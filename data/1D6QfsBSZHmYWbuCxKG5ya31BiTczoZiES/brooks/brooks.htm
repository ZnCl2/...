      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to detection of inorganic and
      biologic structures and/or disruption and/or augmentation of
      functions of structures using acoustic, resonant acoustic, and/or
      resonant acousto-EM energy and/or electromagnetic properties
      and/or fields.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The resonant acoustic frequency of a system is the natural
      free oscillation frequency of the system. A resonant acoustic
      system can be excited by a weak mechanical or acoustic driving
      force in a narrow band of frequencies, close or equal to the
      resonant frequency thereby inducing acoustic resonance in a
      targeted structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Acoustic resonance has been used to determine various
      properties of solid materials. For instance, <b>Migliori et al in
        U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,976,148 and 5,062,296 and 5,355,731</b>
      disclose a method for characterizing a unique resonant frequency
      spectroscopic signature for objects derived from ultrasonic
      excitation of objects, the use of resonant ultrasound spectroscopy
      for grading production quantities of spherical objects such as
      roller balls for bearings, and the use of resonant ultrasound
      spectroscopy with a rectangular parallelpiped sample of a high
      dissipation material to enable low amplitude resonance to be
      detected for use in calculating the elastic constants of the high
      dissipation sample. However, the Migliori patents are directed to
      solid materials and not to selectively targeting organic or
      biologic material especially when liquid systems are involved.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] In addition to interacting with inanimate structures,
      acoustic energy also interacts with living, biologic organisms and
      structures. Acoustic energy has been used extensively in medicine
      and biology for imaging structures, by directing an acoustic wave
      at a biologic structure and analyzing the reflection pattern of
      the acoustic wave. Also, acoustic energy has been used in physical
      therapy medicine for delivering heat to targeted areas of injury
      or pain. However, all of the above applications depend on using
      acoustic energy that is non-selective for the specific targeted
      biologic structure, and as such, may affect more than just the
      targeted structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] <b>Vago, R E., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,048,520 and 5,178,134</b>
      discloses ultrasonic treatment of animals for topical hygiene and
      antiviral effects. The frequencies disclosed are in the range of
      15 kilohertz to 500 kilohertz. They also report that non-enveloped
      viruses were refractive to the inactivating effects of the
      ultrasound. The mechanism cited for their antimicrobial effects is
      "cavitation" on the skin surface only, and they specifically avoid
      the use of resonant frequencies in their apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] <b>Moasser, M., U.S. Pat. No. 4,646,725</b> discloses the
      use of an adaptor for diagnostic ultrasound machines for treatment
      of skin and mucous membrane lesions caused by infectious agents
      including herpes virus. The method of treatment was 2.0 to 3.0
      minutes at a power output of 1.5 watts per square centimeter, with
      no specific frequencies being cited. The use of acoustic resonance
      is not discussed or contemplated.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] <b>Johnston, R G., U.S. Pat. No. 5,426,977</b> discloses
      ultrasonic measurement of the acoustic resonances in eggs to
      provide a technique for establishing the presence of Salmonella
      bacteria. Johnson characterizes the eggs and determines the
      difference between the egg with and without Salmonella bacteria.
      As such, this method does not detect the actual micro-organism,
      but instead characterizes the vibrational modes of an eggshell,
      which are modified by the physical presence of a bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The prior art has failed to suggest a satisfactory method
      or system for affecting functions of a biologic structure without
      also affecting near-by tissue. Furthermore, the prior art does not
      provide for a method that allows precise detection of biologic or
      inorganic structures using acoustic resonance to produce a
      signature with high signal to noise ratio, while producing little
      effect in nearby structures. Still further, use of non-resonant
      acoustic energy in the prior art affects targeted and non-targeted
      structures equally.<br>

      <br>
      [0018] "Resonant acoustic frequency" as used herein includes

      <br>
      [0021] "Living transducer" as used herein is defined as a biologic

      [0024] "Non-resonant electromagnetic signature" as used herein is

      <br>
      [0025] "Resonant acousto-EM energy" as described herein means
      electromagnetic properties and/or fields that induce acoustic
      resonance in a structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The present invention addresses the shortcomings of the
      prior art by inducing acoustic resonance in a targeted structure
      with select frequencies that affect the specific targeted
      structure but have virtually no effect on nearby, non-resonating
      structures. Furthermore, acoustic energy power intensities can be
      reduced by introducing a source of electromagnetic (EM) energy
      that augments, or replaces, the acoustic energy thereby reducing
      the destructive nature of high power acoustic energy. The
      interaction between EM energy and acoustic resonance allows for
      precise detection of a structure in acoustic resonance by
      producing a signature with high signal to noise ratio, while
      producing little effect in other structures.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The present invention provides methods to selectively
      detect, identify and/or affect an inorganic or biologic structure
      by using resonant acoustic and/or acousto-EM energy which can
      transfer useful energy to targeted structures while leaving nearby
      structures, which are not in resonance, virtually unchanged.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to
      provide a method of identifying or detecting an inorganic or
      biologic structure using its resonant acoustic and/or acousto-EM
      signature and/or EM energy patterns.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] It is an object of the present invention to provide a
      method for using resonant acoustic and/or acousto-EM signatures
      and/or energy patterns to augment and/or disrupt the growth and/or
      function of biologic structures.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] It is another object of the invention to provide a method
      for determining resonant frequencies of a biologic structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] It is also an object of the invention to provide a method
      using resonant acoustic and/or resonant acousto-EM energies to
      detect the presence of and/or identify biologic structures.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In accordance with the aforesaid objects the present
      invention provides for the detection of inorganic or biologic
      structures and/or disruption and/or augmentation of growth and/or
      functions of said structures using resonant acoustic and/or
      resonant acousto-EM signatures and/or EM energy patterns.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Applying principles of acoustic resonance, the resonant
      acoustic frequency of a biologic system is the natural free
      oscillation frequency of the system, and thus a system can be
      excited by a weak mechanical or acoustic driving force in a narrow
      band of frequencies. Also, depending on the size, shape, and
      composition of the biologic structure, there can be more than one
      naturally occurring resonant acoustic frequency, as well as
      numerous subharmonic and superharmonic resonant acoustic
      frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] When a structure, including both inorganic and biologic
      structures, goes into acoustic resonance, energy builds up in it
      rapidly. The energy is either kept in the system or released to
      the surrounding environment. Energy kept in the structure can
      enhance the structure's functions or cause disruption of the
      structure. The energy in a resonant system is either intrinsically
      dissipated as electromagnetic energy and/or is transmitted as
      acoustic energy to the nearby medium. The intrinsically dissipated
      energy is of particular interest, because it is dissipated through
      molecular and atomic vibrations, producing EM energy patterns.
      This EM energy is referred to as acousto-EM energy because it is
      produced when a structure is excited by acoustic energy and some
      acoustic energy interacts with the structure and is converted into
      electromagnetic energy thereby being intrinsically dissipated. The
      properties, fields and/or frequencies of EM energy produced depend
      on the unique molecular and atomic components of the structure in
      question. Moreover, the induction of acoustic resonance in a
      structure leads to the production of a unique acousto-EM signature
      for that structure, which can be used to detect and/or identify
      the structure as disclosed in the present invention. Conversely,
      if a structure is targeted with an applied EM energy equivalent to
      its acousto-EM signature, the energy dissipation pathway is
      reversed, and a state of acoustic resonance can be induced.
      Reversing the energy dissipation pathway with an applied
      acousto-EM signature can be used to produce the same augmentation,
      detection, and disruption effects that the original resonant
      acoustic energy field produces. An applied resonant acousto-EM
      signature can be used either by itself, or in combination with
      resonant acoustic energy. Using the applied resonant acousto-EM
      signature and resonant acoustic energy together, allows for the
      use of lower power levels of both types of energy, lessening the
      potential adverse affects of electromagnetic energy and/or
      acoustic energy on nearby or adjacent nontargeted structures.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Electromagnetic energy may also interact with and
      complement an acoustic energy wave in a system in at least four
      ways: via the piezoelectric effect, intrinsic dissipation of
      electromagnetic energy and via the acoustoelectric or
      magnetoacoustic effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] In the piezoelectric effect, acoustic vibratory energy is
      converted interchangeably with EM energy by a transducer. Biologic
      piezoelectric structures can modulate the same conversion of
      energy, thereby acting as living transducers. Thus, when an EM
      field is applied to a biologic piezoelectric structure, an
      acoustic wave is produced. Likewise, when an acoustic wave is
      applied to a biologic piezoelectric structure, EM energy is
      produced. The piezoelectric effect in biologic structures has many
      useful applications (see below.) This effect becomes even more
      useful when principles of acoustic resonance are applied. In the
      present invention specific biologic structures can be targeted
      with an acoustic wave or EM energy at power levels that
      dramatically affect the target structure, but have virtually no
      effect on adjacent, nonresonant structures. Although not
      previously postulated by others, biologic structures functioning
      as living, resonant piezoelectric transducers which modulate the
      conversion of mechanical and EM energy is undoubtedly one of the
      major underlying mechanisms responsible for the interaction of EM
      fields with biologic structures.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In the acoustoelectric effect, the passage of an acoustic
      wave through a semiconductor induces an electric current. The
      passage of an acoustic wave through the material is postulated to
      cause a periodic spatial variation of the potential energy of the
      charge carriers. This results in an electric field across the ends
      of the semiconductor as long as the acoustic wave is traversing
      the semiconductor. Free electron carriers are bunched in the
      potential-energy troughs, and as the acoustic wave having a
      specific frequency propagates, it drags the bunches along with it,
      resulting in an electric field such as a DC field pulsing at the
      specific acoustic frequency or an AC field having a frequency
      equal to the specific acoustic frequency. The effect is enhanced
      where there are both positively and negatively charged carriers,
      and where there are many different groups of carriers-conditions
      which are frequently found in biologic systems. The attributes of
      the current produced depend on the unique molecular and atomic
      components of the structure in question. This aspect alone
      provides a means to perform acoustoelectric spectroscopy on
      biologics many of which are semiconductors, and depending on the
      selected frequency, the acoustoelectric effect in biological
      structures has many other potentially useful applications. Thus
      understood, a targeted structure can be irradiated or exposed to
      acoustic energy having non-resonant frequency and an
      electromagnetic energy pattern of the acoustoelectric effect in
      the structure can be detected. This detected non-resonant
      electromagnetic signature can be used as a signature to affect,
      detect and identify the targeted structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] However, the acoustoelectric effect becomes even more
      useful when principles of acoustic resonance are applied.
      Augmentation, detection, and/or disruption of biologics can be
      targeted to specific structures at power levels that dramatically
      affect the target structure, but have virtually no effect on
      nearby, nonresonant structures. The current produced by the
      acoustoelectric effect in a resonant structure will be much
      stronger than any current produced by neighboring non-resonant
      structures, and may be of an alternating nature. The large signal
      to noise ratio obtained from a resonant structure improves
      accuracy of acoustic and EM energy pattern identification and
      detection. Similar to reversal of the piezoelectric effect and
      acoustic resonance intrinsic energy dissipation pathway (see
      above), application of the resonant acoustoelectric EM energy
      pattern to a targeted structure will amplify the acoustic wave
      (acoustoelectric gain which peaks at the frequency for which the
      acoustic wavelength is the Debye length, where bunching is
      optimum). Thus, combined use of the resonant acoustic,
      acoustoelectric and/or EM fields permit greater tissue penetration
      of high frequency acoustic energy that would otherwise be highly
      attenuated and have poor tissue penetration. Using the resonant
      acoustic frequency, acoustoelectric and/or EM fields together also
      allows for the use of lower power levels of these types of energy,
      lessening the potential effects on other nontargeted and
      nonresonant structures.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The magnetoacoustic effect is the magnetic-field-dependent
      attenuation of an acoustic field in a monotonic, oscillatory, or
      resonant manner, depending on the electronic properties of the
      substance in question. This variability in result, depending on
      structural composition, provides a further enhancement of
      acousto-EM spectroscopy in relation to biologics and other
      structures, via addition of a magnetic field. Also, the addition
      of a magnetic field provides the means to amplify or attenuate an
      acoustic field, thus improving or modulating the penetration of
      the acoustic field in biologic tissues.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Similarly, resonant acoustics combined with acoustic
      cyclotron resonance (i.e., resonant acoustic cyclotron resonance)
      and Doppler-shifted resonant acoustic cyclotron resonance presents
      a powerful, and precise means of selectively causing augmentation,
      detection and/or disruption of structures.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The present invention provides a method that applies the
      principles of acoustic resonance to biologic structures for the
      purpose of disruption and/or augmentation of functions of the
      specifically targeted biologic structure. The resonant acoustic
      frequency of a biologic structure may be determined by performing
      resonant acoustic spectroscopy using methods and systems well know
      in the art. Particularly, a resonant acoustic frequency of a
      biologic structure may by determined by the steps of:<br>
      <br>
      [0042] a) applying acoustic energy to the biologic structure and
      scanning through a range of acoustic energy frequencies; and<br>
      <br>
      [0043] b) detecting at least one specific frequency which causes a
      maximum signal output from the biologic structure indicating the
      biologic structure being induced into acoustic resonance by the at
      least one specific frequency.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The specific frequencies causing the maximum signals are
      the resonant acoustic frequencies of the biologic structure which
      are defined and used herein as the acoustic signature of the
      biologic structure. Once determined, at least one resonant
      acoustic frequency may be applied to the biologic structure to
      affect functioning therein and/or to determine its acousto-EM
      signature.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The acoustic energy, including the resonant acoustic
      frequencies (i.e., the acousto-EM signature) may be applied at a
      power level sufficient to affect functioning of the biologic
      structure. Depending on the power intensity of the acoustic
      energy, and the type of targeted structure that is induced into
      acoustic resonance, the structure may have its functions affected,
      such as disruption and/or augmentation.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] At lower power levels functions of the biologic structure
      can be augmented while at higher power levels disruption of the
      structure may occur. Augmentation as used herein encompasses
      beneficial effects on the biologic structure. Such augmenting of
      functions or enhancing effects include but are not limited to
      enhancement of growth, reproduction, regeneration, embryogenesis,
      metabolism, fermentation, and the like. The results of such
      enhancement include but are not limited to increase in bone mass
      or density, increase in number and maturation of eggs, increase in
      number and/or function of leukocytes, increase in fermentation
      products in beer, wine and cheese manufacturing, increase in plant
      germination and growth and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] There are some situations where the ability to selectively
      disrupt a structure with acoustic resonance is very useful as
      disclosed in the present invention. As stated above, disruption as
      used herein refers to deleterious effects on the biologic
      structure. Such deleterious effects include but are not limited to
      structural failure of the biologic structure resulting in lysis,
      shattering, rupture or inactivation of the biologic or of one or
      more components of the biologic structure. Disruption as used
      herein also includes within its ambit inhibition of vital
      processes required for growth, reproduction, metabolism,
      infectivity and the like. Components which may be targeted for
      disruption include, but are not limited to DNA, RNA, proteins,
      carbohydrates, lipids, lipopolysaccharides, glycolipids,
      glycoproteins, proteoglycans, chloroplasts, mitochondria,
      endoplasmic reticulum, cells, organs and the like. In the case of
      virulent organisms, the virulence factors may be specifically
      targeted for disruption to prevent or inhibit the growth,
      infectivity or virulence of the organism. Such virulence factors
      include but are not limited to endotoxins, exotoxins, pili,
      flagella, proteases, ligands for host cell receptors, capsules,
      cell walls, spores, chitin, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Organics, biologics or one or more targeted portions
      thereof which are amenable to disruption using the methods of the
      present invention include but are not limited to viruses,
      bacteria, protozoans, parasites, fungi, worms, mollusks,
      arthropods, tissue masses, and the like. The organics or biologics
      to be disrupted may be isolated, present in a multicellular
      organism or portion thereof, or other complex environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] It is postulated that disruption of the targeted biologic
      structure without affecting nearby tissue or structures occurs due
      to acoustic resonance being induced only in the targeted structure
      which until now has not been considered a mechanism to affect a
      biologic structure. This is very different from that disclosed in
      the prior art which contemplates only three mechanisms for
      affecting a biologic structure which include cavitation, thermal
      and mechanical.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] At specific power levels, such as in lower levels, that do
      not cause the actual disruption of a structure, resonant acoustic
      energy can intrinsically dissipate within the structure. This
      intrinsically dissipated acoustic energy can be converted by the
      structure into an electromagnetic energy having specific
      properties and/or fields that may be manifested as direct and
      alternating currents, electric and magnetic fields,
      electromagnetic radiation and the like. The pattern of the
      electromagnetic energy represents a produced acousto-EM signature
      of the structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The present invention provides a method to determine an
      acousto-EM signature of a structure which comprises irradiating
      the structure with acoustic energy having a frequency at or near a
      previously determined resonant acoustic frequency of the structure
      to induce resonance therein and detecting the electromagnetic
      energy pattern caused by the intrinsic dissipation of energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Once an acousto-EM signature is determined for a specific
      structure, this structure can be induced into acoustic resonance
      by applying an EM energy pattern or equivalent to the acousto-EM
      signature of the structure. Typical electromagnetic energies
      applied include direct and alternating current, electric and
      magnetic fields, and electromagnetic radiation and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] As such, the present invention applies the principles of
      acoustic resonance by applying resonant acoustic frequencies and
      electromagnetic energy equivalent to the predetermined acousto-EM
      signature of a targeted structure individually, or in combination,
      to affect the targeted structure, the method comprising the steps
      of:<br>
      <br>
      [0054] a) applying at least one resonant acoustic frequency of the
      targeted structure; and/or<br>
      <br>
      [0055] b) applying electromagnetic energy equivalent to part or
      all of the acousto-EM signature of the targeted structure; and<br>
      <br>
      [0056] c) applying (a) and/or (b) each at a power intensity level
      to induce acoustic resonance within the targeted structure and
      affect functioning of the structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Either the resonant acoustic frequency of the targeted
      structure or the acousto-EM signature must be predetermined, as
      discussed above, to provide the applicable energy for inducing
      acoustic resonance in the structure. The electromagnetic energy
      can be introduced into the targeted structure in the form of a
      direct or alternating current having a specific frequency that is
      equivalent to the electromagnetic energy pattern (i.e., the
      acousto-EM signature) detected when the structure is induced into
      acoustic resonance. Furthermore each type of energy can be applied
      at a power level less than used individually and this allows for
      inducing acoustic resonance in the structure with the possibility
      of reducing damage to the structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The present invention provides a method for detecting
      and/or identifying inorganic or biologic structures using resonant
      acoustic and/or acousto-EM energy. The method includes determining
      the acoustic signature of a structure by irradiating the structure
      with a range of frequencies to determine the specific frequency
      and/or frequencies that induce acoustic resonance therein to
      provide an acoustic signature of the structure. The acoustic
      signature can be compared with reference signatures to detect
      and/or identify the structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Furthermore, the identification and/or detection of a
      structure can also be achieved by detecting an acousto-EM
      signature of a targeted structure, the method comprising the steps
      of:<br>
      <br>
      [0060] a) inducing acoustic resonance in the targeted structure;
      and<br>
      <br>
      [0061] b) detecting an electromagnetic energy pattern from the
      targeted structure in acoustic resonance which represents an
      acousto-EM signature of the structure. The acousto-EM signature
      can be compared to reference signatures to detect and/or identify
      the structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The targeted structure can be induced into acoustic
      resonance by introducing acoustic energy including at least one
      resonant acoustic frequency, electromagnetic energy equivalent to
      the resonant acoustic frequency, and/or an electromagnetic energy
      pattern equivalent to the acousto-EM signature.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] The electromagnetic energy pattern manifested as
      electromagnetic properties and fields may be determined by
      detection means well known to those skilled in the art such as
      those disclosed in Introduction to Electromagnetic Fields and
      Waves, by Erik V. Bohn Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., 1968, the
      contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In another embodiment of the present invention, a structure
      may be induced into acoustic resonance by applying to the
      structure part or all of the acousto-EM signature of the structure
      to induce the structure into acoustic resonance. If the structure
      is induced into acoustic resonance, this fact may be used to
      detect and/or identify the structure. This represents another
      method of the present invention that may used for identification
      or detection of a specific structure, because each structure will
      not only have its own unique acoustic signature but also will have
      a unique acousto-EM signature to which it responds by resonating
      acoustically. Also, depending on the power intensity of the
      electromagnetic properties and/or fields and the type of targeted
      structure that is induced into acoustic resonance, the structure
      may have its functions affected, such as disruption and/or
      augmentation.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] In all the above embodiments the introduction of acoustic
      and/or electromagnetic energy including a resonant acoustic
      frequency can be applied in either continuous and/or periodic form
      depending on the desired effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The acoustic and/or EM energy or fields may be applied
      individually or in combination. Likewise the acoustic and/or EM
      energy or fields may be detected individually or in combination.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Many biochemical compounds and biologic structures are
      naturally occurring crystals and especially susceptible in that
      regard to the effects of resonant acoustic energy. Many biologic
      substances are piezoelectric materials. For instance, bone is a
      piezoelectric material and the piezoelectric properties of bone
      play a vital role in its biological functions. As such, it is
      further envisioned by the inventors that biologic structures
      having a piezoelectric nature may be affected by applying a
      sufficient amount of acoustic energy and/or electromagnetic energy
      to induce the structure into resonance thereby affecting the
      functions of the biologic structure either positively or
      negatively. Thus understood, biologic structures that act as
      living transducers may be induced into acoustic resonance by
      introducing electromagnetic energy equivalent to a resonant
      acoustic frequency of the biologic structure which is converted to
      mechanical energy by the living transducer thereby inducing
      acoustic resonance in the structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Another aspect of the invention is a system for detecting a
      biologic or inorganic structure by determining the resonant
      acoustic and/or acousto-EM signature of the structure comprising:<br>
      <br>
      [0069] a) means for inducing acoustic resonance in the biologic or
      inorganic structure;<br>
      <br>
      [0070] b) means for detecting the acoustic signature of the
      biologic or inorganic structure; and<br>
      <br>
      [0071] c) means for comparing the acoustic signature of the
      biologic or inorganic structure with a reference acoustic
      signature of the structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Also, the above system may also or instead comprise means
      for detecting a resonant acousto-EM energy signature of the
      structure in acoustic resonance which produces an electromagnetic
      energy pattern such as described above. The acousto-EM signature
      can be compared with a previously determined reference acousto-EM
      signature by providing means for comparing in a detection or
      identification system. The electromagnetic energy pattern is
      manifested as electromagnetic properties and/or fields that
      include but are not limited to energy in the form of direct and
      alternating current, electric and magnetic fields, and
      electromagnetic radiation. The targeted structure can be induced
      into acoustic resonance by introducing acoustic energy including
      at least one resonant acoustic frequency, electromagnetic energy
      equivalent to the resonant acoustic frequency, and/or an
      electromagnetic energy pattern equivalent to the acousto-EM
      signature.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] In another embodiment of the present invention a system for
      augmenting and/or disrupting a targeted biologic structure
      comprises means for applying acoustic energy including a
      previously determined resonant acoustic frequency to induce
      acoustic resonance in the biologic structure, the acoustic energy
      being applied at a sufficient power input to affect functions of
      the biologic structure. Alternatively, the targeted structure may
      be induced into acoustic resonance by providing electromagnetic
      energy equivalent to the resonant acoustic frequency or the
      acousto-EM signature that was previously determined, such
      electromagnetic energy including direct and alternating current,
      electric and magnetic fields, and electromagnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] In yet another embodiment a system is provided to introduce
      acoustic energies having acoustic frequencies at or near the
      resonant acoustic frequencies of the targeted structure and also
      electromagnetic energy to augment the resonant acoustic
      frequencies comprising:<br>
      <br>
      [0075] means for introducing a frequency at or near the resonant
      acoustic frequency of the targeted structure; and<br>
      <br>
      [0076] means for introducing electromagnetic energy equivalent to
      the electromagnetic energy pattern previously determined as an
      acousto-EM signature of the structure, such means including direct
      and alternating current, electric and magnetic fields, and/or
      electromagnetic radiation and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] The acoustic energy and EM energy equivalent to the
      acousto-EM signature may be applied and/or detected by a single
      means that can apply both types of energy.<br>
      <br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0115] The methods of the present invention comprise DELIVERING
      acoustic energy at resonant frequencies to an inorganic or
      biologic structure as shown in FIG. 1. Using methods known to
      those skilled in the art, any device capable of generating and
      transmitting acoustic energy through any medium can be used to
      generate the resonant acoustic frequencies utilized by the
      invention. This includes, but is not limited to, devices that
      produce acoustic energy using traditional EM stimulation of
      piezoelectric transducers, (man-made or naturally occurring),
      purely mechanical devices (such as high frequency air whistles),
      and laser devices. Individual components for acoustic energy
      systems are commercially available from a wide variety of
      manufacturers, which can be configured to particular applications
      and frequency ranges. (See Thomas Directory of American
      Manufacturers, Photonics Buyer's Guide, 1996, Microwave and RF,
      and Electronic Engineer's Master Catalogue).<br>
      <br>
      [0116] Any oscillator, also called signal generator or function
      generator, that produces a signal with predetermined
      characteristics such as frequency, mode, pulse duration, shape,
      and repetition rate may be utilized to generate the resonant
      acoustic frequencies utilized by the invention. Various
      oscillators or signal generators can be commercially purchased for
      frequencies ranging from Hertz to Gigahertz, such as the
      MicroLambda LMOS series (500 MHz-18 GHz), the BK Precision 2005A
      (100 KHZ-450 MHz) (B&amp;K Precision, Chicago, Ill.), the
      Tektronix SME02 (5 KHZ-5 GHz), and the Tektronix 25 SME 4040 (0.5
      Hz-20 MHz) (Tektronic, Inc., Beaverton, Oreg.), and the Matec 700
      series (1-1100 MHz) and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] The frequency at which resonance occurs depends on the
      size, shape, and composition of a structure. For instance, the
      resonant frequency of a sphere is the frequency at which the
      acoustic wavelength is equal to the sphere diameter. A more
      complex structure-a cylinder-has two resonant frequencies based on
      two axes of orientation, with one of the resonant frequency
      wavelengths being equal to 1.5 times the length. The more complex
      the shape of the structure, the more complex the resonant acoustic
      frequency pattern, however, the wavelength at which acoustic
      resonance occurs is roughly equivalent to the size of the
      structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] The frequency which matches a particular acoustic
      wavelength depends on the composition of the structure, according
      to the equation:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      velocity=frequency*wavelength (1)<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where velocity refers to the speed of the acoustic wave
      propagation (the speed of sound) in the medium composing the
      structure. Although the speed of sound varies among various
      biological tissues, it is roughly equivalent to the speed of sound
      in water (1,500 m/s), because most biologic organisms are composed
      chiefly of water. Using the speed of sound in water as the
      velocity of the acoustic wave, and using the structure size as the
      rough equivalent of the wavelength, the approximate range of
      acoustic frequencies in organic or biologic structures, is given
      by:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] (See the Chart that Follows.)<br>
      Other known speeds of sound in biologic tissues vary and include:<br>
      <b>(1) liver (1550 m/s); (2) muscle (1580 m/s); (3) fat (1459
        m/s); (4) brain (1560 m/s); (5) kidney (1560 m/s); (6) spleen
        (1570 m/s); (7) blood (1575 m/s); (8) bone (4080 m/s); (9) lung
        (650 m/s); (10) lens of eye (1620 m/s); (11) aqueous humor (1500
        m/s); and (12) vitreous humor (1520 m/s). </b>Resonant acoustic
      frequency ranges for targeted organic or biologic structures
      comprised of tissues with acoustic velocities different from the
      speed of sound in water, are derived using the same equation
      (velocity/wavelength) and correlate to the charted ranges listed
      below, plus or minus, depending on the speed of sound in the
      targeted tissue.<br>

      [0119] Although velocity of acoustic energy in a particular medium
      is for the most part constant, there is a slight dependence of
      velocity on frequency-an effect called dispersion. For example,
      over the frequency range of 1 to 20 MHz, the acoustic velocity
      changes by 1%. Thus, in the present invention the resonant
      frequency(s) or at least the range of frequencies within which the
      resonant frequency can be found for a targeted structure depend on
      its size, shape, and composition, and the specific frequency range
      under examination. Some approximate acoustic resonant frequencies
      for biologic structures are included in the following Table 1.<br>

      [0120] To obtain the maximum transfer of acoustical energy from
      one medium to another, the characteristic acoustical impedance of
      each should be as nearly equal to the other as possible. This
      problem of impedance matching, as it is termed, occurs in many
      branches of physics, and is employed in acoustical techniques, as
      a means of matching two media of different acoustical impedances
      R1 and R2 respectively. The matching medium is sandwiched between
      the other two and should be the appropriate thickness relative to
      the wavelength of the sound transmitted, and its acoustical
      impedance R should be nearly equal to [square root of]{square root
      over ((R1R2))}. An impedance matching device that is commercially
      available and which can be utilized in this invention includes
      Model 60, manufactured by Matec Instruments, Inc.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] Acoustic energy can be produced by a transducer that
      converts received electromagnetic energy into rapid, physical
      vibrations, and thus acoustic energy. The first acoustic
      transducers used the piezoelectric properties of naturally
      occurring quartz to produce acoustic energy waves.<br>

      [0122] EM energy-&gt;piezoelectric transducer-&gt;acoustic energy
      waves<br>
      <br>
      [0123] New transducers use materials such as ferroelectric
      ceramics (barium titanate, lead titanate, or lead zirconate) and
      zinc oxide. Recent advances in materials engineering have also
      produced piezoelectric polymers which can be shaped into sheets
      and cords, allowing a multiplicity of applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] Transducers are also commercially available from a wide
      variety of manufacturers, in a wide variety of designs which can
      be configured to particular applications and frequencies. Examples
      of acoustic transducers that may be utilized in the present
      invention and which can be commercially purchased for frequencies
      ranging from Hertz to Gigahertz include Matec broadband immersion
      transducers MIA series (10-196 MHz), Matec broadband MIBO series
      (5-10 MHz), Matec broadband MICO (3.5 MHz), Matec broadband MIDO
      (2.25 MHz), Matec broadband MwO series (50 KHZ-1 MHz), Matec GPUT
      series (500 KHz-20 MHz), Matec intravascular blood flow VP-A50
      series (5-30 MHz), the Teledyne Electronic Technologies In-phase
      or Out-of phase broadband MHz/GHz (up to 17.5 GHz) array
      transducer of zinc oxide on sapphire and optional anti-reflective
      coating, and Channel Industries Kilohertz transducers. In the
      ultrahigh acoustic frequencies (upper GHz and THz) maser and laser
      systems may be utilized.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] The transducers can produce an acoustic wave within a range
      of frequencies (broadband) or for one specific frequency
      (narrowband).<br>
      <br>
      [0126] Commercially available acoustic amplifiers include but are
      not limited to Matec gated amplifier systems (100 KHZ-200 MHz),
      and EM broadband amplifier model 607L (0.8-1,000 MHz.)<br>
      <br>
      [0127] Complete acoustic systems including power frame, computer
      interface, pulse width generator, gated amplifier, broadband
      receiver, and phase detector (100 KHZ-100 MHz) can be purchased
      commercially from sources such as Matec.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] The acoustic delivery system is variable depending on the
      application. Acoustic energy waves can be transmitted into
      gaseous, liquid, or solid media either by direct contact of the
      transducer with the target structure medium, or by coupling of
      transmission of the acoustic wave through other structures or
      mediums one of which is in direct contact with the target
      structure. In the case of biologic structures, coupling through
      multiple structures or media is a likely occurrence, as the
      acoustic wave travels through multiple layers of biologic tissue
      to reach its target structure. If the target structure is a
      liquid, a transducer can be placed into the liquid in direct
      contact with it, or the liquid can be placed in a container whose
      walls are themselves transducers, in direct contact with the
      liquid. Also, a transducer can be placed on the outside of the
      walls of a container in which the liquid is placed.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] If the target structure is a solid, a transducer can again
      be placed in direct contact with it. The solid can be placed in a
      gas or liquid which is used as a coupling agent. A liquid or
      gel-type coupling agent can also couple between a free-standing
      solid and a transducer, when the transducer is placed on a surface
      of the solid.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] The present invention also comprises receiving and
      analyzing acoustic energy derived from an inorganic or biologic
      structure as shown in FIG. 2. Using methods known to those skilled
      in the art, any device capable of receiving and analyzing acoustic
      energy through any medium can be used to detect the resonant
      acoustic and/or acousto-EM frequencies utilized by the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] Detection of acoustic energy waves is basically the reverse
      process of producing acoustic energy waves. Acoustic energy waves
      striking a transducer apply a mechanical stress, producing
      electric polarization proportional to the mechanical stress via
      the piezoelectric effect. The resultant EM energy is converted
      electronically via oscilloscope type devices to a readable format.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] EM energy&lt;-piezoelectric transducer&lt;-acoustic energy
      waves.<br>
      <br>
      [0133] Thus, piezoelectric transducers may be used to both produce
      and detect acoustic energy, using the reversible piezoelectric
      effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] The structure after being induced into an acoustic
      resonance state will emit vibrational waves that will cause
      mechanical stress in the transducer. In turn, an alternating
      potential difference having the same frequency as the acoustic
      wave appears as voltage across electrodes connected to a
      transducer. This voltage is converted via oscilloscope type
      devices to a readable format.<br>
      <br>
      [0135] Oscilloscopes that may be utilized in the present invention
      include but are not limited to those such as the BK Precision 21
      60A (0-60 MHz), the Tektronix TDS 784A (0-1 GHz), the Tektronix
      TDS 820 (6-8 GHz), the Tektronix 1180 a B (0-50 GHz); and spectrum
      analyzers such as Hewlett-Packard 8577A (100 Hz-40 GHz), HP 8555A
      (10 MHz-40 GHz), Tektronix 492 (50 KHZ-21 GHz), Anritsu MS62C (50
      Hz-1.7 GHz), and Polarad 640B (3 MHz-40 GHz) which are all
      commercially available.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] Complete acoustic detection and analysis systems (50
      KHz-100 MHz) including power frame, computer interface, pulse
      width generator, gated amplifier, broadband receiver, phase
      detector, control software, pre-amplifiers, diode expander,
      diplexer, filter, and attenuators can be purchased commercially
      from Matec Instruments Inc., or from other sources.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] The acoustic energy under examination can be either
      reflected or transmitted. For example, in traditional medical
      ultrasound methods, an acoustic wave is produced from a single
      transducer. The acoustic wave strikes various structures. Some of
      the acoustic wave is reflected back from the structures and is
      detected as reflected waves by the same single transducer. Some of
      the acoustic wave may also be transmitted through the structures.
      Many industrial applications of acoustic energy utilize the
      transmitted, rather than reflected waves.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] The present invention also comprises delivering EM energy
      at resonant acoustic and/or resonant acousto-EM frequencies to a
      targeted structure as shown in FIGS. 3-7.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] If a resonant system is embedded in a fluid environment (as
      is the case with most biologic structures) the dissipation of
      energy occurs through an intrinsic source in the system (i.e. via
      conversion to EM energy), or through loss to the nearby medium
      (via coupling and transmission of acoustic energy). Using methods
      known to those skilled in the art, any device capable of
      generating and transmitting EM energy through any medium can be
      used to generate the resonant acoustic and/or acousto-EM energy
      utilized by the present invention including, but not limited to,
      stationary and oscillating magnetic field (FIGS. 3 and 4), direct
      or alternating current (FIG. 5), static charge (FIG. 6), electric
      field, and EM radiation (FIG. 7).<br>

      FIGS. 8-11. Using methods known to those skilled in the art, any
      device capable of sensing and analyzing EM energy through any
      medium can be used to detect the resonant acoustic and/or
      acousto-EM frequencies utilized by the invention. Direct and
      alternating current can be assessed by measuring voltage changes
      (FIG. 11) with 15 voltmeters such as the BK Precision 283 lA
      (0-1200V, 0.1 mV resolution, or the BK Precision 3910-1000V, 10 uV
      resolution), detection of static charge (FIG. 9) and by measuring

      [0151] While the invention is described in relation to certain

      understood that many variations are possible, and alternative

      involve routine testing.<br>

      [0152] The following examples and descriptions of the specific

      modify and/or adapt for various applications such specific
      embodiments without departing from the generic concept, and
      therefore such adaptations and modifications are intended to be
      comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalents of the
      disclosed embodiments and system components.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><br>
      <b>Disruption, Augmentation, Detection and/or Identification of
        Viruses</b><br>
      <br>
      [0153] Since the induction of resonance in a structure can lead to
      sudden and irreversible structural failure due to rupture of one
      or more components of that structure, biologic structures can be
      selectively disrupted using resonant acoustic energy. The present
      invention takes advantage of the rigid, crystalline structure of
      viruses for the purposes of detection, augmentation,
      identification and/or physical disruption of the virion structure
      using acoustic energy and/or acousto-EM at the resonant
      frequencies unique to each specific virus. Viruses may be
      considered piezoelectric crystals, and therefore, can act as
      living transducers.<br>
      <br>
      [0154] Human illnesses caused by viruses include hepatitis,
      influenza, chicken pox, mumps, measles, small pox, acquired immune
      deficiency syndrome (AIDS), ebola, polio, hemorrhagic fever,
      herpes and hairy cell leukemia.<br>
      <br>
      [0155] Diseases in animals caused by viruses include but are not
      limited to parvo infection in dogs, feline leukemia, cowpox,
      rabies and avian plague.<br>
      <br>
      [0156] One of the most notable examples of viral diseases in plant
      life is the historical potato famine in Ireland, caused by a virus
      which infects potato plants.<br>
      <br>
      [0157] There are two major types of virus symmetry-icosahedral and
      helical. The icosahedral shape is roughly equivalent to a soccer
      ball, while the helical shape looks like a toy slinky. The
      majority of viruses fall into one of these groups, the remainder
      being complex or unknown. The icosahedral is roughly a spherical
      shape made up of 20 identical, equilateral triangles, with 3 axes
      of five-fold symmetry. In the helix, the units of the capsid
      spiral out around the nucleic acid, which runs down the center of
      the virus, and there is only one axis of spiraling symmetry.<br>
      <br>
      [0158] Within each symmetry group, viruses can further be
      separated into DNA and RNA groups. Viruses have a central core of
      nucleic material, either DNA or RNA. This nucleic core is
      surrounded by a symmetrical protein shell, called a capsid or
      protein coat. The capsid is composed of individual capsomere
      morphological units, which are in turn composed of individual
      structural units. The structural units are also called
      crystallographic units, because they form a repeating pattern and
      can be demonstrated with X-ray crystallographic diffraction
      techniques. Structural units are the building blocks of the virus
      structure and are usually identical proteins.<br>
      <br>
      [0159] In some viruses, a lipoprotein membrane, or envelope,
      surrounds the capsid. The envelope is derived from host cell
      membranes and is modified by the virus during its departure from
      the host cell. The envelope may carry specific virus proteins such
      as hemagglutinin or neuraminidase that are important for future
      functions and survival of the virus. The envelope of some viruses
      is studded with projections, or peplomers, which look like a
      fringe around the edge. The fringe may also be important for
      function and survival of the virus.<br>
      <br>
      [0160] Classically, the piezoelectric phenomenon is said to exist
      when the application of a mechanical stress to certain dielectric
      (electrically nonconducting) crystals produces electric
      polarization (electric dipole moment per cubic meter) which is
      proportional to the mechanical stress. Conversely, application of
      an EM field to a crystal produces mechanical stress and
      distortion, and hence acoustic energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0161] A necessary condition for the piezoelectric phenomenon in a
      crystal is the absence of a center of symmetry. Twenty of the 32
      classically defined crystal classes lack a center of symmetry and
      are piezoelectric. Viruses are crystalline structures and as such
      are susceptible to vibrational effects by the use of resonant
      acoustic and/or acousto-EM energy. Icosahedral viruses have 5-fold
      symmetry and thus do not have a classical center of symmetry in
      their crystalline structure, the necessary condition for a
      piezoelectric substance. Helical viruses likewise do not have a
      classical center of symmetry, as the spiraling capsids are offset
      from the 90 degree horizontal of the center axis. In addition to
      the crystalline structure of viruses being susceptible to the
      vibrational resonant effects of acoustic energy, viruses, as used
      in the present invention, may also function as piezoelectric,
      acoustic resonance structures.<br>
      <br>
      [0162] The classical 32 groups of naturally occurring crystals
      defined in non-organic chemistry, do not include a group with
      5-fold or offset helical symmetry. It is postulated by the
      inventors that viruses may represent a 33rd and 34th group of
      naturally occurring crystals.<br>
      <br>
      [0163] The present invention has the potential to significantly
      reduce the number and severity of viral infections suffered by the
      world population. The invention has the potential to augment
      production of vaccines, or viral gene transfer. Also, the present
      has veterinary applications, i.e. treating viral infections in
      livestock and poultry, as well as agricultural applications.
      Unlike prior art treatments that use non-resonant frequencies in
      the ultrasound range, the present invention uses specific
      frequencies that create resonance in specific viruses, but not in
      the adjacent tissues. The methods of the present invention also
      use electromagnetic energy equivalent to the acousto-EM signatures
      produced by viruses in a state of acoustic resonance, and utilize
      the piezoelectric, intrinsic energy dissipation, acoustoelectric,
      and/or magnetoacoustic properties of viruses, either alone, in
      combination with each other or in combination with a resonant
      acoustic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0164] The disruption of viruses is useful to treat multicellular
      organisms, in particular, animals, including mammals, birds,
      plants, fruit, insects, arthropods and the like or portions
      thereof which are susceptible to infection by viruses. Portions of
      a multicellular organism which may be treated for disruption of
      viruses include but are not limited to whole body, limbs, organs
      such as the kidney, spleen, liver, pancreas, heart, lung,
      gastrointestinal tract, and the like, tissue such as the cornea,
      bone, bone marrow, blood, cartilage and the like. Products derived
      from the multicellular organism such as blood products are
      included within the scope of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0165] In one embodiment of the present invention used in
      disruption of a virus, the body or the portion of the body to be
      treated may be immersed in a conductive medium and acoustic waves
      applied through the medium to the body or portion thereof at a
      resonant frequency to cause resonance and disruption of the virus
      infecting the body or portion thereof. The duration of the
      treatment is sufficient to disrupt at least about 25% of the virus
      present, preferably at least about 50%. In one embodiment the
      duration of treatment is sufficient to disrupt at least about 50%
      to about 100% of the virus and at the same time have little or no
      harmful side effects to the host multicellular organism. The power
      intensity is dependent upon the tissue or organism and may range
      from 1*10&lt;-11 &gt;W/m&lt;2 &gt;to 1*10&lt;11 &gt;W/m&lt;2
      &gt;and preferably from about 100 to about 10,000 W/m&lt;2&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      [0166] In the case where the multicellular organism is infected
      with more than one genus or species of virus, it is desirable to
      treat the organism with a resonant frequency specific to disrupt
      each type of virus infecting the organism. As in the case of a
      human infected with HIV-1, opportunistic infections may occur
      caused by such viruses as cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, Herpes

      [0167] The present method is beneficial in organ or tissue
      transplantation. Treatment of organs or tissues from a donor prior
      to transplantation prevents or inhibits the transmission of
      disease-causing viruses to the recipient. Such a method is useful
      in xenotransplants, allogeneic transplants, syngeneic transplants
      and the like. Donor organ or tissue to be treated for disruption
      of virus include but are not limited to cornea, heart, liver,
      lung, skin, bone, bone marrow cells, blood and blood products,
      kidney, pancreas and the like.<br>

      Oriboca fever, Rift Valley fever, Congo hemorrhagic fever, Nairobi
      sheep disease, African swine fever and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0179] The present method of disrupting a virus may also be
      utilized in agricultural settings. For example, plants, fruits,
      vegetables, and the like, suspected of containing disease causing
      viruses may be treated using resonant acoustic and/or acousto-EM
      energy for disruption of the viruses. Portions of plants which may
      be treated for disruption of a virus include but are not limited
      to seeds, seedling, pulp, leaves, vegetables, fruits, and the
      like.<br>
      <br>
      [0180] The methods of the present invention comprise delivering
      acoustic energy at resonant frequencies to viruses. For example,
      the qualitative and quantitative resonant frequencies can be
      determined in vitro as shown by the apparatus in FIG. 12. A drop
      of fluid (whole blood, serum, culture fluid, or host cells, etc.)
      with known resonant acoustic characteristics, and which also
      contains a known virus as determined by standard virology methods,
      is placed on a thin disc of absorptive media with known resonant
      acoustic characteristics (paper, cellulose, cotton, polymer,
      etc.). A thin slice of viral-laden tissue or material (embedded or
      sliced material such as provided commercially by Polysciences,
      Inc. JB-4 Embedding, Paraffin, Immuno-Bed Kit, LR Gold, Osteo-Bed
      Bone Kit, Polyfreeze, PEG 4000 Resin, PolyFin Paraffin, etc.) can
      be used. The virus disc is placed between two broadband low GHz or
      high MHz transducers such as disclosed above and clamped into
      place.<br>
      <br>
      [0181] The target range of frequencies to be examined for
      qualitative viral resonance signatures are derived using the speed
      of sound in biologic tissues 1,500 m/s divided by desired
      wavelength, based on viral dimensions. If the viral dimensions are
      unknown, they may be determined by electron microscopy using
      techniques known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0182] One transducer generates the acoustic signal and may sweep
      through a wide band of target frequencies, and the other
      transducer detects the transmitted acoustic signal. The acoustic
      signal transmitted from the virus test disc/slice is fed into the
      positive lead of a signal analyzer. The known acoustic signals
      from the test fluid and disc, or test embedding material serve as
      a control and are fed into the negative lead of the signal
      analyzer. The control signatures are canceled out and the
      remaining resonant acoustic signature displayed is from the virus
      in the sample, yielding a qualitative result.<br>
      <br>
      [0183] By varying the range of frequencies analyzed and comparing
      the amplitudes at each frequency, one can identify the primary
      resonant frequencies, and the associated harmonic resonant
      frequencies. The primary resonant frequencies will have the
      highest amplitude. Each virus will have multiple primary
      frequencies depending on viral dimensions including, but limited
      to, the diameter, length (if cylindrical or helical), apical
      distance, and unit distance. See Table 2 for calculated ranges of
      primary resonant frequencies for individual viruses, using
      acoustic velocity as 1,500 m/s, and viral dimensions as currently
      determined by standard virology methods. Results may vary in
      practice depending on specific viral factors such as bulk modulus,
      dispersion, acoustic velocity in viral materials, in vivo vs. in
      vitro dimensions, etc. and thus the frequencies are in no way
      limited to the calculated frequencies in Table 2.<br>

      [0184] Once the qualitative viral resonant acoustic signature has
      been determined, quantitative results may be determined by
      comparing the resonant acoustic signature amplitudes from samples
      of known concentrations of a specific virus. Samples with higher
      viral loads (concentrations) will have higher resonant acoustic
      signature amplitudes. A ratio of primary resonant frequency
      amplitude to viral concentration is thus derived, allowing for
      assessment of viral load in samples of unknown concentration.<br>
      <br>
      [0185] In another embodiment, resonant acoustic signatures from
      the test disc/slice may be generated either by first clamping a
      control disc/slice into the transducer chamber and storing the
      resonant acoustic signature in a microprocessor for subsequent
      processing with the test disc/slice signature, or by clamping a
      control into a second transducer chamber and sweeping through the
      wide band of frequencies simultaneously with the test disc/slice
      virus sweep. Also, the test disc/slice may be clamped between the
      transducer and a reflective surface, and the acoustic wave
      generated and received by the same transducer, thus analyzing
      reflected rather than transmitted acoustic waves. Furthermore, one
      or more transducers analyzing reflected or transmitted acoustic
      energy may by immersed into a fluid or medium containing the
      virus.<br>
      <br>
      [0186] In another embodiment one or more transducers analyzing
      reflected or transmitted acoustic energy constitute the walls of a
      vessel into which a fluid or medium containing virus is placed.<br>
      <br>
      [0187] The present invention also allows the effects of the
      resonant frequencies to be determined in vitro as shown by the
      apparatus in FIG. 13. Using standard virology culture methods,
      known to those skilled in the art, the viral culture may be placed
      in a reusable/autoclavable test cylinder. The bottom surface of
      the test cylinder is the transducer, constructed for the
      appropriate frequencies, such as a thin film zinc oxide on a
      sapphire substrate. The host medium thus placed in the test
      cylinder spreads over the bottom of the cylinder in a monolayer
      and in direct contact with the transducer. Acoustic energy of the
      desired resonant frequency is then delivered through the culture
      fluid and host medium to the viruses, and the effects on growth
      and function are assessed using standard virology methods. By
      varying the acoustic wave characteristics, such as amplitude, mode
      (continuous vs. pulsed), shape (sinusoidal vs. square), intensity
      etc., the ideal frequency and waveform required to obtain specific
      effects can be determined.<br>
      <br>
      [0188] For example, in testing the augmenting and/or disrupting
      effects of resonant acoustic frequencies on HIV, uninfected
      T-lymphocyte host cells are first assessed in the test cylinder
      with the resonant acoustic intervention (resonant frequencies in
      varying waveform patterns for varying periods of time at varying
      intensities) using the trypan blue dye exclusion test, which
      excludes anomalous viral results by assessing the effects of the
      acoustic intervention on the host cells alone. Step 2 involves
      placing a calculated number of HIV infected T-lymphocytes in the
      test cylinder. The host cells form a monolayer on the
      transducer/floor of the test cylinder, where the acoustic
      intervention is delivered. The results are then assessed using
      standard in vitro methods such as the Coulter HIV-1 p24 antigen
      kit, HIV cultures, HIV-1 DNA by PCR, viral load measurement,
      quantitative measurements, time to positivity, and growth
      suppression.<br>
      <br>
      [0189] The methods of the present invention also provide means to
      disrupt viruses in vivo and extracorporeally in animals as shown
      in FIG. 14. For example, in humans infected with HIV, an
      extracorporeal blood circulation system is established using
      techniques known to those skilled in the art. The extracorporeal
      blood is passed over a series of reusable/autoclavable sterilized
      transducers that deliver acoustic energy at primary or harmonic
      resonant frequencies. The acoustic transducer series acts in
      effect as an acoustic filter, disrupting viruses in the blood
      stream. Efficacy of treatment is assessed using viral load
      studies, as known to one skilled in the art, both prior to and
      after the extracorporeal treatments.<br>
      <br>
      [0190] In another embodiment, the above described acoustic filter
      is also fitted with a receiving transducer mode for analysis of
      the blood sample. With initial passes of blood containing large
      numbers of intact virus, the resonant amplitude will be high.
      After prolonged exposure of the blood to the disrupting resonant
      frequencies, the resonant amplitude will decline as the numbers of
      intact viruses decline, thus giving viral load readings and a
      method to determine when cessation of the extracorporeal treatment
      is indicated.<br>
      <br>
      [0191] In another embodiment, a sheet of piezoelectric material is
      fashioned into an envelope or mesh-type transducer, through which
      the extracorporeal blood is passed. In another embodiment, a tube
      of piezoelectric material is fashioned into a coil transducer,
      through which the extracorporeal blood is passed. In another
      embodiment, the extracorporeal blood is separated into red and
      white blood cell portions, and only the while blood cell portion
      is passed through the acoustic filter, thus reducing the time
      required for treatment and reducing mechanical damage to the red
      blood cell portion.<br>
      <br>
      [0192] In another embodiment, banked blood is passed through an
      acoustic filter at any one of multiple points in the blood product
      collection and administration process (i.e., collection from the
      donor, separation into components, or administration to the
      recipient).<br>
      <br>
      [0193] In another embodiment, nanosystem technology (see
      Nanosytems, by Eric Drechsler; publications of CJ Kim, Berkley
      University; publications of Ralph Merck, Xerox Co., Palo Alto,
      Calif.) is employed to make multiple small acoustic oscillators
      which are enclosed in filter material, the filter material
      preventing passage of the oscillators but allowing the passage of
      blood cells and blood components. The nanite virosonic filter is
      sterilized and attached in line on an extracorporeal system or in
      a blood products system.<br>
      <br>
      [0194] In another embodiment, the resonant and/or harmonic
      acoustic frequencies are generated using acoustic laser or maser
      systems. In similar fashion, the whole or fractionated blood is
      passed extra corporeally over or through a laser or maser acoustic
      filter.<br>
      <br>
      [0195] The method also provides a means to disrupt viruses in vivo
      and intracorporeally in animals as shown in FIG. 15, using
      intravascular devices. Nanosystem technology is employed to make
      multiple small acoustic oscillators which are enclosed in filter
      material, the filter material preventing passage of the
      oscillators but allowing the passage of blood cells and blood
      components. The nanite virosonic filter is attached in line on a
      CVP type catheter or in a Greenfield-type filter.<br>
      <br>
      [0196] In another embodiment, a central venous catheter as known
      to one skilled in the art (produced commercially by Arrow, Baxter,
      etc.) is engineered and fitted with a transducer of appropriate
      frequency at the tip. The catheter is inserted using standard
      technique into a large vein such as the subclavian, jugular, or
      femoral vein. Resonant acoustic energy is then delivered to the
      circulating blood, thereby disrupting virus in vivo.<br>
      <br>
      [0197] In another embodiment, the transducer is fitted as an
      acoustic filter on a larger intravascular device such as a
      Greenfield filter-type device for the inferior vena cava. The
      device is fitted with a battery that is rechargeable through the
      skin, as currently practiced with rechargeable cardiac pacemakers.
      Once inserted, the acoustic filter reduces viral load in the vena
      caval blood flow, without the need for the patient to be
      restricted by catheters.<br>
      <br>
      [0198] In another embodiment, inclusion of a receiving acoustic
      transducer may also detect qualitative and quantitative resonant
      acoustic frequencies of the virus in the multicellular organism to
      determine efficacy and duration of treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0199] The methods of the present invention also provide a means
      to augment and/or disrupt viruses in vivo in a multicellular
      organism, as shown in FIG. 16, using resonant acoustic fields. The
      organism is placed in a form-fitting tub filled either with water
      or a coupling medium such as castor oil (reflection coefficient
      0.0043) or mineral oil, or such other acoustic conductive gel as
      is available commercially. Acoustic transducers are either fitted
      into the walls and floor of the tub, or are themselves the walls
      and floor of the tub (i.e., piezoelectric polymer sheets or
      ceramics). A predetermined acoustic field (frequencies, harmonics,
      amplitude, mode, shape, etc., at a specific intensity) is
      delivered to the organism from the transducer tub through the
      coupling medium.<br>
      <br>
      [0200] In another embodiment, a receiving acoustic transducer mode
      also detects qualitative and quantitative resonant acoustic
      frequencies of the virus in the multicellular organism to
      determine efficacy of treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0201] The present invention also provides a method to augment
      and/or disrupt viruses in vivo in a portion of a multicellular
      organism as shown in FIG. 17, using a resonant acoustic field
      probe. Acoustic transducers of desired frequency are fitted into
      the end of a hand-held probe device, as currently known to those
      skilled in the art of medical ultrasonography. A predetermined
      acoustic field (frequencies, harmonics, amplitude, mode, shape,
      etc. at the required intensity to effect the organism) is
      delivered to a predetermined portion of the organism, from the
      hand-held transducer probe. Attenuation in air is eliminated by
      use of a commercially available acoustic coupling medium such as
      castor oil. For example, in a person afflicted with hepatitis, the
      treatment is delivered through the skin over the liver.
      Subharmonics of the resonant acoustic frequencies can be used to
      minimize acoustic attenuation at the higher frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      [0202] In another embodiment, receiving acoustic transducer mode
      also detects qualitative and quantitative resonant acoustic
      frequencies of the virus in the multicellular organism to
      determine efficacy and duration of treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0203] The present invention also provides a method to disrupt
      viruses in vivo in a portion of a multicellular organism as shown
      in FIG. 18, using a resonant acoustic field sheet.<br>
      <br>
      [0204] Piezoelectric polymer material of desired frequency is
      fashioned into a flexible transducer sheet device. A predetermined
      acoustic field (frequencies, harmonics, amplitude, mode, shape,
      etc.) is delivered to a predetermined portion of the organism,
      from the transducer sheet device. Attenuation in air is eliminated
      by use of a commercially available acoustic coupling medium such
      as castor oil. For example, in a person afflicted with hepatitis,
      the treatment is delivered by placing the sheet in contact with
      the skin over the liver. Subharmonics of the resonant acoustic
      frequencies can be used to minimize acoustic attenuation at the
      higher frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      [0205] In another embodiment, receiving acoustic transducer mode
      also detects qualitative and quantitative resonant acoustic
      frequencies of the virus in the multicellular organism to
      determine efficacy and duration of treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0206] The present invention also provides a means to determine
      qualitative and quantitative resonant acoustic and/or acousto-EM
      frequencies in vitro as shown in FIGS. 19 A &amp; B. A test
      device, as described above and shown in FIG. 12, with any and all
      embodiments, is fitted with transmitters and receivers to
      transmit, detect, measure, and analyze EM energy. When the
      resonant acoustic frequencies are applied to the virus test disk,
      a unique electromagnetic energy pattern is generated, according to
      the structure and composition of the virus and test disk under
      study, referred to herein as the resonant acousto-EM signature.
      Mechanisms producing the resonant acousto-EM signature include,
      but are not limited to piezoelectricity, acoustoelectricity,
      magnetoacoustics and/or intrinsic energy dissipation. The resonant
      acousto-EM signature represents one or more of several
      electromagnetic properties and/or fields including, but not
      limited to, direct current, alternating current, magnetic field,
      electric field, EM radiation and/or acoustic cyclotron resonance
      (standard or Doppler shifted).<br>
      <br>
      [0207] All of the above mentioned forms of EM energy are detected,
      measured, and analyzed with devices and methods known to those
      skilled in the art. (It should be noted that useful information
      may also be derived from application of nonresonant frequencies,
      i.e. current characterization of semiconductor biologics via the
      acoustoelectric effect.) This data in combination with resonant
      signatures yields even greater sensitivity and specificity to the
      method. For example, Herpes simplex virus (HSV) I and II will have
      nearly identical resonant acoustic signatures because they are
      virtually identical in size and shape. They differ in molecular
      protein configuration, however, and can be distinguished by their
      acousto-EM signatures. This includes, but is not limited to,
      characterization at nonresonant and resonant frequencies of
      acoustoelectric currents, acousto-EM signatures produced via
      intrinsic energy dissipation, of acoustic modulation or
      attenuation in the presence of a magnetic field via the
      magnetoacoustic effect, and of electric or magnetic fields induced
      or affected by any of the above processes.<br>
      <br>
      [0208] In another embodiment, the test device is also fitted with
      any and all combinations of resonant acoustic and acousto-EM
      generating equipment. A sample of unknown composition is exposed
      to the frequency energy pattern which is included in the
      acousto-EM signature for a particular structure. Detection of the
      associated resonant acoustic waves from the sample confirms the
      presence of the structure in the sample. Further analysis of
      amplitude would indicate the relative quantity of those particular
      structures in the sample. For instance, the combined use of
      resonant acoustic and acousto-EM signatures could be used to
      search a tissue slice first for the presence of HSV, and then to
      specify whether it is HSV I, HSV II, or a previously unknown and
      uncharacterized HSV. In addition, a quantitative assessment of
      viral load in the sample could also be performed based on relative
      amplitudes. Thus, the application of resonant acoustic and/or
      acousto-EM energy fields, in respect to organic or biologic
      organisms and structures, yields a form of resonant acousto-EM
      spectroscopy, with three basic stimulation and detection modes (1.
      acoustic, 2. EM, 3. acoustic and EM), producing nine basic
      combinations:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] 1. Acoustic stimulation, acoustic detection;<br>
      2. Acoustic stimulation, EM detection;<br>
      3. Acoustic stimulation, acoustic and EM detection;<br>
      4. EM stimulation, acoustic detection;<br>
      5. EM stimulation, EM detection;<br>
      6. EM stimulation, acoustic and EM detection;<br>
      7. Acoustic and EM stimulation, acoustic detection;<br>
      8. Acoustic and EM stimulation, EM detection; and<br>
      9. Acoustic and EM stimulation, acoustic and EM detection.<br>
      <br>
      [0209] The more sophisticated the stimulation and
      detection/analysis modes are, the more sensitive and specific the
      spectroscopy apparatus will be. It should be noted that the use of
      resonant acousto-EM spectroscopy alone or in combination with
      resonant acoustic spectroscopy in the present invention is not
      limited to biological materials and can be utilized to detect and
      identify inorganic materials or structures as discussed below.<br>
      <br>
      [0210] The present invention also provides a method to assess the
      effects of resonant acoustic and/or acousto-EM energy on viruses
      using any and all devices which produce acoustic and/or EM energy
      including, but not limited to, all devices and embodiments
      previously described. For instance, as shown in FIG. 20, to assess
      the piezoelectric effects of EM radiation on the crystalline
      structure of viruses, a test system is used which employs EM
      radiation of the same frequency as at least one of the resonant
      acoustic frequencies of the virus. In the case of HIV, the
      frequency is approximately 15 GHz. A test box made of EM
      absorptive material is fitted with a 15 GHz EM transmitter, with
      the EM radiation directed towards the floor of the box. Uninfected
      T-lymphocyte host cells are first assessed in the test box with
      the 15 GHz intervention with varying exposure patterns (resonant
      frequencies in varying waveform patterns for varying periods of
      time and at varying intensities) using the trypan blue dye
      exclusion test, which excludes anomalous viral results by
      assessing the effects of the acousto-EM intervention on the host
      cells alone. Step 2 involves placing HIV infected T-lymphocytes in
      the test box, where the acousto-EM intervention is delivered. The
      results are then assessed using standard in vitro testing of
      anti-HIV methods such as the Coulter HIV-1 p24 antigen kit, HIV
      cultures, HIV-1 DNA by PCR, and viral load measurement.<br>
      <br>
      [0211] The present invention also provides a method to disrupt
      viruses extracorporeally and/or intravascularly in animals using
      resonant acoustic and/or acousto-EM fields as shown in FIG. 21.
      For example, in humans infected with HIV, an extracorporeal blood
      circulation system is established using techniques known to those
      in the art. The extracorporeal blood is passed over transducers as
      described in FIG. 14, including any and all embodiments. Acoustic
      penetration into the blood may be increased using acoustoelectric
      gain by passing a direct current into the blood parallel with the
      acoustic waves.<br>
      <br>
      [0212] The present invention also provides a method to augment
      and/or disrupt viruses in an organ of a multicellular organism, as
      shown in FIG. 22, using resonant acoustic and/or acousto-EM
      fields. For instance, as in FIG. 16, including any and all
      embodiments, a human cadaver cornea for transplantation is placed
      in a form-fitting cup filled either with water or such other
      non-toxic acoustic conductive gel as is available commercially. A
      predetermined acoustic field (frequencies, harmonics, amplitude,
      mode, shape, etc.) is delivered to the cornea from a transducer
      tub through the coupling medium. Utilizing the magnetoacoustic
      effect, a magnetic field is placed perpendicular to the direction
      of the acoustic wave propagation, at a field strength which is a
      multiple of the acoustic frequency, thereby generating sinusoidal
      or peak-type resonance spikes in the acoustic power, and improving
      resonant acoustic penetration into the cornea without injuring the
      cornea tissue itself.<br>
      <br>
      [0213] The present invention also provides a means to disrupt
      viruses in vivo in a portion of a multicellular organism using a
      resonant acoustic and/or acousto-EM field probe. For example, as
      shown in FIG. 23, a hand-held probe is fitted with an EM radiation
      generating device, as currently known to those skilled in the art.
      A predetermined EM radiation field (frequencies, harmonics,
      amplitude, mode, shape, etc.) replicating the acousto-EM signature
      representing the intrinsic dissipation pattern of a particular
      virus, is delivered to a predetermined portion of the organism,
      from the hand-held probe. For example, in a person afflicted with
      an upper respiratory tract infection (a "cold"), the treatment is
      delivered through the skin over the nose, throat, and sinuses,
      reversing the intrinsic energy dissipation pathway of the
      rhinovirus and inducing resonant acoustic oscillations which
      disrupt the rhinovirus.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Disruption, Augmentation, Detection and/or Identification
        of Micro-organisms</b><br>
      <br>
      [0214] Any micro-organism, such as bacteria, as well as structure
      and molecules contained or associated herewith, may be augmented,
      disrupted, detected and/or identified in vitro or in vivo using
      the methods of the present invention. Bacteria include, but are
      not limited to, those associated with animals, man, avians,
      reptiles, amphibians, insects, aquatic life, plants, fruit, soil,
      water, oil, fermentation processes for food production and the
      like. In one embodiment the bacteria include but are not limited
      to Streptococcus sps., Staphylococcus sps., Hemophilus sps.,
      Neisseria sps., Treponema sps., Salmonella sps., Shigella sps.,
      Escherichia coli strains, Corynebacteria sps., Bordetella sps.,
      Chlostridrium sps., Rickettsia sps., Chlamydia sps., Brucella
      sps., Mycobacterium sps., Borrelia sps., Mycoplasma sps.,
      Lactobacillus sps., strains thereof and the like. Human illnesses
      caused by bacteria include pneumonia, skin and wound infections,
      heart valve infections, gastroenteritis, syphilis, gonorrhea, the
      plague, urinary tract infections, lyme disease, tuberculosis,
      cholera, typhoid fever, anthrax, tetanus and gangrene.<br>
      <br>
      [0215] Fungal infections include athlete's foot, ringworm, vaginal
      yeast infections, oral thrush, histoplasmosis and cryptococcus.<br>
      <br>
      [0216] Diseases in animals caused by bacteria, fungi, protozoa and
      worms are similar to those in humans. Similarly, a wide range of
      micro-organisms infect plants, and even other micro-organisms are
      deemed to be beneficial (e.g., bakers yeast).<br>
      <br>
      [0217] Bacteria are first classified by staining characteristics
      as either Gram positive, or Gram negative. Bacterial response to
      staining is determined by the structure of the cell wall. Next
      bacteria are further classified by shape as either cocci
      (spherical) or rods (cylindrical.) Beyond that, the classification
      schemes generally involve various biochemical reactions.<br>
      <br>
      [0218] Bacterial cell walls are composed of rigid peptidoglycan
      (mucopeptide or murien), a mixed polymer of hexose sugars
      (N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetyl muramic acid) and amino acids
      (the structural units of proteins, see below). As such, the cell
      walls are crystalline structures and are subject to vibrational
      effects from the use of acoustic energy. Thus bacteria are
      susceptible to augmentation, identification and detection, or
      disruption by resonant acoustic frequencies matched to their shape
      (sphere or cylinder), size and composition. In addition, various
      organelles contained within the bacteria structure are also
      susceptible to specific resonant acoustic frequencies (i.e. pili,
      plasma membrane, flagellum, cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, basal
      bodies, capsule, spores, etc.). Finally, the compounds comprising
      the structure itself (crystalline proteins, etc.) also have unique
      resonant frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      [0219] Fungi, protozoa, parasites and worms are similar to
      bacteria in that the organisms are susceptible to the effects of
      specific resonant frequencies based on the size and shape of the
      entire organism, the size and shape of organelles making up a part
      of the organism, and the resonant characteristics of specific
      biochemical compounds making up the organism.<br>
      <br>
      [0220] Any fungus, including yeasts, molds and mushrooms,
      protozoan, parasites or worms, as well as structures and molecules
      contained or associated therewith, may be augmented, disrupted
      and/or detected in vitro or in vivo using the methods of the
      present invention. These organisms include, but are not limited to
      those associated with animals, man, avians, reptiles, amphibians,
      insects, aquatic life, plants, fruit, soil, water, oil,
      fermentation possesses for food production and the like. In one
      embodiment, these organisms include but are not limited to Crypto
      sporidia sps., Aspergillus sps., Trichophyton sps., Saccharomyces
      sps., Blastomyces sps., Coccidioides sps., Paracoccidioides sps.,
      Penicillium sps., Rhizopus sps., Mucor sps., Neurospora sps.,

      thereof and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0221] At low acoustic and/or acousto-EM power inputs such as
      below 1*10&lt;-5 &gt;W/m&lt;2&gt;, the micro-organisms will be
      augmented in function and will emit a characteristic acoustic
      and/or acousto-EM signature which can be used to detect and
      diagnose the presence of the micro-organisms. At higher power
      inputs, the organisms will be disrupted and killed. In addition to
      the structures of bacteria, fungi, protozoa and worms being
      susceptible to the vibrational resonant effects of acoustic and/or
      acousto-EM energy, they may also function as piezoelectric
      structures, intrinsic dissipation, acoustoelectric, and
      magnetoacoustic structures.<br>
      <br>
      [0222] The present invention takes advantage of the composing
      parts of structures, or the entire organism of bacteria, fungi,
      protozoa, and worms for the purpose of augmentation,
      identification, and/or physical disruption of the micro-organism
      structures using acoustic and/or acousto-EM energy at specific
      resonant frequencies, and the piezoelectric, intrinsic
      dissipation, acoustoelectric and/or magnetoacoustic properties of
      any and all structures involved, either alone or in combination
      with a resonant acoustic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0223] Unlike treatment in the prior art using ultrasound, the
      present invention uses specific resonant frequencies, which can be
      used to treat a multilayer organism. The invention also has the
      potential to augment the functional activity of micro-organisms
      deemed beneficial such as baker's yeast, wine yeast, lactic acid
      bacteria (wine and cheese,) petroleum yeast, and microbes
      producing specific amino acids, antibiotics, enzymes, or other
      chemicals. The functional activities may include growth,
      metabolism, oxidation or reduction activity and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0224] In one embodiment, the present invention allows the
      resonant acoustic and/or acousto-EM frequencies of micro-organisms
      to be determined in vitro as shown by the apparatus described in
      FIGS. 12 and 24 A &amp; B, including any and all embodiments, with
      transducers designed for lower frequencies in the MHZ range (as
      provided commercially by Matec Instruments). For example, in a
      meat packing plant concerned with the contamination of beef by
      bacteria, in particular, E. coli, a similar device can be used to
      screen the meat for bacteria, in a relatively short time span when
      compared to conventional culturing methods. First a swab of the
      meat surface is taken, and placed into a sterile test tube
      containing sterile saline at physiologic pH. A predetermined
      amount of the solution is pipetted onto a standard test disc,
      which is clamped between two transducers. Resonant or resonant
      harmonic acoustic frequencies are scanned for in the test sample,
      thereby screening for the presence or absence of potentially
      harmful E. coli bacteria. Inspection of meat is done more
      efficiently and reliably than by current methods.<br>
      <br>
      [0225] The present invention also allows the resonant acoustic
      and/or acousto-EM fields of micro-organisms to be used to augment
      these biologic organisms or their structures. For example, as
      shown in FIG. 25, the bottom of a beer fermentation vat is fitted
      with acoustic transducers of appropriate frequency and power
      output to augment the function of the special strains of
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast. This yeast is currently used to
      ferment beer for a period of 5 to 10 days, however, with resonant
      acoustic augmentation, the fermentation time is reduced. The most
      efficient power output level can be determined by quantitatively
      detecting concentration of yeast and conversion of starch and/or
      sugar molecules to alcohol compound.<br>
      <br>
      [0226] The present invention also allows the resonant acoustic
      and/or acousto-EM fields of micro-organisms to be used to disrupt
      these biologic organisms or their structures. For example, as
      shown in FIG. 26, a commercial kitchen microwave is fitted with
      two (2) EM radiation horns-one for cooking and one for the
      resonant acoustic and/or acousto-EM frequencies of the common food
      pathogens such as E. coli and Salmonella sps. Prior to roasting,
      grilling, or such other food preparation method as may be desired,
      the home chef may decontaminate the meat or other food product of
      any potential pathogens by using the decontaminate cycle on the
      microwave oven.<br>
      <br>
      [0227] Acoustic resonance measurements were conducted on several
      types of bacteria to determine the resonant acoustic frequency of
      the bacteria. A Matec high frequency 7000 pulse modulator and
      receiver was used in conjunction with a Matec automated data
      acquisition system and an oscilloscope. Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (American Type Culture Collection #13883) was grown on standard
      growth media. A Matec 90 MHz, [3/8]'' diameter transducer surface
      was cleaned and sterilized with alcohol. Live Klebsiella was
      placed on the surface of the transducer. Resonant acoustic
      spectroscopy was performed in the acoustic range of 100-200 MHz. A
      resonant acoustic frequency was detected for the Klebsiella at
      125-130 MHz with a centered frequency at 127.5 MHz. This was
      presumed to be a resonant subharmonic frequency.<br>
      <br>
      [0228] The same measurements were performed on E. coli bacteria
      (American Type Culture Collection #25922) using the same
      equipment. A resonant acoustic frequency was detected for the E.
      coli with a centered frequency of 113 MHz. This too was presumed
      to be a resonant subharmonic frequency.<br>

      <b>Example 3</b><br>
      <b>Detection and Disruption of Infectious Arthropod</b>s<br>
      <br>
      [0229] Arthropods include a diverse group of insects that infest
      and feed on the blood of humans and animals. Examples include
      lice, fleas, ticks, mosquitoes, mites, sandflies and tsetse flies.
      Aside from the general discomfort and annoyance that these
      arthropods produce when they infest a human or animal, the true
      danger of infestation lies in the diseases transmitted by the
      arthropods. These diseases, in general, cost the world economy
      billions of dollars a year. The overall health status of the
      victims is impaired and they suffer loss of time, quality of life
      and sometimes life itself<br>
      <br>
      [0230] Mosquitoes transmit dengue fever, yellow fever,
      encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever, malaria and lymphatic filariasis.
      Ticks transmit encephalitis, Lyme disease, relapsing fever and
      Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Fleas transmit the plague (Yersinia)
      and typhus. Lice transmit typhus. Mites transmit rickettsial pox.
      Flies transmit African sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and Chagas
      disease.<br>
      <br>
      [0231] The distinguishing feature of arthropods is the chitinous
      exoskeleton, which covers the body and legs. Chitin is a long,
      unbranched molecule consisting of repeating units of
      N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. It is found abundantly in nature and forms
      the hard shell of insects, arthropods, crustaceans, mollusks, and
      even the cell walls of certain fungi. As such, chitin is a
      crystalline structure and is subject to the effects of acoustic
      and/or acousto-EM energy. Thus arthropods are susceptible to
      detection and disruption by resonant acoustic frequencies matched
      to their shape (sphere or cylinder), and size. In addition,
      various organs or appendages contained within the arthropod
      structure are also susceptible to specific resonant acoustic
      frequencies. Finally, the compounds comprising the structure
      itself (chitin, crystalline proteins, etc.) also have unique
      resonant frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      [0232] At low acoustic power inputs, the infectious arthropods
      will emit a characteristic acoustic and/or acousto-EM signature
      which can be used to detect and diagnose their presence. At higher
      power inputs, the arthropods will be disrupted and killed. The
      specific range of intensities used for detection or disruption
      will be determinant on the structure and the intensity can be
      determined using standard methods known to those skilled in the
      art such as discussed above. In addition to the structures of
      arthropods being susceptible to the effects of acoustic and/or
      acousto-EM energy, they may also function as piezoelectric
      structures.<br>
      <br>
      [0233] The present invention takes advantage of composing parts of
      the structures or the entire organism of arthropods for the
      purpose of identification and/or physical disruption of the
      arthropod structure using acoustic and/or acousto-EM energy at
      specific resonant frequencies and patterns, and using them as
      piezoelectric, intrinsic dissipation, acoustoelectric, and or
      magnetoacoustic structures, either alone or in combination with a
      resonant acoustic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0234] The methods of the present invention allow the resonant
      acoustic frequencies of arthropods to be determined and utilized,
      with devices of appropriate frequency similar to those previously
      described. For example, researchers capturing and cataloging
      thousands of insects and other arthropods in an effort to identify
      the source of an infectious agent such as Ebola, a hemorrhagic
      fever, or encephalitis, could use an apparatus such as that shown
      in FIG. 27. The portion of the acoustic spectrum containing the
      resonant frequencies of the infectious agent in question is
      scanned. Known resonant frequencies of arthropod materials are fed
      into the negative lead of the spectrum analyzer and cancel out
      their component resonant frequencies in the positive lead sample
      scan. The remaining frequencies are analyzed for the resonant
      acoustic signature of the offending microorganism. This provides a
      means to readily identify the host reservoir of an infectious
      agent without the need for expensive and time-consuming studies.<br>
      <br>
      [0235] The present invention also provides a means to kill
      infecting arthropods on a large organism, for example fleas on a
      dog or human, as shown in FIG. 28. High kHz to very low MHz
      transducers are fitted onto a bathtub-type apparatus. The resonant
      acoustic frequencies for fleas are delivered through the water to
      the surface of the animal. High power outputs for deep tissue
      penetration are not required, as the infectious arthropods are
      restricted to the surface or outer-most layers of the dog or
      human. The same method can also be used, for example, to de-flea
      or de-louse bedding and linens in a washing machine.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 4</b><br>
      <b>Augmentation of Bone Growth</b><br>
      <br>
      [0236] Bone demineralization in humans is a significant health
      care problem. Thousands of elderly people sustain fractures of the
      hip, leg, or arm due to this bone demineralization (osteoporosis).
      These injuries cost the American health care system billions of
      dollars a year, for treatment, surgery, and rehabilitation after
      the injury. In addition, the overall health status of the victims
      is impaired, and they suffer loss of time and quality of life due
      to these fractures. Other conditions which contribute to bone
      matrix loss include weightlessness (e.g., in outer space) and
      prolonged confinement to bed. People in certain occupations may
      benefit from an increase in the normal bone density. Examples
      include professional athletes, military personnel, and jobs
      requiring exposure to increased atmospheric pressures (e.g.,
      undersea diving).<br>
      <br>
      [0237] Living bone is organized in a calcium based crystalline
      structure of hydroxyapatite, doped with copper, and embedded in
      collagen fibers. The application of force to the collagen fibers
      in the bony matrix, through mechanical pressure or gravitational
      fields, stimulates the piezoelectric effect and flow of ions via
      fluid channels in bone. This small electrical charge, in turn,
      acts as a signal to the body's osteoblasts to deposit more
      hydroxyapatite. As the hydroxyapatite density increases, the bone
      becomes stronger. Thus, bones maintain their normal structure and
      density in response to pressures and forces encountered in normal
      daily activities, via a piezoelectric effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0238] With aging, normal copper doping is lost, and the
      piezoelectric effect diminished. The result is that hydroxyapatite
      density is not maintained, and the elderly suffer from
      osteoporosis and bone fractures. The same thing occurs in the
      absence of normal activity (weightlessness and confinement to
      bed), with subsequent absence of the normal piezoelectric effect
      and ionic current flows.<br>
      <br>
      [0239] Bone is a crystalline piezoelectric structure and as such
      is subject to the vibratory effects of acoustic energy. The
      operative process behind normal physiologic bone density
      maintenance is the generation of hydroxyapatite molecular movement
      within collagen fibers, compressed by macro-pressures. These occur
      from daily activities, and stimulate the piezoelectric and
      subsequent bone building osteoblastic effects.<br>
      <br>
      [0240] This molecular movement and the collagen fiber compression
      can also be generated from micro-pressures within the
      semiconductor matrix of bone. Thus understood, micro-pressures can
      be produced by acoustic energy waves.<br>
      <br>
      [0241] In addition to the piezoelectric effect, since bone is a
      piezoelectric and semiconductor structure, it will exhibit the
      acoustoelectric, intrinsic dissipation and magnetoacoustic
      effects. Conditions with diminished bone semiconductor function
      (osteoporosis) and/or decreased macro-pressures (weightlessness
      and bed confinement) can be effectively treated through
      application of acoustic micro-pressures which generate a
      biological piezoelectric effect, and/or also via acoustic
      resonance, intrinsic dissipation, acoustoelectric and
      magnetoacoustic effects.<br>
      <br>
      [0242] Prior literature describes the use of non-resonant
      ultrasound to speed the rate of healing of bone fractures,
      however, the mechanism causes gross disruption of the bone
      tissues, which in turn damages the microscopic capillary bed in
      bone, with leakage of serum and cells into the bony matrix, and
      with subsequent bone mineralization. The literature also describes
      attempts to use ultrasound to detect resonant frequencies of the
      structure of entire bones (femur and ulna) to diagnose a bone as
      normal or defective. However, the use of resonant acoustics and/or
      acousto-EM frequencies to activate the piezoelectric effect is not
      described. No consideration is given in the prior art to using
      bone as a living transducer for the piezoelectric, intrinsic
      dissipation, acoustoelectric, and magnetoacoustic effects, either
      alone or in combination with a resonant acoustic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0243] The present invention takes advantage of the crystalline,
      piezoelectric structure of bone for the purpose of augmenting bone
      growth and calcification. The invention has the potential to
      significantly reduce the number and severity of bone fractures
      suffered by victims of osteoporosis. The invention has the
      potential to speed the healing process of fractures. Other
      conditions which contribute to bone matrix loss, such as
      weightlessness (i.e., in outer space), or prolonged confinement to
      bed, would also benefit from the invention. The invention has the
      potential to aid people in occupations which would benefit from an
      increase in their bone density (athletes, military personnel, and
      jobs requiring exposure to increased atmospheric pressures such as
      undersea diving.) The invention also has potential veterinary
      applications. Unlike prior treatment using ultrasound, the present
      invention uses resonant acoustic and/or acousto-EM frequencies of
      bone to stimulate at least the piezoelectric effect for
      augmentation of bone growth without affecting neighboring tissue.<br>
      <br>
      [0244] The methods of the present invention provide a means to
      augment the growth and maintenance of bone using resonant acoustic
      and/or resonant acousto-EM energy. For example, as shown in FIG.
      29, a sheet of piezoelectric material is fitted into a shower mat
      device. When an elderly person, prone to osteoporosis, showers the
      mat is activated. Water in the shower acts as a conductive medium
      and primary or harmonic resonant frequencies are delivered through
      the soles of the feet, along the lines of force, up into the legs
      and hips. The piezoelectric effect in bone is activated and bone
      density is increased.<br>
      <br>
      [0245] The present invention provides a method to augment the
      growth and maintenance of bone using resonant acoustic and/or
      acousto-EM energy, for example, as also shown in FIG. 30. The
      sleeping/tether bags used by astronauts during conditions of
      weightlessness are fitted with EM radiation transmitters in the
      foot of the bags. The bags are made of EM absorptive materials.
      The tethers that anchor the sleeping bags to the space vessel
      include the cables to connect the antennas to signal generators in
      the space craft. While sleeping, the bone maintenance devices in
      the sleeping bag are activated, delivering EM radiation to the
      astronauts at a resonant frequency that activates the
      piezoelectric effect in bone, and thus, maintains their normal
      body density. Extraneous EM radiation which might interfere with
      other equipment on board is blocked by the EM absorptive materials
      in the sleeping bags.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 5</b><br>
      <b>Disruption and Detection of Benign or Malignant Tissues or
        Masses</b><br>
      <br>
      [0246] There are a wide variety of tissue masses, both benign and
      malignant, which afflict humans and animals. Many tissue masses
      are encapsulated or are contained within a restricted area in the
      body. Nearly all benign tumors grow and expand slowly, developing
      a fibrous capsule, and producing a discrete, readily palpable and
      easily movable mass. Examples of benign tumors include fibroma,
      lipoma, chondroma, osteoma, hemangioma, lymphangioma, meningioma,
      leiomyoma, adenoma, papilloma, polyps, condyloma, fibroadenoma and
      rhabdomyoma. Most malignant tumors are invasive and metastasize,
      however, notable exceptions are gliomas and basal cell carcinomas.
      Other tissue masses causing disease include emboli, thrombi,
      abscesses, stones, and foreign bodies.<br>
      <br>
      [0247] By virtue of having a defined, discrete structure, many
      tissue masses are susceptible to the disrupting effects of
      acoustic energy at resonant frequencies matched to their size and
      shape. Prior art contains many applications for the use of
      acoustics at non-resonant frequencies to detect and even disrupt
      tissue masses, but to date detection of tissue masses via resonant
      acoustic energy and disruption of tissue masses via acoustic
      energy at resonant frequencies has not been disclosed.<br>
      <br>
      [0248] In addition to tissue masses being susceptible to detection
      and disruption by resonant acoustic frequencies matched to their
      shape and size, the components comprising the tissue mass itself
      (cell types, crystalline proteins, etc.) also have unique resonant
      frequencies susceptible to detection and disruption. At lower
      power inputs, certain tissues or masses can be augmented in growth
      or metabolism, providing a supplemental technique for tissue
      culturing, regeneration, and growth.<br>
      <br>
      [0249] Depending on their structure, certain tissue masses or
      types may also exhibit resonant acousto-EM effects as well as
      functioning as piezoelectric, intrinsic dissipation,
      acoustoelectric and/or magnetoacoustic structures.<br>
      <br>
      [0250] The present invention takes advantage of the discrete
      shape, size and composition of numerous benign and malignant
      tissues and masses to cause the identification, augmentation,
      detection, and/or disruption of those structures using acoustic
      and/or electromagnetic energy at specific resonant frequencies.
      Unlike prior treatments using ultrasound, the present invention
      uses specific resonant acoustic and/or electromagnetic
      frequencies, which can be used to treat a multilayer organism by
      targeting a specific structure therein. It combines the known
      tumor/mass detection abilities of acoustic energy (diagnostic
      ultrasound) with the disruptive characteristics of acoustic and/or
      electromagnetic energy at resonant frequencies. The invention also
      has the potential to augment the growth and function of various
      tissues and masses, where desirable.<br>
      <br>
      [0251] The present invention provides a means to detect and
      disrupt benign or malignant tissues and/or tissue masses using
      resonant acoustic and/or acousto-EM energy. For example, as shown
      in FIG. 31, an acoustic transducer designed with standard
      echo-reflective capabilities is used to determine the size and
      dimensions of a tissue mass. Based on the calculated resonant
      frequencies, a range is scanned to determine the precise resonant
      frequencies. Then one or more of those frequencies are delivered
      to the mass, disrupting its structure and allowing subsequent
      resorption of the mass by the body.<br>
      <br>
      [0252] Also, the present invention provides a means to detect
      benign or malignant tissue types using resonant acoustic and/or
      acousto-EM energy, using the apparatus described in FIGS. 12 and
      19 A &amp; B, including any and all embodiments, the cell test
      disc or tissue preparation is placed between two transducers and
      the frequencies are scanned looking for resonant peaks and EM
      patterns. Differences in the resonant peaks and EM patterns will
      differentiate between tissue types, for example between normal
      epithelial cells and cancerous epithelial cells.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 6</b><br>
      <b>Augmentation. Detection and/or Disruption of Biochemical
        Compounds or Tissues</b><br>
      <br>
      [0253] Biologic organisms are composed of many biochemical
      compounds including nucleic acids, carbohydrates, lipids, amino
      acids and steroids. Many biochemical compounds align themselves in
      regularly repeating patterns: in other words they adopt
      crystalline forms. Examples of biochemical crystals include
      insulin, hexokinase, aldolase, hemoglobin, myoglobin and spectrin.
      In addition, certain tissues or cell structures adopt crystalline
      form such as bone, muscle fibers, and connective tissue fibers for
      the former, and cell membranes, Na/K membrane pumps, and visual
      rod receptors for the latter.<br>
      <br>
      [0254] The biochemical compounds from which biological organisms
      are composed have their own unique resonant frequencies, based on
      their innate crystalline structure. Many of the biochemical
      compounds are also piezoelectric, intrinsic energy dissipation,
      acoustoelectric and magnetoacoustic structures. As such,
      biochemical compounds are subject to the augmenting, disrupting
      and/or detecting features of resonant acoustic and/or acousto-EM
      energy. The present invention uses specific resonant acoustic
      and/or acousto-EM frequencies, which can be used to treat a
      multilayer organism. The present invention also has the potential
      to utilize piezoelectric, intrinsic energy dissipation,
      acoustoelectric and/or magnetoacoustic effects to achieve desired
      results, either alone or in combination with a resonant acoustic
      field.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 7</b><br>
      <b>Stimulation or Disruption of Proteoglycans Adhesive Units
        Between Cells Yielding a Skin Welding Scalpel</b><br>
      <br>
      [0255] The present invention provides a method to stimulate and/or
      disrupt proteoglycans adhesive units between cells using resonant
      acoustic and/or acousto-EM energy. Millions of operations are
      performed on humans every year, using metal scalpels to make the
      incision. The use of such scalpels requires closure of the
      incisions with stitches, a period of healing and invariably
      results in scar formation. In addition, millions of people suffer
      traumatic cuts, tears, or ruptures of the skin, again requiring
      closure of the wounds with stitches, a period of healing, and scar
      formation.<br>
      <br>
      [0256] In multicellular organisms, the cells are held together by
      proteoglycans units, at the rate of approximately 1,600 per cell.
      These units are approximately 200 um long, with some variation
      between the species.<br>
      <br>
      [0257] When an incision is made, or a traumatic break in a cell
      layer occurs, the cellular adhesions are ripped apart, some cells
      are ruptured, and blood vessels are torn open. White blood cells,
      platelets and fibroblasts congregate in the extracellular space
      and eventually lead to the formation of a scar which readheres the
      tissues. During this healing phase the open tissues are much more
      susceptible to invasion by foreign organisms, and wound infection
      is a complication that must be constantly guarded against.<br>
      <br>
      [0258] Even if the wound heals without the complication of
      infection, a scar still remains. Modern plastic surgery techniques
      try to either minimize or hide scars, but the formation of a scar
      is inevitable.<br>
      <br>
      [0259] An energy field achieving acoustic resonance with the
      proteoglycans units at high amplitudes indicating high power
      levels will cause separation of the adhesive bonds between cells,
      thus producing separation of tissue layers, and in essence, a
      non-traumatic incision. The same energy field at lower amplitudes
      will cause readhesion of the adhesive bonds, with nearly
      instantaneous and scarless healing of the readhesed incision.<br>
      <br>
      [0260] The present invention dramatically improves the surgical
      process by nontraumatically separating cell layers in the tissue,
      and by instantly readhering the cell layers with minimal or no
      scarring, using resonant acoustic frequencies. In so much as
      proteoglycans units may exhibit piezoelectric, intrinsic energy
      dissipation, acoustoelectric and/or magnetoacoustic effects, the
      present invention has the potential to produce the above results
      using the electromagnetic energy pattern of the acousto-EM
      signature, either alone or in combination with a resonant acoustic
      field. The present invention also has veterinary and agricultural
      significance, i.e., treating wounds or performing surgery in
      livestock and poultry, and grafting of various plant tissues or
      branches from one plant to another.<br>
      <br>
      [0261] For example, as shown in FIG. 33, a transducer tipped
      scalpel is used to produce an acoustic/acousto-EM wave of
      appropriate frequencies to disrupt the proteoglycans adhesive
      units between cells and create a surgical incision. At the end of
      the procedure the edges of the incision are held together, and
      another transducer of appropriate frequencies and type is passed
      over the incision, readhering the tissues.<br>

      <b>Augmentation, Detection and/or Disruption of Structures of
        Multicellular Organisms</b><br>
      <br>
      [0262] The augmentation, identification, detection and/or
      disruption of multicellular organisms has many applications. The
      world population is plagued by a variety of pests such as insects,
      rodents and mollusks. In other situations, the detection of
      various species in particular habitats is of importance to human
      activities. Finally, there are many multicellular organisms whose
      growth and augmentation are desired for harvesting of food,
      medicines, jewelry, etc. Pests can be eliminated by the use of
      resonant acoustic and/or acousto-EM frequencies matched to the
      size and shape of their body, parts of their bodies, or specific
      biochemical compounds contained in their bodies. For example, a
      resonant acoustic and/or acousto-EM frequency matched to the size
      of the head, thorax, or abdomen, could be lethal to bees, wasps,
      ants or termites. Similarly, a resonant acoustic and/or acousto-EM
      frequency matched to the size and shape of a mouse's internal
      organ (brain, kidney, gonad, aorta, etc.) could be lethal to that
      animal. Mollusk pests such as the zebra shell mussel and barnacles
      could be controlled or eliminated through the use of resonant
      acoustic and/or acousto-EM frequencies matched to the size and
      shape of their eggs, internal organs, chitin shell, or
      cement/cement plate, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0263] Detection of various pest organisms such as termites, or
      desired organisms such as endangered species could be aided
      through the use and detection of resonant acoustic and/or
      acousto-EM frequencies specific for those organisms. The use of
      resonant acoustic and/or acousto-EM frequencies could potentially
      aid in the identification and differentiation of species and
      subspecies throughout the animal, plant and microbiological
      kingdoms.<br>
      <br>
      [0264] Examples of multicellular organisms whose growth and
      augmentation are desired for harvesting include plants and protein
      sources such as fish, clams, shrimp, chickens and other livestock.
      Medicines, drugs and chemicals harvested from a wide variety of
      plant and animal sources include hormones, perfumes, dyes and
      vitamins. Other materials harvested from plant and animal sources
      are such an intrinsic part of human activities that they are
      simply too numerous to list (i.e., pearls, clothing fibers,
      building materials, leather, etc.) At lower power inputs of the
      resonant acoustic and/or acousto-EM frequencies, these organisms
      and their structures can be selectively augmented.<br>
      <br>
      [0265] The present invention takes advantage of the discrete shape
      and size of numerous organisms to make use of resonant acoustic
      and/or acousto-EM frequencies specific to those organisms, for
      purposes of augmentation, identification, detection and/or
      disruption. Using the piezoelectric, intrinsic energy dissipation,
      acoustoelectric and/or magnetoacousto effects, the invention has
      the potential to produce the above results by applying an
      electromagnetic energy pattern of the specific acousto-EM
      signature, either alone or in combination with a resonant acoustic
      field. The present invention has the potential to provide
      chemical-free control of numerous pests. The present invention
      also has the potential to provide for the detection and
      identification of numerous species of organisms. Lastly, the
      present invention has the potential to augment growth and
      metabolism in and of structures in various species deemed
      beneficial.<br>
      <br>
      [0266] The present invention provides a means to augment, detect
      and/or disrupt structures of multicellular organisms using
      resonant acoustic and/or acousto-EM energy. For example, as shown
      in FIG. 32, a transducer apparatus with the resonant frequency for
      the cement plate of barnacles (by which they attach themselves to
      the hulls of ships) is fitted into an underwater "scrubber" which
      is operated remotely from the deck of the ship via cables, or from
      inside the vessel via RF control. As the scrubber moves along the
      outside of the hull, the acoustic wave disrupts the cement plate
      of the barnacles, causing them to lose their grip on the hull and
      fall off into the ocean.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 9</b><br>
      <b>Augmentation or Disruption of Growth Rate of Fish</b><br>
      <br>
      [0267] The present invention provides for augmenting and/or
      disrupting the growth rate of fish in a commercial fishery as
      shown in FIG. 34.<br>
      <br>
      [0268] Two breeding pairs of small fish were maintained in a 10
      gallon fish tank at 80[deg.] F. The breeding pairs produced eggs
      which hatched in approximately 3-5 days. The three day old
      small-fry hatchlings were removed from the breeding tank and
      measured for acoustic resonance frequency profiles. The
      small-fries were placed, one at a time, in a drop of water on top
      of a 2.25 MHz Matec transducer to measure and determine resonant
      frequencies of the small-fries. All of the small-fry tested
      produced similar resonant acoustic frequencies profiles with minor
      individual variations. One of the strongest initial signals was at
      2.4 MHz.<br>
      <br>
      [0269] TEST A. The first test was conducted on two different
      groupings of small-fry, one group exposed to an acoustic resonant
      field and the other used as a control group. The experimental
      tanks were fitted with Matec 2.25 MHz acoustic transducers through
      a water tight grommet, through and parallel to the bottom of the
      tanks. One half of the small-fry were placed in a control tank
      that was connected to a transducer, but not activated. The other
      half of small-fry were placed in a tank with a transducer and an
      acoustic field was applied to the tank. The acoustic field
      transmitted at 2.4 MHz, continuously at 10 volts/sec. power. The
      small-fry that were in the control tank all thrived and grew while
      all the small-fry in the acoustic field died within two weeks.<br>
      <br>
      [0270] TEST B. Another testing regime was conducted on small-fry
      wherein the small-fry were divided into three groups.<br>
      <br>
      [0271] DAY 1. One third of the group was left in the breeding tank
      with parents as controls. One group was put in another small
      control tank, attached to a transducer but without activating
      power to the transducer. The third group was placed in a tank
      attached to a working transducer and the small-fry were exposed to
      an acoustic field of 2.4 MHz, using the pulse mode of the power
      source at 10 msec repetition rate with a 20 microsecond pulse
      width or duration. The voltage power was set at 300 volts/s, via
      the Matec TB 1000.<br>
      <br>
      [0272] DAY 7. Within one week there was a noticeable difference in
      the sizes of the different groups of small-fry, the small-fry
      exposed to the acoustic resonance field being larger than the two
      control groups.<br>
      <br>
      [0273] DAY 10. On the tenth (10) day of the experiment, all the
      small-fry were remeasured and the frequency exposing the small-fry
      in the acoustic exposed tank was reduced to 2.0 MHz but all other
      parameters remained the same. The acoustic exposed small-fry
      thrived.<br>
      <br>
      [0274] DAY 14. Five of the small-fry in the small tank control
      group died.<br>
      <br>
      [0275] DAY 16. Eighteen of the small-fry in the small tank control
      group had died by this time. The breeding tank group were
      unaffected. All remaining small-fry in all groups were measured
      using a centimeter ruler and the binocular microscope:<br>

      &nbsp; Small tank control group&nbsp; 5 mm long<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      [0276] DAY 18. All but one of the small-fly in the small tank
      control group had died. The control group in the breeding tank
      were still alive and functioning and the acoustic resonance
      exposed group were thriving.<br>
      <br>
      [0277] DAY 19. The resonant acoustic frequencies of the growing
      small-fly in the acoustic tank was measured again. The acoustic
      field was changed to 1.55 MHz, with all other parameters remaining
      the same except the pulse width of each repetition was reduced to
      2 microseconds. This reduction of width of pulse had a marked
      influence on the growth of the small-fry indicating that the
      microseconds was at the upper end of the power range for
      augmentation at these frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      [0278] DAY 21. The sole remaining small-fry in the small tank
      control group was moved into the breeding control group. This sole
      small-fly was noticeably smaller than the other control groups but
      all control small-fly were noticeably smaller than the acoustic
      group.<br>
      <br>
      [0279] DAY 41. In the acoustic group tank, the acoustic field was
      changed to 0.830 MHz, having all other parameters remain constant.<br>
      <br>
      [0280] DAY 65. The acoustic field exposing the small-fly in the
      acoustic group tank was terminated. At approximately two months
      old, the acoustic resonance exposed fish were approximately the
      same size as much older 4 month old controls from an earlier
      control group and much larger than their counterparts in the
      breeding control group.<br>
      <br>
      [0281] RESULTS: There was a significant difference in level of
      power input or intensity between TEST A and TEST B. In TEST A, the
      power was continuous at 10 Volts/sec. In TEST B the power was
      pulsed and the acoustic field was active at the most only 0.2% of
      the time. Therefore, even though the power was 300 volt/sec, the
      overall yield was only (300 V/sec*0.002) or 0.6 Volts/sec total
      power.<br>
      <br>
      [0282] As the small-fry grew the acoustic resonant frequencies
      that induced function changes also changed due to difference in
      structure size and shape.<br>
      <br>
      [0283] After termination of the acoustic field, the small fry were
      allowed to grow to maturity and breed. The fish exposed to
      acoustic energy at the resonant frequency matured and laid eggs
      significantly sooner than the control fish. No second generation
      effects were noted in offspring of either the acoustic exposed or
      control fish.<br>

      <br>
      [0284] Testing was conducted to determine the effects of resonant
      acoustic energy on the germination and growth patterns of sugar
      snap peas. The seeds for the sugar snap peas were obtained from
      Lake Valley Seed Co., packed for lot 1997 lot A2B, 5717, Arapahoe,
      Boulder Colo., 80303.<br>
      <br>
      [0285] Initially, the resonant acoustic frequency of pea sprouts
      was ascertained by determining the frequency for the maximum
      amplitude shown on an A-scan. By varying the frequency of the
      audio generator, the amplitude of the pea sprout was a maximum at
      the resonant frequency. Seven sugar snap peas were covered half
      way with room temperature water in a wide-mouth glass container
      and left on the counter to sprout. Six days later, the sprouts
      were tested as follows:<br>

      Transducers used in the experiment included the Matec 1.0 MHz,
      2.25 MHz, 5.0 MHz and 10.0 MHz, all being 0.5 inches in diameter.
      These frequencies were initially chosen because calculation showed
      that based on the speed of sound in water (1,500 m/s) and the
      diameter of the sprouts (1-2 mm or 0.001-0.002 m), the resonant
      frequency across the diameter of the sprout should be in the low
      MHz range:<br>

      velocity=frequency*wavelength<br>
      <br>

      frequency=velocity/wavelength=1,500 m/s/0.001 m=1.5 MHz<br>
      <br>
      [0287] Sprout #1 was excised from the pea halves, and was placed
      between two 2.25 MHz transducers, coupled with a thin coat of EKG
      gel. The Tb 1000 was set on scan increments of 0.005 MHz, and the
      sprout was scanned from the lowest (50 KHz) frequency available on
      the system to the highest (20 MHz). Variations in amplitude were
      observed during this frequency sweeping process, and the low MHz
      region was quickly identified as the highest amplitude region.
      Further frequency sweeping revealed maximum amplitude at 1.7 MHz.<br>
      <br>
      [0288] The same procedure was followed for test sprout #2 and #3.
      Test sprout #2 was still attached to half of the pea, and the
      resonant frequency of 1.64 MHz was detected from the entire
      structure, although the gain had to be increased because of the
      attenuation of the acoustic field by the pea half. Sprout #3 was
      an isolated sprout such as #1 and revealed a resonant frequency of
      1.78 MHz.<br>
      <br>
      [0289] The same procedure was repeated with the 1.0 MHz transducer
      and similar results were obtained. Thus, it was concluded that the
      acoustic resonant frequency for 4-5 day old sugar snap pea sprouts
      was 1.7 MHz+-0.1 MHz. Having successfully identified a resonant
      frequency for a multicellular biological, the next step was to
      show disruption and/or augmentation effects from the application
      of an acoustic field at this frequency.<br>
      <br>
      [0290] A number of germination tests were conducted using
      different power levels or voltages and length of exposure at the
      acoustic resonant frequency.<br>

      Two small plastic dishes were prepared with sterile cotton balls
      in a single layer in the bottom of the dishes with seven sugar
      snap pea seeds and filled with distilled water to cover the pea
      seeds halfway. The pea seeds in one dish served as a control. The
      1.0 MHz transducer was clamped tightly in a ring stand clamp, and
      the face of the transducer was lowered into the center of the
      dish. The acoustic field of the transducer was lowered into the
      center of the dish. The acoustic field was initiated on day one
      and interrupted several times during the next 72 hours due to
      frequent storms in the area. The transducer was operating
      approximately only 18 hours during the first 48 hours of the test.<br>
      <br>
      [0292] The experiment was terminated on day five. All seven of the
      acoustic pea seeds sprouted, while only five of the control pea
      seeds sprouted. Several spots of black mold were noted in the
      control dish. Comparison of the root sprouts revealed that the
      acoustic sprouts were twice as long as the control sprouts (2.9 cm
      vs. 1.6 cm). Interpretation of these results was ambiguous because
      of the tight clamping of the transducer, the frequent and repeated
      interruption of the acoustic field and the contaminating mold in
      the control dish. Accordingly, test trays were constructed with
      the transducer coming up through the bottom of the tray.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Germination #2</b><br>
      <br>
      [0293] The same acoustic equipment and setup was used in this
      germination as that used in germination #1. The 1.0 MHz transducer
      was clamped loosely in a ring stand clamp, and the face of the
      transducer was lowered into a larger plastic dish. A second 1.0
      MHz transducer, unconnected to the signal generator was lowered
      into a larger control dish. Interruptions were infrequent.<br>
      <br>
      [0294] The study was terminated on day #7. In the control dish,
      79% had sprouted and the average root sprout length was 3.95 cm
      (n=81.) In the acoustic dish, only 69% had sprouted and the
      average root sprout length was 3.12 cm (n=80). It was concluded
      that this frequency at the higher power voltage output
      demonstrated a disruptive effect on pea sprouting and growth.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Germination #3</b><br>
      <br>
      [0295] A new setup was implemented wherein the 1 MHz transducer
      was fitted into the bottom of two dishes which were modified by
      drilling a hole with rubber seals to accommodate a. 5 inch
      diameter transducer. The transducers were placed face up through
      the bottom of the dish. Each dish was prepared with sterile cotton
      batting in a single layer in the bottom. Fifty sugar snap pea
      seeds were placed in the dishes and filled halfway with water. The
      control dish was prepared exactly as the acoustic dish but
      unconnected to the signal generator. The acoustic field was
      initiated on day #1 with the above settings used in germination
      #1, except that the pulse width was increased to 19.98 [mu]sec
      which was about 10 times the pulse width used in germination #1.
      It was also 10 times the power output as in experiment #2.
      Interruptions were infrequent.<br>
      <br>
      [0296] The study was terminated on day #7. In the control dish,
      82% had sprouted and the average root sprout length was similar to
      germination #2. In the acoustic dish, only 72% had sprouted and
      the average root sprout was similar to germination #2. This data
      confirmed that the frequency of 1.7 MHz at a high power voltage
      level demonstrated a disruptive effect on pea sprouting and
      growth.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Germination #4</b><br>
      <br>
      [0297] The same setup was used as that disclosed in germination #3

      <br>
      <br>
      [0298] The results of this germination showed that only 84% of the
      control dish had sprouted, while in the acoustic dish, 90% had
      sprouted. The average root sprout length of the acoustic peas was
      24% longer than the control peas. It was concluded that this
      frequency and a lower power acoustic field has an augmenting
      effect on the pea sprouting and growth.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Germination #5</b><br>
      <br>
      [0299] The same setup and experiment disclosed in germination #4
      was repeated with similar results. In the control dish, 84% had
      sprouted, while in the acoustic dish, 96% had sprouted. The
      average root sprout length of the acoustic peas was 30% longer
      than the control peas (3.26 cm vs. 2.49 cm). It was confirmed that
      the acoustic resonant frequency at low power had an augmenting
      effect on the growth of the peas.<br>
      <br>
      [0300] The results of the above five germination tests, shown in
      Table 3, confirmed that acoustic resonant energy can have both an
      disruptive and augmenting effect depending on the length of
      exposure and power intensity of exposure. Also, it was concluded
      that the tight clamping of the transducer in germination #1 must
      have damped and attenuated the power output from the transducer to
      mimic low power effect.<br>

      Germination #6<br>
      <br>
      [0301] Germination trays were prepared by placing sterile cotton
      in the bottom of round plastic bowls equipped with acoustic
      transducers in the bottom. Seventy-five peas (Sugar snap, Lake<br>
      <br>
      [0302] Valley lot A2B 1997) were placed in each tray and distilled
      water was added as needed. An acoustic field was delivered to one
      group of peas for three days using a Matec 1.0 MHz transducer with
      a repetition rate of 10 msec having a pulse width of 2 [mu]sec.
      The peas were then transferred to 6 inch diameter tapered black
      plastic pots, filled with plant growing medium, having bottom
      openings for water drainage. Three peas were planted in each
      container.<br>
      <br>
      [0303] The peas were grown indoors with a 1000 watt grow-light.
      The peas grew to maturity and into plants bearing pea pods which
      were measured and weighed. Table 4 provides information relating
      to the overall growth pattern of the mature pea plants.<br>

      Conclusion-The acoustically treated peas had approximately 20%
      greater weight and volume of peas. Weight of peas per plant was
      identical between the two groups. Hence, the acoustic treatment
      affected crop yield indirectly, by increasing germination. The
      acoustic treatment during the first three days affected
      germination only, and did not affect the subsequent growth and
      crop yield after the acoustic field was discontinued.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Germination #7</b><br>
      <br>
      [0304] DAY 1 Germination trays (2) were prepared as above in
      germination #6 with 115 peas per tray. Neither tray was equipped
      with acoustic transducers. In this experiment, peas contained in
      one of the prepared trays were induced into acoustic resonance by
      an acousto-EM field which was delivered via exposure in a shielded
      room using a 20 foot antenna and an E field generator. EM energy
      at a frequency of 1.7 MHz was applied continuously at a power of
      8.5 volts/m. The tray containing the control peas was kept in a
      second shielded room without exposure to an acousto-EM field.<br>
      <br>
      [0305] DAY 3-11 of the peas exposed to the acousto-EM field
      sprouted while only 5 of the control peas sprouted. The acousto-EM
      exposed peas were almost twice the length of the control peas.<br>
      <br>
      [0306] DAY 6-45 of the peas exposed to the acousto-EM field had
      sprouted while only 35 of the control group had sprouted.<br>
      <br>
      [0307] DAY 10-61 of the peas exposed to the acousto-EM field had
      sprouted while only 45 of the control group had sprouted. The
      average length of the leaf sprout on the exposed acousto-EM field
      group was 3.3 cm while the average length of the control group was
      only 2.7 cm.<br>
      <br>
      [0308] RESULTS: Applying an acousto-EM signature augmented the
      germination and growth rate of the peas.<br>

      <b>Detection and Identification of Inorganic Structures</b><br>
      <br>
      [0309] The methods and systems of the present invention have a
      wide range of useful applications, such as on-site identification
      both qualitatively and quantitatively of various types of
      inorganic matter or structures, recognition of impurities in metal
      alloys, recognition of armaments and weapons, such as plastic
      explosives, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0310] Detection and identification can be achieved by applying
      acoustic energy at a frequency closely matching the resonant
      frequency of an object or structure thereby inducing acoustic
      resonance therein for detection of a unique acoustic and/or
      acousto-EM signature. Using methods known to those skilled in the
      art, any device capable of generating and transmitting acoustic
      energy through any medium can be used to generate the resonant
      acoustic and/or acousto-EM signatures utilized by this invention
      including the apparatus disclosed and shown above in FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0311] Using methods known to those skilled in the art, any device
      capable of detecting and analyzing acoustic energy and/or EM
      energy through any medium can be used to detect the resonant
      acoustic and/or acousto-EM signatures utilized by the invention
      such as disclosed and shown above in FIG. 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0312] The system shown in FIG. 12 gives a schematic overview of
      the necessary components to be utilized in determining resonant
      acoustic frequencies of different inorganic materials or
      structures. Predetermination of the specific frequencies and
      acoustic and/or acousto-EM signatures will provide a database for
      later comparisons.<br>
      <br>
      [0313] In FIGS. 35 A &amp; B block diagrams show the apparatus
      setup wherein resonant acoustic energy can be combined with
      acousto-EM energy for a spectroscopic method to identify, detect
      and distinguish similar or dis-similar objects. This can be
      accomplished by stimulating an object to resonance by the use of
      acoustic energy, electromagnetic energy or both. When the resonant
      acoustic frequencies are applied to the sample, acoustic resonance
      is induced and a unique electromagnetic energy pattern is
      generated, that being the resonant acousto-EM signature.
      Mechanisms producing the resonant acousto-EM signature may
      include, but are not limited to piezoelectricity,
      acoustoelectricity, magnetoacoustics and/or intrinsic energy
      dissipation. The resonant acousto-EM signature is a manifestation
      of electromagnetic properties and/or fields including, but not
      limited to, direct current, alternating current, magnetic field,
      electric field, EM radiation and/or acoustic cyclotron resonance.<br>
      <br>
      [0314] Analysis is then performed on the resultant acoustic,
      electromagnetic or combined energy spectrum produced. The
      distribution of acoustic and electromagnetic frequencies and/or
      properties is then characterized to describe a unique acoustic
      and/or acousto-EM signature of the object.<br>
      <br>
      [0315] The present invention may be utilized in security systems
      such as in airports where concerns regarding the transport of
      plastic explosives or plastic weapons into airlines terminals and
      carriers are generating increased security surveillance. Metal
      detectors are not capable of detecting polymers because in most
      cases the polymers will not respond to the magnetic fields of the
      device. Likewise, the other alternatives such as X-rays devices or
      trained animals are not able to distinguish one polymer from
      another, and therefore, some explosives can be difficult to
      detect.<br>
      <br>
      [0316] A detection device can be used that will recognize the
      unique acoustic signature and/or acousto-EM signature which
      characterizes a particular plastic explosive.<br>
      <br>
      [0317] To determine the acoustic resonant frequency of the plastic
      explosive, the natural frequency of the plastic containing the
      explosive has to be determined first. The method to determine the
      resonant frequency which in turn determines the frequency needed
      to induce acoustic resonance includes the following steps. A
      sample of the plastic having a known quantity of explosive
      material is placed between two transducers comprising thin slices
      of thin film zinc oxide on a sapphire substrate available from
      Teledyne Electronic Technology. The sample is adhered to the
      transducers by phenyl salicylate, a coupling medium that acts as
      an adhesive and also allows the transfer of energy. One of the
      transducers is connected to a Teledyne Microstrip Matching
      Network, which is an impedance matching device. The impedance
      matching device is in turn connected to a Hewlett-Packard Model
      6286A power source. The other transducer is also connected to a
      Teledyne Microstrip Matching Network which in turn is connected to
      a B &amp; K Precision Model 2625 spectrum analyzer. The acoustic
      signal, of the plastic test sample, transmitted from the
      transducer is fed into the positive lead of the spectrum analyzer.
      The known acoustic signals from the testing fluids, holders,
      transducer material served as a control and are fed into the
      negative lead of the spectrum analyzer. Using this setup the
      control signatures are canceled out and the remaining resonant
      acoustic signature displayed is from the plastic explosive,
      yielding a qualitative result and a unique signature.<br>
      <br>
      [0318] The power source is activated and a range of voltages is
      transmitted to the transducer. The electrical signal induces a
      mechanical strain in the transducer material causing an acoustical
      energy wave in a specific frequency range corresponding to the
      voltage that is delivered by the power source. This acoustic wave
      is transmitted through the plastic sample and received by the
      second transducer. The electrical output from the transducer is
      converted into a readable format by the spectrum analyzer. The
      resonant frequency and in turn the resonant acoustic signature can
      be determined by this method. By varying the voltage from the
      power source, the amplitude of the transmitted acoustic wave
      reacts to the different applied voltages. When the amplitude of
      the signal reaches a maximum, the plastic sample is in acoustic
      resonance and the frequency that induces this state substantially
      corresponds to the resonant frequency. At this point, the resonant
      acoustic and/or acousto-EM signature can be determined.<br>
      <br>
      [0319] Once the resonant acoustic signature of the plastic
      explosive is determined then a test can be conducted with several
      different types of plastic, some that contained the explosive and
      some that do not. Again each sample is placed in the same setup as
      explained above. The previously determined frequency range to
      induce acoustic resonance in the sample containing the explosive
      is administered by the power source using the corresponding
      voltage. The samples are individually tested and only the samples
      containing explosives reach maximum amplitude at the predetermined
      acoustic resonant frequency. Using this method a unique signature
      for a plastic that contains a certain type of explosive can be
      determined.<br>
      <br>
      [0320] Once the qualitative resonant acoustic signature has been
      determined it can be stored in a microprocessor or other memory
      storage device for subsequent comparative analysis in a
      recognition mode. Also once the qualitative resonant acoustic
      and/or acousto-EM energy signature has been determined,
      quantitative results may be determined by comparing the resonant
      acoustic signature amplitudes from samples of known concentration
      of the plastic explosives. Samples with higher concentrations of
      plastic explosives will have a higher resonant acoustic signature
      amplitudes. In turn, a ratio can be derived allowing for
      assessment of load in the sample of unknown concentration.<br>
      <br>
      [0321] Suitcases, packages and people can be scanned at an airport
      terminal to determine if a plastic explosive is being transported
      into the terminal or on a carrier. A suitcase can be placed
      between two transducers, one transducer generates the acoustic
      signal and sweeps through a wide band of target frequencies, and
      the other transducer detects the transmitted acoustic signal. The
      acoustic signal transmitted from the suitcase is fed into the
      positive lead of a signal analyzer. The known acoustic resonant
      signatures for leather, paper, fabric, plastics, and other
      materials that would normally be included in passengers' luggage
      or carry-on packages are fed into the negative lead of the signal
      analyzer. Thus the control signatures cancel out their component
      resonant frequencies in the positive lead sample. The remaining
      frequencies are analyzed for the acoustic resonant signature of
      the plastic explosive.<br>
      <br>
      [0322] In another embodiment, the electromagnetic energy pattern
      of the acousto-EM signature of a plastic explosive is transmitted
      to the suitcase. If an acoustic transducer detects an acoustic
      signal from within the suitcase which is indicating the material
      has been induced into acoustic resonance then detection is
      affirmed. The amplitude of the acoustic signal may provide
      additional information on the relative size or amount of explosive
      in the suitcase.<br>
      <br>
      [0323] In yet another embodiment the acousto-EM signature of a
      plastic explosive is transmitted to the suitcase. Both acoustic
      energy and acousto-EM properties of the contents within the
      suitcase are measured to detect and identify the plastic
      explosive.<br>

      The subject matter of each of the aforementioned Patent
      Applications is herein expressly incorporated by reference.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The physical structures of various materials (e. g. , organic,
      inorganic and/or biologic) are vital for determining, for example,
      physical properties (e. g. , functionality, size, physical
      properties, electrical properties, mechanical properties,
      dielectric properties, thermal properties, etc. ) of various
      materials (e. g. , solids, liquids, gasses and/or plasmas). In
      this regard, certain materials may have similar chemical
      compositions, but very different physical properties due to, for
      example: (1) different arrangements of ions, atoms, molecules
      and/or macromolecules of various sizes and/or shapes; (2)
      different bonding angles between atoms, ions, molecules and/or
      macromolecules; and/or (3) different types of bonds holding
      together ions, atoms, molecules and/or macromolecules, etc. The
      prior art refers generally to the formation and/or control of
      structures in the areas of biology, inorganic chemistry and/or
      organic chemistry as crystal growth, crystallization, crystal
      engineering and/or structural or phase engineering of materials.<br>
      <br>
      Crystal growth or crystallization begins with, for example,
      primary nucleation, followed by secondary nucleation. However, in
      crystal systems that do not appear to require primary nucleation
      (e. g. , some type of seed is typically provided) then only
      secondary nucleation may occur.<br>
      <br>
      There are numerous crystallization models postulated in the prior
      art which attempt to explain crystallization reactions in certain
      material systems. These models include: (1) the broken band model
      which focuses on the energy of dissociated atoms being
      proportional to the number of bonds between nearest neighbors; (2)
      the free energy model which focuses on the free energies
      associated with various structural configurations in lattices; (3)
      the step-step interactions which focus on dipole-dipole
      interactions; (4) Wulff's construction, which focuses on
      minimization of surface free energies to obtain crystalline
      shapes; (5) Frank's model which theorizes that the velocity of
      growth or dissolution depends on surface orientation; (6) the BCF
      (Burton, Cabrera, Frank) model which focuses on step flow or a
      series of growth stages occurring due to the presence of a series
      of steps or ledges; (7) the Schwoebel Effect which discusses
      adatoms overcoming a potential energy maximum prior to adhering;
      and (8) various other crystallization models which take into
      account, for example, impurities, electric field effects, liquid
      field theory and/or morphology, etc. None of the various proposed
      models or theories for crystal growth explain satisfactorily the
      relevant mechanisms of crystal growth. Accordingly, detailed
      control of crystal growth or crystallization in many different
      areas of science remains an empirical science with numerous trials
      and errors often occurring to achieve desirable crystalline growth
      or engineering and/or desirable phases, structures or phase
      transformations.<br>
      <br>
      It is well known that certain ions or atoms have an affinity for
      other atoms and/or ions, and thus, may be capable of bonding to
      each other by the well-known techniques of ionic bonding, covalent
      bonding, polar-covalent bonding, metallic bonding, hydrogen
      bonding, Van der Waal forces, etc., and/or hybrids or combinations
      of the same. The particular types of bonds which hold together
      atoms, ions, molecules and/or macromolecules, influence, for
      example, the positioning of ions, atoms, molecules and/or
      macromolecules, relative to each other (e. g. , including such
      factors as separation, distances, bond angles, coordination
      number, etc. ). Moreover, molecules (e. g. , combinations of
      atoms) can be bonded to other molecules or molecular ions (e. g. ,
      proteins composed of molecules of amino acids) and also exhibit
      various spacings and angular displacements relative to each other.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, there are certain materials that have mixtures of
      atoms and molecules, whereby the atoms and molecules are bonded
      together by more than one of the bonding techniques mentioned
      above, and are also thereby located at certain distances and
      angles with respect to each other. Further, there are numerous
      macromolecules (e. g. , viruses which are composed of different
      proteins, water, etc. ) that contain various structural and
      angular relationships between different molecules of the same (or
      substantially the same) chemical composition.<br>
      <br>
      One of the most basic structures that is used to refer
      structurally to arrangements of atoms, ions, molecules, etc. , is
      the unit cell. For example, the unit cells of seven (7) different
      crystal systems are shown in Figure 70. In particular, Figure 70a
      shows a cubic unit cell structure; Figure 70b shows a tetragonal
      unit cell structure; Figure 70c shows an orthorhombic unit cell
      structure; Figure 70d shows a monoclinic unit cell structure;
      Figure 70e shows a triclinic unit cell structure; Figure 70f shows
      a rhombohedral unit cell structure; and Figure 70g shows a
      hexagonal unit cell structure. Moreover, Table A shows
      relationships between the various unit cell dimensions and angles
      shown in Figure 70 as well as certain examples of certain
      inorganic materials which exhibit the aforementioned unit cell
      structures.<br>

      Various known inorganic, biologic and/or organic atoms, ions,
      molecules and/or macromolecules may adopt one or more of the unit
      cell arrangements shown in Figures 70a- 70g. There are various
      known rules and experimental determinations that assist in
      predicting the various unit cells and/or macrostructures which may
      result from combinations of various ions, atoms, molecules and/or
      macromolecules of similar or different chemical compositions.<br>
      <br>
      For example, with specific reference to inorganic systems,
      different types of bonds that can be used to bond species together
      include covalent bonding, ionic bonding, Van der Waals bonding,
      metallic bonding, etc. For example, in covalently bonded crystals,
      the covalency of the atom (s) or ion (s) and the characteristics
      of the spatial distribution of the bonds in which the atoms form
      are the primary factors for determining the coordination or
      bonding or the particular assembly of atoms or ions in a
      structure.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast, electrostatic bonding or ionic bonding is governed by
      several different rules. Specifically: (1) The first rule, as an
      approximation, treats ions as rigid spheres and the way in which
      the spherical ions are packed together is determined by the
      relative sizes of the ions.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, a coordinated polyhedron of anions is formed around
      each cation, the cation- anion distance being determined by the
      radius sum and the coordination number of the cation by the radius
      ratio.<br>
      <br>
      (2) The second rule is known as the electrostatic valency
      principle. This rule causes a charge balancing to occur. In
      particular, in a stable coordinated structure, the total strength
      of the valency bonds which reach an anion from all neighboring
      cations is equal to the charge of the anion. This rule causes
      structures to assume configurations of minimum potential energies
      in which the ions try to achieve electrical neutrality in their
      locality (e. g. , in their unit cells).<br>
      <br>
      (3) The third rule references the existence of edges and faces
      which may be common to two anion polyhedra in a coordinated
      structure. In particular, stabilities of polyhedra are decreased
      by the existence of edges and faces. This effect can be large for
      cations with high valency and small coordination numbers, and can
      be especially large when the radius ratio approaches the lower
      limit of stability of the polyhedron. This rule is due to the fact
      that an edge, or a face, which is common to two anion and
      polyhedra, will result in the close approach of two cations, and a
      corresponding increase in the potential energy of the system as
      compared with a state in which only corners are shared and thus,
      the cations are spaced apart as far as possible.<br>
      <br>
      (4) The fourth rule is that in crystals containing different
      cations, those of high valency and small coordination number
      typically do not share polyhedron elements with each other. This
      rule follows the third rule stated above.<br>
      <br>
      (5) The final general rule is that the number of different kinds
      of constituents in a crystal tends to be small in number.<br>
      <br>
      The five aforementioned general rules also have certain
      applicability in organic and biologic systems, but have been
      specifically referenced with regard to inorganic systems to
      simplify the discussion thereof.<br>
      <br>
      By following each of the aforementioned rules, different
      crystalline structures (or phases or patterns) may be obtainable
      in similar (or exactly the same) chemical systems. This aspect of
      obtaining different crystalline structures but having the same (or
      substantially the same) chemical structure is known as
      polymorphism. A substance is typically referred to as being
      polymorphous when it is capable of existing in two or more forms
      having different crystalline structures or patterns. Examples of
      well-known polymorphs include, carbon, selenium, quartz (SiO2),
      certain metals, barium titanate, zinc sulfide, ferric oxide,
      silica, proteins, prions, lipids, hydrocarbons, glycine, etc. In
      certain polymorphs, a first crystalline form can be found under a
      first set of physical conditions and a reversible transition may
      exist between different forms, said reversible transition being
      capable of occurring by, for example, one or more changes in
      certain of the physical conditions (e. g. , environmental
      conditions to which the polymorphs are exposed) or by introduction
      of a catalyst. These types of materials are said to be
      enantiotropic. When transitions between crystalline forms or
      states is irreversible, the forms are said to be monotropic. An
      example of an enantiomer is iron which has a cubic packed
      structure between the temperatures of about 906 C-1401 C, and a
      cubic body-centered structure with temperatures outside this
      range. Water also exhibits different structural forms (e. g. ,
      microclusters, macroclusters, etc. ) and there are at least 13
      different crystalline H20 structures that are known to exist in
      relatively modest pressure and temperature regimes. A third
      example are certain proteins, which when exposed to a polymorphic
      prion, change structure to match that of the prion via an
      autocatlytic transition.<br>
      <br>
      There are various rules that assist in identifying relationships
      that exist between polymorphous forms of different substances.
      Specifically, the prior art has attempted to classify polymorphic
      changes into the following areas. For example, the recognized
      polymorphs that exist include one or more of the following
      relationships: (1) changes in which the immediate coordination
      number of the ions/atoms is not significantly altered; (2) changes
      in which a change in immediate coordination occurs;<br>
      <br>
      (3) changes involving a transition between an ideal structure and
      a defect structure; and (4) changes in which a change in bond-type
      occurs.<br>
      <br>
      Each of the four (4) aforementioned polymorph relationships may be
      mutually exclusive, or may contain features of the other. However,
      it should be understood that various different configurations,
      such as unit cell, protein folding, or DNA twisting, exist for a
      large number of materials of substantially similar composition or
      compositions which are substantially identical.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the unit cells shown in Figures 70a-70g, there are
      different lattices available for use in combination with the unit
      cells. In particular, a lattice is known as an array of equivalent
      points in one, two, or more typically, three dimensions. Lattices
      typically do not provide any information regarding the actual
      positions of atoms or molecules in any particular spatial
      relationship, but show the various translational symmetries of the
      various atoms, ions or molecules by locating equivalent positions
      within the lattice. The environment of any atom or ion placed on
      one of the lattice points will be identical to the environment of
      a similar atom or ion placed on a corresponding different lattice
      point. The simplest illustration of this concept is a
      one-dimensional lattice consisting of an infinite series of
      equally spaced points along a line (see, for example, Figure 71).
      However, the more realistic uses of lattices occurs in
      three-dimensional crystal structures. The simplest lattice type is
      known as a primitive (represented by the symbol"P"), and a unit
      cell with a primitive lattice contains a single lattice point.<br>
      <br>
      A second lattice-type is body-centered (represented by the
      symbol"I"). Figure 72 shows a body-centered cubic structure.<br>
      <br>
      A lattice which has lattice points at the center of all unit faces
      as well as at the corners is known as a face-centered lattice and
      is represented by the symbol"F". This lattice is shown in Figure
      73.<br>
      <br>
      A final lattice which contains points in just one of the faces is
      known as face-centered, but can be given any one of the
      symbols"A","B"or"C". A"C-type"lattice refers to the situation
      where additional translational symmetry places lattice points at
      the centers of the faces; whereas the A and B face-centered
      lattices are obtained in an identical manner but the additional
      lattice points occur in different planes. An example of a
      face-centered lattice is given in Figure 74. It is noted that
      the"A"and"B"face-centered lattices are obtained in<br>
      <br>
      identical manner but the additional lattice points in the bc and
      ac planes respectively are obtained. Accordingly, face-centered
      cubic lattice structures are typically referred to by the
      letter"C".<br>
      <br>
      The four different lattice types discussed above (i. e. , P, I, F
      and C) can be combined with the seven unit cell or crystal classes
      which gives rise to all possible variations. All the possible
      variations are known as the"Bravais"lattices. In particular, for
      example, in inorganic systems, the seven different crystal systems
      match up with particular Bravais lattices. Table B shows the 14
      Bravais lattices that are possible.<br>

      <br>
      A variety of techniques exist for achieving crystal growth or
      structure in organic, inorganic, biologic, etc. , systems. For
      example: (1) the high vacuum techniques of molecular beam epitaxy
      and atomic layer epitaxy cause atoms or molecules to be projected
      onto a surface of a substrate where the atoms or molecules become
      incorporated thereon (e. g., adatoms); (2) growth from solutions
      (e. g. , epitaxial growth); (3) vapor phase growth onto one or
      more substrates or seed crystals; (4) growth from a liquid metal;
      (5) growth from a solution (e. g. , aqueous, molten salts or other
      solvents); (6) growth from a saturated or supersaturated solution
      (e. g. , aqueous, or other solvents); (7) growth from a melt, also
      known as solidification; (8) precipitation growth; (9) growth
      under high pressure conditions (e. g., hydrothermal) ; (10)
      chemical vapor transport reaction growth; (11) growth through
      electrochemical reactions (e. g. , electrocrystallization); (12)
      growth from the solid phase (e. g. , strain annealing); (13)
      acoustocrystallization techniques; (14) biologic techniques (e.
      g., sitting drop, hanging drop, containerless, etc. ) ; and (15)
      numerous post-growth treatments that affect already formed
      structures (e. g. , annealing, heat treatment, laser treatment,
      etching processes (e. g. , chemical, thermal, etc. ), etc. ).
      Phase-diagrams are often employed to assist in<br>
      understanding what potential crystalline phases or structures can
      be achieved by these various crystal growth, crystallization or
      ordering techniques and post-growth treatment techniques.<br>
      <br>
      Much experimental and empirical work has been performed to
      determine systems and/or phases which various atoms, ions,
      molecules and/or macromolecules assemble into.<br>
      <br>
      For example, thousands and thousands of phase diagrams exist
      describing various organic, biologic and/or inorganic systems.
      Phase diagrams show equilibrium conditions for systems and
      exhibit, typically, the lowest known free energy states for
      composition, temperature, pressure and/or other conditions imposed
      upon the system. In particular, the traditional belief is that
      under a given set of fixed parameters, there will be only one
      mixture of phases that can be present. Phase-equilibrium diagrams
      provide a precise method of graphically representing equilibrium
      situations and are important for characterizing various organic,
      inorganic and/or biologic systems. The phase-equilibrium diagrams
      record the composition of each phase present, the number of phases
      present and the amounts of each phase, at equilibrium. It is noted
      that equilibrium conditions are rarely achieved in most systems.
      However, even though non-equilibrium conditions (e. g. ,
      metastable equilibrium conditions) typically prevail in real-life
      systems, phase-diagrams are still important to practitioners in
      each of their respective fields to assist in determining what
      phases may be present, influenced, and/or controlled, etc. , in
      various crystallization systems.<br>
      <br>
      Phase-diagrams are regularly utilized to determine phase and
      composition changes occurring under varying environmental
      conditions. For example, changes in environmental gasses present
      in a system, changes in partial pressures of environmental gasses,
      changes in temperature, changes in pressure, changes in
      composition, etc. , are all known factors that are capable of
      influencing the resultant product (e. g. , crystalline or
      structural species present) in any given crystallization reaction
      system.<br>
      <br>
      There are numerous phase-diagrams for each of the aforementioned
      systems including, for example, one-component phase diagrams,
      two-component phase diagrams, three-component phase diagrams, etc.
      A good example of a single component, single-solid phase system is
      sodium chloride. In particular, Figure 75 shows the relationship
      between temperature and pressure for the ionically bonded material
      known as NaCl. In addition, Figures 76a and 76b shown clinographic
      projections of the unit cell of the cubic structure for sodium
      chloride. Figure 77 shows a clinographic projection of the cubic
      unit cell structure of<br>
      sodium chloride, where the ions are shown in approximately correct
      relative sizes. The solid circles represent the sodium ions,
      whereas the hollow circles represent the chlorine ions.<br>
      <br>
      Phase-diagrams can be interpreted by the phase rule (known as the
      Gibbs Phase Rule) which is shown in the following relationship for
      a single component system: P + V = C + 2.<br>
      <br>
      The phase rule listed above uses P for the number of phases
      present in equilibrium, V for the variance or number of degrees of
      freedom and C for the number of components. This phase rule
      relationship is the basis for preparing and utilizing
      phase-equilibrium diagrams.<br>
      <br>
      For example, Figure 78 shows a perspective view of a simple binary
      phase-diagram. This two-component system adds an additional
      variable of composition to the phase rule. Thus, application of
      the phase rule is as follows: for the point"A"one phase is present
      and both temperature and composition can be arbitrarily varied.
      However, in areas in which two phases are present at equilibrium,
      the composition of each phase is indicated by lines on the
      diagram. The intersection of a constant-temperature line with
      phase boundaries gives the compositions of the phases in
      equilibrium at temperature"T". Thus, with two phases present, the
      following phase rule relationship exists:<br>
      P+V=C+2,2+V=2+2, V=2.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, at an arbitrarily fixed pressure, any arbitrary change in
      either temperature or composition of one of the phases present
      requires a corresponding change in the other variable.
      Accordingly, the maximum number of phases that can be present
      where pressure is arbitrarily fixed (i. e. , where V = 1) is as
      follows: P+V=C+2, P+1=2+2, P=3.<br>
      <br>
      The solid horizontal line indicated by the letter C in Figure 78,
      represents a situation where three phases are present and the
      composition of each phase and the temperature are fixed.
      Accordingly, phase-diagrams can be utilized to determine what
      phases are present, what conditions can result in certain phases
      being present and the compositions of certain phases.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, defect crystallization pathways exist in each
      crystallization reaction system, and the precise crystalline
      pathway that is chosen is a function of many factors known to the
      art. For example, a representative ternary phase diagram is shown
      in Figure 86a (which is representative of a ternary eutectic) and
      in Figure 86b (which is representative of a ternary solid
      solution). Further, Figure 86c shows one precise crystallization
      pathway<br>
      followed by the composition"A"shown in Figure 86a. A brief
      description of the crystallization pathway is as follows: a liquid
      having a composition A falls into a first primary field of
      component"X". As the temperature in the ternary liquid is
      decreased to Tl, a solid having a composition"X"begins to
      crystallize from the melt. The composition of the remaining liquid
      changes along the line AB due to some of the solid"X"crystallizing
      out therefrom. A concept known as the"lever principle" (i. e. , a
      concept for determining relative amounts and compositions of
      materials which crystallize from a melt) applies along the line
      AB. Further, as cooling continues and the temperature reaches T2,
      the crystallization pathway reaches a boundary condition
      representing the equilibrium between the composition of the
      remaining liquid and the two solid phases"X"and"Z". At this point,
      "Z"begins to crystallize as well as"X"and the remaining liquid
      changes in composition along the path CD. However, at the
      point"L"the phases that exist in equilibrium comprise a liquid
      having a composition"L", and the solids"X"and"Z", whereas the
      overall composition of the entire system is"A". Cooling continues
      until a ternary eutectic occurs at TE at the point D. At the point
      D, composition"Y"is also capable of crystallizing.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, various crystalline species are capable of
      crystallizing from, for example, the solidification of one or more
      species from a melt, whether the melt is under equilibrium or
      non-equilibrium conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Another example of a phase diagram is contained in Figure 79,
      which shows an example of a solubility curve. This general
      solubility curve is for a solid that forms a hydrate (i. e. , one
      or more compounds that has one or more water molecules attached to
      it) as a system is cooled. For example, Figure 79 could be any
      solid that forms hydrates such as, for example, Na2S203. The
      number of hydrate molecules shown in Figure 79 is arbitrary and
      will vary for each substance.<br>
      <br>
      Further, Figure 79a shows several solubility curves for different
      solutes in water.<br>
      <br>
      Most of these materials show increased solubility as a function of
      temperature. Sodium chloride is one of those solutes that shows a
      gradually increasing solubility in water as a function of
      increasing temperature. Specifically, for example, the solubility
      plot for NaCl shows that a saturated solution of NaCl at 20 C,
      will comprise about 36 grams of NaCl dissolved in 100 grams of
      water.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, it should be apparent that the various bonding
      mechanisms for bonding together ions, atoms, molecules,
      macromolecules, etc. , result in various possibilities for<br>
      crystalline and structural configurations (e. g. , the different
      unit cells shown in Figure 70 and the different Bravais lattices
      shown in Figure 72-74). While much work has been done to
      categorize different chemical configurations and/or structures, as
      well as many theories or explanations being set forth in an
      attempt to explain the mechanisms of crystallization, including
      the initiation of crystallization as well as secondary nucleation
      or growth, much remains unknown regarding the ability to control
      various crystalline structures within, for example, one or more
      given species. However, it is clear that various reactions,
      including various bonding and chemical reactions, are important in
      determining certain crystalline structures.<br>
      <br>
      In this regard, chemical reactions are driven by energy. The
      energy comes in many different forms including chemical, thermal,
      mechanical, acoustic, and electromagnetic.<br>
      <br>
      Various features of each type of energy are thought to contribute
      in different ways to the driving of chemical reactions.
      Irrespective of the type of energy involved, chemical reactions
      are undeniably and inextricably intertwined with the transfer and
      combination of energy. An understanding of energy is, therefore,
      vital to an understanding of chemical reactions and hence, certain
      structural transformations.<br>
      <br>
      A chemical reaction can be controlled and/or directed either by
      the addition of energy to the reaction medium in the form of
      thermal, mechanical, acoustic and/or electromagnetic energy or by
      means of transferring energy through a physical catalyst. These
      methods are traditionally not that energy efficient and can
      produce, for example, either unwanted by- products, decomposition
      of required transients, and/or intermediates and/or activated
      complexes and/or insufficient quantities of preferred products of
      a reaction.<br>
      <br>
      It has been generally believed that chemical reactions occur as a
      result of collisions between reacting molecules. In terms of the
      collision theory of chemical kinetics, it has been expected that
      the rate of a reaction is directly proportional to the number of
      the molecular collisions per second: rate a number of
      collisions/sec<br>
      This simple relationship has been used to explain the dependence
      of reaction rates on concentration. Additionally, with few
      exceptions, reaction rates have been believed to increase with
      increasing temperature because of increased collisions.<br>
      <br>
      The dependence of the rate constant k of a reaction can be
      expressed by the following equation, known as the Arrhenius
      equation:<br>
      k= Ae-Ea/RT where Ea is the activation energy of the reaction
      which is the minimum amount of energy required to initiate a
      chemical reaction, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute
      temperature and e is the base of the natural logarithm scale. The
      quantity A represents the collision rate and shows that the rate
      constant is directly proportional to A and, therefore, to the
      collision rate. Furthermore, because of the minus sign associated
      with the exponent Ea/RT, the rate constant decreases with
      increasing activation energy and increases with increasing
      temperature.<br>
      <br>
      Normally, only a small fraction of the colliding molecules,
      typically the fastest- moving ones, have enough kinetic energy to
      exceed the activation energy, therefore, the increase in the rate
      constant k has been explained with the temperature increase. Since
      more high-energy molecules are present at a higher temperature,
      the rate of product formation is also greater at the higher
      temperature. But, with increased temperatures there are a number
      of problems which can be introduced into the reaction system. With
      thermal excitation other competing processes, such as bond
      rupture, may occur before the desired energy state can be reached.
      Also, there are a number of decomposition products which often
      produce fragments that are extremely reactive, but they can be so
      short-lived because of their thermodynamic instability, that a
      preferred reaction may be dampened.<br>
      <br>
      Radiant or light energy is another form of energy that may be
      added to the reaction medium that also may have negative side
      effects but which may be different from (or the same as) those
      side effects from thermal energy. Addition of radiant energy to a
      system produces electronically excited molecules that are capable
      of undergoing chemical reactions.<br>
      <br>
      A molecule in which all the electrons are in stable orbitals is
      said to be in the ground electronic state. These orbitals may be
      either bonding or non-bonding. If a photon of the proper energy
      collides with the molecule the photon may be absorbed and one of
      the electrons may be promoted to an unoccupied orbital of higher
      energy. Electronic excitation results in spatial redistribution of
      the valence electrons with concomitant changes in internuclear
      configurations. Since chemical reactions and bonding are
      controlled to a great extent by these factors, an electronically
      excited molecule undergoes a chemical reaction or bond
      transformation that may be distinctly different from those of its
      ground-state counterpart.<br>
      <br>
      The energy of a photon is defined in terms of its frequency or
      wavelength,<br>
      <br>
      E = hv = hc/k where E is energy; h is Plank's constant, 6.6 x
      10-34 J sec ; v is the frequency of the radiation, sec'' ; c is
      the speed of light; and X is the wavelength of the radiation. When
      a photon is absorbed, all of its energy is typically imparted to
      the absorbing species. The primary act following absorption
      depends on the wavelength of the incident light. Photochemistry
      studies photons whose energies lie in the ultraviolet region (e.
      g., 100A-4000 A) and in the visible region (e. g., 4000A-7000A) of
      the electromagnetic spectrum. Such photons are primarily a cause
      of electronically excited molecules.<br>
      <br>
      Since the molecules are imbued with electronic energy upon
      absorption of light, reactions and structural transformations
      occur from different potential-energy surfaces from those
      encountered in thermally excited systems. However, there are
      several drawbacks of using the known techniques of photochemistry,
      that being, utilizing a broad band of frequencies thereby causing
      unwanted side reactions, undue experimentation, and poor quantum
      yield. The area of photocrystallization is still in its infancy
      and the known techniques are trial and error, empirical
      approaches, with no cohesive or comprehensive understanding of the
      underlying mechanisms. Some good examples of photochemistry are
      shown in the following patents.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, U. S. Patent No. 5,174, 877 issued to Cooper, et
      al. al., (1992) discloses an apparatus for the photocatalytic
      treatment of liquids. In particular, it is disclosed that
      ultraviolet light irradiates the surface of a prepared slurry to
      activate the photocatalytic properties of the particles contained
      in the slurry. The transparency of the slurry affects, for
      example, absorption of radiation. Moreover, discussions of
      different frequencies suitable for achieving desirable
      photocatalytic activity are disclosed.<br>
      <br>
      Further, U. S. Patent No. 4,755, 269 issued to Brumer, et al. al.
      , (1998) discloses a photodisassociation process for
      disassociating various molecules in a known energy level. In
      particular, it is disclosed that different disassociation pathways
      are possible and the different pathways can be followed due to
      selecting different frequencies of certain electromagnetic
      radiation. It is further disclosed that the amplitude of
      electromagnetic radiation applied corresponds to amounts of
      product produced.<br>
      <br>
      Selective excitation of different species is shown in the
      following three (3) patents.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, U. S. Patent No. 4,012, 301 to Rich, et al. al. ,
      (1977) discloses vapor phase chemical reactions that are
      selectively excited by using vibrational modes corresponding to<br>
      the continuously flowing reactant species. Particularly, a
      continuous wave laser emits radiation that is absorbed by the
      vibrational mode of the reactant species.<br>
      <br>
      U. S. Patent No. 5,215, 634 issued to Wan, et al. , (1993)
      discloses a process of selectively converting methane to a desired
      oxygenate. In particular, methane is irradiated in the presence of
      a catalyst with pulsed microwave radiation to convert reactants to
      desirable products. The physical catalyst disclosed comprises
      nickel and the microwave radiation is applied in the range of
      about 1.5 to 3.0 GHz.<br>
      <br>
      U. S. Patent No. 5,015, 349 issued to Suib, et al. al. , (1991)
      discloses a method for cracking a hydrocarbon to create cracked
      reaction products. It is disclosed that a stream of hydrocarbon is
      exposed to a microwave energy which creates a low power density
      microwave discharge plasma, wherein the microwave energy is
      adjusted to achieve desired results. A particular frequency
      desired of microwave energy is disclosed as being 2.45 GHz.<br>
      <br>
      The art contains numerous well known crystallization and structure
      formations or modifications techniques (e. g. , single crystal,
      polycrystalline, amorphous, etc. ) as well as numerous well known
      post-processing techniques (e. g. , annealing, chemical etching,
      laser etching, temperature conditioning, pressure conditioning,
      atmospheric conditioning, etc.) which also affect structure. The
      prior art techniques largely contain empirical results from many
      trial and error approaches that, in most cases, are not well
      understood at a basic level.<br>
      <br>
      Physical catalysts are also well known in the art but the role
      that physical catalysts play in various reactions is also not well
      understood at a basic level. Specifically, a physical catalyst is
      typically regarded as a substance which alters the reaction rate
      of a chemical reaction without appearing in the end product. It is
      known that some reactions can be speeded up or controlled by the
      presence of substances which themselves appear to remain unchanged
      after the reaction has ended. By increasing the velocity of a
      desired reaction relative to unwanted reactions, the formation of
      a desired product can be maximized compared with unwanted
      by-products. Often only a trace of physical catalyst is necessary
      to accelerate the reaction. Also, it has been observed that some
      substances, which if added in trace amounts, can slow down the
      rate of a reaction. This looks like the reverse of catalysis, and,
      in fact, substances which slow down a reaction rate have been
      called negative catalysts or poisons.<br>
      <br>
      Known physical catalysts go through a cycle in which they are used
      and regenerated so that they can be used again and again. A
      physical catalyst operates by providing another path for the
      reaction which can have a higher reaction rate or slower rate than
      available in the absence<br>
      <br>
      of the physical catalyst. At the end of the reaction, because the
      physical catalyst can be recovered, it appears the physical
      catalyst is not involved in the reaction. But, the physical
      catalyst must somehow take part in the reaction, or else the rate
      of the reaction would not change. The catalytic act has
      historically been represented by five essential steps originally
      postulated by Ostwald around the late 1800's:<br>
      1. Diffusion to the catalytic site (reactant);<br>
      2. Bond formation at the catalytic site (reactant);<br>
      3. Reaction of the catalyst-reactant complex;<br>
      4. Bond rupture at the catalytic site (product); and<br>
      5. Diffusion away from the catalytic site (product).<br>
      <br>
      The exact mechanisms of catalytic actions are unknown in the art
      but it is known that physical catalysts can speed up a reaction
      that otherwise would take place too slowly to be practical.<br>
      <br>
      A well known category of catalysts are the autocatalysts. In
      autocatalysis, the product of a reaction functions as a catalyst,
      speeding the rate of formation of more product. In autocatalytic
      reactions, it is clear that the catalyst does take part in the
      reaction. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms of autocatalytic
      actions are also largely unknown in the art.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, what is needed is a better understanding of the
      crystal growth, crystallization, structural and/or phase change
      processes and mechanisms so that biological, organic, and/or
      inorganic processes and materials, etc. , can be engineered by
      more precisely controlling the multitude of reaction processes
      that exist, as well as developing completely new reaction pathways
      and/or new and/or desirable reaction products (e. g. , crystalline
      phases or species).<br>

      cathode in an electrolytic cell, where the cations of the
      electrolyte becomes the positive ions of the metal to be coated on

      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention, discloses a variety of novel spectral
      energy techniques, referred to sometimes herein as spectral
      crystallization, that can be utilized in a number of
      crystallization reactions in organic, biologic and/or inorganic
      systems, including very basic reactions, which may be desirable to
      achieve or to permit to occur (or to prevent) in the various
      crystallization reaction systems. These spectral energy techniques
      can be used in, for example, all known crystal growth or
      crystallization techniques including, but not limited to,
      evaporation, vapor diffusion, liquid diffusion, thermal gradients,
      gel diffusion, high vacuum techniques of molecular beam epitaxy,
      atomic layer epitaxy, epitaxial growth from solutions, growth from
      a liquid metal, growth from a solution (e. g. , aqueous, molten
      salt or other solvent), growth from super saturated solutions,
      growth from a melt, precipitation growth, hydrothermal growth,
      chemical vapor transport reaction growth, electrocrystallization,
      growth from a solid phase, acoustocrystallization, co-crystals and
      clath rates, etc. In addition, the techniques of the present
      invention can be used to obtain virtually all types of
      crystallization by all known crystallization or crystal growth
      techniques including the use of defects, if desirable, or
      eliminating defects, if desirable. Further, the techniques of the
      present invention can be utilized to obtain desirable phase or
      structure changes in certain crystals (single or polycrystalline)
      that have already been formed and/or to cause certain<br>
      <br>
      grown crystals to behave as though certain phase changes have
      occurred. Examples include such post-treatment processes as
      annealing processes, etching processes (e. g. , thermal or
      chemical), chemical treatments (e. g. , solid, liquid, gas and/or
      plasma), etc. Further, the techniques of the present invention can
      be utilized to obtain desired structures in certain materials.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the invention discloses a variety of novel spectral
      energy conditioning techniques, referred to sometimes herein as
      spectral conditioning, or conditioning energies that can be
      utilized to condition a conditionable participant. Once a
      conditionable participant has been conditioned, the conditioned
      participant can be used in a crystallization reaction system.
      These spectral energy conditioning techniques can be used to
      condition at least one conditionable participant which can
      thereafter be used in, for example, any type of organic or
      inorganic crystallization system, biological crystallization
      reaction system (e. g. , plant and animal), industrial
      crystallization reaction system, etc. Further, the conditioned
      participant may itself comprise both a reactant and a reaction
      product, whereby, for example, the chemical composition of the
      conditioned participant does not substantially change (if at all)
      but one or more energy dynamics, physical properties or structures
      and/or phases is changed once the conditioned participant is
      involved with, and/or activated by, the crystallization reaction
      system.<br>
      <br>
      The techniques of the present invention have utility for growing
      crystals (or preventing growth of crystals in certain
      crystallization reaction systems) that exhibit only a single
      crystalline species, and mixed crystals, as well as for growing
      crystals that exhibit at least two crystalline species, as well as
      for those systems that are polymorphic (i. e. , where more than
      one crystalline phase exists for a single chemical formula). For
      example, the techniques of the present invention can be utilized
      to assist in the primary nucleation of crystals, the secondary
      nucleation of crystals, controlling particular compositions formed
      during crystallization, controlling particular phases formed
      during crystallization, causing crystals and/or phases to result
      (or preventing certain phases from forming) that do not normally
      result under a given set of environmental conditions, causing a
      formed crystal phase to change which may result in the crystal
      behaving as though the phase had changed, causing primary or
      secondary nucleation of a first material or crystalline species
      and subsequent primary nucleation and/or secondary nucleation of a
      second composition and/or crystalline species; epitaxial growth of
      similar or dissimilar materials on a substrate, preferential or<br>
      <br>
      selective crystallization of a particular species from a mixed
      species source, etc. The techniques of the present invention can
      be used for all known crystal growth or crystallization techniques
      whereby the techniques of the invention augment existing
      techniques (e. g. , use of a seed crystal is augmented by at least
      one spectral energy provider and/or at least one spectral energy
      conditioning provider) or substantially completely replace certain
      aspects of growth (e. g. , a seed crystal can be replaced
      completely by a spectral energy provider and/or a spectral energy
      conditioning provider). Moreover, the techniques of the present
      invention can prevent the formation of certain crystals or
      structures or cause, for example, one or more amorphous phases or
      structures to result when one or more crystallized species or
      structures would normally result or vice versa.<br>
      <br>
      These novel spectral energy techniques (now referred to as
      spectral crystallization) and novel spectral energy conditioning
      techniques (now referred to as spectral conditioning
      crystallization) are possible to achieve due to the fundamental
      discoveries contained herein that disclose various means for
      achieving the transfer of energy (or preventing the transfer of
      energy) and/or controlling the energy dynamics and/or controlling
      the resonant exchange of energy between, for example, two
      entities. The invention teaches that the key for transferring
      energy between two entities (e. g. , one entity sharing energy
      with another entity) is that when frequencies match, energy
      transfers. For example: (1) matching of frequencies of spectral
      energy patterns of two different forms of matter or matching of
      frequencies of a spectral energy pattern of matter with energy in
      the form of a spectral energy catalyst; and/or (2) matching of
      frequencies of spectral conditioning energy patterns of two
      different forms of matter or matching of frequencies of a spectral
      energy pattern of matter with energy in the form of a spectral
      conditioning catalyst. In the case of achieving the transfer of
      energy between, for example, a spectral energy conditioning
      pattern and a conditionable participant, once conditioning energy
      has been transferred, the conditioned participant can thereafter
      favorably utilize its conditioned energy pattern in a
      crystallization reaction system. The aforementioned entities may
      both be comprised of matter (solids, liquids, gases and/or plasmas
      and/or mixtures and/or components thereof), both comprised of
      various form (s) of energy, or one comprised of various form (s)
      of energy and the other comprised of matter (solids, liquids,
      gases and/or plasmas and/or mixtures and/or components thereof).<br>

      More specifically, all matter can be represented by spectral
      energy patterns, which can be quite simple to very complex in
      appearance, depending on, for example, the complexity of<br>
      the matter. One example of a spectral energy pattern is a spectral
      pattern (or a spectral conditioning pattern) which likewise can be
      quite simple to quite complex in appearance, depending on, for
      example, the complexity of the matter. In the case of matter
      represented by spectral patterns (or spectral conditioning
      patterns), matter can exchange energy with other matter if, for
      example, the spectral patterns of the two forms of matter match,
      at least partially, or can be made to match or overlap, at least
      partially (e. g. , spectral curves or spectral patterns (or
      spectral conditioning patterns) comprising one or more
      electromagnetic frequencies may overlap with each other). In
      general, but not in all cases, the greater the overlap in spectral
      patterns (and thus, the greater the overlap of frequencies
      comprising the spectral patterns or spectral conditioning
      patterns), the greater the amount of energy transferred. Likewise,
      for example, if the spectral pattern (or spectral conditioning
      pattern) of at least one form of energy can be caused to match or
      overlap, at least partially, with the spectral pattern of matter,
      (e. g. , a participant or a conditionable participant) energy will
      also transfer to the matter. Thus, energy can be transferred to
      matter by causing frequencies to match.<br>
      <br>
      As discussed elsewhere herein, energy (E), frequency (v) and
      wavelength (,) and the speed of light (c) in a vacuum are
      interrelated through, for example, the following equation:<br>
      E = lav = lacl, When a frequency or set of frequencies
      corresponding to at least a first form of matter can be caused to
      match with a frequency or set of frequencies corresponding to at
      least a second form of matter, energy can transfer between the
      different forms of matter and permit at least some interaction
      and/or reaction to occur involving at least one of the two
      different forms of matter. For example, solid, liquid, gas and/or
      plasma (and/or mixtures and/or portions thereof) forms of matter
      can interact and/or react and form a desirable reaction product or
      result. Any combination (s) of the above forms of matter (e. g.,
      solid/solid, solid/liquid, solid/gas, solid/plasma,
      solid/gas/plasma, solid/liquid/gas, etc. , and/or mixtures and/or
      portions thereof) are possible to achieve for desirable
      interactions and/or reactions to occur in various crystallization
      reaction systems in biologic, organic and/or inorganic systems.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, for example, the present invention has
      applicability in the following exemplary systems: (1)
      graphite/diamond; (2) the phases associated with Si02 ; (3) the
      phases associated with BaTiO3, (4) the phases of water/ice; (5)
      the solubility of materials in solvents (e. g. , solutes in
      water); (6) the phases in the binary system MgO/SiO2 ; (7) the
      phases in the<br>
      FeO/Fe203 system; (8) the phases in a hydrate system; (9) the
      phases in polymers; (10) the phases in lipids; and (11) the phases
      in proteins. Specific experimental examples of various exemplary
      crystallization reaction systems are contained in
      the"Examples"section later herein, while the following exemplary
      systems give a general understanding of the applicability of the
      techniques of the present invention.<br>

      Figures 80a, 80b and 80c relate to the various phases for carbon,
      including graphite and diamond. A phase-diagram for carbon phases
      is shown in Figure 80a. This phase- diagram shows that graphite is
      the predominate phase present at lower pressures and lower
      temperatures but that a transition to diamond occurs at higher
      temperatures and/or higher pressures. The clinographic projection
      of the hexagonal structure of diamond is shown in Figure 80b;
      whereas the clinographic projection of the unit cell of the cubic
      structure of diamond is shown in Figure 80c. The techniques of the
      present invention can be utilized to assist in phase
      transformations in this system and systems like this system.<br>
      <br>
      Figures 8 la and 81b show two phase-diagrams for the Si02 system.
      In particular, Figure 81a shows the equilibrium diagram for Si02
      whereas Figure 81b shows metastable phases that also occur in the
      Si02 system. Figure 81c shows a clinographic projection of the
      unit cell of an idealized cubic p-crystobalite structure. Figure
      81 d shows a plan view of a rhombohedral structure of a-quartz
      projected on a plane perpendicular to the principal axis.<br>

      Figure 81 e shows a plan view of the hexagonal structure of
      (3-quartz projected on a plan view taken perpendicular to the
      z-axis. The techniques of the present invention can assist in
      controlling the presence of one or more phases in the Si02 system
      and systems like this system.<br>

      Figure 82a shows the phase diagram for the system Ba2TiO4/TiO2. Of
      particular interest in this phase diagram is the formation of
      barium titanate (BaTi03). Figure 82b shows a clinographic
      projection of the unit cell of an idealized cubic structure of
      BaTiO3. In addition, Figure 82c shows cation displacements
      relative to an oxide sub-lattice in tetragonal BaTiO3. Moreover,

      The techniques of the present invention can be utilized to control
      various phases in the barium titanate crystallographic system and
      systems like this system.<br>
      <br>
      The various phase diagrams (e. g. , showing temperature and
      pressure relationships) for water are shown in Figures 83a, 83b
      and 83c, with Figure 83c being the more common phase diagram for
      water. In addition, Figure 83d shows a clinographic projection of
      the hexagonal structure of ice. In general, there are three
      recognized forms of water under the temperature/pressure
      conditions shown in the aforementioned Figure between which a
      somewhat continuous transition with temperature occurs.
      Specifically, a first structure of water is ice-like and is stable
      below about 4 C ; a second phase is a quartz-like structure of
      water which is stable between about 4 C and about 150 C under the
      shown pressure conditions; and a third phase of water is a
      close-packed array which is stable above about 150 C under the
      shown pressure conditions. However, water may be regarded as one
      of the most complex structures known to man. In particular,
      numerous sub-phases exist within the three general phases
      discussed above. The sub-phases may coincide with various
      micro-and macro-molecular clusters. Further, there are at least 13
      recognized phases of water as a function of modest temperatures
      and pressures. The techniques of the present invention can be
      utilized to affect the behavior of water (e. g. , solute/solvent
      relationships can be affected by the techniques of the present
      invention).<br>
      <br>
      A binary phase diagram for the system MgO-SiO2 is shown in Figure
      84a. A corresponding plan view of an idealized orthorhombic
      structure of forsterite (i. e., Mg2SiO4) is shown in Figure 84b on
      a plane which is perpendicular to the x-axis. The techniques of
      the present invention can be utilized to control various phases in
      the MgO-SiO2 system.<br>
      <br>
      The system FeO/Fe203 is shown in phase-diagram form in Figure 85a.
      A clinographic projection of four unit cells of a cubic
      body-centered structure of a-iron is<br>
      shown in Figure 85b. The techniques of the present invention can
      be utilized to obtain desirable phases in the system FeO-Fe203 and
      systems like this system (as discussed in more<br>
      Still further, as shown in Figure 79, a solubility curve for a
      theoretical hydrate is given. The techniques of the present
      invention can be utilized to modify the expected phases in the
      solubility curve in this system and in systems like this system
      (as discussed in greater detail later herein.<br>
      <br>
      Further, Figure 97a shows several solubility curves for different
      solvents in water.<br>
      <br>
      Most of these materials show increased solubility as a function of
      temperature. Sodium chloride is one of those solutes that shows a
      gradually increasing solubility in water as a function of
      increasing temperature. Specifically, for example, the solubility
      plot for NaCl shows that a saturated solution of NaCl at 20 C,
      will comprise about 36 grams of NaCl dissolved in 100 grams of
      water. Thus, for example, if 40 grams of NaCl was added to the 100
      grams of water, about 4 grams of undissolved NaCl would remain as
      solid in the bottom of a container. Moreover, if 36 grams of NaCl
      was added to 100 grams of water at 20 C, as above, and the
      temperature of the solution was raised, then the solution would be
      slightly unsaturated (e. g. , the solution would be capable of
      dissolving more NaCl at this temperature).<br>
      <br>
      Still further, if 36 grams of NaCl was added to 100 grams of water
      at 20 C, as above, and the temperature of the solution was
      lowered, then the solution would be"supersaturated" (e. g. , at
      least temporarily) until the extra (i. e. , 4 grams) of solute
      would come out of the solution (i. e., at which point the solution
      would again be saturated). Thus, these aforementioned selective
      examples are exemplary ways to utilize solubility curves to form
      saturated, unsaturated and supersaturated solutions. In this
      regard, a saturated solution is typically regarded as one where an
      equilibrium is established between undissolved solute and
      dissolved solutes.<br>
      <br>
      However, the techniques of the present invention can
      advantageously affect or change the solubility (or at least the
      rate that solutes can be dissolved by solvents) of known materials
      at known temperatures in known solutions (as discussed in grater
      detail later herein).<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the techniques of the present invention are equally
      applicable in polymer or organic systems as well as in biologic
      systems. In this regard, crystalline or structural growth of, for
      example, proteins, fatty acids, lipids, DNA, etc. , as well as
      crystalline or structural growth of, for examples, polymers
      (including monomers and oligimers) are well known. Different
      crystalline or structural species (e. g. , phases) are also
      obtainable in these crystallization reaction systems. Further, the
      techniques of the present invention can be<br>
      <br>
      utilized to control quasicrystal systems, liquid crystal systems,
      as well as encouraging certain crystallization reaction systems to
      remain essentially non-crystalline (e. g. , predominantly
      non-crystalline or only localized order) or to encourage at least
      only a limited order within certain crystallization reaction
      systems.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 87a shows a molecular model of the 5-a transformation
      observed in oleic acid, erucic acid, asclepic acid and palmitoleic
      acid. Specifically, oleic acid is one of the principal unsaturated
      fatty acids. Most of the unsaturated fatty acids exhibit a
      polymorphic behavior.<br>
      <br>
      Unsaturated fatty acids play an important role in lipid molecules
      that correspondingly play critical roles in the functional
      activities of biological organisms and also in fatty products.<br>
      <br>
      Unsaturated fatty acids occupy about one-half of all acyl chains
      in bio-membrane phospholipids, promoting fluidity and permeability
      of the membrane through conformational flexibility of the acyl
      chains. Major factors which are thought to influence the physical
      and chemical properties of unsaturated fats and lipids are the
      number, position and configuration of double bonds. Thus, it is
      very important to have a molecular-level understanding of the
      structure-function relationships of unsaturated fatty acids. The
      techniques of the present invention can assist in controlling
      certain reaction products and/or reaction pathways in various
      organic or biologic crystallization reaction systems.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 87b shows a single crystal morphology of the a-form and
      6-form of gondoic acid.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 87c shows a Raman scattering C-C stretching band of the
      a-form and 6-form of gondoic acid.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 87d shows a phase-diagram for mixtures of gondoic acid with
      asclepic acid; and Figure 87e shows a phase-diagram for mixtures
      of gondoic acid with oleic acid.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, Figures 87b-87e show important phase and structure
      relationships between these various biologic acids. The control of
      particular phases or structures within these fatty acids can be of
      great significance and importance in biological reactions.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the techniques of the present invention can be
      utilized to assist and/or control various reaction pathways within
      these crystallization reaction systems (as discussed in greater
      detail later herein).<br>
      <br>
      However, crystallization in biological crystallization reaction
      systems, in general, follow the basic steps of nucleation and
      growth. In this regard, crystallization of, for example, a fat
      compound typically requires supersaturation or supercooling. For
      fat systems,<br>
      <br>
      crystallization is often complex because natural fats are a
      mixture of various triacylglycerols.<br>
      <br>
      Consequently, the concentration of these triacylglycerols is
      typically low and, for example, increased supercooling may be
      required to achieve desirable nucleation of the low concentration
      species. Furthermore, triacylglycerols are characterized by a
      complex melting behavior. The triacylglycerols typically exhibit
      three different crystal structures of a, (3'and . These
      polymorphic crystal structures depend on, for example, the
      particular driving forces for crystallization. Accordingly, the
      understanding and techniques for controlling of these various
      processes to achieve desirable polymorphic phases is important in
      these crystallization reaction systems.<br>
      <br>
      Crystallization of other organic compounds, for example, proteins,
      is typically accomplished using a variety of catalytic components
      such as salts, buffers, precipitants, reagents, additives, and
      temperature. Accordingly, the techniques of the present invention
      can be utilized to assist and/or control various reaction pathways
      within these crystallization reaction systems (as discussed in
      greater detail later herein).<br>
      <br>
      In order to practice the techniques of the present invention, it
      has been discovered that matter (e. g. , solids, liquids, gases
      and/or plasmas and/or mixtures and/or portions thereof) can be
      caused, or influenced, to interact and/or react (or be prevented
      from reacting and/or interacting) with other matter and/or
      portions thereof in, for example, a crystallization reaction
      system along a desired reaction pathway by applying energy, in the
      form of, for example, a spectral energy provider such as a
      catalytic spectral energy pattern, a catalytic spectral pattern, a
      spectral energy pattern, a spectral energy catalyst, a spectral
      pattern, a spectral catalyst, a spectral environmental reaction
      condition and/or combinations thereof, which can collectively
      result in an applied spectral energy pattern being applied or
      provided in at least a portion of the crystallization reaction
      system.<br>
      <br>
      Likewise, matter (e. g. , solids, liquids, gases and/or plasmas
      and/or mixtures and/or portions thereof) can be caused, or
      influenced, to interact and/or react with other matter and/or
      portions thereof in, for example, a crystallization reaction
      system along a desired reaction pathway by applying conditioning
      energy to a conditionable participant, in the form of, for
      example, a catalytic spectral energy conditioning pattern, a
      catalytic spectral conditioning pattern, a spectral energy
      conditioning pattern, a spectral energy conditioning catalyst, a
      spectral conditioning pattern, a spectral conditioning catalyst, a
      spectral conditioning environmental reaction condition and/or
      combinations thereof, which can<br>
      <br>
      collectively result in an applied spectral energy conditioning
      pattern being applied to a conditionable participant.
      Specifically, the applied conditioning energy results in a
      conditioned participant which, when exposed to, and/or activated
      by, a crystallization reaction system, can cause the
      crystallization reaction system to behave in a desirable manner
      (e. g. , the conditioned energy pattern of the conditioned
      participant favorably interacts with at least one participant in a
      crystallization reaction system).<br>
      <br>
      One aspect of the present invention is the discovery that a
      spectral energy pattern delivered to a crystallization reaction
      system can function as a form of scaffolding which effects and
      controls crystallization and/or structure of the reaction product.
      For example, a seed crystal in a crystallization reaction system
      can be modeled as an autocatalyst. In this model, a seed crystal
      emits a unique spectral energy pattern which extends a short
      distance into the surrounding medium. This extending energy
      pattern functions as a type of scaffolding which guides and
      catalyzes growth of the crystal. In this regard, a seed crystal
      can be considered to be an autocatalyst, and crystallization and
      autocatalytic process. A spectral energy pattern can be delivered
      to a crystallization reaction system which enhances the inherent
      energy scaffolding of a seed crystal, or which replaces it
      altogether. Examples if this phenomena, discussed in greater
      detail in the"Examples"section later herein, utilizes a sodium
      vapor lamp as a spectral energy pattern which results in enhanced
      formation of sodium halide crystals from various aqueous
      solutions.<br>
      <br>
      Since, a seed crystal appears to behave as a catalyst in an
      autocatalytic process which results in the formation of one or
      more ordered or structured forms of matter in a crystallization
      reaction system, the seed crystal (or seed-crystal spectral energy
      pattern) is an important component to consider in a
      crystallization reaction system. For example, a seed crystal
      catalyzes at least one reaction in a crystallization reaction
      system leading to the formation of one or more species (e. g. ,
      crystal growth, crystallization, phase changes, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      In the case of a seed crystal, the spectral frequencies, which are
      constantly being emitted and absorbed by all matter, can act as a
      spectral catalyst for the formation of more crystal in the
      crystallization reaction system. However, these frequencies
      emitted are, typically, somewhat limited in intensity (i. e. , are
      relatively weak) due to the relatively small size of most seed
      crystals that are utilized. Accordingly, the emanated or emitted
      spectral pattern may not reach very far into a crystallization
      reaction system. This disclosure teaches and shows that
      crystallization can be enhanced if the spectral signal of the seed
      crystal is effectively<br>
      <br>
      amplified. In many respects, the electric and/or magnetic fields
      emitted by the seed crystal may act as, for example,
      electromagnetic scaffolding for the rapid and orderly formation of
      more crystalline layers. However, if the signal is small (e. g. ,
      the"scaffolding"does not extend very far into the reactants or
      participants in the crystallization reaction system) then crystal
      growth may be relatively slow. However, if the size of
      the"scaffolding"could be effectively increased (e. g. , by
      applying a spectral energy provider of sufficient strength so as
      to increase the effective size of the spectral pattern emitted by
      the seed crystal) then, for example, the rate of crystallization
      or the rate of crystal growth can be effectively increased.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, directional patterning of the electromagnetic
      scaffolding can also influence, for example, shape, morphology,
      phase, etc. , of crystalline growth or formation in the
      crystallization reaction system.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, an existing seed crystal produces an
      electromagnetic"scaffolding"effect comprising a combination of
      standing waves and nodes which are produced by, for example, the
      interaction of spectral patterns of the crystallized species.
      These electromagnetic waves include electronic, vibrational,
      rotational, librational, translational, gyrational and torsional
      frequencies, as well as fine splitting frequencies, hyperfine
      splitting frequencies, Stark frequencies and Zeeman frequencies.
      These particular electromagnetic nodes and waves extend,
      typically, only a short distance from the surface of the seed
      crystal (or epitaxial substrate or nucleation site). When, for
      example, adatoms approach the seed crystal, the adatoms can
      resonate sympathetically with the standing wave pattern emitted by
      the seed crystal (e. g. , the presence of the scaffolding) and may
      be attracted, through, for example, the process of beading, to
      form additional layers on the seed crystal (i. e. , a growth of
      one or more crystalline species now occurs).<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, by augmenting or supplementing a naturally occurring
      standing wave pattern of electromagnetic energy existing in, for
      example, a seed crystal, layer-by-layer growth can be accelerated,
      as well as growth being capable of being controlled with greater
      specificity. Particular control of growth includes controlling the
      lattice vibrations for atomic or mixed crystals; controlling
      librational, vibrational or translational frequencies in the case
      of molecular crystals such as water; controlling torsional or
      hydrogen bonding frequencies in the case of, for example, organic
      macromolecules; and/or controlling electronic or other
      frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      In addition to supplementing the electromagnetic patterns of a
      seed crystal, a complete substitution of electromagnetic patterns
      (e. g. , use of a spectral provider) can also be utilized.<br>
      <br>
      In these cases, interactions and/or reactions may also be caused
      to occur when the applied spectral energy pattern (or the applied
      spectral energy conditioning pattern) results in, for example,
      some type of modification to the spectral energy pattern of one or
      more of the forms of matter in the crystallization reaction
      system. The various forms of matter include reactants; transients;
      intermediates; activated complexes; physical catalysts; reaction
      products; promoters; poisons; solvents; physical catalyst support
      materials; reaction vessels; and/or mixtures of components
      thereof. For example, the applied spectral energy provider (i. e.
      , at least one of spectral energy catalyst; spectral catalyst;
      spectral energy pattern; spectral pattern; catalytic spectral
      energy pattern; catalytic spectral pattern; applied spectral
      energy pattern and spectral environmental reaction conditions)
      when targeted appropriately to, for example, a participant and/or
      component in the crystallization reaction system, can result in
      the generation of, and/or desirable interaction (e. g. , primary
      nucleation and/or secondary nucleation) with one or more
      participants for enhanced nucleation (or if desired, primary
      and/or secondary nucleation can be prevented or substantially
      completely eliminated).<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, the applied spectral energy provider can be targeted
      to achieve very specific desirable results and/or reaction product
      and/or reaction product at a desired rate and/or along a desired
      reaction pathway (e. g. , along a desired crystallization reaction
      pathway).<br>
      <br>
      The targeting in many cases can occur by a direct resonance
      approach, (i. e. , direct resonance targeting), a harmonic
      resonance approach (i. e. , harmonic targeting) and/or a non-
      harmonic heterodyne resonance approach (i. e. , non-harmonic
      heterodyne targeting). The spectral energy provider can be
      targeted to, for example, interact with at least one frequency of
      an atom or molecule, including, but not limited to, electronic
      frequencies, vibrational frequencies, rotational frequencies,
      rotational-vibrational frequencies, librational frequencies,
      translational frequencies, gyrational frequencies, fine splitting
      frequencies, hyperfine splitting frequencies, magnetic field
      induced frequencies, electric field induced frequencies, natural
      oscillating frequencies, and all components and/or portions
      thereof (discussed in greater detail later herein). These
      approaches may result in, for example, the mimicking of at least
      one mechanism of action of a physical catalyst, environmental
      factor and/or a seed crystal, etc. , in a crystallization reaction
      system.<br>
      <br>
      Similar concepts also apply to utilizing an applied spectral
      energy conditioning pattern in a conditioning reaction system to
      form a conditioned participant. In the case where one applied
      spectral energy conditioning pattern is utilized, interactions
      and/or reactions may be caused to occur in the conditioning
      reaction system when the applied spectral energy conditioning
      pattern results in, for example, some type of modification to the
      spectral energy pattern of one or more conditionable participants
      prior to such participant (s) being involved in, and/or activated
      by, the crystallization reaction system. The various forms of
      matter that can be used as a conditionable participant include
      reactants; physical catalysts; reaction products; promoters;
      poisons; solvents; physical catalyst support materials; reaction
      vessels; conditioning reaction vessels; and/or mixtures of
      components thereof. For example, the applied spectral energy
      conditioning provider (e. g. , at least one of a: spectral energy
      conditioning catalyst; spectral conditioning catalyst; spectral
      energy conditioning pattern; spectral conditioning pattern;
      catalytic spectral energy conditioning pattern; catalytic spectral
      conditioning pattern ; applied spectral energy conditioning
      pattern and spectral conditioning environmental reaction
      conditions) when targeted appropriately to, for example, a
      conditionable participant and/or component thereof prior to the
      conditionable participant and/or component thereof becoming
      involved in, and/or activated by, the crystallization reaction
      system, can result in the generation of a desirable reaction
      product, and/or desirable interaction with one or more
      participants in the crystallization reaction system. Specifically,
      the applied spectral energy conditioning provider can be targeted
      to a conditionable participant to achieve very specific desirable
      results (e. g. , a very specific conditioned energy pattern). The
      desirable conditioned energy pattern can thereafter result in a
      desirable reaction pathway, a desirable reaction product and/or at
      a desired rate in a crystallization reaction system, when the
      conditioned participant becomes involved in the crystallization
      reaction system. Further, the conditioned participant may itself
      comprise both a reactant and a reaction product, whereby, for
      example, the chemical composition of the conditioned participant
      does not substantially change (if at all) but one or more physical
      properties or structures or phases or relationships in one or more
      of the energy structure (s) is changed once the conditioned
      participant is involved with, and/or activated by, the
      crystallization reaction system.<br>
      <br>
      The conditioning targeting can occur by a direct resonance
      conditioning approach, (i. e. , direct resonance conditioning
      targeting), a harmonic resonance conditioning approach<br>
      <br>
      (i. e. , harmonic conditioning targeting), non-harmonic heterodyne
      conditioning resonance approach (i. e., non-harmonic heterodyne
      conditioning targeting). The spectral energy conditioning provider
      can be targeted to, for example, interact with the conditionable
      participant by interacting with at least one frequency of an atom
      or molecule, including, but not limited to, electronic
      frequencies, vibrational frequencies, rotational frequencies,
      rotational-vibrational frequencies, fine splitting frequencies,
      hyperfine splitting frequencies, magnetic field induced
      frequencies, electric field induced frequencies, natural
      oscillating frequencies, and all components and/or portions
      thereof (discussed in greater detail later herein). Some examples
      of known sources of spectral energy conditioning providers

      The techniques of the present invention can be utilized to achieve
      preferred characteristics, such as growth and/or orientation
      and/or morphology, etc. , which is/are not<br>
      normally attainable by known systems. For example, if a seed
      crystal is utilized, electromagnetic energy may be preferentially
      directed to one or more faces of the seed crystal to result in a
      larger"scaffolding"extending from one or more selected sides of
      the seed crystal to result in preferential growth from those side
      (s). Moreover, rather than simply applying a spectral energy
      provider which simulates the"scaffolding"or energy pattern of a
      seed crystal, a spectral energy provider such as spectral
      environmental reaction condition could be applied. In this regard,
      environmental factors such as temperature, pressure,
      concentration, etc. , can also favorably influence crystal growth
      or crystallization.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, for example, spectral patterns corresponding to, for
      example, temperature and/or pressure could be applied instead of,
      or in addition to, those spectral energy patterns corresponding to
      the"scaffolding"of the seed crystal.<br>
      <br>
      Further, for example, a spectral energy conditioning pattern may
      be applied to a conditionable participant which may by itself, or
      when used with a spectral energy pattern, favorably influence the
      formation of desirable reaction product (s) at one or more
      specific locations in a crystallization reaction system when the
      conditioned participant becomes involved in the crystallization
      reaction system. For example, the conditioned participant may
      itself function as a seed crystal, or may complement the energy
      pattern of one or more participants in the crystallization
      reaction system. Depending on a particular crystallization
      reaction system, a spectral energy pattern and a spectral energy
      conditioning pattern may be substantially similar to each other,
      or very different from each other. Examples of this phenomenon,
      discussed in greater detail in the"Examples"section later herein,
      utilize a sodium vapor light as a spectral energy conditioning
      pattern for conditioning water prior to solute being dissolved
      therein.<br>
      <br>
      As stated above, a spectral energy provider can be used to augment
      a system, or to replace, for example, a seed crystal. In this
      regard, when a critical size for nucleation is provided by the use
      of, for example, seed crystals, crystallization occurs on the
      provided nucleation sites. There are a number of critical factors
      associated with these nucleation sites.<br>
      <br>
      However, rather than using such seed crystals, a spectral energy
      provider could be input into a crystallization reaction system to
      function effectively as a seed crystal.<br>
      <br>
      The techniques of the present invention can also be utilized to
      grow crystals (e. g., epitaxial growth) onto other materials (e.
      g. , epitaxial substrates), which differ in crystalline form from
      those materials which are desired to be grown. In particular, by
      providing<br>
      <br>
      appropriate spectral energy providers to, for example, a
      substrate, an appropriate "scaffolding" can emanate from a surface
      of a substrate resulting in the attraction of desirable ions,
      atoms, molecules and/or macromolecules, etc. , onto at least one
      surface of a substrate.<br>
      <br>
      Further, by substantially matching, for example, a spectral energy
      pattern of a substrate with a spectral energy provider, atoms,
      ions, molecules and/or macromolecules can be encouraged to bond or
      attach themselves to the substrate in a desirable manner. If, for
      example, the desired substrate creates a spectral energy pattern
      (e. g. , an electromagnetic energy pattern), which does not match
      sufficiently to, for example, the spectral energy patterns of
      atoms, ions, molecules and/or macromolecules which are to be
      bonded onto the substrate, then the substrate can be caused to
      emit a spectral energy pattern which differs from the normal (i.
      e. , inherent) spectral energy pattern emitted therefrom. In this
      regard, for example, particular frequencies could be heterodyned
      (e. g. , externally or internally) with the substrate to cause the
      substrate to behave in a different manner spectrally (i. e. , a
      different and more favorable spectral energy pattern can be
      created). These techniques of causing the substrate to behave in a
      different manner spectrally could be advantageously utilized to,
      for example: (1) attract ions, atoms, molecules and/or
      macromolecules (or portions thereof) that would not normally be
      attracted; (2) attract ions, atoms, molecules and/or
      macromolecules (or portions thereof) that subsequently remain
      fixed to the substrate; (3) attract ions, atoms, molecules and/or
      macromolecules (or portions thereof) which subsequently detach
      themselves from the substrate and form a free-standing body;
      and/or (4) repel ions, atoms, molecules and/or macromolecules (or
      portions thereof) that would not normally be repelled that, for
      example, may correspond to certain impurities or defects in a
      particular structure or material. These particular techniques can
      enhance the production of many difficult, and/or economically
      undesirable products, to be formed in an efficient, economical and
      desirable manner. Moreover, these techniques could be used to form
      patterns or designs of similar or dissimilar atoms, ions,
      molecules and/or macromolecules on at least a portion of a
      substrate.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, designs of particular utility could be placed
      permanently or temporarily on various substrate materials (e. g. ,
      forming a circuit pattern on a chip, etc. ) to achieve a variety
      of functional effects.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, the techniques of the present invention can be used
      to form composite crystals (e. g. , the formation of
      super-lattices). In this regard, if a first spectral energy
      provider was utilized in a crystallization reaction system a first
      crystalline growth could be<br>
      achieved. Thereafter, a different spectral energy provider (and/or
      conditioned participant) could be introduced into the same
      crystallization reaction system, thereby resulting in a different
      crystalline species growing on, for example, the first produced
      crystalline species.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, alternating layers of different crystal materials
      could be achieved. An example of alternating layers that would be
      useful in the inorganic crystallization art would be layers of
      CdTe followed by layers of ZnTe. Moreover, one or more alternating
      layers of an amorphous species could be included with one more
      crystalline species. Accordingly, many additional unmentioned
      permutations should occur to those of ordinary skill in the art
      once armed with the teachings contained herein. Examples of this
      phenomenon, discussed in greater detail in the"Examples"section
      later herein, utilize various spectral energy patterns which
      result in enhanced formation of particular crystalline species in
      composite crystals.<br>
      <br>
      Further, composite crystals could be achieved where different
      growth patterns are achieved in different directions. In this
      regard, for example, a first crystalline species could be achieved
      in an XY direction, and an alternative crystalline species could
      be achieved in, for example, a Z direction.<br>
      <br>
      The techniques of the present invention could also enhance the
      evaporation crystallization process. In this regard, when
      materials typically flow from the vapor phase, a crystallization
      growth rate is approximately equal to the difference of the flux
      of atoms from the vapor compared to the evaporation rate. The
      incoming flux is proportional to the vapor pressure (and thus to
      the vapor density). The present invention can effectively reduce
      the evaporation rate by applying, for example, a spectral energy
      provider (and/or a spectral energy conditioning provider) which
      corresponds to, for example, electronic frequencies or frequencies
      of individual components in the crystal lattice to assist in
      stabilizing each atom which is, for example, evaporated onto a
      surface or, generally, is within a crystallization reaction
      system. This effective stabilization could limit, for example,
      reabsorption of atoms into the gas and/or accelerate the
      deposition of adatoms.<br>
      <br>
      The techniques of the present invention can also be utilized to
      eliminate certain derivative structures, if desired, or to achieve
      certain derivative structures. In this regard, various defects
      exist in crystals. These defects include: point defects (e. g. ,
      lattice vacancies, interstitials, impurities, etc. ) ; line
      defects (e. g. , dislocations); surface defects (e. g. , grain
      boundaries, stacking faults, etc. ) ; and three-dimensional
      defects (e. g. , striations, cellular growth, voids, inclusions,
      etc. ). In many cases a perfect crystal would be desirable to
      achieve<br>
      <br>
      because, for example, such crystals would be very strong
      mechanically. Such crystals could be very useful for abrasion or
      wear applications. However, when crystalline defects such as
      lattice vacancies, interstitials, dislocations, grain boundaries,
      stacking faults, etc. , occur, all such defects degrade mechanical
      performance. In order to minimize defects, an appropriate spectral
      energy provider could be utilized and create, for example,
      a"gettering","getting"or "scavenging"standing wave pattern
      or"scaffolding"for any impurities in the system at a location
      which is apart from the area where crystallization is occurring.
      The provision of such a"gettering"spectral pattern could minimize
      the inclusion of undesirable defects.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, if certain defects are desirable to be included,
      then a particular spectral energy provider could be utilized to
      mimic such defects and the mechanism of action of, for example,
      the impurity could be copied by utilizing an appropriate spectral
      energy provider.' Still further, certain derivative structures or
      defects may also be minimized or eliminated by utilizing an
      appropriate spectral energy provider which creates an effective
      repulsion or repulsive wave pattern at or near a location where
      crystallization is occurring. The provision of such
      a"repulsing"spectral pattern could minimize the inclusion of
      undesirable impurities or defects. One example of such
      a"repulsing"wave pattern would be the rotational frequency of a
      crystalline species causing increased rotational motion of the
      species in the crystallization reaction system thereby slowing or
      preventing, for example, its bonding to a growing crystal.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, for most materials, El (i. e. , the energy required
      to form an interstitial), is greater than Ev, (i. e. , the energy
      require to form a vacancy). Vacancies tend to be a dominant entity
      in defect structures. Typically, near the melting point, a crystal
      may have a vacancy concentration of up to 0. 1%. The presence of
      vacancies and interstitial atoms in a crystal provides a mechanism
      by which mass transport (i. e. , diffusion) can occur in the
      crystalline lattice. The vacancy provides a missing site into
      which a neighboring atom can jump. When the atom jumps, the
      vacancy has moved, now occupying the original site of the
      neighbor.<br>
      <br>
      Interstitals may move in a similar manner. Both of these motions
      result in an energization of the lattice as the atoms move.
      Moreover, the jump rate for a defect (as well as the rate of
      atomic diffusion) in a crystal is proportional to temperature.
      Accordingly, the techniques of the present invention can be
      applied to control the number of interstitials and/or vacancies in
      a crystal by including and/or excluding the spectral pattern of
      the vacancies and/or interstitials, in a controlled manner, by
      controlling the energy provided by the spectral energy<br>
      provider. Further, diffusion of foreign substances can be
      controlled either positively or negatively, by, for example,: (1)
      controlling the number or lack thereof of vacancies/interstitials
      ; (2) using spectral energy providers which mimic the mechanisms
      of action of lattice patterns to increase the jump rates of the
      point defects, and hence diffusion rates, of the foreign
      substance; and/or (3) energizing the foreign substances directly
      by controlling their energy structure, etc. For example, foreign
      substances such as heavy metals (tungsten, mercury, etc. ) are
      often infiltrated as interstitials into protein crystals to assist
      in the x-ray analysis of those crystals. The techniques of the
      present invention can be used to enhance interstitial formation,
      for example, by applying a mercury lamp emitting the mercury
      electronic frequencies, to a protein crystal bathed in a solution
      of mercury salts, thereby enhancing mercury infiltration into the
      protein crystal.<br>
      <br>
      In non-metals, vacancies and interstitials may also be activated
      in crystallization reaction systems by applying an appropriate
      spectral energy provider, thus producing electrical conductivity.
      The presence of vacancies and/or interstitials in semiconductors
      can alter the electronic properties of the material in that they
      serve to trap and scatter free electrons and holes. The techniques
      of the present invention can be used to reduce the random chaos of
      current crystallization techniques, with their subsequent random
      placement of point defects, to produce a semiconductor with a more
      evenly spaced group of point defects, thus refining the electrical
      conduction properties of the material.<br>
      <br>
      Electronic transitions of the trapped charges may also give rise
      to optical absorption and luminescence bands in semiconductors and
      insulators. Thus, by controlling, for example, the placement and
      number of point defects, (i. e. , by utilizing an appropriate
      spectral energy provider) these properties can also be tailored.<br>
      <br>
      The somewhat chaotic manner in which atoms fall into place during
      growth (e. g., adatoms) makes the formation of lattice
      dislocations likely. Once such lattice dislocations are formed on
      a small scale, the dislocations can propagate as the crystal
      grows. Thus, applied shear stress allows one atom plane to slip
      past another as the dislocations move which may, in some cases,
      significantly alter one or more properties of a material in a
      negative manner.<br>
      <br>
      Further, work hardening, resulting in pinned dislocations, is
      currently used to minimize dislocation problems and strengthen
      materials. By applying the spectral energy techniques of the
      present invention, the chaos of current crystallization techniques
      can be minimized, resulting in, for example, the minimizing of
      dislocations in a crystal structure and a<br>
      <br>
      corresponding increase in various physical properties including,
      for example, the strength of materials formed by such techniques.
      Further, as shown in the"Examples"Section later herein, modified
      crystal growth can be achieved from solutions that have not yet
      reached their saturation point (e. g. , sodium chloride aqueous
      solutions which result in the production of NaCl crystals from
      solutions that are not completely saturated).<br>
      <br>
      Surface defects also can be a problem in crystal growth. As with
      the other defects, the chaos of random crystallization methods
      allow grain boundary and stacking faults to occur.<br>
      <br>
      Reducing the chaos of the crystallization process will diminish,
      if desired, these defects as well.<br>
      <br>
      Cellular structure can occur in alloys and is thought to be due to
      impurities. The impurities diffuse rather slowly in the liquid
      melt, and even more slowly in the solid.<br>
      <br>
      Consequently, the impurities which remain trapped in the pockets
      cannot escape and the pockets become infinitely deep, leading to
      the formation of cellular structures. Thus cellular formations
      occur with rapid growth velocities. The techniques of the present
      invention can cause a spectral energy provider to be applied to
      speed the rate of diffusion of impurities (e. g. , via
      heterodyning between the impurity and lattice frequencies)
      applying the rotational frequency of impurity, or encouraging
      crystallization immediately around the impurity thus avoiding the
      usually undesirable formation of deep poclcets and cellular
      structures.<br>
      <br>
      The current techniques for controlling defects include, for
      example, using temperature gradients applied during directional
      solidification to remove constitutional supercooling and prevent
      cellular growth by morphological instability. Also, they control
      dislocation density by use of a bottlenecked seed at which
      dislocations may emerge on the crystal surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      These techniques or mechanisms of action could be at least
      partially duplicated by the application of at least one spectral
      energy provider. For example, a vibrational frequency may be
      applied to duplicate certain of the effects of a higher
      temperature atomic and/or molecular motion, without actually
      raising the temperature.<br>
      <br>
      The techniques of the present invention are also useful for
      controlling step bunching as well as annealing. For example, step
      bunching may result in macrostops. This macrostop process can
      occur during growth of crystals from a liquid phase or from a
      vapor phase.<br>
      <br>
      Defects occur in formed crystals due to, for example, the
      inclusion of physical impurities.<br>
      <br>
      Further, in annealing processes, crystals are heated to, for
      example, reduce surface<br>
      <br>
      roughening. The techniques of the present invention could be
      utilized to enhance both of these general processes.<br>
      <br>
      The techniques of the present invention can also be utilized to
      affect the myriad of electrochemical crystallization systems. For
      example, the techniques of the present invention are applicable to
      affecting the structure of materials formed in any of the
      following processes or techniques: electrocrystallization;
      electrometallurgy; electromigration; electrophoresis;
      electroplating; electrowinning; galvanizing; and mass transport
      reactions.<br>
      <br>
      In some cases, desirable results in the aforementioned
      crystallization reaction systems may be achieved by utilizing a
      single applied spectral energy pattern targeted to a single
      participant or component or to multiple participants or
      components; while in other cases, more than one applied spectral
      energy pattern may be targeted to a single participant or
      component or to multiple participants or components, by, for
      example, multiple approaches in a single crystallization reaction
      system. Specifically, combinations of direct resonance targeting,
      harmonic targeting and non-harmonic heterodyne targeting, which
      can be made to interact with one or more frequencies occurring in
      atoms and/or molecules, could be used sequentially or
      substantially continuously. Further, in certain cases, the
      spectral energy provider targeting may result in various
      interactions at predominantly the upper energy levels of one or
      more of the various forms of matter present in a crystallization
      reaction system.<br>
      <br>
      Further, in another preferred embodiment of the invention, the
      aforementioned approaches for creating a conditioned participant
      may result in, for example, the conditioned participant mimicking
      of at least one mechanism of action of a physical or environmental
      reaction condition once the conditioned participant is exposed to
      (e. g. , activated in) a crystallization reaction system and/or
      the conditioned participant may enhance certain reaction pathways
      and/or reaction rates (e. g. , kinetics of a reaction may be
      increased or decreased; or reaction products may be altered,
      increased or decreased). For example, in some cases, desirable
      results may be achieved by utilizing a single applied spectral
      energy conditioning pattern targeted to a single conditionable
      participant; while in other cases, more than one applied spectral
      energy conditioning pattern may be targeted to a single
      participant or to multiple conditionable participants, by, for
      example, multiple approaches. Specifically, combinations of direct
      resonance conditioning targeting, harmonic conditioning targeting
      and non-harmonic heterodyne conditioning targeting, which can be
      made to interact with one or more frequencies occurring in atoms
      and/or molecules of a conditionable participant, could<br>
      <br>
      be used sequentially or substantially continuously to create
      desirable conditioned participants.<br>
      <br>
      Further, in certain cases, the spectral energy conditioning
      provider targeting may result in various interactions at
      predominantly the upper energy levels of one or more of the
      various forms of matter present as a conditionable participant.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, numerous combinations of the aforementioned applied
      spectral energy patterns and applied spectral energy conditioning
      patterns could be used in a crystallization reaction system to
      target participants and/or conditionable participants. For
      example, applied spectral energy patterns could be directed to one
      or more participants; and/or applied spectral energy conditioning
      patterns could be directed to one or more conditionable
      participants. In some crystallization reaction systems, a spectral
      energy pattern and a spectral energy conditioning pattern may be
      substantially similar to each other (e. g. , exactly the same or
      at least comprising similar portions of the electromagnetic
      spectrum) or very different from each other (e. g. , comprising
      similar or very different portions of the electromagnetic
      spectrum). The combination of one or more spectral energy patterns
      with one or more spectral energy conditioning patterns could have
      significant implications for control or growth of specific
      structures or phases and/or rates of reaction (s).<br>
      <br>
      The invention further recognizes and explains that various
      environmental reaction conditions are capable of influencing
      reaction pathways in a crystallization reaction system when using
      a spectral energy catalyst such as a spectral catalyst. The
      invention teaches specific methods for controlling various
      environmental reaction conditions in order to achieve desirable
      results in a reaction (e. g. , desirable reaction product (s) in
      one or more desirable reaction pathway (s) ) and/or interactions.
      The invention further discloses an applied spectral energy
      approach which permits the simulation, at least partially, of
      desirable environmental reaction conditions by the application of
      at least one, for example, spectral environmental reaction
      conditions. Thus, environmental reaction conditions can be
      controlled and used in combination with at least one spectral
      energy pattern to achieve a desired reaction pathway (e. g. , a
      desired phase or phases or a desired crystalline form or species).
      Alternatively, traditionally utilized environmental reaction
      conditions can be modified in a desirable manner (e. g. ,
      application of a reduced temperature and/or reduced pressure) by
      supplementing and/or replacing the traditional environmental
      reaction condition (s) with at least one spectral environmental
      reaction condition. One example of such a spectral environmental
      reaction pattern, is the delivery of vibrational overtones to<br>
      <br>
      water, thereby causing water to behave, in its solvent capacity,
      as though it were at higher temperatures, as discussed in greater
      detail in the"Examples"section later herein.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, the invention further recognizes and explains that
      various conditioning environmental reaction conditions are capable
      of influencing the resultant energy pattern of a conditionable
      participant, which, when such conditioned participant becomes
      involved with, and/or activated in, a crystallization reaction
      system, can influence reaction pathways in a crystallization
      reaction system. The invention teaches specific methods for
      controlling various conditioning environmental reaction conditions
      in order to achieve desirable conditioning of at least one
      conditionable participant which in turn can achieve desirable
      results (e. g. , desirable reaction product (s) and/or one or more
      desirable reaction pathway (s) and/or desirable interactions
      and/or desirable reaction rates) in a crystallization reaction
      system. The invention further discloses an applied spectral energy
      conditioning approach which permits the simulation, at least
      partially, of desirable environmental reaction conditions by the
      application of at least one, for example, spectral conditioning
      environmental reaction condition. Thus, conditioning environmental
      reaction conditions can be controlled and used in combination with
      at least one spectral energy conditioning pattern to achieve a
      desired conditioned energy pattern in a conditioned participant.
      Alternatively, traditionally utilized environmental reaction
      conditions can be modified in a desirable manner (e. g. ,
      application of a reduced temperature and/or reduced pressure) by
      supplementing and/or replacing the traditional environmental
      reaction condition (s) with at least one spectral conditioning
      environmental reaction condition.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also provides a method for determining desirable
      physical catalysts (i. e. , comprising previously known materials
      or materials not previously known to function as a physical
      catalyst such as a new or different seed crystal) which can be
      utilized in a crystallization reaction system to achieve a desired
      reaction pathway and/or desired reaction rate. In this regard, the
      invention may be able to provide a recipe for a physical and/or
      spectral catalyst for a particular reaction in a crystallization
      reaction system where no physical catalyst previously existed. In
      this embodiment of the invention, spectral energy patterns are
      determined or calculated by the techniques of the invention and
      corresponding physical catalysts (e. g. , seed crystal) can be
      supplied or manufactured and thereafter included in the
      crystallization reaction system to generate the calculated
      required spectral energy patterns. In certain cases, one or more
      existing physical species could be used or combined in<br>
      <br>
      a suitable manner, if a single physical species was deemed to be
      insufficient, to obtain the appropriate calculated spectral energy
      pattern to achieve a desired reaction pathway and/or desired
      reaction rate. Such catalysts can be used alone, in combination
      with other physical catalysts, spectral energy catalysts,
      controlled environmental reaction conditions and/or spectral
      environmental reaction conditions to achieve a desired resultant
      energy pattern and consequent reaction pathway and/or desired
      reaction rate.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, the invention also provides a method for determining
      desirable physical catalysts (e. g. , comprising previously known
      materials or materials not previously known to function as a
      physical catalyst or seed crystal) which can be utilized in a
      crystallization reaction system by appropriately conditioning at
      least one conditionable participant to achieve a desired reaction
      pathway and/or desired reaction rate and/or desired reaction
      product when the conditioned participant becomes involved with (e.
      g. , is added to or activated in) the crystallization reaction
      system. In this regard, the invention may be able to provide a
      recipe for a physical and/or spectral catalyst for a particular
      crystallization reaction system where no physical catalyst
      previously existed. In this embodiment of the invention, spectral
      energy conditioning patterns are determined or calculated by the
      techniques of the invention and corresponding conditionable
      participants can be supplied or manufactured and thereafter
      included in the crystallization reaction system to generate the
      calculated required spectral energy patterns. In certain cases,
      one or more existing physical species of a conditionable
      participant could be used or combined in a suitable manner, if a
      single physical species was deemed to be insufficient, to obtain
      the appropriate calculated spectral energy conditioning pattern to
      achieve a desired reaction pathway and/or desired reaction rate.
      Such conditionable participants, once conditioned, can be used
      alone, in combination with other physical catalysts, spectral
      energy catalysts, spectral energy catalysts, controlled
      environmental reaction conditions, spectral environmental reaction
      conditions and/or spectral environmental reaction conditions to
      achieve a desired reaction pathway and/or desired reaction rate.
      Thus, once a desired conditioned energy pattern is achieved in a
      conditionable participant, the conditioned participant becomes
      involved with, and/or activated in, the crystallization reaction
      system.<br>
      <br>
      The invention discloses many different permutations of one
      important theme of the invention, namely, that when frequencies of
      components in a crystallization reaction system match, or can be
      made to match, energy transfers between the components,
      participants or<br>
      <br>
      conditioned participants in the crystallization reaction system.
      Depending on how the energy dynamics of the component (s) are
      controlled or directed, the crystallization reaction system will
      be likewise controlled or directed. It should be understood that
      the many different permutations can be used alone to achieve
      desirable results (e. g. , desired reaction pathways and/or a
      desired reaction rates and/or desired reaction products) or can be
      used in a limitless combination of permutations, to achieve
      desired results (e. g. , desired reaction pathways, desired
      reaction products and/or desired reaction rates). However, in a
      first preferred embodiment of the invention, so long as a
      participant, or conditioned participant has one or more of its
      frequencies that match with at least one frequency of at least one
      other component in a crystallization reaction system (e. g. ,
      spectral patterns overlap), energy can be transferred.<br>
      <br>
      If energy is transferred, desirable interactions and/or reactions
      can result in the crystallization reaction system. Further, the
      conditioned participant may itself comprise both a reactant and a
      reaction product, whereby, for example, the chemical composition
      of the conditioned participant does not substantially change (if
      at all) but one or more energy dynamics, physical properties,
      structures, or phases is changed once the conditioned participant
      is involved with, and/or activated by, the reaction system.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the same targeted frequency or energy can be used with
      different power amplitudes, in the same crystallization reaction
      system, to achieve dramatically different results. For example,
      the vibrational frequency of a liquid solvent may be input at low
      power amplitudes to improve the solvent properties of the liquid
      without causing any substantial change in the chemical composition
      of the liquid. At higher power levels, the same vibrational
      frequency can be used to dissociate the liquid solvent, thereby
      changing its chemical composition. Thus, there is a continuum of
      effects that can be obtained with a single targeted frequency,
      ranging from changes in the energy dynamics of a participant, to
      changes in the actual chemical or physical structure of a
      participant.<br>
      <br>
      A targeted frequency or energy can also be used with different
      power amplitudes on a formed material in post-formation treatment
      processes that also could achieve dramatically different
      structural results with the formed material. For example,
      post-treatment processes such as annealing, thermal etching,
      chemical etching (e. g. , using liquids, solids, gases and/or
      plasmas), etc. , can all be used to selectively alter one or more
      properties in a formed material.<br>
      <br>
      A targeted frequency or energy could also result in desirable
      structural, physical and/or chemical changes (e. g. , permit
      certain reactions to occur, locally or globally) within at least a<br>
      <br>
      portion of (or on at least a portion of a surface of) a formed
      material (e. g. , solid, liquid, gas or plasma). These techniques
      could be useful for interactions including metal formation,
      semiconductor manufacturing, sintering, biological processes,
      plastics formation, hydrocarbon manufacturing, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the concept of frequencies matching can also be used in
      the reverse.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, if a reaction in a crystallization reaction system
      is occurring because frequencies match, the reaction can be slowed
      or stopped by causing the frequencies to no longer match or at
      least to match to a lesser degree. In this regard, one or more
      crystallization reaction system components (e. g. , environmental
      reaction condition, spectral environmental reaction condition
      and/or an applied spectral energy pattern) can be modified and/or
      applied so as to minimize, reduce or eliminate frequencies from
      matching. This also permits reactions to be started and stopped
      with ease providing for novel control in a myriad of reactions in
      a crystallization reaction system including preventing the
      formation of certain crystalline species, controlling the amount
      of crystallization in a crystallization reaction system, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Further, if a source of, for example, electromagnetic radiation
      includes a somewhat larger spectrum of wavelengths or frequencies
      (i. e. , energies) than those which are needed to optimize (or
      prevent) a particular reaction in a crystallization reaction
      system, then some of the unnecessary (or undesirable) wavelengths
      can be prevented from coming into contact with the crystallization
      reaction system (e. g. , can be blocked, reflected, absorbed, etc.
      ) by an appropriate filtering, absorbing and/or reflecting
      technique as discussed in greater detail later herein.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the concept of frequencies matching can also be used in
      the reverse for conditionable participants. Specifically, if a
      reaction is occurring because frequencies match, the reaction can
      be slowed or stopped by causing the frequencies to no longer match
      or at least match to. a lesser degree. In this regard, one or more
      crystallization reaction system components (e. g. , environmental
      reaction condition, spectral environmental reaction condition
      and/or an applied spectral energy pattern) can be modified by
      introducing a conditionable participant, once conditioned, so as
      to minimize, reduce or eliminate frequencies from matching in the
      crystallization reaction system. This also permits reactions to be
      started and stopped with ease providing for novel control in a
      myriad of reactions in a crystallization reaction system including
      preventing the formation of certain crystalline species,
      controlling the amount of product formed in a crystallization
      reaction system, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Further, if a source of, for example, electromagnetic radiation
      includes a somewhat larger spectrum of wavelengths or frequencies
      (i. e. , energies) than those which are needed to optimize (or
      prevent) a particular reaction in a crystallization reaction
      system, then some of the unnecessary (or undesirable) wavelengths
      can be prevented from coming into contact with the crystallization
      reaction system (e. g. , can be blocked, reflected, absorbed, etc.
      ) by an appropriate filtering, absorbing and/or reflecting
      technique as discussed in greater detail later herein.<br>
      <br>
      It should also be apparent that various conditionable
      participants, once conditioned, can be used in combination with
      various participants and/or spectral energy providers in a
      crystallization reaction system to control numerous reaction
      pathways. Also, the conditioning of reaction vessels, or portions
      thereof, can also result in desirable control of numerous reaction
      pathways.<br>
      <br>
      Further, a conditionable participant may be conditioned by
      removing at least a portion of its spectral pattern prior to the
      conditionable participant being introduced into a crystallization
      reaction system. Also, removing (or blocking) at least a portion
      of a spectral pattern of a reaction vessel, or portion (s)
      thereof, can also result in desirable control of various reaction
      pathways.<br>
      <br>
      To simplify the disclosure and understanding of the invention,
      specific categories or sections have been created in the"Summary
      of the Invention"and in the"Detailed Description of the Preferred
      Embodiments". However, it should be understood that these
      categories are not mutually exclusive and that some overlap
      exists. Accordingly, these artificially created sections should
      not be used in an effort to limit the scope of the invention
      defined in the appended claims.<br>
      <br>
      Further, in the following Sections, attempts have been made to
      simplify discussions and reduce the overall length of this
      disclosure. For example, in many instances, "participants"in a
      crystallization reaction system or holoreaction system are
      exclusively referred to. However, it should be understood
      that"conditionable participants"could also be separately addressed
      in the disclosure, even though not always expressly referred to
      herein.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, when the various general mechanisms of the invention are
      referred to herein, even if reference is made directly or
      indirectly to"participants"only, it should be understood that the
      discussion also applies to"conditionable participants"with similar
      relevancy. Efforts have<br>
      <br>
      been made throughout the disclosure to refer expressly to all of
      the novel phenomenon associated with conditionable participants
      only when required for clarification purposes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>I. WAVE ENERGIES</b><br>
      <br>
      In general, thermal energy has traditionally been used to drive
      chemical reactions by applying heat and increasing the temperature
      of a reaction system. The addition of heat increases the kinetic
      (motion) energy of the chemical reactants. It has been believed
      that a reactant with more kinetic energy moves faster and farther,
      and is more likely to take part in a chemical reaction. Mechanical
      energy likewise, by stirring and moving the chemicals, increases
      their kinetic energy and thus their reactivity. The addition of
      mechanical energy often increases temperature, by increasing
      kinetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      Acoustic energy is applied to chemical reactions as orderly
      mechanical waves.<br>
      <br>
      Because of its mechanical nature, acoustic energy can increase the
      kinetic energy of chemical reactants, and can also elevate their
      temperature (s). Electromagnetic (EM) energy consists of waves of
      electric and magnetic fields. EM energy may also increase the
      kinetic energy and heat in reaction systems. It also may energize
      electronic orbitals or vibrational motion in some reactions.<br>
      <br>
      Both acoustic and electromagnetic energy consist of waves. Energy
      waves and frequency have some interesting properties, and may be
      combined in some interesting ways.<br>
      <br>
      The manner in which wave energy transfers and combines, depends
      largely on the frequency.<br>
      <br>
      For example, when two waves of energy, each having the same
      amplitude, but one at a frequency of 400 Hz and the other at 100
      Hz are caused to interact, the waves will combine and their
      frequencies will add, to produce a new frequency of 500 Hz (i. e.
      , the"sum" frequency). The frequency of the waves will also
      subtract when they combine to produce a frequency of 300 Hz (i. e.
      , the"difference"frequency). All wave energies typically add and
      subtract in this manner, and such adding and subtracting is
      referred to as heterodyning.<br>
      <br>
      Common results of heterodyning are familiar to most as harmonics
      in music. The importance of heterodyning will be discussed in
      greater detail later herein.<br>
      <br>
      Another concept important to the invention is wave interactions or
      interference. In particular, wave energies are known to interact
      constructively and destructively. This phenomena is important in
      determining the applied spectral energy pattern. Figures la-lc
      show two different incident sine waves 1 (Figure la) and 2 (Figure
      lb) which correspond t<br>
      <br>
      two different spectral energy patterns having two different
      wavelengths B1 and 4 (and thus different frequencies) which could
      be applied to a reaction system. Assume arguendo that the energy
      pattern of Figure la corresponds to an electromagnetic spectral
      pattern (or an electromagnetic spectral conditioning pattern) and
      that Figure lb corresponds to one spectral environmental reaction
      condition (or a spectral conditioning environmental reaction
      condition). Each of the sine waves 1 and 2 has a different
      differential equation which describes its individual motion.
      However, when the sine waves are combined into the resultant
      additive wave 1 + 2 (Figure Ic), the resulting complex
      differential equation, which describes the totality of the
      combined energies (i. e. , the applied spectral energy pattern; or
      the applied spectral energy conditioning pattern) actually results
      in certain of the input energies being high (i. e. , constructive
      interference shown by a higher amplitude) at certain points in
      time, as well as being low (i. e. , destructive interference shown
      by a lower amplitude) at certain points in time.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, the portions"X"represent areas where the
      electromagnetic spectral pattern of wave 1 has constructively
      interfered with the spectral environmental reaction condition wave
      2, whereas the portions"Y"represent areas where the two waves 1
      and 2 have destructively interfered. Depending upon whether the
      portions"X"corresponds to desirable or undesirable wavelengths,
      frequencies or energies (e. g. , causing the applied spectral
      energy pattern (or the applied spectral energy conditioning
      pattern) to have positive or negative interactions with, for
      example, one or more participants and/or components in the
      crystallization reaction system), then the portions"X"could
      enhance a positive effect in the reaction system or could enhance
      a negative effect in the crystallization reaction system.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, depending on whether the portions"Y"correspond to
      desirable or undesirable wavelengths, frequencies, or energies,
      then the portions"Y"may correspond to the effective loss of either
      a positive or negative effect.<br>
      <br>
      Further, if a source of, for example, electromagnetic radiation
      includes a somewhat larger spectrum of wavelengths or frequencies
      (i. e. , energies) than those which are needed to optimize a
      particular reaction, then some of the unnecessary (or undesirable)
      wavelengths can be prevented from coming into contact with the
      crystallization reaction system (e. g., blocked, reflected,
      absorbed, etc. ). Accordingly in the simplified example discussed
      immediately above, by permitting only desirable wavelengths Bl to
      interact in a crystallization reaction system (e. g. , filtering
      out certain wavelengths or frequencies of a broader spectrum<br>
      <br>
      electromagnetic emitter) the possibilities of negative effects
      resulting from the combination of waves 1 (Figure la) and 2
      (Figure lb) would be minimized or eliminated. In this regard, it
      is noted that in practice many desirable incident wavelengths can
      be made to be incident on at least a portion of a crystallization
      reaction system. Moreover, it should also be clear that positive
      or desirable effects include, but are not limited to, those
      effects resulting from an interaction (e. g. , heterodyne,
      resonance, additive wave, subtractive wave, constructive or
      destructive interference) between a wavelength or frequency of
      incident light and a wavelength (e. g. , atomic and/or molecular,
      etc. ), frequency or property (e. g. , Stark effects, Zeeman
      effects, etc. ) inherent to the crystallization reaction system
      itself. Thus, by maximizing the desirable wavelengths (or
      minimizing undesirable wavelengths), crystallization reaction
      system efficiencies never before known (e. g. , crystal growth
      rates, crystal morphologies, crystal phases, crystal purities,
      etc. ) can be achieved. Alternatively stated, certain destructive
      interference effects resulting from the combinations of different
      energies, frequencies and/or wavelengths can reduce certain
      desirable results in a crystallization reaction system. The
      present invention attempts to mask or screen (e. g. , filter) as
      many of such undesirable energies (or wavelengths) as possible (e.
      g. , when a somewhat larger spectrum of wavelengths is available
      to be incident on a crystallization reaction system) from becoming
      incident on a crystallization reaction system and thus strive for,
      for example, the synergistic results that can occur due to, for
      example, desirable constructive interference effects between the
      incident wavelengths of, for example, electromagnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      It should be clear from this particular analysis that constructive
      interferences (i. e. , the points"X") could, for example, maximize
      both positive and negative effects in a crystallization reaction
      system. Accordingly, this simplified example shows that by
      combining, for example, certain frequencies from a spectral
      pattern (or a spectral conditioning pattern) with one or more
      other frequencies from, for example, at least one spectral
      environmental reaction condition (or at least one spectral
      environmental conditioning reaction condition), that the applied
      spectral energy pattern (or applied spectral energy conditioning
      pattern) that is actually applied to the crystallization reaction
      system can be a combination of constructive and destructive
      interference (s). The degree of interference can also depend on
      the relative phases of the waves. Accordingly, these factors
      should also be taken into account when choosing appropriate
      spectral energy patterns (or applied spectral<br>
      <br>
      energy conditioning patterns) that are to be applied to a
      crystallization reaction system. In this regard, it is noted that
      in practice many desirable incident wavelengths can be applied to
      a crystallization reaction system or undesirable incident
      wavelengths removed from a source which is incident upon at least
      a portion of a crystallization reaction). Moreover, it should also
      be clear that wave interaction effects include, but are not
      limited to, heterodyning, direct resonance, indirect resonance,
      additive waves, subtractive waves, constructive or destructive
      interference, etc. Further, as discussed in detail later herein,
      additional effects such as electric effects and/or magnetic field
      effects can also influence spectral energy patterns or spectral
      energy conditioning patterns (e. g. , spectral patterns or
      spectral conditioning patterns, respectively).<br>

      <b>II. SPECTRAL CATALYSTS, SPECTRAL CONDITIONING CATALYSTS AND</b><br>
      <b>SPECTROSCOPY</b><br>
      <br>
      A wide variety of reactions can be advantageously affected and
      directed with the assistance of a spectral energy catalyst (or
      spectral energy conditioning catalyst) having a specific spectral
      energy pattern (e. g. , spectral pattern, spectral conditioning
      pattern or electromagnetic pattern) which transfers targeted
      energy to initiate, control and/or promote desirable reaction
      pathways (e. g. , desirable crystallization pathways in a single
      or multiple component crystallization system) and/or desirable
      reaction rates within a crystallization reaction system. This
      section discusses spectral catalysts (and spectral conditioning
      catalysts) in more detail and explains various techniques for
      using spectral catalysts (and/or spectral conditioning catalysts)
      in various crystallization reaction systems (and holoreaction
      systems).<br>
      <br>
      For example, a spectral catalyst can be used in a crystallization
      reaction system to replace and provide the additional energy
      normally supplied by a physical catalyst (e. g. , a seed crystal,
      a substrate used for epitaxial growth, a crystallization agent,
      promoter or inhibitor, etc. ). The spectral catalyst can actually
      mimic or copy the mechanisms of action of a physical catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      The spectral catalyst can act as both a positive catalyst to
      increase the rate of a reaction or as a negative catalyst or
      poison to decrease the rate of reaction. Furthermore, the spectral
      catalyst can augment a physical catalyst by utilizing both a
      physical catalyst and a spectral catalyst to achieve, for example
      a desired crystallization pathway in a crystallization reaction
      system. The spectral catalyst can improve the activity of a
      physical catalyst. Also, the spectral catalyst can partially
      replace a specific quantity or amount of the physical catalyst,<br>
      <br>
      thereby reducing and/or eliminating many of the difficulties
      associated with, for example, primary and/or secondary nucleation,
      selectivity, and/or morphology.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, a conditionable participant can be conditioned by a
      spectral conditioning catalyst to form a conditioned participant
      which can thereafter be used in a crystallization reaction system,
      alone or in combination with a spectral catalyst. The spectral
      conditioning catalyst can energize a conditionable participant to
      result in a conditioned participant which can likewise, for
      example, replace, augment or otherwise provide additional energy
      normally provided by a physical catalyst in a crystallization
      reaction system, as discussed immediately above with regard to a
      spectral catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      Further, in the present invention, the spectral energy catalyst
      provides targeted energy (e. g. , electromagnetic radiation
      comprising a specific frequency or combination of frequencies), in
      a sufficient amount for a sufficient duration to initiate and/or
      promote and/or direct a reaction (e. g. , follow a particular
      reaction pathway). The total combination of targeted energy
      applied at any point in time to the crystallization reaction
      system is referred to as the applied spectral energy pattern. The
      applied spectral energy pattern may be comprised of a single
      spectral catalyst, multiple spectral catalysts and/or other
      spectral energy catalysts as well. With the absorption of targeted
      energy into a crystallization reaction system (e. g. ,
      electromagnetic energy from a spectral catalyst), a reactant may
      be caused to proceed through one or several reaction pathways
      including: energy transfer which can, for example, excite
      electrons to higher energy states for initiation of a reaction, by
      causing frequencies to match; ionize or dissociate reactants which
      may participate in a reaction; stabilize reaction products;
      energize and/or stabilize intermediates and/or transients and/or
      activated complexes that participate in a reaction pathway; cause
      one or more components in a crystallization reaction to have
      spectral patterns which at least partially overlap; alter the
      energy dynamics of one or more components causing them to have
      altered properties; and/or alter the resonant exchange of energy
      within the holoreaction system.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, in the present invention, the spectral energy
      conditioning catalyst provides targeted conditioning energy (e. g.
      , electromagnetic radiation comprising a specific frequency or
      combination of frequencies), in a sufficient amount for a
      sufficient duration to condition a conditionable participant to
      form a conditioned participant and to permit the conditioned
      participant to initiate and/or promote and/or direct a reaction
      (e. g. , follow a particular reaction pathway) once the
      conditioned participant is initiated or activated in the
      crystallization<br>
      <br>
      reaction system. The total combination of targeted conditioning
      energy applied at any point in time to the conditioning reaction
      system is referred to as the applied spectral energy conditioning
      pattern. The applied spectral energy conditioning pattern may be
      comprised of a single spectral conditioning catalyst, multiple
      spectral conditioning catalysts and/or other spectral energy
      conditioning catalysts. With the absorption of targeted
      conditioning energy into a conditioning reaction system (e. g. ,
      electromagnetic energy from a spectral conditioning catalyst), a
      conditioned participant may cause one or more reactants to proceed
      through one or several reaction pathways including: energy
      transfer which can for example, excite electrons to higher energy
      states for initiation of chemical reaction, by causing frequencies
      to match; ionize or dissociate reactants which may participate in
      a chemical reaction; stabilize reaction products; energize and/or
      stabilize intermediates and/or transients and/or activated
      complexes that participate in a reaction pathway; cause one or
      more components in a crystallization reaction system to have
      spectral patterns which at least partially overlap; and/or alter
      the energy dynamics of one or more components causing them to have
      altered properties; and/or alter the resonant exchange of energy
      within the holoreaction system.<br>
      <br>
      For example, in a simple crystallization reaction system, if a
      chemical reaction provides for at least one reactant"A"to be
      converted into at least one reaction product"B", a physical
      catalyst"C" (or a conditioned participant"C") may be utilized. In
      contrast, a portion of the catalytic spectral energy pattern (e.
      g. , in this section the catalytic spectral pattern) of the
      physical catalyst"C"may be applied in the form of, for example, an
      electromagnetic beam (as discussed elsewhere herein) to catalyze
      the crystallization reaction.<br>
      <br>
      C A oB Substances A and B = unknown frequencies, and C = 30 Hz;<br>
      Therefore, Substance A + 30 HZ--* Substance B.<br>
      <br>
      In the present invention, for example, the spectral pattern (e. g.
      , electromagnetic spectral pattern) of the physical catalyst"C"can
      be determined by known methods of spectroscopy. Utilizing
      spectroscopic instrumentation, the spectral pattern of the
      physical catalyst is preferably determined under conditions
      approximating those occurring in the crystallization reaction
      system using the physical catalyst (e. g. , spectral energy
      patterns as well as spectral patterns can be influenced by
      environmental reaction conditions, as discussed<br>
      <br>
      later herein). In the case of crystallization, which can be an
      autocatalytic process, B and C can be identical such that:<br>
      C = B ; and thus<br>
      B A &lt; B or<br>
      B IB--+ 2B<br>
      Spectroscopy is a process in which the energy differences between
      allowed states of any system are measured by determining the
      frequencies of the corresponding electromagnetic energy which is
      either being absorbed or emitted. Electromagnetic spectroscopy in
      general deals with the interaction of electromagnetic radiation
      with matter.<br>
      <br>
      When photons interact with, for example, atoms or molecules,
      changes in the properties of atoms and molecules are observed.<br>
      <br>
      Atoms and molecules are associated with several different types of
      motion. The entire molecule rotates, the bonds vibrate, and even
      the electrons move, albeit so rapidly that electron density
      distributions have historically been the primary focus of the
      prior art. Each of these kinds of motion is quantified. That is,
      the atom, molecule or ion can exist only in distinct states that
      correspond to discrete energy amounts. The energy difference
      between the different quantum states depends on the type of motion
      involved. Thus, the frequency of energy required to bring about a
      transition is different for the different types of motion. That
      is, each type of motion corresponds to the absorption of energy in
      different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum and different
      spectroscopic instrumentation may be required for each spectral
      region. The total motion energy of an atom or molecule may be
      considered to be at least the sum of its electronic, vibrational
      and rotational energies.<br>
      <br>
      In both emission and absorption spectra, the relation between the
      energy change in the atom or molecule and the frequency of the
      electromagnetic energy emitted or absorbed is given by the
      so-called Bohr frequency condition: dE =hv where h is Planck's
      constant; v is the frequency; and dE, is the difference of
      energies in the final and initial states.<br>
      <br>
      Electronic spectra are the result of electrons moving from one
      electronic energy level to another in an atom, molecule or ion. A
      molecular physical catalyst's spectral pattern includes not only
      electronic energy transitions but also may involve transitions
      between rotational and vibrational energy levels. As a result, the
      spectra of molecules are much more complicated than those of
      atoms. The main changes observed in the atoms or molecules after
      interaction with photons include excitation, ionization and/or
      rupture of chemical bonds, all of which may be measured and
      quantified by spectroscopic methods including emission or
      absorption spectroscopy which give the same information about
      energy level separation.<br>
      <br>
      In emission spectroscopy, when an atom or molecule is subjected to
      a flame or an electric discharge, such atoms or molecules may
      absorb energy and become"excited."On their return to
      their"normal"state they may emit radiation. Such an emission is
      the result of a transition of the atom or molecule from a high
      energy or"excited"state to one of lower state. The energy lost in
      the transition is emitted in the form of electromagnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      "Excited"atoms usually produce line spectra
      while"excited"molecules tend to produce band spectra.<br>
      <br>
      In absorption spectroscopy, the absorption of nearly monochromatic
      incident radiation is monitored as it is swept over a range of
      frequencies. During the absorption process the atoms or molecules
      pass from a state of low energy to one of high energy. Energy
      changes produced by electromagnetic energy absorption occur only
      in integral multiples of a unit amount of energy called a quantum,
      which is characteristic of each absorbing species.<br>
      <br>
      Absorption spectra may be classified into four types: rotational;
      rotation-vibration; vibrational; and electronic.<br>
      <br>
      The rotational spectrum of a molecule is associated with changes
      which occur in the rotational states of the molecule. The energies
      of the rotational states differ only by a relatively small amount,
      and hence, the frequency which is necessary to effect a change in
      the rotational levels is very low and the wavelength of
      electromagnetic energy is very large. The energy spacing of
      molecular rotational states depends on bond distances and angles.
      Pure rotational spectra are observed in the far infrared and
      microwave and radio regions (See Table 1).<br>
      <br>
      Rotation-vibrational spectra are associated with transitions in
      which the vibrational states of the molecule are altered and may
      be accompanied by changes in rotational states.<br>
      <br>
      Absorption occurs at higher frequencies or shorter wavelength and
      usually occurs in the middle of the infrared region (See Table 1).<br>
      <br>
      Vibrational spectra from different vibrational energy levels occur
      because of motion of bonds. A stretching vibration involves a
      change in the interatomic distance along the axis of the bond
      between two atoms. Bending vibrations are characterized by a
      change in the angle between two bonds. The vibrational spectra of
      a molecule are typically in the near- infrared range. It should be
      understood that the term vibrational spectra means all manner of
      bond motion spectra including, but not limited to, stretching,
      bending, librational, translational, torsional, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Electronic spectra are from transitions between electronic states
      for atoms and molecules and are accompanied by simultaneous
      changes in the rotational and vibrational states in molecules.
      Relatively large energy differences are involved, and hence
      absorption occurs at rather large frequencies or relatively short
      wavelengths. Different electronic states of atoms or molecules
      correspond to energies in the infrared, ultraviolet-visible or
      x-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum (see Table 1).<br>

      Electromagnetic radiation as a form of energy can be absorbed or
      emitted, and therefore many different types of spectroscopy may be
      used in the present invention to determine a desired spectral
      pattern of a spectral catalyst (e. g. , a spectral pattern of a
      physical catalyst) including, but not limited to, x-ray,
      ultraviolet, infrared, microwave, atomic absorption, flame
      emissions, atomic emissions, inductively coupled plasma, DC argon
      plasma, arc-source emission, spark-source emission,
      high-resolution laser, radio, Raman and the like.<br>
      <br>
      In order to study the electronic transitions, the material to be
      studied may need to be heated to a high temperature, such as in a
      flame, where the molecules are atomized and excited. Another very
      effective way of atomizing gases is the use of gaseous discharges.<br>
      <br>
      When a gas is placed between charged electrodes, causing an
      electrical field, electrons are liberated from the electrodes and
      from the gas atoms themselves and may form a plasma or plasma-like
      conditions. These electrons will collide with the gas atoms which
      will be atomized, excited or ionized. By using high frequency
      fields, it is possible to induce gaseous discharges without using
      electrodes. By varying the field strength, the excitation energy
      can be varied. In the case of a solid material, excitation by
      electrical spark or arc can be used. In the spark or arc, the
      material to be analyzed is evaporated and the atoms are excited.<br>
      <br>
      The basic scheme of an emission spectrophotometer includes a
      purified silica cell containing the sample which is to be excited.
      The radiation of the sample passes through a slit and is separated
      into a spectrum by means of a dispersion element. The spectral
      pattern can be detected on a screen, photographic film or by a
      detector.<br>
      <br>
      An atom will most strongly absorb electromagnetic energy at the
      same frequencies it emits. Measurements of absorption are often
      made so that electromagnetic radiation that is emitted from a
      source passes through a wavelength-limiting device, and impinges
      upon the physical catalyst sample that is held in a cell. When a
      beam of white light passes through a material, selected
      frequencies from the beam are absorbed. The electromagnetic
      radiation that is not absorbed by the physical catalyst passes
      through the cell and strikes a detector.<br>
      <br>
      When the remaining beam is spread out in a spectrum, the
      frequencies that were absorbed show up as dark lines in the
      otherwise continuous spectrum. The position of these dark lines
      correspond exactly to the positions of lines in an emission
      spectrum of the same molecule or atom. Both emission and
      absorption spectrophotometers are available through regular
      commercial channels.<br>
      <br>
      In 1885, Balmer discovered that hydrogen vibrates and produces
      energy at frequencies in the visible light region of the
      electromagnetic spectrum which can be expressed by a simple
      formula: 1/k = R (1/22-1/m2) when X is the wavelength of the
      light, R is Rydberg's constant and m is an integer greater than or
      equal to 3 (e. g. , 3,4, or 5, etc. ). Subsequently, Rydberg
      discovered that this equation<br>
      <br>
      could be adapted to result in all the wavelengths in the hydrogen
      spectrum by changing the 1/22 to 1/n2, as in, 1/S = R (1/n2-1/m2)
      where n is an integer 2 1, and m is an integer &gt; n+1. Thus, for
      every different number n, the result is a series of numbers for
      wavelength, and the names of various scientists were assigned to
      each such series which resulted. For instance, when n=2 and m &gt;
      3, the energy is in the visible light spectrum and the series is
      referred to as the Balmer series. The Lyman series is in the
      ultraviolet spectrum with n = 1, and the Paschen series is in the
      infrared spectrum with n = 3.<br>
      <br>
      In the prior art, energy level diagrams were the primary means
      used to describe energy levels in the hydrogen atom (see Figures
      7a and 7b).<br>
      <br>
      After determining the electromagnetic spectral pattern of a
      desired catalyst (e. g. , a physical catalyst such as a seed
      crystal), the catalytic spectral pattern may be duplicated, at
      least partially, and applied to the crystallization reaction
      system. Any generator of one or more frequencies within an
      acceptable approximate range of, for example, frequencies of
      electromagnetic radiation may be used in the present invention.
      When duplicating one or more frequencies of, for example, a
      spectral pattern (or a spectral conditioning pattern), it is not
      necessary to duplicate the frequency exactly. For instance, the
      effect achieved by a frequency of 1,000 THz, can also be achieved
      by a frequency very close to it, such as 1,001 or 999 THz. Thus,
      there will be a range above and below each exact frequency which
      will also catalyze a reaction. Specifically, Figure 12 shows a
      typical bell-curve"B"distribution of frequencies around the
      desired frequency fo, wherein desirable frequencies can be applied
      which do not correspond exactly to fo, but are close enough to the
      frequency fo to achieve a desired effect, such as those
      frequencies between and including the frequencies within the range
      of fl and f2. Note that fi and f2 correspond to about one half the
      maximum amplitude, apax, of the curve"B". Thus, whenever the
      term"exact"or specific reference to"frequency" or the like is
      used, it should be understood to have this meaning. In addition,
      harmonics of spectral catalyst (or spectral conditioning catalyst)
      frequencies, both above and below the exact spectral catalyst
      frequency (or spectral conditioning catalyst frequency), will
      cause sympathetic resonance with the exact frequency and will
      catalyze the reaction. Finally, it is possible to catalyze
      reactions by duplicating one or more of the mechanisms of action
      of the exact frequency, rather than using the exact frequency
      itself. For example, platinu<br>
      <br>
      catalyzes the formation of water from hydrogen and oxygen, in
      part, by energizing the hydroxyl radical at its frequency of
      roughly 1,060 THz. The desired reaction can also be catalyzed by
      energizing the hydroxy radical with its microwave frequency,
      thereby duplicating platinum's mechanism of action.<br>
      <br>
      An electromagnetic radiation-emitting source should have the
      following characteristics: high intensity of the desired
      wavelengths; long life; stability; and the ability to emit the
      electromagnetic energy in a pulsed and/or continuous mode.
      Moreover, in certain crystallization reaction systems, it may be
      desirable for the electromagnetic energy emitted to be capable of
      being directed to an appropriate point (or area) within at least a
      portion of the crystallization reaction system. Suitable
      techniques include optical waveguides, optical fibers, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Irradiating sources can include, but are not limited to, arc
      lamps, such as xenon-arc, hydrogen and deuterium, krypton-arc,
      high-pressure mercury, platinum, silver; plasma arcs, discharge
      lamps, such as As, Bi, Cd, Cs, Ge, Hg, K, Na, P, Pb, Rb, Sb, Se,
      Sn, Ti, Tl and Zn; hollow-cathode lamps, either single or multiple
      elements such as Cu, Pt, and Ag; and sunlight and coherent
      electromagnetic energy emissions, such as masers and lasers. A
      more complete list of irradiating sources are located in Table D.<br>
      <br>
      Masers are devices which amplify or generate electromagnetic
      energy waves with great stability and accuracy. Masers operate on
      the same principal as lasers, but produce electro-magnetic energy
      in the radio and microwave, rather than visible range of the
      spectrum. In masers, the electromagnetic energy is produced by the
      transition of molecules between rotational energy levels.<br>
      <br>
      Lasers are powerful coherent photon sources that produce a beam of
      photons having the same frequency, phase and direction, that is, a
      beam of photons that travel exactly alike.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, for example, the predetermined spectral pattern of a
      desired catalyst can be generated by a series or grouping of
      lasers producing one or more required frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      Any laser capable of emitting the necessary electromagnetic
      radiation with a frequency or frequencies of the spectral energy
      provider may be used in the present invention. Lasers are
      available for use throughout much of the spectral range. They can
      be operated in either a continuous or a pulsed mode. Lasers that
      emit lines and lasers that emit a continuum may be used in the
      present invention. Line sources may include argon ion laser, ruby
      laser, the nitrogen laser, the Nd : YAG laser, the carbon dioxide
      laser, the carbon<br>
      <br>
      monoxide laser and the nitrous oxide-carbon dioxide laser. In
      addition to the spectral lines that are emitted by lasers, several
      other lines are available, by addition or subtraction in a crystal
      of the frequency emitted by one laser to or from that emitted by
      another laser.<br>
      <br>
      Devices that combine frequencies and may be used in the present
      invention include difference frequency generators and sum
      frequency mixers. Other lasers that may be used in this invention
      include, but are not limited to: crystal, such as A1203 doped with
      Cr3+, Y3Al5012 doped with Nd3+ ; gas, such as He-Ne, Kr-ion;
      glass, chemical, such as vibrationally excited HCL and HF ; dye,
      such as Rhodamine 6G in methanol; and semiconductor lasers, such
      as Gal-xAlxAs. Many models can be tuned to various frequency
      ranges, thereby providing several different frequencies from one
      instrument and applying them to the crystallization reaction
      system (See Examples in Table 2).<br>

      The coherent light from a single laser or a series of lasers is
      simply brought to focus or introduced to the region of the
      crystallization reaction system where a desired reaction is to
      take place. The light source should be close enough to avoid
      a"dead space"in which the light does not reach the desired area in
      the crystallization reaction system, but far enough<br>
      <br>
      apart to assure complete incident-light absorption. Since
      ultraviolet sources generate heat, such sources may need to be
      cooled to maintain efficient operation. Irradiation time, causing
      excitation of one or more components in the crystallization
      reaction system, may be individually tailored for each reaction:
      some short-term for a continuous reaction with large surface
      exposure to the light source; or long light-contact time for other
      systems. In addition, exposure times and energy amplitudes or
      intensities may be controlled depending on the desired effect (e.
      g. , altered energy dynamics, ionizations, bond rupture, species
      selection, directional growth etc.).<br>
      <br>
      An object of this invention is to provide a spectral energy
      pattern (e. g. , a spectral pattern of electromagnetic energy) to
      one or more reactants in a crystallization reaction system by
      applying at least a portion of (or substantially all of) a
      required spectral energy catalyst (e. g. , a spectral catalyst)
      determined and calculated by, for example, waveform analysis of
      the spectral patterns of, for example, the reactant (s) and the
      reaction product (s).<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, in the case of a spectral catalyst, a calculated
      electromagnetic pattern will be a spectral pattern or will act as
      a spectral catalyst to generate a preferred reaction pathway
      and/or preferred reaction rate. In basic terms, spectroscopic data
      for identified substances can be used to perform a simple waveform
      calculation to arrive at, for example, the correct electromagnetic
      energy frequency, or combination of frequencies, needed to
      catalyze a reaction. In simple terms,<br>
      Au B Substance A = 50 Hz, and Substance B = 80 Hz<br>
      80 Hz-50 Hz = 30 Hz :<br>
      Therefore, Substance A + 30 Hz--- &gt; Substance B.<br>
      <br>
      The spectral energy pattern (e. g. , spectral patterns) of both
      the reactant (s) and reaction product (s) can be determined. In
      the case of a spectral catalyst, this can be accomplished by the
      spectroscopic means mentioned earlier. Once the spectral patterns
      are determined (e. g., having a specific frequency or combination
      of frequencies) within an appropriate set of environmental
      reaction conditions, the spectral energy pattern (s) (e. g. ,
      electromagnetic spectral pattern (s) ) of the spectral energy
      catalyst (e. g. , spectral catalyst) can be determined.<br>
      <br>
      Using the spectral energy pattern (s) (e. g. , spectral patterns)
      of the reactant (s) and reaction product (s), a waveform analysis
      calculation can determine the energy difference between the
      reactant (s) and reaction product (s) and at least a portion of
      the calculated spectral energy<br>
      <br>
      pattern (e. g. , electromagnetic spectral pattern) in the form of
      a spectral energy pattern (e. g. , a spectral pattern) of a
      spectral energy catalyst (e. g. , a spectral catalyst) can be
      applied to the desired reaction in a crystallization reaction
      system to cause the desired reaction to follow along the desired
      crystallization reaction pathway. The specific frequency or
      frequencies of the calculated spectral energy pattern (e. g. ,
      spectral pattern) corresponding to the spectral energy catalyst
      (e. g. , spectral catalyst) will provide the necessary energy
      input into the desired reaction in the crystallization reaction
      system to affect and initiate a desired crystallization reaction
      pathway.<br>
      <br>
      Performing the waveform analysis calculation to arrive at, for
      example, the correct electromagnetic energy frequency or
      frequencies can be accomplished by using complex algebra, Fourier
      transformation or Wavelet Transforms, which is available through
      commercial channels under the trademark Mathematica (D and
      supplied by Wolfram, Co. It should be noted that only a portion of
      a calculated spectral energy catalyst (e. g. , spectral catalyst)
      may be sufficient to catalyze a reaction or a substantially
      complete spectral energy catalyst (e. g. , spectral catalyst) may
      be applied depending on the particular circumstances.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, at least a portion of the spectral energy pattern (e.
      g. , electromagnetic pattern of the required spectral catalyst)
      may be generated and applied to the crystallization reaction
      system by, for example, the electromagnetic radiation emitting
      sources defined and explained earlier.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of this invention is to provide a spectral energy
      conditioning pattern (e. g. , a spectral conditioning pattern of
      electromagnetic energy) to one or more conditionable participants
      in a conditioning crystallization reaction system by applying at
      least a portion of (or substantially all of) a required spectral
      energy conditioning catalyst (e. g. , a spectral conditioning
      catalyst) determined and calculated by, for example, waveform
      analysis of the spectral patterns of, for example, the
      conditionable participant (s), and the conditioned participant.
      Accordingly, in the case of a spectral conditioning catalyst, a
      calculated electromagnetic conditioning pattern will be a spectral
      conditioning pattern which, when applied to a conditionable
      participant, will permit the conditioned participant to act as a
      spectral catalyst to generate a preferred reaction pathway and/or
      preferred reaction rate in a crystallization reaction system. In
      basic terms, spectroscopic data for identified substances can be
      used to perform a simple waveform calculation to arrive at, for
      example, the correct<br>
      <br>
      electromagnetic energy frequency, or combination of frequencies,
      needed to catalyze a reaction. In simple terms,<br>
      AB Conditionable substance A = 50Hz, and conditioned Substance B =
      80 Hz<br>
      80 Hz-50 Hz = 30 Hz:<br>
      Therefore, Substance A + 30 Hz- Substance B.<br>
      <br>
      The spectral energy conditioning pattern (e. g. , spectral
      conditioning pattern) of both the conditionable participant and
      the conditioned participant can be determined. In the case of a
      spectral conditioning catalyst, this can be accomplished by the
      spectroscopic means mentioned earlier. Once the spectral patterns
      are determined (e. g. , having a specific frequency or combination
      of frequencies) within an appropriate set of conditioning
      environmental reaction conditions, the spectral energy
      conditioning pattern (s) (e. g., electromagnetic spectral
      conditioning pattern (s) ) of the spectral energy conditioning
      catalyst (e. g. , spectral conditioning catalyst) can be
      determined. Using the spectral energy conditioning pattern (s) (e.
      g. , spectral conditioning patterns) of the conditionable
      participant and the conditioned participant, a waveform analysis
      calculation can determine the energy difference between the
      conditioned participant and reactant (s) or product (s) and at
      least a portion of the calculated spectral energy conditioning
      pattern (e. g. , electromagnetic spectral conditioning pattern) in
      the form of a spectral energy conditioning (e. g. , a spectral
      conditioning pattern) of a spectral energy conditioning catalyst
      (e. g. , a spectral conditioning catalyst) can be applied to the
      desired conditionable participant in a conditioning reaction
      system to subsequently result in the desired reaction in the
      crystallization reaction system once the conditioned participant
      is introduced to the crystallization reaction system. The specific
      frequency or frequencies of the calculated spectral energy
      conditioning pattern (e. g., a spectral conditioning pattern)
      corresponding to the spectral energy conditioning catalyst (e. g.
      , spectral conditioning catalyst) required to form a conditioned
      participant will provide the necessary energy input into the
      desired reaction in the crystallization reaction system to affect
      and initiate a desired reaction pathway.<br>
      <br>
      Performing the waveform analysis calculation to arrive at, for
      example, the correct electromagnetic energy frequency or
      frequencies can be accomplished by using complex algebra, Fourier

      commercial channels under the trademark Mathematica@ and supplied
      by Wolfram, Co. It<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      should be noted that only a portion of a calculated spectral
      energy conditioning catalyst (e. g., spectral conditioning

      substantially complete spectral energy conditioning catalyst (e.
      g. , spectral conditioning catalyst) may be applied depending on
      the particular circumstances.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, at least a portion of the spectral energy
      conditioning pattern (e. g., electromagnetic pattern of the
      required spectral catalyst) may be generated and applied to the
      holoreaction system by, for example, the electromagnetic radiation
      emitting sources defined and explained earlier.<br>

      The specific physical catalysts (e. g. , seed crystals, epitaxial

      <b>III. TARGETIN</b>G<br>
      <br>
      The frequency and wave nature of energy has been discussed herein.
      Additionally, Section I entitled"Wave Energies"disclosed the
      concepts of various potential interactions between different
      waves. The general concepts of"targeting", "direct resonance
      targeting", "harmonic targeting"and"non-harmonic heterodyne
      targeting" (all defined terms herein) build on these and other
      understandings.<br>
      <br>
      Targeting has been defined generally as the application of a
      spectral energy provider (e. g. , spectral energy catalyst,
      spectral catalyst, spectral energy pattern, spectral pattern,
      catalytic spectral energy pattern, catalytic spectral pattern,
      spectral environmental reaction conditions and applied spectral
      energy pattern) to a desired reaction in a crystallization
      reaction system. The application of these types of energies to a
      desired reaction can result in interaction (s) between the applied
      spectral energy provider (s) and matter (including all components
      thereof) in the crystallization reaction system. This targeting
      can result in at least one of direct resonance, harmonic
      resonance, and/or non-harmonic heterodyne resonance with at least
      a portion, for example, of at least one form of matter in a
      crystallization reaction system. In this invention, targeting
      should be generally understood as meaning applying a particular
      spectral energy provider (e. g. , a spectral energy pattern) to
      another entity comprising matter (or any component thereof) to
      achieve a particular desired result (e. g. , desired reaction
      product and/or desired reaction product at a desired reaction
      rate).<br>
      <br>
      Further, the invention provides techniques for achieving such
      desirable results without the production of, for example,
      undesirable transients, intermediates, activated complexes and/or
      reaction products (e. g. , derivative structures, impurities,
      defects, etc. ). In this regard, some limited prior art techniques
      exist which have applied certain forms of energies (as previously
      discussed) to various non-crystallization reactions. These certain
      forms of energies have been limited to direct resonance and
      harmonic resonance with some electronic frequencies and/or
      vibrational frequencies of some reactants. These limited forms of
      energies used by the prior art were due to the fact that the prior
      art lacked an adequate understanding of the spectral energy
      mechanisms and techniques disclosed herein. Further,
      crystallization prior art has typically applied general processing
      conditions such as temperature, pressure, etc. , to achieve
      desired goals. Moreover, it has often been the case in the prior
      art that at least some undesirable intermediate, transient,
      activated complex and/or reaction product was formed, and/or a
      less than optimum reaction rate for a desired crystallization
      reaction pathway occurred. The present invention overcomes the
      limitations of the prior art by specifically targeting, for
      example, various forms of matter (e. g. , seed crystals) in a
      crystallization reaction system (and/or components thereof), with,
      for example, an applied spectral energy pattern. Heretofore, such
      selective targeting of the invention was never disclosed or
      suggested. Specifically, at best, the prior art has been reduced
      to using random, trial and error environmental factors.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, whenever use of the word"targeting"is made herein, it
      should be understood that targeting does not correspond to
      undisciplined energy bands being applied to a crystallization
      reaction system; but rather to a targeted, applied spectral energy
      pattern.<br>
      <br>
      <b>IV. CONDITIONING TARGETING</b><br>
      <br>
      Conditioning targeting has been defined generally as the
      application of a spectral energy conditioning provider (e. g. ,
      spectral energy conditioning catalyst, spectral conditioning
      catalyst, spectral energy conditioning pattern, spectral
      conditioning pattern, catalytic spectral energy conditioning
      pattern, catalytic spectral conditioning pattern, spectral
      conditioning environmental reaction conditions and applied
      spectral energy conditioning pattern) to a conditionable
      participant to form at least one conditioned participant prior to
      the conditioned participant becoming involved in (e. g. ,
      introduced into and/or activated in) a crystallization reaction
      system. The application of these types of conditioning energies to
      conditionable participants to form conditioned participants, prior
      to the conditioned<br>
      <br>
      participants being introduced to a crystallization reaction
      system, can result in interaction (s) between the conditioned
      participant matter and other components in the crystallization
      reaction system (including all components thereof) so that the
      conditioned matter can then initiate and/or direct desirable
      reaction pathways and/or desirable reaction rates within a
      crystallization reaction system. This conditioning targeting can
      result in at least one of direct conditioning resonance, harmonic
      conditioning resonance, non-harmonic conditioning heterodyne
      resonance and/or non-resonance influencing with at least a portion
      of, for example, at least one form of conditionable participant
      matter (of any form) to form conditioned participant matter which
      is later introduced into, or activated in, a crystallization
      reaction system. In this invention, conditioning targeting should
      be generally understood as meaning applying a particular spectral
      energy conditioning provider (e. g. , a spectral energy
      conditioning pattern) to another conditionable entity comprising
      conditionable matter (or any component thereof) to achieve a
      particular desired result (e. g. , ultimately achieve a desired
      reaction product and/or desired reaction product at a desired
      reaction rate due to the conditioned matter being introduced into
      the crystallization reaction system. ). It should be noted that
      introduction into the crystallization reaction system should not
      be construed as meaning only a physical introduction of a
      conditioned participant that has been conditioned in a
      conditioning reaction vessel, but should also be understood as
      meaning that a conditionable participant can be conditioned in
      situ in a crystallization reaction vessel (or the reaction vessel
      per se can be conditioned) and the crystallization reaction system
      thereafter is initiated, activated, or turned on (e. g. ,
      initiated by the application of, for example, temperature,
      pressure, etc. ) once the conditioned participant is present in
      the crystallization reaction vessel. Thus, the invention provides
      techniques for achieving such desirable results without the
      production of, for example, undesirable transients, intermediates,
      activated complexes and/or reaction products (e. g. , defects,
      impurities, etc. ). The present invention teaches that by
      specifically targeting, for example, various forms of
      conditionable matter (and/or components thereof) prior to the
      conditioned matter being involved with reactions in a
      crystallization reaction system desirable results can be achieved.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, whenever use of the word"conditioning targeting"is
      made herein, it should be understood that conditioning targeting
      does not correspond to undisciplined energy bands being applied to
      a conditionable participant to form a conditioned participant
      which then becomes involved in a crystallization reaction system;
      but rather to well defined,<br>
      targeted, applied spectral energy conditioning patterns, each of
      which has a particular desirable purpose to form a conditioned
      participant so that the conditioned participant can, for example,
      permit a desired reaction pathway to be followed, and/or achieve a
      desired result and/or a desired result at a desired reaction rate
      in a crystallization reaction system. These results include
      conditioning targeting a single form of conditionable participant
      matter to form conditioned matter which, when such conditioned
      matter is activated or initiated in a crystallization reaction
      system, causes the conditioned matter to behave favorably, or
      conditioning targeting multiple forms of conditionable participant
      matter to achieve desirable results.<br>
      <br>
      <b>V. ENVIRONMENTAL REACTION CONDITIONS</b><br>
      <br>
      Environmental reaction conditions are important to understand
      because they can influence, positively or negatively,
      crystallization reaction pathways in a crystallization reaction
      system. Traditional environmental reaction conditions include
      temperature, pressure, surface area of catalysts, catalyst size
      and shape, solvents, support materials, poisons, promoters,
      concentrations, electromagnetic radiation, electric fields,
      magnetic fields, mechanical forces, acoustic fields, reaction
      vessel size, shape and composition and combinations thereof, etc.<br>
      <br>
      The following reaction can be used to discuss the effects of
      environmental reaction conditions which may need to be taken into
      account in order to cause the reaction to proceed along the simple
      reaction pathway shown below.<br>
      <br>
      C<br>
      AB<br>
      Specifically, in some instances, reactant A will not form into
      reaction product B in the presence of any catalyst C unless the
      environmental reaction conditions in the crystallization reaction
      system include certain maximum or minimum conditions of
      environmental reaction conditions such as pressure and/or
      temperature. In this regard, many reactions will not occur in the
      presence of a physical catalyst unless the environmental reactions
      conditions include, for example, an elevated temperature and/or an
      elevated pressure. In the present invention, such environmental
      reaction conditions should be taken into consideration when
      applying a particular spectral energy catalyst (e. g. , a spectral
      catalyst). Many specifics of the various environmental reaction
      conditions are discussed in greater detail in the Section herein
      entitled "Description of the Preferred Embodiments".<br>
      <br>
      <b>VI. CONDITIONING ENVIRONMENTAL REACTION CONDITIONS</b><br>
      <br>
      Conditioning environmental reaction conditions are also important
      to understand because they can also influence, positively or
      negatively, the conditioning of a conditionable participant and
      can ultimately lead to different reaction pathways in a
      crystallization reaction system when a conditioned participant is
      introduced into, or activated in, the crystallization reaction
      system. The same traditional environmental reaction conditions
      listed above also apply here, namely temperature, pressure,
      surface area of catalysts, catalyst size and shape, solvents,
      support materials, poisons, promoters, concentrations,
      electromagnetic radiation, electric fields, magnetic fields,
      mechanical forces, acoustic fields, reaction vessel size, shape
      and composition and combinations thereof, etc.<br>
      <br>
      In the present invention, such conditioning environmental reaction
      conditions should be taken into consideration when applying a
      particular spectral energy catalyst (e. g. , a spectral
      conditioning catalyst) to a conditionable participant. Similar
      environmental considerations need to be taken into account when
      the conditioned participant is introduced into a crystallization
      reaction system. Many specifics of the various environmental
      and/or conditioning environmental reaction conditions are
      discussed in greater detail in the Section herein
      entitled"Description of the Preferred Embodiments".<br>
      <br>
      <b>VII. SPECTRAL ENVIRONMENTAL REACTION CONDITIONS</b><br>
      <br>
      If it is known that certain reaction pathways will not occur
      within a crystallization reaction system (or not occur at a
      desirable rate) even when a catalyst is present unless, for
      example, certain minimum or maximum environmental reaction
      conditions are present (e. g., the temperature is lowered or
      pressure is elevated), then an additional frequency or combination
      of frequencies (i. e. , an applied spectral energy pattern) can be
      applied to the crystallization reaction system. In this regard,
      spectral environmental reaction condition (s) can be applied
      instead of, or to supplement, those environmental reaction
      conditions that are naturally present, or need to be present, in
      order for a desired crystallization reaction pathway and/or
      desired reaction rate to be followed. The environmental reaction
      conditions that can be supplemented or replaced with spectral
      environmental reaction conditions include, for example,
      temperature, pressure, surface area of catalysts, catalyst size
      and shape, solvents, support materials, poisons, promoters,
      concentrations, electric fields, magnetic fields, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, a particular frequency or combination of
      frequencies and/or fields that can produce one or more spectral
      environmental reaction conditions can be combined with<br>
      <br>
      one or more spectral energy catalysts and/or spectral catalysts to
      generate an applied spectral energy pattern which can be focussed
      on a particular area in a crystallization reaction system.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, various considerations can be taken into account for
      what particular frequency or combination of frequencies and/or
      fields may be desirable to combine with (or replace) various
      environmental reaction conditions, for example.<br>
      <br>
      As an example, in a simple reaction, assume that a first
      reactant"A"has a frequency or simple spectral pattern of 3 THz and
      a second reactant"B"has a frequency or simple spectral pattern of
      7 THz. At room temperature, no reaction occurs. However, when
      reactants A and B are exposed to high temperatures, their
      frequencies, or simple spectral patterns, both shift to 5 THz.
      Since their frequencies match, they transfer energy and a reaction
      occurs. By applying a frequency of 2 THz, at room temperature, the
      applied 2 THz frequency will heterodyne with the 3 THz pattern to
      result in, both 1 Thz and 5 THz heterodyned frequencies; while the
      applied frequency of 2 THz will heterodyne with the spectral
      pattern of 7 THz of reactant"B"and result in heterodyned
      frequencies of 5 THz and 9 THz in reactant"B". Thus, the
      heterodyned frequencies of 5 THz are generated at room temperature
      in each of the reactants"A"and"B". Accordingly, frequencies in
      each of the reactants match and thus energy can transfer between
      the reactants"A"and"B". When the energy can transfer between such
      reactants, all desirable reactions along a reaction pathway may be
      capable of being achieved. However, in certain reactions, only
      some desirable reactions along a reaction pathway are capable of
      being achieved by the application of a singular frequency. In
      these instances, additional frequencies and/or fields may need to
      be applied to result in all desirable steps along a reaction
      pathway being met, including but not limited to, the formation of
      all required reaction intermediates and/or transients.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, by applying a frequency, or combination of frequencies
      and/or fields (i. e., creating an applied spectral energy pattern)
      which corresponds to at least one spectral environmental reaction
      condition, the spectral energy patterns (e. g. , spectral patterns
      of, for example, reactant (s), intermediates, transients,
      catalysts, etc. ) can be effectively modified which may result in
      broader spectral energy patterns (e. g. , broader spectral
      patterns), in some cases, or narrower spectral energy patterns (e.
      g. , spectral patterns) in other cases. Such broader or narrower
      spectral energy patterns (e. g. , spectral patterns) may
      correspond to a broadening or narrowing of line widths in a
      spectral energy pattern (e. g. , a spectral pattern).<br>
      <br>
      As stated throughout herein, when frequencies match, energy
      transfers. In this particula<br>
      <br>
      embodiment, frequencies can be caused to match by, for example,
      broadening the spectral pattern of one or more participants in a
      crystallization reaction system. For example, as discussed in much
      greater detail later herein, the application of temperature to a
      crystallization reaction system typically causes the broadening of
      one or more spectral patterns (e. g. , line width broadening) of,
      for example, one or more reactants in the crystallization reaction
      system. It is this broadening of spectral patterns that can cause
      spectral patterns of one or more reactants to, for example,
      overlap. The overlapping of the spectral patterns can cause
      frequencies to match, and thus energy to transfer. When energy is
      transferred, reactions can occur. The scope of reactions which
      occur, include all of those reactions along any particular
      crystallization reaction pathway. Thus, the broadening of spectral
      pattern (s) can result in, for example, formation of reaction
      product, formation of and/or stimulation and/or stabilization of
      reaction intermediates and/or transients, catalyst frequencies,
      poisons, promoters, etc. All of the environmental reaction
      conditions that are discussed in detail in the section
      entitled"Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments"can be
      at least partially stimulated in a crystallization reaction system
      by the application of a spectral environmental reaction condition.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, spectral patterns can be caused to become
      non-overlapping by changing, for example, at least one spectral
      environmental reaction condition, and thus changing the applied
      spectral energy pattern. In this instance, energy will not
      transfer (or the rate at which energy transfers can be reduced)
      and reactions will not occur (or the rates of reactions can be
      slowed).<br>
      <br>
      Finally, by controlling spectral environmental reaction
      conditions, the energy dynamics within a holoreaction system may
      be controlled. For example, with a first spectral environmental
      reaction condition, a first set of frequencies may match and hence
      energy may transfer at a first set of energy levels and types.
      When the spectral environmental reaction condition is changed, a
      second set of frequencies may match, resulting in transfer of
      energy at different levels or types.<br>
      <br>
      Spectral environmental reaction conditions can be utilized to
      start and/or stop reactions in a reaction pathway. Thus, certain
      reactions can be started, stopped, slowed and/or speeded up by,
      for example, applying different spectral environmental reaction
      conditions at different times during a reaction and/or at
      different intensities. Thus, spectral<br>
      <br>
      environmental reaction conditions are capable of influencing,
      positively or negatively, reaction pathways and/or reaction rates
      in a crystallization reaction system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>VIII. SPECTRAL CONDITIONING ENVIRONMENTAL REACTION CONDITIONS</b><br>
      <br>
      Similarly, spectral conditioning environmental reaction conditions
      considerations apply in a parallel manner in this section as well.
      Specifically, if it is known that certain conditioning of a
      conditioned participant will not occur (or not occur at a
      desirable rate), unless for example, certain minimum or maximum
      conditioning environmental reaction conditions are present (e. g.
      , the temperature and/or pressure is/are elevated), then an
      additional frequency or combination of frequencies (i. e. , an
      applied spectral energy conditioning pattern) can be applied to
      the conditionable participant. In this regard, spectral
      conditioning environmental reaction condition (s) can be applied
      instead of, or to supplement, those conditioning environmental
      reaction conditions that are naturally present, or need to be
      present, in order for a desired conditioning of a conditionable
      participant to occur (i. e. , to form a desired conditioned
      participant). The conditioning environmental reaction conditions
      that can be supplemented or replaced with spectral conditioning
      environmental reaction conditions include, for example,
      temperature, pressure, surface area of catalysts, catalyst size
      and shape, solvents, support materials, poisons, promoters,
      concentrations, electric fields, magnetic fields, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, a particular frequency or combination of
      frequencies and/or fields that can produce one or more spectral
      conditioning environmental reaction conditions can be combined
      with one or more spectral energy conditioning catalysts and/or
      spectral conditioning catalysts to generate an applied spectral
      energy conditioning pattern.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, various considerations can be taken into account for
      what particular frequency or combination of frequencies and/or
      fields may be desirable to combine with (or replace) various
      conditioning environmental reaction conditions, for example.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, by applying a frequency, or combination of frequencies
      and/or fields (i. e., creating an applied spectral energy
      conditioning pattern) which corresponds to at least one spectral
      environmental conditioning reaction condition, the spectral energy
      conditioning patterns of a conditionable participant can be
      effectively modified which may result in broader spectral energy
      conditioning patterns (e. g. , broader spectral conditioning
      patterns), in some cases, or narrower spectral energy conditioning
      patterns (e. g. , spectral conditioning patterns) in other cases.
      Such broader or narrower spectral energy patterns (e. g. ,
      spectral<br>
      <br>
      conditioning patterns) may correspond to a broadening or narrowing
      of line widths in a spectral conditioning energy pattern (e. g. ,
      a spectral conditioning pattern). As stated throughout herein,
      when frequencies match, energy transfers. In this particular
      embodiment, frequencies can be caused to match by, for example,
      broadening the spectral conditioning pattern of one or more
      participants in a cell reaction system. For example, as discussed
      in much greater detail later herein, the application of
      temperature to a conditioning reaction system typically causes the
      broadening of one or more spectral conditioning patterns (e. g.,
      line width broadening) of, for example, one or more conditionable
      participants in a conditioning reaction system. It is this
      broadening of spectral conditioning patterns that can cause
      spectral conditioning patterns of one or more constituents in a
      conditioning reaction system to, for example, overlap. The
      overlapping of the spectral conditioning patterns can cause
      frequencies to match, and thus energy to transfer to result in a
      conditioned participant.<br>
      <br>
      The same conditionable participant may be conditioned with
      different spectral energy patterns or amounts to result in
      conditioned participants with different energy dynamics (e. g.,
      energized electronic level versus energized rotation). The scope
      of reactions which occur once a conditioned participant is
      introduced into a crystallization reaction system, include all of
      those reactions along any particular reaction pathway. Thus, the
      broadening of spectral conditioned pattern (s) in a conditioned
      participant can result in, for example, formation of reaction
      product, formation of and/or stimulation and/or stabilization of
      reaction intermediates and/or transients, catalyst frequencies,
      poisons, promoters, etc. , in a crystallization reaction system.
      All of the conditioning environmental reaction conditions that are
      discussed in detail in the section entitled"Detailed Description
      of the Preferred Embodiments"can be at least partially simulated
      in a conditioning reaction system by the application of a spectral
      conditioning environmental reaction condition.<br>
      <br>
      Spectral conditioning environmental reaction conditions can be
      utilized to start direct, contain and/or appropriately condition a
      conditionable participant so that the conditioned participant can
      stop reactions or reaction pathways in a crystallization reaction
      system. Thus, certain reactions can be started, stopped, slowed
      and/or speeded up in a crystallization reaction system by, for
      example, applying different spectral conditioning environmental
      reaction conditions to a conditionable participant and introducing
      the conditioned participant into a crystallization reaction system
      at different times during a reaction and/or at different
      intensities. Thus, spectral conditioning environmental reaction
      conditions are capable of<br>
      <br>
      influencing, positively or negatively, reaction pathways and/or
      reaction rates in a crystallization reaction system by providing
      different spectral energy patterns in one or more conditioned
      participants.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, by utilizing the above techniques to design (e. g. ,
      calculate or determine) a desirable spectral energy pattern, such
      as a desirable spectral pattern for a spectral energy catalyst (e.
      g. , a spectral catalyst corresponding to, for example, a seed
      crystal or an epitaxial substrate) rather than applying the
      spectral energy catalyst (e. g. , spectral catalyst) per se, for
      example, the designed spectral pattern can be used to design
      and/or determine an optimum physical and/or spectral catalyst that
      could be used in the crystallization reaction system to obtain a
      particular crystallization result. Further, the invention may be
      able to provide a recipe for a physical and/or spectral catalyst
      for a particular crystallization reaction where no catalyst
      previously existed (e. g. , certain atoms, ions, molecules and/or
      macromolecules can be influenced to crystallize in a manner which
      does not normally occur). For example in a reaction where: AoI~B
      where A = reactant, B = product and I = known intermediate, and
      there is no known catalyst, either a physical or spectral catalyst
      could be designed which, for example, resonates with the
      intermediate"I", thereby catalyzing the formation of one or more
      desirable crystallization reaction product (s).<br>
      <br>
      As a first step, the designed spectral pattern could be compared
      to known spectral patterns for existing materials to determine if
      similarities exist between the designed spectral pattern and
      spectral patterns of known materials. If the designed spectral
      pattern at least partially matches against a spectral pattern of a
      known material, then it is possible to utilize the known material
      as a physical catalyst to obtain a desired crystallization
      reaction and/or desired crystallization reaction pathway in a
      crystallization reaction system. In this regard, it may be
      desirable to utilize the known material alone or in combination
      with a spectral energy catalyst and/or a spectral catalyst. Still
      further, it may be possible to utilize environmental reaction
      conditions and/or spectral environmental reaction conditions to
      cause the known material to behave in a manner which is even
      closer to the designed energy pattern or spectral pattern.
      Further, the application of different spectral energy patterns may
      cause the designed catalyst to behave in different manners, such
      as, for example, encouraging a first crystallization reaction
      pathway with the application of a first spectral energy pattern an<br>
      <br>
      encouraging a second crystallization reaction pathway with the
      application of a second spectral energy pattern. Likewise, the
      changing of one or more environmental reaction conditions could
      have a similar effect.<br>
      <br>
      Further, this designed catalyst has applications in all types of
      reactions including, but not limited to, chemical (organic and
      inorganic), biological, physical, energy, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, in certain cases, one or more physical species
      could be used or combined in a suitable manner, for example,
      physical mixing or by a chemical reaction, to obtain a physical
      catalyst material exhibiting the appropriate designed spectral
      energy pattern (e. g., spectral pattern) to achieve a desired
      reaction pathway. Accordingly, a combination of designed catalyst
      (s) (e. g. , a physical catalyst which is known or manufactured
      expressly to function as a physical catalyst such as a seed
      crystal), spectral energy catalyst (s) and/or spectral catalyst
      (s) can result in a resultant energy pattern (e. g. , which in
      this case can be a combination of physical catalyst (s) and/or
      spectral catalyst (s) ) which is conducive to forming desired
      reaction product (s) and/or following a desired reaction pathway
      at a desired reaction rate. In this regard, various line width
      broadening and/or narrowing of spectral energy pattern (s) and/or
      spectral pattern (s) may occur when the designed catalyst is
      combined with various spectral energy patterns and/or spectral
      patterns.<br>
      <br>
      It is important to consider the energy interactions between all
      components involved in the desired reaction in a crystallization
      reaction system when calculating or determining an appropriate
      designed catalyst. There will be a particular combination of
      specific energy pattern (s) (e. g. , electromagnetic energy) that
      will interact with the designed catalyst to form an applied
      spectral energy pattern. The particular frequencies, for example,
      of electromagnetic radiation that should be caused to be applied
      to a crystallization reaction system should be as many of those
      frequencies as possible, when interacting with the frequencies of
      the designed catalyst, that can result in desirable effects to one
      or more participants in the crystallization reaction system, while
      eliminating as many of those frequencies as possible which result
      in undesirable effects within the crystallization reaction system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>X. DESIGNING CONDITIONABLE PARTICIPANTS</b><br>
      <br>
      Moreover, by utilizing the above techniques to design (e. g. ,
      calculate or determine) a desirable spectral energy pattern, such
      as a desirable spectral pattern for a spectral energy catalyst
      rather than applying the spectral energy catalyst (e. g. ,
      spectral catalyst) per se, for<br>
      <br>
      example, the designed spectral pattern can be used to design
      and/or determine an optimum physical and/or spectral catalyst that
      could be used in the crystallization reaction system to obtain a
      particular result. Further, the invention may be able to provide a
      recipe for a physical and/or spectral catalyst for a particular
      crystallization reaction where no catalyst previously existed. For
      example in a reaction where: AoI~B where A = reactant, B = product
      and I = known intermediate, and there is no known catalyst, either
      a physical or spectral catalyst could be designed which, for
      example, resonates with the intermediate"I", thereby catalyzing
      the formation of one or more desirable reaction product (s).<br>
      <br>
      As a first step, the designed spectral pattern could be compared
      to known spectral patterns for existing materials to determine if
      similarities exist between the designed spectral pattern and
      spectral patterns of known materials. If the designed spectral
      pattern at least partially matches against a spectral pattern of a
      known material, then it is possible to utilize the known material
      as a physical catalyst to obtain a desired reaction and/or desired
      reaction pathway or rate in a crystallization reaction system. In
      this regard, it may be desirable to utilize the known material
      alone or in combination with a spectral energy catalyst and/or a
      spectral catalyst. Still further, it may be possible to utilize
      environmental reaction conditions and/or spectral environmental
      reaction conditions to cause the known material to behave in a
      manner which is even closer to the designed energy pattern or
      spectral pattern. Further, the application of different spectral
      energy patterns may cause the designed catalyst to behave in
      different manners, such as, for example, encouraging a first
      reaction pathway with the application of a first spectral energy
      pattern and encouraging a second reaction pathway with the
      application of a second spectral energy pattern. Likewise, the
      changing of one or more environmental reaction conditions could
      have a similar effect.<br>
      <br>
      Further, this designed catalyst has applications in all types of
      reactions including, but not limited to, chemical (organic and
      inorganic), biological, physical, energy, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, in certain cases, one or more physical species
      could be used or combined in a suitable manner, for example,
      physical mixing or by a chemical reaction, to obtain a physical
      catalyst material exhibiting the appropriate designed spectral
      energy pattern (e. g., spectral pattern) to achieve a desired
      reaction pathway. Accordingly, a combination of designed catalyst
      (s) (e. g. , a physical catalyst which is known or manufactured
      expressly to<br>
      <br>
      function as a physical catalyst), spectral energy catalyst (s)
      and/or spectral catalyst (s) can result in a resultant energy
      pattern (e. g. , which in this case can be a combination of
      physical catalyst (s) and/or spectral catalyst (s) ) which is
      conducive to forming desired reaction product (s) and/or following
      a desired reaction pathway at a desired reaction rate. In this
      regard, various line width broadening and/or narrowing of spectral
      energy pattern (s) and/or spectral pattern (s) may occur when the
      designed catalyst is combined with various spectral energy
      patterns and/or spectral patterns.<br>
      <br>
      It is important to consider the energy interactions between all
      components involved in the desired reaction in a crystallization
      reaction system when calculating or determining an appropriate
      designed catalyst. There will be a particular combination of
      specific energy pattern (s) (e. g. , electromagnetic energy) that
      will interact with the designed catalyst to form an applied
      spectral energy pattern. The particular frequencies, for example,
      of electromagnetic radiation that should be caused to be applied
      to a crystallization reaction system should be as many of those
      frequencies as possible, when interacting with the frequencies of
      the designed catalyst, that can result in desirable effects to one
      or more participants in the cell reaction system, while
      eliminating as many of those frequencies as possible which result
      in undesirable effects within the crystallization reaction system.<br>

      <br>
      All of the above information disclosing the invention should
      provide a comprehensive understanding of the main aspects of the
      invention. However, in order to understand the invention further,
      the invention shall now be discussed in terms of some of the
      representative objects or goals to be achieved.<br>
      <br>

      6. Another object of this invention is to provide a method to
      affect and/or direct a particular crystallization reaction pathway
      in a crystallization reaction system with a spectral catalyst (e.
      g. , the spectral pattern of a seed crystal and/or an epitaxial
      substrate) by augmenting a physical catalyst comprising the steps
      of: duplicating at least a portion of a spectral pattern of a
      physical catalyst (e. g. , at least one frequency of a spectral
      pattern of the physical catalyst) with at least one energy emitter
      source to form a catalytic spectral pattern; applying to the
      crystallization reaction system, (e. g. , irradiating) at least a

      electromagnetic spectral pattern having a frequency range of from
      about radio frequency to about ultraviolet frequency) at a
      sufficient intensity and for a sufficient duration to catalyze one
      or more particular reactions in the crystallization reaction
      system; and introducing the physical catalyst (e. g. , seed

      introduced into the crystallization reaction system.<br>
      <br>
      37. Another object of this invention is to provide a method to
      affect and/or direct a reaction system with a conditioned
      participant and a spectral energy catalyst and a spectral
      environmental reaction condition, with or without a physical
      catalyst, comprising the steps of: applying or introducing at
      least one conditioned participant to the crystallization reaction
      system; applying at least one spectral energy catalyst at a
      sufficient intensity and for a sufficient duration to catalyze a
      reaction pathway; applying at last one spectral environmental
      reaction condition at a sufficient intensity and for a sufficient
      duration to catalyze a reaction pathway, whereby when any of said
      at least one conditioned participant, said at least one spectral
      energy catalyst and/or at least one spectral environmental
      reaction condition are applied at the same time, they form an
      applied spectral energy pattern; and introducing the physical
      catalyst into the crystallization reaction system.<br>
      <br>
      The above method may be practiced by introducing the physical
      catalyst into the crystallization reaction system before, and/or
      during, and/or after applying any one of, or any combination of,
      the conditioned participant and/or the spectral energy catalyst
      and/or the spectral environmental reaction condition to the
      crystallization reaction system. Likewise, the conditioned
      participant and/or the spectral energy catalyst and/or the
      spectral environmental reaction condition can be provided

      condition a conditionable participant with an applied spectral
      energy conditioning pattern and/or a spectral energy conditioning
      catalyst comprising the steps of:<br>

      applying at least one applied spectral energy conditioning pattern
      at a sufficient intensity and for a sufficient duration to
      condition the conditionable participant, whereby said at least one
      applied spectral energy conditioning pattern comprises at least
      one member selected from the group consisting of catalytic
      spectral energy conditioning pattern, catalytic spectral

      spectral energy pattern into a crystallization reaction system
      before, and/or during, and/or after introducing a conditioned
      participant into the crystallization reaction system. Moreover,
      the conditioned participant and the applied spectral energy
      pattern can be provided sequentially or continuously. If applied
      continuously, a new applied spectral energy pattern is formed.<br>
      <br>
      The above method may also comprise conditioning the conditionable
      participant in a conditioning reaction vessel and/or in a reaction
      vessel. If the conditionable participant is first conditioned in a
      reaction vessel, the conditioning occurs prior to some or all
      other components comprising the cell reaction system being
      introduced into the cell reaction system.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the reaction vessel and/or conditioning reaction vessel
      per se may be treated with conditioning energy. In the case of the

      comprising: applying at least one frequency and/or field to cause
      a conditioned spectral energy pattern (e. g. , conditioned

      pathway and/or desired reaction rate ; and designing a

      materials), that exhibit (s) a conditioned spectral pattern that
      approximates the required spectral pattern, when exposed to a
      suitable spectral energy conditioning pattern.<br>

      comprise a physical admixing of one or more materials and/or more
      materials that have been combined by an appropriate reaction, such
      as a chemical reaction. The designed conditionable participant
      material may be enhanced in function by one or more spectral
      energy conditioning patterns that may also be applied to the
      conditioning reaction system. Moreover, the application of
      different spectral energy conditioning patterns may cause the
      designed conditionable material, once conditioned, to behave in
      different manners in a crystallization reaction system, such as,
      for example, encouraging a first reaction pathway in a
      crystallization reaction system with the application of a first
      spectral energy conditioning pattern, and encouraging a second
      reaction pathway with the application of a second spectral energy
      conditioning pattern. Likewise, the changing of one or more
      environmental reaction conditions could have a similar effect.<br>
      <br>
      Further, this designed conditionable participant or material has
      applications in all types of reactions including, but not limited
      to, chemical (organic and inorganic), biological, physical, etc.<br>
      <br>
      54. It should be understood that in each of 29-53 Objects of the
      Invention, that crystallization reaction systems also include
      preventing certain crystallization phenomena from occurring, when
      desirable.<br>
      <br>
      55. Another object of the invention is to use at least one
      conditioned participant with each of the techniques set forth in
      Objects 1-28 above; and to use at least one additional spectral
      energy pattern with each of the techniques set forth in Objects
      29-54 above.<br>
      <br>
      While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory or
      explanation of operation, it is believed that when frequencies
      match, energy transfers. The transfer of energy can be a sharing
      of energy between two entities and, for example, a transfer of
      energy from one entity into another entity. The entities may both
      be, for example, matter, or one entity may be matter and the other
      energy (e. g. energy may be a spectral energy pattern such as
      electromagnetic frequencies, and/or an electric field and/or a
      magnetic field).<br>

      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      In general, thermal energy is used to drive chemical reactions by
      applying heat and increasing the temperature. The addition of heat
      increases the kinetic (motion) energy of the chemical reactants. A
      reactant with more kinetic energy moves faster and farther, and is
      more likely to take part in a chemical reaction. Mechanical energy
      likewise, by stirring and moving the chemicals, increases their
      kinetic energy and thus their reactivity. The addition of
      mechanical energy often increases temperature, by increasing
      kinetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      &lt;Desc/Clms Page number 120&gt;<br>
      <br>
      Acoustic energy is applied to chemical reactions as orderly
      mechanical waves.<br>
      <br>
      Because of its mechanical nature, acoustic energy can increase the
      kinetic energy of chemical reactants, and can also elevate their
      temperature (s). Electromagnetic (EM) energy consists of waves of
      electric and magnetic fields. Electromagnetic energy may also
      increase the kinetic energy and heat in crystallization reaction
      systems. It may energize electronic orbitals or vibrational motion
      in some reactions.<br>
      <br>
      Both acoustic and electromagnetic energy may consist of waves. The
      number of waves in a period of time can be counted. Waves are
      often drawn, as in Figure la. Usually, time is placed on the
      horizontal X-axis. The vertical Y-axis shows the strength or
      intensity of the wave. This is also called the amplitude. A weak
      wave will be of weak intensity and will have low amplitude (see
      Figure 2a). A strong wave will have high amplitude (see Figure
      2b).<br>
      <br>
      Traditionally, the number of waves per second is counted, to
      obtain the frequency.<br>
      <br>
      Frequency = Number of waves/time = Waves/second = Hz.<br>
      <br>
      Another name for"waves per second", is"hertz" (abbreviated"Hz").
      Frequency is drawn on wave diagrams by showing a different number
      of waves in a period of time (see Figure 3a which shows waves
      having a frequency of 2 Hz and 3 Hz). It is also drawn by placing
      frequency itself, rather than time, on the X-axis (see Figure 3b
      which shows the same 2 Hz and 3Hz waves plotted differently).<br>
      <br>
      Energy waves and frequency have some interesting properties, and
      may interact in some interesting ways. The manner in which wave
      energies interact, depends largely on the frequency. For example,
      when two waves of energy interact, each having the same amplitude,
      but one at a frequency of 400 Hz and the other at 100 Hz, the
      waves will add their frequencies, to produce a new frequency of
      500 Hz (i. e. , the"sum"frequency). The frequency of the waves
      will also subtract to produce a frequency of 300 HZ (i. e. , the
      "difference"frequency). All wave energies typically add and
      subtract in this manner, and such adding and subtracting is
      referred to as heterodyning. Common results of heterodyning are
      familiar to most as harmonics in music.<br>
      <br>
      There is a mathematical, as well as musical basis, to the
      harmonics produced by heterodyning. Consider, for example, a
      continuous progression of heterodyned frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      As discussed above, beginning with 400 Hz and 100 Hz, the sum
      frequency is 500 Hz and the difference frequency is 300 Hz. If
      these frequencies are further heterodyned (added and<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      subtracted) then new frequencies of 800 (i. e. , 500 + 300) and
      200 (i. e. , 500-300) are obtained.<br>
      <br>
      The further heterodyning of 800 and 200 results in 1,000 and 600
      Hz as shown in Figure 4.<br>
      <br>
      A mathematical pattern begins to emerge. Both the sum and the
      difference columns contain alternating series of numbers that
      double with each set of heterodynes. In the sum column, 400 Hz,
      800 Hz, and 1,600 Hz, alternates with 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, and 2000
      Hz. The same sort of doubling phenomenon occurs in the difference
      column.<br>
      <br>
      Heterodyning of frequencies is the natural process that occurs
      whenever waveform energies interact. Heterodyning results in
      patterns of increasing numbers that are mathematically derived.
      The number patterns are integer multiples of the original
      frequencies. These multiples are called harmonics. For example,
      800 Hz and 1600 Hz are harmonics of 400 Hz. In musical terms, 800
      Hz is one octave above 400 Hz, and 1600 Hz is two octaves higher.
      It is important to understand the mathematical heterodyne basis
      for harmonics, which occurs in all waveform energies, and thus in
      all of nature.<br>
      <br>
      The mathematics of frequencies is very important. Frequency
      heterodynes increase mathematically in visual patterns (see Figure
      5). Mathematics has a name for these visual patterns of Figure 5.
      These patterns are called fractals. A fractal is defined as a
      mathematical function which produces a series of self-similar
      patterns or numbers. Fractal patterns have spurred a great deal of
      interest historically because fractal patterns are found
      everywhere in nature. Fractals can be found in the patterning of
      large expanses of coastline, all the way down to microorganisms.
      Fractals are found in the behavior of organized insects and in the
      behavior of fluids. The visual patterns produced by fractals are
      very distinct and recognizable. A typical fractal pattern is shown
      in Figure 6.<br>
      <br>
      A heterodyne is a mathematical function, governed by mathematical
      equations, just like a fractal. A heterodyne also produces
      self-similar patterns of numbers, like a fractal. If graphed, a
      heterodyne series produces the same familiar visual shape and form
      which is so characteristic of fractals. It is interesting to
      compare the heterodyne series in Figure 5, with the fractal series
      in Figure 6.<br>
      <br>
      Heterodynes are fractals; the conclusion is inescapable.
      Heterodynes and fractals are both mathematical functions which
      produce a series of self-similar patterns or numbers.<br>
      <br>
      Wave energies interact in heterodyne patterns. Thus, all wave
      energies interact as fractal patterns. Once it is understood that
      the fundamental process of interacting energies is itself a
      fractal process, it becomes easier to understand why so many
      creatures and systems in nature<br>
      <br>
      also exhibit fractal patterns. The fractal processes and patterns
      of nature are established at a fundamental or basic level.<br>
      <br>
      * Accordingly, since energy interacts by heterodyning, matter
      should also be capable of interacting by a heterodyning process.
      All matter whether in large or small forms, has what is called a
      natural oscillatory frequency. The natural oscillatory frequency
      ("NOF") of an object, is the frequency at which the object prefers
      to vibrate, once set in motion. The NOF of an object is related to
      many factors including size, shape, dimension, and composition.<br>
      <br>
      The smaller an object is, the smaller the distance it has to cover
      when it oscillates back and forth. The smaller the distance, the
      faster it can oscillate, and the higher its NOF.<br>
      <br>
      For example, consider a wire composed of metal atoms. The wire has
      a natural oscillatory frequency. The individual metal atoms also
      have unique natural oscillatory frequencies. The NOF of the atoms
      and the NOF of the wire heterodyne by adding and subtracting, just
      the way energy heterodynes.<br>
      <br>
      NOFatom + NOFwire = Sum Frequencyatom+wire and NOFatom-NOFwire =
      Difference FrequencyatOm wire<br>
      If the wire is stimulated with the Difference Frequencyatom-wire,
      the difference frequency will heterodyne (add) with the NOFWire to
      produce NOFatom, (natural oscillatory frequency of the atom) and
      the atom will absorb with the energy, thereby becoming stimulated
      to a higher energy level. Cirac and Zoeller reported this
      phenomenon in 1995, and they used a laser to generate the
      Difference Frequency.<br>
      <br>
      Difference Frequencyatom-wire + NOFwire = NOFatom<br>
      Matter heterodynes with matter in a manner similar to the way in
      which wave energies heterodyne with other wave energies. This
      means that matter in its various states may also interact in
      fractal processes. This interaction of matter by fractal processes
      assists in explaining why so many creatures and systems in nature
      exhibit fractal processes and patterns. Matter, as well as energy,
      interacts by the mathematical equations of heterodynes, to produce
      harmonics and fractal patterns. That is why there are fractals
      everywhere around us.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, energy heterodynes with energy, and matter heterodynes with
      matter.<br>
      <br>
      However, perhaps even more important is that matter can heterodyne
      with energy (and visa versa). In the metal wire discussion above,
      the Difference Frequencyatom-wire in the<br>
      <br>
      experiment by Cirac and Zoeller was provided by a laser which used
      electromagnetic wave energy at a frequency equal to the Difference
      Frequencyatom-wire. The matter in the wire, via its natural
      oscillatory frequency, heterodyned with the electromagnetic wave
      energy frequency of the laser to produce the frequency of an
      individual atom of matter. This shows that energy and matter do
      heterodyne with each other.<br>
      <br>
      In general, when energy encounters matter, one of three
      possibilities occur. The energy either bounces off the matter (i.
      e. , is reflected energy), passes through the matter (i. e., is
      transmitted energy), or interacts and/or combines with the matter
      (e. g. , is absorbed or heterodynes with the matter). If the
      energy heterodynes with the matter, new frequencies of energy
      and/or matter will be produced by mathematical processes of sums
      and differences. If the frequency thus produced matches an NOF of
      the matter, the energy will be, at least partially, absorbed, and
      the matter will be stimulated to, for example, a higher energy
      level, (i. e. , it possesses more energy). A crucial factor which
      determines which of these three possibilities will happen is the
      frequency of the energy compared to the frequency of the matter.
      If the frequencies do not match, the energy will either be
      reflected, or will pass on through as transmitted energy. If the
      frequencies of the energy and the matter match either directly (e.
      g. , are close to each other, as discussed in greater detail later
      herein), or match indirectly (e. g. , heterodynes), then the
      energy is capable of interacting and/or combining with the matter.<br>
      <br>
      Another term often used for describing the matching of frequencies
      is resonance. In this invention, use of the term resonance will
      typically mean that frequencies of matter and/or energy match. For
      example, if the frequency of energy and the frequency of matter
      match, the energy and matter are in resonance and the energy is
      capable of combining with the matter. Resonance, or frequency
      matching, is merely an aspect of heterodyning that permits the
      coherent transfer and combination of energy with matter.<br>
      <br>
      In the example above with the wire and atoms, resonance could have
      been created with the atom, by stimulating the atom with a laser
      frequency exactly matching the NOF of the atom. In this case, the
      atom would be energized with its own resonant frequency and the
      energy would be transferred to the atom directly. Alternatively,
      as was performed in the actual wire/laser experiment, resonance
      could also have been created with the atom by using the
      heterodyning that naturally occurs between differing frequencies.
      Thus, the resonant frequency of the atom (NOFatom) can be produced
      indirectly, as an additive (or subtractive)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      heterodyned frequency, between the resonant frequency of the wire
      (NOFWire) and the applied frequency of the laser. Either direct
      resonance, or indirect resonance through heterodyned frequency
      matching, produces resonance and thus permits the combining of
      matter and energy. When frequencies match, energy transfers and
      amplitudes may increase.<br>
      <br>
      Heterodyning produces indirect resonance. Heterodyning also
      produces harmonics, (i. e., frequencies that are integer multiples
      of the resonant (NOF) frequency. For example, the music note"A"is
      approximately 440 Hz. If that frequency is doubled to about 880
      Hz, the note"A"is heard an octave higher. This first octave is
      called the first harmonic.<br>
      <br>
      Doubling the note or frequency again, from 880 Hz to 1,760 Hz (i.
      e. , four times the frequency of the original note) results in
      another"A", two octaves above the original note.<br>
      <br>
      This is called the third harmonic. Every time the frequency is
      doubled another octave is achieved, so these are the even integer
      multiples of the resonant frequency.<br>
      <br>
      In between the first and third harmonic is the second harmonic,
      which is three times the original note. Musically, this is not an
      octave like the first and third harmonics. It is an octave and a
      fifth, equal to the second"E"above the original"A". All of the odd
      integer multiples are fifths, rather than octaves. Because
      harmonics are simply multiples of the fundamental natural
      oscillatory frequency, harmonics stimulate the NOF or resonant
      frequency indirectly. Thus by playing the high"A"at 880 Hz on a
      piano, the string for middle"A"at 440 Hz should also begin to
      vibrate due to the phenomenon of harmonics.<br>
      <br>
      Matter and energy in chemical reactions respond to harmonics of
      resonant frequencies much the way musical instruments do. Thus,
      the resonant frequency of the atom (NOFatom) can be stimulated
      indirectly, using one or more of its'harmonic frequencies. This is
      because the harmonic frequency heterodynes with the resonant
      frequency of the atom itself (NOFatom).<br>
      <br>
      For example, in the wire/atom example above, if the laser is tuned
      to 800 THz and the atom resonates at 400 THz, heterodyning the two
      frequencies results in:<br>
      800 THz-400 THz = 400 THz<br>
      The 800 THz (the atom's first harmonic), heterodynes with the
      resonant frequency of the atom, to produce the atom's own resonant
      frequency. Thus the first harmonic indirectly resonates with the
      atom's NOF, and stimulates the atom's resonant frequency as a
      first generation heterodyne.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, the two frequencies will also heterodyne in the other
      direction, producing:<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      800 THz + 400 THz = 1, 200 THz<br>
      The 1,200 THz frequency is not the resonant frequency of the atom.
      Thus, part of the energy of the laser will heterodyne to produce
      the resonant frequency of the atom. The other part of the energy
      of the laser heterodynes to a different frequency, that does not
      itself stimulate the resonant frequency of the atom. That is why
      the stimulation of an object by a harmonic frequency of particular
      strength of amplitude, is typically less than the stimulation by
      its'own resonant (NOF) frequency at the same particular strength.<br>
      <br>
      Although it appears that half the energy of a harmonic is wasted,
      that is not necessarily the case. Referring again to the exemplary
      atom vibrating at 400 THz, exposing the atom to electromagnetic
      energy vibrating at 800 THz will result in frequencies subtracting
      and adding as follows:<br>
      800 THz-400 THz = 400 THz and<br>
      800 THz + 400 THz = 1, 200 THz<br>
      The 1,200 THz heterodyne, for which about 50% of the energy
      appears to be wasted, will heterodyne with other frequencies also,
      such as 800 THz. Thus,<br>
      1,200 THz-800 THz = 400 THz<br>
      Also, the 1,200 THz will heterodyne with 400 THz:<br>
      1,200 THz-400 THz = 800 THz, thus producing 800 THz, and the 800
      THz will heterodyne with 400 THz:<br>
      800 THz-400 THz = 400 THz, thus producing 400 THz frequency again.
      When other generations of heterodynes of the seemingly wasted
      energy are taken into consideration, the amount of energy
      transferred by a first harmonic frequency is much greater than the
      previously suggested 50% transfer of energy. There is not as much
      energy transferred by this approach when compared to direct
      resonance, but this energy transfer is sufficient to produce a
      desired effect (see Figure 14).<br>
      <br>
      As stated previously, Ostwald's theories on catalysts and bond
      formation were based on the kinetic theories of chemistry from the
      turn of the century. However, it should now be understood that
      chemical reactions are interactions of matter, and that matter
      interacts with other matter through resonance and heterodyning of
      frequencies; and energy can just as easily interact with matter
      through a similar processes of resonance and heterodyning. With
      the advent of spectroscopy (discussed in more detail elsewhere
      herein), it is evident that matter<br>
      <br>
      produces, for example, electromagnetic energy at the same or
      substantially the same frequencies at which it vibrates. Energy
      and matter can move about and recombine with other energy or
      matter, as long as their frequencies match, because when
      frequencies match, energy transfers. In many respects, both
      philosophically and mathematically, both matter and energy can be
      fundamentally construed as corresponding to frequency.
      Accordingly, since chemical reactions are recombinations of matter
      driven by energy, chemical reactions are in effect, driven just as
      much by frequency.<br>
      <br>
      Analysis of a typical chemical reaction should be helpful in
      understanding the normal processes disclosed herein. A
      representative reaction to examine is the formation of water from
      hydrogen and oxygen gases, catalyzed by platinum. Platinum has
      been known for some time to be a good hydrogen catalyst, although
      the reason for this has not been well understood.<br>
      <br>
      Pt<br>
      H2 + 1/202 H20<br>
      This reaction is proposed to be a chain reaction, depending on the
      generation and stabilization of the hydrogen and hydroxy
      intermediates. The proposed reaction chain is: '/2 H2<br>
      H t H+02+H2 1 t # H2O + OH- t OH-+ H2 &lt; -H+ H20<br>
      Generation of the hydrogen and hydroxy intermediates are thought
      to be crucial to this reaction chain. Under normal circumstances,
      hydrogen and oxygen gas can be mixed together for an indefinite
      amount of time, and they will not form water. Whenever the
      occasional hydrogen molecule splits apart, the hydrogen atoms do
      not have adequate energy to bond with an oxygen molecule to form
      water. The hydrogen atoms are very short-lived as<br>
      <br>
      they simply re-bond again to form a hydrogen molecule. Exactly how
      platinum catalyzes this reaction chain is a mystery to the prior
      art.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention teaches that an important step to catalyzing
      this reaction is the understanding now provided that it is crucial
      not only to generate the intermediates, but also to energize
      and/or stabilize (i. e. , maintain the intermediates for a longer
      time), so that the intermediates have sufficient energy to, for
      example, react with other components in the reaction system. In
      the case of platinum, the intermediates react with the reactants
      to form product and more intermediates (i. e. , by generating,
      energizing and stabilizing the hydrogen intermediate, it has
      sufficient energy to react with the molecular oxygen reactant,
      forming water and the hydroxy intermediate, instead of falling
      back into a hydrogen molecule).<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, by energizing and stabilizing the hydroxy intermediates,
      the hydroxy intermediates can react with more reactant hydrogen
      molecules, and again water and more intermediates result from this
      chain reaction. Thus, generating energizing and/or stabilizing the
      intermediates, influences this reaction pathway. Paralleling
      nature in this regard would be desirable (e. g. , nature can be
      paralleled by increasing the energy levels of the intermediates).<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, desirable, intermediates can be energized and/or
      stabilized by applying at least one appropriate electromagnetic
      frequency resonant with the intermediate, thereby stimulating the
      intermediate to a higher energy level. Interestingly, that is what
      platinum does (e. g., various platinum frequencies resonate with
      the intermediates on the reaction pathway for water formation).
      Moreover, in the process of energizing and stabilizing the
      reaction intermediates, platinum fosters the generation of more
      intermediates, which allows the reaction chain to continue, and
      thus catalyzes the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      As a catalyst, platinum takes advantage of many of the ways that
      frequencies interact with each other. Specifically, frequencies
      interact and resonate with each other: 1) directly, by matching a
      frequency; or 2) indirectly, by matching a frequency through
      harmonics or heterodynes. In other words, platinum vibrates at
      frequencies which both directly match the natural oscillatory
      frequencies of the intermediates, and which indirectly match their
      frequencies, for example, by heterodyning harmonics with the
      intermediates.<br>
      <br>
      Further, in addition to the specific intermediates of the reaction
      discussed above herein, it should be understood that in this
      reaction, like in all reactions, various transients or transient
      states also exist. In some cases, transients or transient states
      may only involve different bond angles between similar chemical
      species or in other cases transients may<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      involve completely different chemistries altogether. In any event,
      it should be understood that numerous transient states exist
      between any particular combination of reactant and reaction
      product.<br>
      <br>
      It should now be understood that physical catalysts produce
      effects by generating, energizing and/or stabilizing all manner of
      transients, as well as intermediates. In this regard, Figure 8a
      shows a single reactant and a single product. The
      point"A"corresponds to the reactant and the point"B"corresponds to
      the reaction product. The point"C"corresponds to an activated
      complex. Transients correspond to all those points on the curve
      between reactant"A"and product"B", and can also include the
      activated complex"C".<br>
      <br>
      In a more complex reaction which involves formation of at least
      one intermediate, the reaction profile looks somewhat different.
      In this regard, reference is made to Figure 8b, which shows
      reactant"A", product"B", activated complex"C'and C", and
      intermediate "D". In this particular example, the
      intermediate"D"exists as a minimum in the energy reaction profile
      of the reaction, while it is surrounded by the activated complexes
      C'and C".<br>
      <br>
      However, again, in this particular reaction, transients correspond
      to anything between the reactant"A"and the reaction product"B",
      which in this particular example, includes the two activated
      complexes"C"'and"C'',"as well as the intermediate"D". In the
      particular example of hydrogen and oxygen combining to form water,
      the reaction profile is closer to that shown in Figure 8c. In this
      particular reaction profile,"D""and"D'""could correspond generally
      to the intermediates of the hydrogen atom and hydroxy molecule.<br>
      <br>
      Now, with specific reference to the reaction to form water, both
      intermediates are good examples of how platinum produces resonance
      in an intermediate by directly matching a frequency. Hydroxy
      intermediates vibrate strongly at frequencies of 975 THz and 1,060
      THz. Platinum also vibrates at 975 THz and 1,060 THz. By directly
      matching the frequencies of the hydroxy intermediates, platinum
      can cause resonance in hydroxy intermediates, enabling them to be
      energized, stimulated and/or stabilized long enough to take part
      in chemical reactions. Similarly, platinum also directly matches
      frequencies of the hydrogen intermediates. Platinum resonates with
      about 10 out of about 24 hydrogen frequencies in its electronic
      spectrum (see Figure 69). Specifically, Figure 69 shows the
      frequencies of hydrogen listed horizontally across the Table and
      the frequencies of platinum listed vertically on the Table. Thus,
      by directly resonating with the intermediates in the<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      above-described reaction, platinum facilitates the generation,
      energizing, stimulating, and/or stabilizing of the intermediates,
      thereby catalyzing the desired reaction.<br>
      <br>
      Platinum's interactions with hydrogen are also a good example of
      matching frequencies through heterodyning. It is disclosed herein,
      and shown clearly in Figure 69, that many of the platinum
      frequencies resonate indirectly as harmonics with the hydrogen
      atom intermediate (e. g. , harmonic heterodynes). Specifically,
      fifty-six (56) frequencies of platinum (i. e. , 33 % of all its
      frequencies) are harmonics of nineteen (19) hydrogen frequencies
      (i. e. , 80% of its 24 frequencies). Fourteen (14) platinum
      frequencies are first harmonics (2X) of seven (7) hydrogen
      frequencies. And, twelve (12) platinum frequencies are third
      harmonics (4X) of four (4) hydrogen frequencies. Thus, the
      presence of platinum causes massive indirect harmonic resonance in
      the hydrogen atom, as well as significant direct resonance.<br>
      <br>
      Further focus on the individual hydrogen frequencies is even more
      informative.<br>
      <br>
      Figures 9-10 show a different picture of what hydrogen looks like
      when the same information used to make energy level diagrams is
      plotted as actual frequencies and intensities instead.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, the X-axis shows the frequencies emitted and
      absorbed by hydrogen, while the Y-axis shows the relative
      intensity for each frequency. The frequencies are plotted in
      terahertz (THz, 1012 Hz) and are rounded to the nearest THz. The
      intensities are plotted on a relative scale of 1 to 1,000. The
      highest intensity frequency that hydrogen atoms produce is 2,466
      THz. This is the peak of curve I to the far right in Figure 9a.
      This curve I shall be referred to as the first curve. Curve I
      sweeps down and to the right, from 2,466 THz at a relative
      intensity of 1,000 to 3,237 THz at a relative intensity of only
      about 15.<br>
      <br>
      The second curve in Figure 9a, curve II, starts at 456 THz with a
      relative intensity of about 300 and sweeps down and to the right.
      It ends at a frequency of 781 THz with a relative intensity of
      five (5). Every curve in hydrogen has this same downward sweep to
      the right. Progressing from right to left in Figure 9, the curves
      are numbered I through V; going from high to low frequency and
      from high to low intensity.<br>
      <br>
      The hydrogen frequency chart shown in Figure 10 appears to be much
      simpler than the energy level diagrams. It is thus easier to
      visualize how the frequencies are organized into the different
      curves shown in Figure 9. In fact, there is one curve for each of
      the series described by Rydberg. Curve"I"contains the frequencies
      in the Lyman series, originating<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      from what quantum mechanics refers to as the first energy level.
      The second curve from the right, curve"II", equates to the second
      energy level, and so on.<br>
      <br>
      The curves in the hydrogen frequency chart of Figure 9 are
      composed of sums and differences (i. e. , they are heterodyned).
      For example, the smallest curve at the far left, labeled curve"V",
      has two frequencies shown, namely 40 THz and 64 THz, with relative
      intensities of six (6) and four (4), respectively (see also Figure
      10). The next curve, IV, begins at 74 THz, proceeds to 114 THz and
      ends with 138 THz. The summed heterodyne calculations are thus:<br>
      40+74=114<br>
      64+74+138.<br>
      <br>
      The frequencies in curve IV are the sum of the frequencies in
      curve V plus the peak intensity frequency in curve IV.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the frequencies in curve IV, minus the frequencies
      in curve V, yield the peak of curve IV:<br>
      114-40 = 74<br>
      138-64 = 74.<br>
      <br>
      This is not just a coincidental set of sums or differences in
      curves IV and V. Every curve in hydrogen is the result of adding
      each frequency in any one curve, with the highest intensity
      frequency in the next curve.<br>
      <br>
      These hydrogen frequencies are found in both the atom itself, and
      in the electromagnetic energy it radiates. The frequencies of the
      atom and its energy, add and subtract in regular fashion. This is
      heterodyning. Thus, not only matter and energy heterodyne
      interchangeably, but matter heterodynes its'own energy within
      itself.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the highest intensity frequencies in each curve are
      heterodynes of heterodynes. For example, the peak frequency in
      Curve I of Figure 9 is 2,466 THz, which is the third harmonic of
      616 THz;<br>
      4 x 616 THz = 2, 466 THz.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, 2,466 THz is the third harmonic of 616 THz (Recall that for
      heterodyned harmonics, the result is even multiples of the
      starting frequency, i. e. , for the first harmonic 2X the original
      frequency and the third harmonic is 4X the original frequency.
      Multiplying a frequency by four (4) is a natural result of the
      heterodyning process. ) Thus, 2,466 THz is a fourth generation
      heterodyne, namely the third harmonic of 616 THz.<br>
      <br>
      The peak of curve II of Figure 9, a frequency corresponding to 456
      THz, is the third harmonic of 114 THz in curve IV. The peak of
      curve III, corresponding to a frequency of 160 THz, is the third
      harmonic of 40 THz in curve V. The peaks of the curves shown in
      Figure 9 are not only heterodynes between the curves but are also
      harmonics of individual frequencies which are themselves
      heterodynes. The whole hydrogen spectrum turns out to be an
      incestuously heterodyned set of frequencies and harmonics.<br>
      <br>
      Theoretically, this heterodyne process could go on forever. For
      example, if 40 is the peak of a curve, that means the peak is four
      (4) times a lower number, and it also means that the peak of the
      previous curve is 24 (64-40 = 24). It is possible to
      mathematically extrapolate backwards and downwards this way to
      derive lower and lower frequencies. Peaks of successive curves to
      the left are 24.2382, 15.732, and 10.786 THz, all generated from
      the heterodyne process. These frequencies are in complete
      agreement with the Rydberg formula for energy levels 6,7 and 8,
      respectively. Not much attention has historically been given by
      the prior art to these lower frequencies and their heterodyning.<br>
      <br>
      This invention teaches that the heterodyned frequency curves
      amplify the vibrations and energy of hydrogen. A low intensity
      frequency on curve IV or V has a very high intensity by the time
      it is heterodyned out to curve I. In many respects, the hydrogen
      atom is just one big energy amplification system. Moving from low
      frequencies to high frequencies, (i. e. , from curve V to curve I
      in Figure 9), the intensities increase dramatically. By
      stimulating hydrogen with 2,466 THz at an intensity of 1,000, the
      result will be 2,466 THz at 1,000 intensity. However, if hydrogen
      is stimulated with 40 THz at an intensity of 1,000, by the time it
      is amplified back out to curve I of Figure 9, the result will be
      2,466 THz at an intensity of 167,000. This heterodyning turns out
      to have a direct bearing on platinum, and on how platinum
      interacts with hydrogen. It all has to do with hydrogen being an
      energy amplification system. That is why the lower frequency
      curves are perceived as being higher energy levels. By
      understanding this process, the low frequencies of low intensity
      suddenly become potentially very significant.<br>
      <br>
      Platinum resonates with most, if not all, of the hydrogen
      frequencies with one notable exception, the highest intensity
      curve at the far right in the frequency chart of Figure 9 (i. e.,
      curve I) representing energy level 1, and beginning with 2,466
      THz. Platinum does not appear to resonate significantly with the
      ground state transition of the hydrogen atom.<br>
      <br>
      However, it does resonate with multiple upper energy levels of
      lower frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      With this information, one ongoing mystery can be solved. Ever
      since lasers were developed, the prior art chemists believed that
      there had to be some way to catalyze a reaction using lasers.
      Standard approaches involved using the single highest intensity
      frequency of an atom (such as 2,466 THz of hydrogen) because it
      was apparently believed that the highest intensity frequency would
      result in the highest reactivity. This approach was taken due to
      considering only the energy level diagrams. Accordingly, prior art
      lasers are typically tuned to a ground state transition frequency.
      This use of lasers in the prior art has been minimally successful
      for catalyzing chemical reactions. It is now understood why this
      approach was not successful. Platinum, the quintessential hydrogen
      catalyst, does not resonate with the ground state transition of
      hydrogen. It resonates with the upper energy level frequencies, in
      fact, many of the upper level frequencies. Without wishing to be
      bound by any particular theory or explanation, this is probably
      why platinum is such a good hydrogen catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      Platinum resonates with multiple frequencies from the upper energy
      levels (i. e. , the lower frequencies). There is a name given to
      the process of stimulating many upper energy levels, it is called
      a laser.<br>
      <br>
      Einstein essentially worked out the statistics on lasers at the
      turn of the century when atoms at the ground energy level (El) are
      resonated to an excited energy level (E2). Refer to the number of
      atoms in the ground state as"Ni"and the number of excited atoms
      as"N2", with the total"Ntotal". Since there are only two possible
      states that atoms can occupy: Ntotal= N1 + N2.<br>
      <br>
      After all the mathematics are performed, the relationship which
      evolves is:<br>
      N2 N2 1 ----- = ----- &lt; ----- Ntotal N1 + N2 2<br>
      In a two level system, it is predicted that there will never by
      more than 50% of the atoms in the higher energy level, E2, at the
      same time.<br>
      <br>
      If, however, the same group of atoms is energized at three (3) or
      more energy levels (i. e. , a multi-level system), it is possible
      to obtain more than 50% of the atoms energized above the first
      level. By referring to the ground and energized levels as El, E2,
      and E3, respectively, and the numbers of atoms as Ntotal, Nl, N2,
      and N3, under certain circumstances<br>
      <br>
      the number of atoms at an elevated energy level (N3) can be more
      than the number at a lower energy level (N2). When this happens,
      it is referred to as a"population inversion".<br>
      <br>
      Population inversion means that more of the atoms are at higher
      energy levels that at the lower energy levels.<br>
      <br>
      Population inversion in lasers is important. Population inversion
      causes amplification of light energy. For example, in a two-level
      system, one photon in results in one photon out.<br>
      <br>
      In a system with three (3) or more energy levels and population
      inversion, one photon in may result in 5,10, or 15 photons out
      (see Figure 11). The amount of photons out depends on the number
      of levels and just how energized each level becomes. All lasers
      are based on this simple concept of producing a population
      inversion in a group of atoms, by creating a multi- level
      energized system among the atoms. Lasers are simply devices to
      amplify electromagnetic wave energy (i. e. , light). Laser is
      actually an abbreviation for Light Amplification System for
      Emitting Radiation.<br>
      <br>
      By referring back to the interactions discussed herein between
      platinum and hydrogen, platinum energizes 19 upper level
      frequencies in hydrogen (i. e. , 80% of the total hydrogen
      frequencies). But only three frequencies are needed for a
      population inversion.<br>
      <br>
      Hydrogen is stimulated at 19. This is a clearly multi-level
      system. Moreover, consider that seventy platinum frequencies do
      the stimulating. On average, every hydrogen frequency involved is
      stimulated by three or four (i. e. , 70/19) different platinum
      frequencies; both directly resonant frequencies and/or indirectly
      resonant harmonic frequencies. Platinum provides ample stimulus,
      atom per atom, to produce a population inversion in hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, consider the fact that every time a stimulated hydrogen
      atom emits some electromagnetic energy, that energy is of a
      frequency that matches and stimulates platinum in return.<br>
      <br>
      Platinum and hydrogen both resonate with each other in their
      respective multi-level systems. Together, platinum and hydrogen
      form an atomic scale laser (i. e. , an energy amplification system
      on the atomic level). In so doing, platinum and hydrogen amplify
      the energies that are needed to stabilize both the hydrogen and
      hydroxy intermediates, thus catalyzing the reaction pathway for
      the formation of water. Platinum is such a good hydrogen catalyst
      because it forms a lasing system with hydrogen on the atomic
      level, thereby amplifying their respective energies.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Further, this reaction hints that in order to catalyze a
      crystallization reaction system and/or control the reaction
      pathway in a crystallization reaction system it is possible for
      only a single transient and/or intermediate to be formed and/or
      energized by an applied frequency (e. g., a spectral catalyst) and
      that by forming and/or stimulating at least one transient and/or
      at least one intermediate that is required to follow for a desired
      reaction pathway (e. g. , either a complex reaction or a simple
      reaction), then a frequency, or combination of frequencies, which
      result in such formation or stimulation of only one of such
      required transients and/or intermediates may be all that is
      required. Accordingly, the present invention recognizes that in
      some crystallization reaction systems, by determining at least one
      required transient and/or intermediate, and by applying at least
      one frequency which generates, energizes and/or stabilizes said at
      least one transient and/or intermediate, then all other transients
      and/or intermediates required for a reaction to proceed down a
      desired reaction pathway may be selfgenerated. However, in some
      cases, the reaction could be increased in rate by applying the
      appropriate frequency or spectral energy pattern, which directly
      stimulates all transients and/or intermediates that are required
      in order for a reaction to proceed down a desired reaction
      pathway. Accordingly, depending upon the particulars of any
      crystallization reaction system, it may be desirable for a variety
      of reasons, including equipment, environmental reaction
      conditions, etc. , to provide or apply a frequency or spectral
      energy pattern which results in the formation and/or stimulation
      and/or stabilization of any required transients and/or
      intermediates. Thus, in order to determine an appropriate
      frequency or spectral energy pattern, it is first desirable to
      determine which transients and/or intermediates are present in any
      reaction pathway. Similarly, a conditioned participant could be
      formulated to accomplish a similar task.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, once all known required transients and/or
      intermediates are determined, then, one can determine
      experimentally or empirically which transients and/or
      intermediates are essential to a reaction pathway and then
      determine, which transients and or intermediates can be
      self-generated by the stimulation and/or formation of a different
      transient or intermediate. Once such determinations are made,
      appropriate spectral energies (e. g., electromagnetic frequencies)
      can then be applied to the crystallization reaction system to
      obtain the desirable reaction product and/or desirable reaction
      pathway.<br>
      <br>
      It is known that an atom of platinum interacts with an atom of
      hydrogen and/or a hydroxy intermediate. And, that is exactly what
      modern chemistry has taught for the last one<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      hundred years, based on Ostwald's theory of catalysis. However,
      the prior art teaches that catalysts must participate in the
      reaction by binding to the reactants, in other words, the prior
      art teaches a matter: matter bonding interaction is required for
      physical catalysts. As previously stated, these reactions follow
      these steps:<br>
      1. Reactant diffusion to the catalyst site;<br>
      2. Bonding of reactant to the catalyst site;<br>
      3. Reaction of the catalyst-reactant complex;<br>
      4. Bond rupture at the catalytic site (product); and<br>
      5. Diffusion of the product away from the catalyst site.<br>
      <br>
      However, according to the present invention, for example, energy:
      energy frequencies can interact as well as energy: matter
      frequencies. Moreover, matter radiates energy, with the energy
      frequencies being substantially the same as the matter
      frequencies. So platinum vibrates at the frequency of 1,060 THz,
      and it also radiates electromagnetic energy at 1,060 THz. Thus,
      according to the present invention, the distinction between energy
      frequencies and matter frequencies starts to look less important.<br>
      <br>
      Resonance can be produced in, for example, the reaction
      intermediates by permitting them to come into contact with
      additional matter vibrating at substantially the same frequencies,
      such as those frequencies of a platinum atom (e. g. , platinum
      stimulating the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form
      water). Alternatively, according to the present invention,
      resonance can be produced in the intermediates by introducing
      electromagnetic energy corresponding to one or more platinum
      energies, which also vibrate at the same frequencies, thus at
      least partially mimicking (an additional mechanism of platinum is
      resonance with the H2 molecule, a pathway reactant) the mechanism
      of action of a platinum catalyst. Matter, or energy, it makes no
      difference as far as the frequencies are concerned, because when
      the frequencies match, energy transfers. Thus, physical catalysts
      are not required. Rather, the application of at least a portion of
      the spectral pattern of a physical catalyst may be sufficient (i.
      e. at least a portion of the catalytic spectral pattern).<br>
      <br>
      However, in another preferred embodiment, substantially all of a
      spectral pattern can be applied.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, by understanding the catalyst mechanism of action,
      particular frequencies can be applied to, for example, one or more
      reactants in a reaction system and, for example, cause the applied
      frequencies to heterodyne with existing frequencies in the matter
      itself to<br>
      <br>
      result in frequencies which correspond to one or more platinum
      catalyst or other relevant spectral frequencies. For example, both
      the hydrogen atom and the hydrogen molecule have unique
      frequencies. By heterodyning the frequencies a subtractive
      frequency can be determined:<br>
      NOF H atom-NOF H molecule = Difference H atom-molecule<br>
      The Difference H atom-molecule frequency applied to the H2
      molecule reactant will heterodyne with the molecule and energize
      the individual hydrogen atoms as intermediates.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, any reaction participant can serve as the heterodyning
      backboard for stimulation of another participant. For example,<br>
      Difference H atom-Oxygen molecule + NOF oxygen molecule = NOF H
      atom or<br>
      Difference OH-water + NOF water = NOFoH<br>
      This approach enables greater flexibility for choice of
      appropriate equipment to apply appropriate frequencies. However,
      the key to this approach is understanding catalyst mechanisms of
      action and the reaction pathway so that appropriate choices for
      application of frequencies can be made.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, whenever reference is made to, for example, a
      spectral catalyst duplicating at least a portion of a physical
      catalyst's spectral pattern, this reference is to all the
      different frequencies produced by a physical catalyst; including,
      but not necessarily limited to, electronic, vibrational,
      rotational, and NOF frequencies. To catalyze, control, and/or
      direct a chemical reaction then, all that is needed is to
      duplicate one or more frequencies from a physical catalyst, with,
      for example, an appropriate electromagnetic energy. The actual
      physical presence of the catalyst is not necessary. A spectral
      catalyst can substantially completely replace a physical catalyst,
      if desired.<br>
      <br>
      A spectral catalyst can also augment or promote the activity of a
      physical catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      The exchange of energy at particular frequencies, between
      hydrogen, hydroxy, and platinum is primarily what drives the
      conversion to water. These participants interact and create a
      miniature atomic scale lasing system that amplify their respective
      energies. The addition of these same energies to a crystallization
      reaction system, using a spectral catalyst, does the same thing.
      The spectral catalyst amplifies the participant energies by
      resonating with them and when frequencies match, energy transfers
      and the chemicals (matter) can absorb the energy. Thus, a spectral
      catalyst can augment a physical catalyst, as well as replace it.
      In so<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      doing, the spectral catalyst may increase the reaction rate,
      enhance specificity, and/or allow for the use of less physical
      catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 12 shows a basic bell-shaped curve produced by comparing
      how much energy an object absorbs, as compared to the frequency of
      the energy. This curve is called a resonance curve. As elsewhere
      herein stated, the energy transfer between, for example, atoms or
      molecules, reaches a maximum at the resonant frequency (fo). The
      farther away an applied frequency is from the resonant frequency,
      fo, the lower the energy transfer (e. g., matter to matter, energy
      to matter, etc. ). At some point the energy transfer will fall to
      a value representing only about 50% of that at the resonant
      frequency fo. The frequency higher than the resonant frequency, at
      which energy transfer is only about 50% is called"f2."The
      frequency lower than the resonant frequency, at which about 50%
      energy transfer occurs, is labeled"fl."<br>
      The resonant characteristics of different objects can be compared
      using the information from the simple exemplary resonance curve
      shown in Figure 12. One such useful characteristic is called
      the"resonance quality"or"Q"factor. To determine the resonance
      quality for an object the following equation is utilized: fi<br>
      Q= (f2-fi) Accordingly, as shown from the equation, if the
      bell-shaped resonance curve is tall and narrow, then (f2-fl) will
      be a very small number and Q, the resonance quality, will be high
      (see Figure 13a). An example of a material with a high"Q"is a high
      quality quartz crystal resonator. If the resonance curve is low
      and broad, then the spread or difference between f2 and fl will be
      relatively large. An example of a material with a low"Q"is a
      marshmallow.<br>
      <br>
      The dividing of the resonant frequency by this large number will
      produce a much lower Q value (see Figure 13b).<br>
      <br>
      Atoms and molecules, for example, have resonance curves which
      exhibit properties similar to larger objects such as quartz
      crystals and marshmallows. If the goal is to stimulate atoms in a
      reaction (e. g. , hydrogen in the reaction to produce water as
      mentioned previously) a precise resonant frequency produced by a
      crystallization reaction system component or environmental
      reaction condition (e. g. , hydrogen) can be used. It is not
      necessary to use the<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      precise frequency, however. Use of a frequency that is near a
      resonant frequency of, for example, one or more crystallization
      reaction system components or environmental reaction conditions is
      adequate. There will not be quite as much of an effect as using
      the exact resonant frequency, because less energy will be
      transferred, but there will still be an effect.<br>
      <br>
      The closer the applied frequency is to the resonant frequency, the
      more the effect. The farther away the applied frequency is from
      the resonant frequency, the less effect that is present (i. e. ,
      the less energy transfer that occurs).<br>
      <br>
      Harmonics present a similar situation. As previously stated,
      harmonics are created by the heterodyning (i. e. , adding and
      subtracting) of frequencies, allowing the transfer of significant
      amounts of energy. Accordingly, for example, desirable results can
      be achieved in chemical reactions if applied frequencies (e. g. ,
      at least a portion of a spectral catalyst) are harmonics (i. e. ,
      matching heterodynes) with one or more resonant frequency (ies) of
      one or more crystallization reaction system components or
      environmental reaction conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Further, similar to applied frequencies being close to resonant
      frequencies, applied frequencies which are close to the harmonic
      frequency can also produce desirable results.<br>
      <br>
      The amplitude of the energy transfer will be less relative to a
      harmonic frequency, but an effect will still occur. For example,
      if the harmonic produces 70% of the amplitude of the fundamental
      resonant frequency and by using a frequency which is merely close
      to the harmonic, for example, about 90% on the harmonic's
      resonance curve, then the total effect will be 90% of 70%, or
      about 63% total energy transfer in comparison to a direct resonant
      frequency. Accordingly, according to the present invention, when
      at least a portion of the frequencies of one or more
      crystallization reaction system components or environmental
      reaction conditions at least partially match, then at least some
      energy will transfer and at least some reaction will occur (i. e.
      , when frequencies match, energy transfers).<br>
      <br>
      <b>DUPLICATING THE CATALYST MECHANISM OF ACTION</b><br>
      <br>
      As stated previously, to catalyze, control, and/or direct a
      chemical reaction, a spectral catalyst can be applied. The
      spectral catalyst may correspond to at least a portion of a
      spectral pattern of a physical catalyst or the spectral catalyst
      may correspond to frequencies which form or stimulate required
      participants (e. g. , heterodyned frequencies) or the spectral
      catalyst may substantially duplicate environmental reaction
      conditions such as temperature or pressure. Thus, as now taught by
      the present invention, the actual physical presence of a catalyst
      is not required to achieve the desirable chemical reactions, phase
      transformations, or<br>
      <br>
      structural control. The obsoleting of a physical catalyst is
      accomplished by understanding the underlying mechanism inherent in
      catalysis, namely that desirable energy can be exchanged (i. e. ,
      transferred) between, for example, (1) at least one participant
      (e. g. , reactant, transient, intermediate, activated complex,
      reaction product, promoter and/or poison) and/or at least one
      component in a crystallization reaction system and (2) an applied
      spectral energy (e. g., spectral catalyst) when such energy is
      present at one or more specific frequencies. In other words, the
      targeted mechanism that nature has built into the catalytic
      process can be copied according to the teachings of the present
      invention. Nature can be further mimicked because the catalyst
      process reveals several opportunities for duplicating catalyst
      mechanisms of action, and hence improving the use of spectral
      catalysts, as well as the control of countless chemical reactions
      and transformations.<br>
      <br>
      For example, the previously discussed reaction of hydrogen and
      oxygen to produce water, which used platinum as a catalyst, is a
      good starting point for understanding catalyst mechanisms of
      action. For example, this invention discloses that platinum
      catalyzes the reaction in several ways not contemplated by the
      prior art:<br>
      Platinum directly resonates with and energizes reaction
      intermediates and/or transients (e. g. , atomic hydrogen and
      hydroxy radicals);<br>
      Platinum harmonically resonates with and energizes at least one
      reaction intermediate and or transient (e. g. , atomic hydrogen);
      and<br>
      Platinum energizes multiple upper energy levels of at least one
      reaction intermediate and or transient (e. g. , atomic hydrogen).<br>
      <br>
      This knowledge can be utilized to improve the functioning of the
      spectral catalyst and/or spectral energy catalyst, to design
      spectral catalysts and spectral energy catalysts which differ from
      actual catalytic spectral patterns, to design physical catalysts
      (or conditionable participants that can be conditioned to function
      as physical catalysts), and to optimize environmental reaction
      conditions in crystallization holoreaction systems. For example,
      the electronic frequencies of potassium are in the visible light
      regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The electronic spectra of
      virtually all atoms are in the ultraviolet, visible light, and
      infrared regions. However, these very high electromagnetic
      frequencies can be a problem for large-scale and industrial
      applications because wave energies having high frequencies
      typically do not penetrate matter very well (i. e. , do not
      penetrate far into matter).<br>
      <br>
      The tendency of wave energy to be absorbed rather than
      transmitted, can be referred to as<br>
      <br>
      attenuation. High frequency wave energies have a high attenuation,
      and thus do not penetrate far into a typical industrial scale
      reaction vessel containing typical reactants for a chemical
      reaction. Thus, the duplication and application of at least a
      portion of the spectral pattern of platinum into a commercial
      scale reaction vessel will typically be a slow process because a
      large portion of the applied spectral pattern of the spectral
      catalysts may be rapidly absorbed near the edges of the reaction
      vessel.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, in order to input energy into a large industrial-sized
      commercial reaction vessel, a lower frequency energy could be used
      that would penetrate farther into the reactants housed within the
      reaction vessel. The present invention teaches that this can be
      accomplished in a unique manner by copying nature. As discussed
      herein, the spectra of atoms and molecules are broadly classified
      into three (3) different groups: electronic, vibrational, and
      rotational.<br>
      <br>
      The electronic spectra of atoms and small molecules are said to
      result from transitions of electrons from one energy level to
      another, and have the corresponding highest frequencies, typically
      occurring in the ultraviolet (UV), visible, and infrared (IR)
      regions of the EM spectrum. The vibrational spectra are said to
      result primarily from this movement of bonds between individual
      atoms within molecules, and typically occur in the infrared and
      microwave regions. Rotational spectra occur primarily in the
      microwave and radiowave regions of the EM spectrum due, primarily,
      to the rotation of the molecules.<br>
      <br>
      Microwave or radiowave radiation could be an acceptable frequency
      to be used to spectrally control a chemical reaction or
      transformation because it would penetrate well into a large
      reaction vessel. Unfortunately, potassium atoms do not produce
      frequencies in the microwave or radiowave portions of the
      electromagnetic spectrum because they do not have vibrational or
      rotational spectra. However, by understanding the mechanism of
      action of electronic potassium frequencies in phase
      transformations, selected potassium frequencies can be used as a
      model for a spectral catalyst in the microwave portion of the
      spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, as previously discussed by an analogy of platinum,
      one mechanism of action of potassium in the mixed KC1 halide
      crystallization reaction system to produce only KCl solid crystals
      involves energizing the potassium atoms to produce resonant
      attraction and solid growth of the potassium atoms. Atomic
      potassium has a high frequency electronic spectrum without
      vibrational or rotational spectra. The NaCl and KC1 crystals, on
      the other hand, are molecules and have vibrational and rotational
      spectra as well as electronic spectra. Thus, the<br>
      <br>
      NaCl and KC1 molecules absorb and heterodyne frequencies in the
      microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, to copy the mechanism of action of potassium in the reaction
      to form solid KC1, namely resonating with at least one reaction
      participant, the potassium atom can be specifically targeted via
      resonance. However, instead of resonating with the potassium in
      its electronic spectrum, as the KC1 seed crystal does, at least
      one NaCl frequency in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic
      spectrum can be used to resonate with the NaCl nuclei. NaCl
      molecules resonate at a microwave frequency of about 13.0737 GHz.<br>
      <br>
      Energizing a mixed crystallization Na, K, and Cl with a spectral
      catalyst at about 13.0737 GHz will catalyze the formation of KC1.
      In this instance, the mechanism of action of the physical catalyst
      potassium has been partially copied and reversed and the mechanism
      has been shifted to a different region of the electromagnetic
      spectrum. In other words, by engineering the NaCl vibrational
      frequency, small NaCl molecules are energized and prevented from
      bonding to the KC1 solid. Thus, by understanding the resonant
      mechanisms involved in phase transformations, the mechanisms can
      be copied in desired regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention, by again copying the mechanism
      of action, physical catalysts (e. g. , seed crystals) frequencies
      can be adapted or selected to be convenient and/or efficient for
      the equipment available. Specifically, harmonic frequencies can be
      utilized. The potassium atom has resonant frequencies which are
      harmonics of the sodium spectral frequencies. Thus, a K spectral
      light source can resonate harmonically with the sodium (in a
      sodium crystallization system) and visa versa to enhance phase
      transformations.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, harmonic overtones of materials can be used to alter
      and control those material properties. In summary, a mechanism of
      action of a physical catalyst can be copied, duplicated or
      mimicked while moving the relevant energy frequencies, to a
      portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that matches equipment
      available for the holoreaction system and the application of
      electromagnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      The third method discussed above for platinum catalyzing this
      reaction involves energizing at least one reaction component
      multiple upper energy levels. Again, assume that the only spectral
      energy source available produces frequencies in the infra-red
      region, where many of the upper energy level electronic
      frequencies for atoms are located. These infra-red frequencies,
      for example for potassium, can be used to produce resonant
      attraction and solid<br>
      <br>
      growth of the potassium atom in, for example, a potassium covalent
      crystal. Specifically, the present invention has discovered that a
      mechanism of action that physical catalysts use is to resonate
      with multiple upper energy levels of at least one reaction
      participant. It is now understood that the use of upper energy
      levels can affect and control transformations of matter. Once
      again, nature can be mimicked by duplicating one naturally
      occurring mechanism of action by specifically targeting multiple
      energy levels with a spectral catalyst to achieve energy transfer
      in a novel manner.<br>
      <br>
      The preceding discussion on duplicating catalyst mechanisms of
      action is just the beginning of an understanding of many variables
      associated with the use of spectral catalysts.<br>
      <br>
      These additional variables should be viewed as potentially very
      useful tools for enhancing the performance of spectral energy,
      and/or physical catalysts. There are many factors and variables
      that affect both catalyst performance, and chemical reactions in
      general. For example, when the same catalyst (or conditioned
      participant) is mixed with the same reactant, but exposed to
      different environmental reaction conditions such as temperature or
      pressure, different products can be produced. Consider the
      following example: H20 + NaCl 22 74% salinity<br>
      20H H20 + NaCl 55 100% salinity<br>
      20H<br>
      The same reactants produces quite different products in these two
      reactions, namely 74% salinity or 100% salinity, depending on the
      reaction temperature.<br>
      <br>
      Many factors are known in the art which affect the direction and
      intensity and rate at a which a reaction proceeds in general.
      Temperature is but one of these factors. Other factors include
      pressure, volume, surface area of physical catalysts, solvents,
      support materials, contaminants, catalyst size and shape and
      composition, reactor vessel size, shape and composition, electric
      fields, magnetic fields, acoustic fields and whether a
      conditioning energy was introduced to a conditioned participant
      prior to the conditioned participant being involved or activated
      in a crystallization reaction system. The present invention
      teaches that these factors all have one thing in common. These
      factors are capable of changing the spectral patterns (i. e. ,
      frequency pattern) of, for example, participants and/or
      crystallization reaction system components. Some changes in
      spectra are very well studied and thus much<br>
      <br>
      information is available for consideration and application
      thereof. The prior art does not contemplate, however, the spectral
      chemistry basis for each of these factors, and how they relate to
      catalyst mechanisms of action, and chemical reactions in general.
      Further, alternatively, effects of the aforementioned factors can
      be enhanced or diminished by the application of additional
      spectral, spectral energy, and/or physical catalyst frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, these environmental reaction conditions can be at least
      partially simulated in a crystallization reaction system by the
      application of one or more corresponding spectral environmental
      reaction conditions (e. g. , a spectral energy pattern which
      duplicates at least a portion of one or more environmental
      reaction conditions). Alternatively, one spectral environmental
      reaction condition (e. g. , a spectral energy pattern
      corresponding to temperature) could be substituted for another (e.
      g. , spectral energy pattern corresponding to pressure) so long as
      the goal of matching of frequencies was met.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TEMPERATURE</b><br>
      <br>
      At very low temperatures, the spectral pattern of an atom or
      molecule has clean, crisp peaks (see Figure 15a). As the
      temperature increases, the peaks begin to broaden, producing a
      bell-shaped curve of a spectral pattern (see Figure 15b). At even
      higher temperatures, the bell-shaped curve broadens even more, to
      include more and more frequencies on either side of the primary
      frequency (see Figure 15c). This phenomenon is called"broadening".<br>
      <br>
      These spectral curves are very much like the resonance curves
      discussed in the previous section. Spectroscopists use resonance
      curve terminology to describe spectral frequency curves for atoms
      and molecules (see Figure 16). The frequency at the top of the
      curve, fo, is called the resonance frequency. There is a frequency
      (f2) above the resonance frequency and another (fl) below it (i.
      e. , in frequency), at which the energy or intensity (i. e.,
      amplitude) is 50% of that for the resonance frequency fo. The
      quantity fi-fi is a measure of how wide or narrow the spectral
      frequency curve is. This quantity (f2-fl) is the"line width". A
      spectrum with narrow curves has a small line width, while a
      spectrum with wide curves has a large line width.<br>
      <br>
      Temperature affects the line width of spectral curves. Line width
      can affect catalyst performance, chemical reactions and/or
      reaction pathways. At low temperatures, the spectral curves of
      chemical species will be separate and distinct, with a lesser
      possibility for the transfer of resonant energy between potential
      crystallization reaction system components (see Figure 17a).
      However, as the line widths of potentially reactive chemical
      species broaden,<br>
      <br>
      their spectral curves may start to overlap with spectral curves of
      other chemical species (see Figure 17b). When frequencies match,
      or spectral energy patterns overlap, energy transfers.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, when temperatures are low, frequencies do not match and
      reactions are slow. At higher temperatures, resonant transfer of
      energy can take place and reactions can proceed very quickly or
      proceed along a different reaction pathway than they otherwise
      would have at a lower temperature.<br>
      <br>
      Besides affecting the line width of the spectral curves,
      temperature also can change, for example, the resonant frequency
      of holoreaction system components. For some chemical species, the
      resonant frequency will shift as temperature changes. This can be
      seen in the infrared absorption spectra in Figure 18a and
      blackbody radiation graphs shown in Figure 18b. Further, atoms and
      molecules do not all shift their resonant frequencies by the same
      amount or in the same direction, when they are at the same
      temperature. This can also affect catalyst performance. For
      example, if a catalyst resonant frequency shifts more with
      increased temperature than the resonant frequency of its targeted
      chemical species, then the catalyst could end up matching the
      frequency of a chemical species, and resonance may be created
      where none previously existed (see Figure 18c). Specifically,
      Figure 18c shows catalyst"C"at low temperature and"C*"at high
      temperature. The catalyst"C*"resonates with reactant"A"at high
      temperatures, but not at low temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      The amplitude or intensity of a spectral line may be affected by
      temperature also. For example, linear and symmetric rotor
      molecules will have an increase in intensity as the temperature is
      lowered while other molecules will increase intensity as the
      temperature is raised. These changes of spectral intensity can
      also affect catalyst performance. Consider the example where a low
      intensity spectral curve of a catalyst is resonant with one or
      more frequencies of a specific chemical target. Only small amounts
      of energy can be transferred from the catalyst to the target
      chemical (e. g. , a hydroxy intermediate). As temperature
      increases, the amplitude of the catalyst's curve increases also.
      In this example, the catalyst can transfer much larger amounts of
      energy to the chemical target when the temperature is raised.<br>
      <br>
      If the chemical target is the intermediate chemical species for an
      alternative reaction route, the type and ratio of end products may
      be affected. By examining the above cyclohexene/palladium reaction
      again, at temperatures below 300 C, the products are benzene and
      hydrogen gas. However, when the temperature is above 300 C, the
      products are<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      benzene and cyclohexane. Temperature is affecting the palladium
      and/or other constituents in the holoreaction system (including,
      for example, reactants, intermediates, and/or products) in such a
      way that an alternative reaction pathway leading to the formation
      of cyclohexane is favored above 300 C. This could be a result of,
      for example, increased line width, altered resonance frequencies,
      or changes in spectral curve intensities for any of the components
      in the holoreaction system.<br>
      <br>
      It is important to consider not only the spectral catalyst
      frequencies one may wish to use to catalyze a reaction, but also
      the reaction conditions under which those frequencies are supposed
      to work. For example, in the palladium/cyclohexene reaction at low
      temperatures, the palladium may match frequencies with an
      intermediate for the formation of hydrogen molecules (H2). At
      temperatures above 300 C the reactants and transients may be
      unaffected, but the palladium may have an increased line width,
      altered resonant frequency and/or increased intensity. The changes
      in the line width, resonant frequency and/or intensity may cause
      the palladium to match frequencies and transfer energy to an
      intermediate in the formation of cyclohexane instead. If a
      spectral catalyst was to be used to assist in the formation of
      cyclohexane at room temperature, the frequency for the cyclohexane
      intermediate would be more effective if used, rather than the
      spectral catalyst frequency used at room temperature.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, it may be important to understand the holoreaction system
      dynamics in designing and selecting an appropriate spectral
      catalyst. The transfer of energy between different crystallization
      reaction system components will vary, depending on temperature.<br>
      <br>
      Once understood, this allows one to knowingly adjust temperature
      to optimize a reaction, reaction product, interaction and/or
      formation of reaction product at a desirable reaction rate,
      without the trial and error approaches of prior art. Further, it
      allows one to choose catalysts such as physical catalysts,
      spectral catalysts, and/or spectral energy patterns to optimize a
      desired reaction pathway. This understanding of the spectral
      impact of temperature allows one to perform customarily high
      temperature (and, sometimes high danger) chemical processes at
      safer, room temperatures. It also allows one to design physical
      catalysts which work at much broader temperature ranges (e. g. ,
      frigid arctic temperatures or hot furnace temperatures), as
      desired.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>PRESSURE</b><br>
      <br>
      Pressure and temperature are directly related to each other.
      Specifically, from the ideal gas law, we know that<br>
      PV = nRT where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of
      moles of gas, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute
      temperature. Thus, at equilibrium, an increase in temperature will
      result in a corresponding increase in pressure. Pressure also has
      an effect on spectral patterns.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, increases in pressure can cause broadening and
      changes in spectral curves, just as increases in temperature do
      (see Figure 19 which shows the pressure broadening effects on the
      NH3 3.3 absorption line).<br>
      <br>
      Mathematical treatments of pressure broadening are generally
      grouped into either collision or statistical theories. In
      collision theories, the assumption is made that most of the time
      an atom or molecule is so far from other atoms or molecules that
      their energy fields do not interact. Occasionally, however, the
      atoms or molecules come so close together that they collide. In
      this case, the atom or molecule may undergo a change in wave phase
      (spectral) function, or may change to a different energy level.
      Collision theories treat the matter's emitted energy as occurring
      only when the atom or molecule is far from others, and is not
      involved in a collision. Because collision theories ignore
      spectral frequencies during collisions, collision theories fail to
      predict accurately chemical behavior at more than a few
      atmospheres of pressure, when collisions are frequent.<br>
      <br>
      Statistical theories, however, consider spectral frequencies
      before, during and after collisions. They are based on calculating
      the probabilities that various atoms and/or molecules are
      interacting with, or perturbed by other atoms or molecules. The
      drawback with statistical treatments of pressure effects is that
      the statistical treatments do not do a good job of accounting for
      the effects of molecular motion. In any event, neither collision
      nor statistical theories adequately predict the rich interplay of
      frequencies and heterodynes that take place as pressure is
      increased. Experimental work has demonstrated that increased
      pressure can have effects similar to those produced by increased
      temperature, by:<br>
      1) broadening of the spectral curve, producing increased line
      width; and<br>
      2) shifting of the resonant frequency (fo).<br>
      <br>
      Pressure effects different from those produced by temperatures
      are: (1) pressure changes typically do not affect intensity, (see
      Figure 20 which shows a theoretical set of<br>
      <br>
      curves exhibiting an unchanged intensity for three applied
      different pressures) as with temperature changes; and (2) the
      curves produced by pressure broadening are often less symmetric
      than the temperature-affected curves. Consider the shape of the
      three theoretical curves shown in Figure 20. As the pressure
      increases, the curves become less symmetrical.<br>
      <br>
      A tail extending into the higher frequencies develops. This upper
      frequency extension is confirmed by the experimental work shown in
      Figure 21. Specifically, Figure 21a shows a pattern for the
      absorption by water vapor in air (lOg of H20 per cubic meter); and
      Figure 21b shows the absorption in NH3 at 1 atmosphere pressure.<br>
      <br>
      Pressure broadening effects on spectral curves are broadly grouped
      into two types: resonance or"Holtsmark"broadening,
      and"Lorentz"broadening. Holtsmark broadening is secondary to
      collisions between atoms of the same element, and thus the
      collisions are considered to be symmetrical. Lorentz broadening
      results from collisions between atoms or molecules which are
      different. The collisions are asymmetric, and the resonant
      frequency, fo, is often shifted to a lower frequency. This shift
      in resonant frequency is shown in Figure 20.<br>
      <br>
      The changes in spectral curves and frequencies that accompany
      changes in pressure can affect catalysts, both physical and
      spectral, and chemical reactions and/or reaction pathways.<br>
      <br>
      At low pressures, the spectral curves tend to be fairly narrow and
      crisp, and nearly symmetrical about the resonant frequency.
      However, as pressures increase, the curves may broaden, shift, and
      develop high frequency tails.<br>
      <br>
      At low pressures the spectral frequencies in the crystallization
      reaction system might be so different for the various atoms and
      molecules that there may be little or no resonant effect, and thus
      little or no energy transfer. At higher pressures, however, the
      combination of broadening, shifting and extension into higher
      frequencies can produce overlapping between the spectral curves,
      resulting in the creation of resonance, where none previously
      existed, and thus, the transfer of energy. The crystallization
      reaction system may proceed down one reaction pathway or another,
      depending on the changes in spectral curves produced by various
      pressure changes. One reaction pathway may be resonant and proceed
      at moderate pressure, while another reaction pathway may be
      resonant and predominate at higher pressures. As with temperature,
      it is important to consider the crystallization reaction system
      frequencies and mechanisms of action of various catalysts under
      the environmental reaction conditions one wishes to duplicate.
      Specifically, in order for an efficient transfer of energy to<br>
      occur between, for example, a spectral catalyst and at least one
      reactant in a crystallization reaction system, there must be at
      least some overlap in frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      For example, a reaction with a physical catalyst seed crystal at
      400 THz and a key covalent adatom at 500 THz may proceed slowly at
      atmospheric pressure. Where the pressure is raised to about five
      (5) atmospheres, the catalyst broadens out through the 500 THz,
      for example, of the adatom. This allows the transfer of energy
      between the catalyst and adatom by, for example, energizing and
      stimulating the adatom. The crystallization reaction then proceeds
      very quickly. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory
      or explanation, it appears that, the speed of the reaction has
      much less to do with the number of collisions (as taught by the
      prior art) than it has to do with the spectral patterns of the
      crystallization reaction system components. In the above example,
      the reaction could be energized at low pressures by applying the
      500 THz frequency to directly stimulate and attract the key
      adatom. This could also be accompanied indirectly using various
      heterodynes, (e. g. , @ 1,000 THz harmonic, or a 100 THz
      non-harmonic heterodyne between the catalyst and transient (500
      THz-400 THz = 100 THz.).<br>
      <br>
      As shown herein, the transfer of energy between different
      crystallization reaction system components will vary, depending on
      pressure. Once understood, this allows one to knowingly adjust
      pressure to optimize a reaction, without the trial and error
      approaches of prior art. Further, it allows one to choose
      catalysts such as physical catalysts, seed crystals, epitaxial
      substrates, spectral catalysts, and/or spectral energy patterns to
      optimize one or more desired reaction pathways. This understanding
      of the spectral impact of pressure allows one to perform
      customarily high pressure (and thus, typically, high danger)
      chemical processes at safer, room pressures. It also allows one to
      design physical catalysts which work over a large range of
      acceptable pressures (e. g. , low pressures approaching a vacuum
      to several atmospheres of pressure).<br>
      <br>
      <b>SURFACE AREA</b><br>
      <br>
      Traditionally, the surface area of a catalyst has been considered
      to be important because the available surface area controls the
      number of available binding sites.<br>
      <br>
      Supposedly, the more exposed binding sites, the more catalysis. In
      light of the spectral mechanisms disclosed in the present
      invention, surface area may be important for another reason.<br>
      <br>
      Many of the spectral catalyst frequencies that correspond to
      physical catalysts are electronic frequencies in the visible light
      and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum. These high frequencies
      have relatively poor penetrance into, for example, large reaction
      vessels that contain one or more reactants. The high frequency
      spectral emissions from a catalyst such as a seed crystal will
      thus not travel very far into such a crystallization reaction
      system before such spectral emissions are absorbed. Thus, for
      example, an atom or molecule must be fairly close to a physical
      catalyst so that their respective electronic frequencies can
      interact.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, surface area primarily affects the probability that a
      particular chemical species, will be close enough to the physical
      catalyst to interact with its electromagnetic spectra emission (s)
      and in the case of crystallization, be attracted to the catalyst
      as an adatom. With small surface area, few atoms or molecules will
      be close enough to interact. However, as surface area increases,
      so too does the probability that more atoms or molecules will be
      within range for reaction. Thus, in addition to increasing the
      available number of binding sites, larger surface area probably
      increases the volume of the crystallization reaction system
      exposed to the spectral catalyst frequencies or patterns. This is
      similar to the concept of assuring adequate penetration of a
      spectral catalyst into a crystallization reaction system (e. g.,
      assuming that there are adequate opportunities for species to
      interact with each other).<br>
      <br>
      An understanding of the effects of surface area on catalysts and
      crystallization reaction system components allows one to knowingly
      adjust surface area, spectral emission, and other crystallization
      reaction system components to optimize a reaction, reaction
      pathway and/or formation of reaction product (s), at a desirable
      reaction rate, without the drawbacks of the prior art. For
      instance, surface area is currently optimized by making
      traditional chemical catalyst particles as small as possible,
      thereby maximizing the overall surface area. The small particles
      have a tendency to, for example, sinter (merge or bond together)
      which decreases the overall surface area and catalytic activity.
      Rejuvenation of a large surface area catalyst can be a costly and
      time-consuming process. This process can be avoided with an
      understanding of the herein presented invention in the field of
      spectral chemistry. For example, assume a reaction is quickly
      catalyzed by a 3 m2 catalyst bed (in a transfer of energy from
      catalyst to a key reactant and product). After sintering takes
      place, however, the surface area is reduced to 1 m2. Thus, the
      transfer of energy from the catalyst is dramatically reduced, and
      the reaction slows down. The costly and time-consuming process of
      rejuvenating the surface area can be avoided (or at least delayed)
      by inhibiting the<br>
      <br>
      crystallization reaction system (i. e. , sintering) with one or
      more desirable spectral energy patterns. In addition, because
      spectral energy patterns can affect the final physical form or
      phase of a material, as well as its chemical formula, the
      sintering process itself may be reduced or eliminated.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the penetrance of spectral frequencies into a
      crystallization reaction system can be enhanced, creating
      a"virtually"enlarged surface. For example, in a metal alloy
      crystallization reaction system, spectral frequencies of a desired
      metal in the alloy can be transmitted onto the seed crystal. These
      spectral frequencies may act to extent the effective spectral
      emissions of the metal many times further than would normally
      occur with typical attenuation. Crystallizing species will be
      attracted by resonance from much further away, enhancing formation
      of the alloy. These same methods can be used to control
      selectivity of crystallization, such as ratios or symmetry of
      species within a material, such as an alloy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CATALYST SIZE AND SHAPE</b><br>
      <br>
      In a related line of reasoning, catalyst size and shape are
      classically thought to affect physical catalyst activity.
      Crystallization controlled by critical nucleus size has
      historically been used to steer transformation pathways. As with
      surface area, certain particle sizes (e. g., critical nuclei) are
      thought to provide a stable structure and thus maximize the
      transformation rate and amount. The relationship between size and
      surface area has been previously discussed.<br>
      <br>
      In light of the current understanding of the spectral mechanisms
      underlying the activity of physical catalysts and transformations
      in general, catalyst size and shape may be important for other
      reasons. One of those reasons is a phenomenon called"self
      absorption".<br>
      <br>
      When a single atom or molecule produces its'classical spectral
      pattern it radiates electromagnetic energy which travels outward
      from the atom or molecule into neighboring space. Figure 22a shows
      radiation from a single atom versus radiation from a group of
      atoms as shown in Figure 22b. As more and more atoms or molecules
      group together, radiation from the center of the group is absorbed
      by its'neighbors and may never make it out into space. Depending
      on the size and shape of the group of atoms, self absorption can
      cause a number of changes in the spectral emission pattern (see
      Figure 23). Specifically, Figure 23a shows a normal spectral curve
      produced by a single atom; Figure 23b shows a resonant frequency
      shift due to self absorption; Figure 23c shows a self-reversal
      spectral pattern produced by self absorption in a group of atoms
      and Figure 23d shows a self-reversal spectral<br>
      <br>
      pattern produced by self absorption in a group of atoms. These
      changes include a shift in resonant frequency and self-reversal
      patterns.<br>
      <br>
      The changes in spectral curves and frequencies that accompany
      changes in catalyst (e. g. , seed crystal) size and shape can
      affect catalysts, chemical transformations and/or reaction
      pathways. For example, atoms or molecules of a physical catalyst
      may produce spectral frequencies in the crystallization reaction
      system which resonate with a key intermediate and/or reaction
      product. With larger groups of atoms, such as in a forming
      crystal, the combination of resonant frequency shifting and
      self-reversal may eliminate overlapping between the spectral
      curves of chemical species, thereby minimizing or destroying
      conditions of resonance, and for example slowing the rate of
      crystallization.<br>
      <br>
      A crystallization reaction system may proceed down one reaction
      pathway or another, depending on the changes in spectral curves
      produced by the particle sizes. For example, a catalyst (or
      conditioned participant) having a moderate particle size may
      proceed down a first reaction pathway while a larger size catalyst
      may direct the reaction down another reaction pathway.<br>
      <br>
      The changes in spectral curves and frequencies that accompany
      changes in catalyst size and shape are relevant for practical
      applications<br>
      The use of spectral catalysts according to the present invention
      allows for much finer tuning of these processes. For example, the
      high level of catalyst activity obtained with a smaller catalyst
      size can still be obtained by, for example, augmenting the
      physical catalyst with at least a portion of one or more spectral
      catalyst (s).<br>
      <br>
      For example, assume that a 10 um average particle size catalyst
      (e. g. , seed crystal) has 50% of the activity of a 5 um average
      particle size catalyst. One approach to maintain desired rates of
      crystallization is to use the 10 u. m physical catalyst and
      augment the physical catalyst with at least a portion of at least
      one spectral catalyst. Catalyst activity can be effectively
      doubled (or increased even more) by the spectral catalyst,
      resulting in approximately the same degree of activity (or perhaps
      even greater activity) as with the 5um catalyst. Thus, the present
      invention permits the size of the catalyst to be changed, while
      retaining favorable conditions so that the reaction can be
      performed economically, compared to traditional prior art
      approaches.<br>
      <br>
      Another manner to approach the issue is to eliminate the physical
      catalyst completely.<br>
      <br>
      For example, in another embodiment of the invention, a fiberoptic
      sieve, (e. g. , one with very<br>
      <br>
      large pores) can be used in a flow-through reactor vessel.
      According to the present invention, the spectral catalyst can be
      emitted through the fiberoptic sieve, thus catalyzing the reacting
      species as they flow by. This improvement over the prior art
      approaches has significant processing implications including lower
      costs, higher rates and improved safety, to mention only a few.<br>
      <br>
      Materials are also manufactured in a range of shapes, as well as
      sizes. Shapes include spheres, irregular granules, pellets,
      extrudate, and rings. Some shapes are more expensive to
      manufacture than others, while some shapes have superior
      properties (e. g. , material activity, strength, etc. ) than
      others. While spheres are inexpensive to manufacture, a packed bed
      of spheres produces high-pressure drops and the spheres are
      typically not very strong.<br>
      <br>
      Traditional physical catalyst rings on the other hand, have
      superior strength and activity and produce very little pressure
      drop, but they are also relatively expensive to produce.<br>
      <br>
      Spectral energy catalysts permit a greater flexibility in choosing
      shape, for example, in a traditional chemical catalyst. For
      example, instead of using a packed bed of inexpensive spheres,
      with the inevitable high pressure drop and resulting mechanical
      damage to the catalyst particles, catalyst rings can be used while
      obtaining the same or greater catalyst activity. Using the
      spectral crystallization techniques described herein, particularly
      those related to directional growth, the shape of formed materials
      can be more easily controlled.<br>
      <br>
      The use of spectral energy catalysts and/or spectral environmental
      reaction conditions to control shape of materials has the
      following advantages: - permit the use of less expensive shaped
      material particles; - permit the use of fewer particles overall; -
      permit the use of stronger shapes of particles; and - permit the
      use of particle shapes with more desirable performance
      characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      Their use to replace existing physical catalysts has similar
      advantages: - eliminate the use and expense of catalyst particles
      (e. g. , seed crystals) altogether; - allow use of spectral
      catalyst delivery systems that are faster; and - delivery systems
      can be designed to incorporate superior materials characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      Catalyst size and shape are also important to spectral emission
      patterns because all objects have an NOF depending on their size
      and shape. The smaller an object is in dimension, the higher its
      NOF will be in frequency (because speed = length x frequency).<br>
      <br>
      Also, two (2) objects of the same size, but different shape will
      have different NOF's (e. g. , the<br>
      <br>
      resonant NOF frequency of a 1.0 m diameter sphere, is different
      from the NOF for a 1.0 m edged cube). Wave energies (both acoustic
      and EM) will have unique resonant frequencies for particular
      objects. The objects, such as physical catalyst particles or
      powder granules of reactants in a slurry, will act like antennas,
      absorbing and emitting energies at their structurally resonant
      frequencies. With this understanding, one is further able to
      manipulate and control the size and shape of crystallization
      reaction system components (e. g. , physical catalysts, reactants,
      etc. ) to achieve desired effects. For example, a transient for a
      desired reaction pathway may produce a spectral rotational
      frequency of 30 GHz. Catalyst spheres 1cm in diameter with
      structural EM resonant frequency of 30 GHz (3xlO8m/s lx10~2m =
      30x109Hz), can be used to direct the reaction. The catalyst
      particles will structurally resonate with the rotational frequency
      of the transient, providing energy to the transient and
      controlling the reaction. Likewise, the structurally resonant
      catalyst particles may be further energized by a spectral energy
      catalyst, such as, for example, 30 GHz microwave radiation.<br>
      <br>
      Thus understood, the spectral dynamics of chemical transformations
      can be much more precisely controlled than in prior art trial and
      error approaches.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SOLVENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      Typically, the term solvent is applied to mixtures for which the
      solvent is a liquid, however, it should be understood that
      solvents may also comprise solids, liquids, gases or plasmas
      and/or mixtures and/or components thereof. The prior art typically
      groups liquid solvents into three broad classes: aqueous, organic,
      and non-aqueous. If an aqueous solvent is used, it means that the
      solvent is water. Organic solvents include hydrocarbons such as
      alcohols and ethers. Non-aqueous solvents include inorganic
      non-water substances. Many chemical transformations take place in
      solvents.<br>
      <br>
      Because solvents are themselves composed of atoms, molecules
      and/or ions they can have pronounced effects on chemical
      transformations. Solvents are comprised of matter and they emit
      their own spectral frequencies. The present invention teaches that
      these solvent frequencies undergo the same basic processes
      discussed earlier, including heterodyning, resonance, and
      harmonics. Spectroscopists have known for years that a solvent can
      dramatically affect the spectral frequencies produced by
      its'solutes. Likewise, chemists have known for years that solvents
      can affect catalyst activity and material properties. However, the
      spectroscopists and chemists in the prior art have apparently not
      associated these long studied changes in solute frequencies with
      changes in catalyst activity and material<br>
      <br>
      properties. The present invention recognizes that these changes in
      solute spectral frequencies can affect catalyst activity and
      chemical reactions and/or reaction pathways in general.<br>
      <br>
      Changes of curve intensity, gradual or abrupt shifting of the
      resonant frequency fo, and even abrupt rearrangement of resonant
      frequencies can occur.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the present invention recognizes that one or more
      spectral frequencies in a solvent may be targeted by a spectral
      energy pattern or spectral energy conditioning pattern to change
      one or more properties of the solvent, and hence may change the
      reaction and energy dynamics in a holoreaction system. Similarly,
      a spectral energy pattern or a spectral energy conditioning
      pattern may be applied to a solute, causing a change in one or
      more properties of the solute, solvent, or solute/solvent system,
      and hence may change the reaction and energy dynamics in a
      holoreaction systems.<br>
      <br>
      When reviewing Figure 24a, the solid line represents a portion of
      the spectral pattern of phthalic acid in alcohol while the dotted
      line represents phthalic acid in the solvent hexane.<br>
      <br>
      Consider a phase reaction taking place in alcohol, in which the
      spectral catalyst resonates with phthalic acid at a frequency of
      1,250, the large solid curve in the middle. If the solvent is
      changed to hexane, the phthalic acid no longer resonates at a
      frequency of 1,250 and the spectral catalyst can not stimulate and
      energize its phase transformation. The change in solvent will
      render the spectral catalyst ineffective.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, in reference to Figure 24b, iodine produces a high
      intensity curve at 580 when dissolved in carbon tetrachloride, as
      shown in curve B. In alcohol, as shown by curve A the iodine
      produces instead, a moderate intensity curve at 1,050 and a low
      intensity curve at 850. Accordingly, assume that a reaction uses a
      spectral catalyst that resonates directly with the iodine in
      carbon tetrachloride at 580 for an organohalide crystallization.
      If the spectral catalyst does not change and the solvent is
      changed to alcohol, the spectral catalyst will no longer function
      because frequencies no longer match and energy will not transfer.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, the spectral catalyst's frequency of 580 will no
      longer match and resonate with the new iodine frequencies of 850
      and 1,050.<br>
      <br>
      There is also the possibility that the change in the solvent could
      bring the catalyst into resonance with a different chemical
      species and help the reaction proceed down an alternative reaction
      pathway.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, consider the graph in Figure 24c, which shows a variety
      of solvent mixtures ranging from 100% benzene at the far left, to
      a 50: 50 mixture of benzene and alcohol in the<br>
      <br>
      center, to 100% alcohol at the far right. The solute is
      phenylazophenol. The phenylazophenol has a frequency of 855-860
      for most of the solvent mixtures. For a 50: 50 benzene: alcohol
      mixture the frequency is 855; or for a 98: 2 benzene: alcohol
      mixture the frequency is still 855. However, at 99.5 : 0.5
      benzene: alcohol mixture, the frequency abruptly changes to about
      865. A spectral catalyst active in 100% benzene by resonating with
      the phenylazophenol at 865, will lose its activity if there is
      even a slight amount of alcohol (e. g., 0.5%) in the solvent.<br>
      <br>
      Thus understood, the principles of spectral chemistry presented
      herein can be applied to catalysis, and reactions and/or reaction
      pathways in general. Instead of using the prior art trial and
      error approach to the choice of solvents and/or other
      crystallization reaction system components, solvents can be
      tailored and/or modified to optimize the spectral environmental
      reaction conditions. For example, a reaction may be designed to
      have a key reaction participant (e. g. , reaction vessel) which
      resonates at 400 THz, while the catalyst (e. g. , seed crystal)
      resonates at 800 THz transferring energy harmonically. A more
      efficient system could be designed with a different solvent that
      may cause the resonant frequencies of both the participant and the
      catalyst to abruptly shift to 600 THz. There the catalyst would
      resonate directly with the participant, transferring even more
      energy, and catalyzing the crystallization reaction system more
      efficiently.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the properties of solvents, solutes, and solvent/solute
      systems may be affected by spectral energy providers. Water is the
      universal solvent. It is commonly known and understood that if
      water is heated, its kinetic energy increases, and hence, the rate
      at which solutes dissolve also increases. After a solute has been
      added to a solvent, such as water, physical properties such as pH
      and conductivity change at a rate related to their kinetic energy
      and the temperature of the solute/solvent system.<br>
      <br>
      A novel aspect of the present invention is the understanding that
      the properties of solvents, solutes and solvent/solute systems may
      be affected and controlled by spectral energy providers outside
      the realm of simple thermal or kinetic mechanisms. For example,
      water at about 28 C will dissolve salt (sodium chloride) at a
      particular rate. Water at about 28 C which has been conditioned
      with its own vibrational overtones will dissolve salt faster, even
      though there is no apparent difference in temperature. Similarly,
      if salt is added to water, there is a predictable rate of change
      in the pH and conductivity of the solution. If the water is
      conditioned or spectrally activated with its own vibrational
      overtones, either before<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      or after, respectively, the addition of the salt, the rate of
      change of pH and conductivity is enhanced even though there is no
      difference in temperature. These effects are shown in greater
      detail in the Examples section herein.<br>
      <br>
      Further, if the salt is conditioned with some of its own
      electronic frequencies prior to adding it to water, the rate of
      change of conductivity is again enhanced, even though there is
      again no apparent difference in temperature. These effects are
      shown in greater detail in the Examples section herein.<br>
      <br>
      In general, delivery of spectral energy patterns and/or spectral
      energy conditioning patterns to solvents, solutes: and
      solvent/solute systems may change the energy dynamics of the
      solvent and/or solute and hence their properties in a holoreaction
      system. These spectral techniques disclosed herein can be used to
      control many aspects of matter transformations such as chemical
      reactions, phase changes, and material properties (all of which
      are described in the Examples section herein).<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUPPORT MATERIALS</b><br>
      <br>
      Traditional physical catalysts can be either unsupported or
      supported. An unsupported catalyst is a formulation of the pure
      catalyst, with substantially no other molecules present.
      Unsupported catalysts are rarely used industrially because these
      catalysts generally have low surface area and hence low activity.
      The low surface area can result from, for example, sintering, or
      coalescence of small molecules of the catalyst into larger
      particles in a process which reduces surface tension of the
      particles. An example of an unsupported catalyst is platinum alloy
      gauze, which is sometimes used for the selective oxidation of
      ammonia to nitric oxide. Another example is small silver granules,
      sometimes used to catalyze the reaction of methanol with air, to
      form formaldehyde. When the use of unsupported catalysts is
      possible, their advantages include straightforward fabrication and
      relatively simple installation in various industrial processes.<br>
      <br>
      A supported catalyst is a formulation of the catalyst with other
      particles, the other particles acting as a supporting skeleton for
      the catalyst. Traditionally, the support particles are thought to
      be inert, thus providing a simple physical scaffolding for the
      catalyst molecules. Thus, one of the traditional functions of the
      support material is to give the catalyst shape and mechanical
      strength. The support material is also said to reduce sintering
      rates. If the catalyst support is finely divided similar to the
      catalyst, the support will act as a "spacer"between the catalyst
      particles, and hence prevent sintering. An alternative theory<br>
      <br>
      holds that an interaction takes place between the catalyst and
      support, thereby preventing sintering. This theory is supported by
      the many observations that catalyst activity is altered by changes
      in support material structure and composition.<br>
      <br>
      Supported catalysts are generally made by one or more of the
      following three methods: impregnation, precipitation, and/or
      crystallization. Impregnation techniques use preformed support
      materials, which are then exposed to a solution containing the
      catalyst or its precursors. The catalyst or precursors diffuse
      into the pores of the support. Heating, or another conversion
      process, drives off the solvent and transforms the catalyst or
      precursors into the final catalyst. The most common support
      materials for impregnation are refractory oxides such as aluminas
      and aluminum hydrous oxides. These support materials have found
      their greatest use for catalysts that must operate under extreme
      conditions such as steam reforming, because they have reasonable
      mechanical strengths.<br>
      <br>
      Precipitation techniques use concentrated solutions of catalyst
      salts (e. g. , usually metal salts). The salt solutions are
      rapidly mixed and then allowed to precipitate in a finely divided
      form. The precipitate is then prepared using a variety of
      processes including washing, filtering, drying, heating, and
      pelleting. Often a graphitic lubricant is added.<br>
      <br>
      Precipitated catalysts have high catalytic activity secondary to
      high surface area, but they are generally not as strong as
      impregnated catalysts.<br>
      <br>
      Traditional crystallization techniques produce support materials
      called zeolites. The structure of these crystallized catalyst
      zeolites is based on Si04 and A104 (see Figure 25a which shows the
      tetrahedral units of silicon; and Figure 25b which shows the
      tetrahedral units of aluminum). These units link in different
      combinations to form structural families, which include rings,
      chains, and complex polyhedra. For example, the Si04 and A104
      tetrahderal units can form truncated octahedron structures, which
      form the building blocks for A, X, and Y zeolites (see Figure 26a
      which shows a truncated octahedron structure with lines
      representing oxygen atoms and corners are Al or Si atoms; Figure
      26b which shows zeolite with joined truncated octahedrons joined
      by oxygen bridges between square faces; and Figure 26c which shows
      zeolites X and Y with joined truncated octahedrons joined by
      oxygen bridges between hexagonal faces).<br>
      <br>
      The crystalline structure of zeolites gives them a well defined
      pore size and structure.<br>
      <br>
      This differs from the varying pore sizes found in impregnated or
      precipitated support<br>
      <br>
      materials. Zeolite crystals are made by mixing solutions of
      silicates and aluminates and the catalyst. Crystallization is
      generally induced by heating (see spectral effects of temperature
      in the Section entitled"Temperature"). The structure of the
      resulting zeolite depends on the silicon/aluminum ratio, their
      concentration, the presence of added catalyst, the temperature,
      and even the size of the reaction vessels used, all of which are
      environmental reaction conditions. Zeolites generally have greater
      specificity than other catalyst support materials (e. g. , they do
      not just speed up the reaction). They also may steer the reaction
      towards a particular reaction pathway.<br>
      <br>
      Spectral crystallization methods can be used to affect and control
      the formation of desired materials such as, for example, zeolites.
      The processes taught herein can, for example, crystallize
      materials faster, more economically, in greater numbers, with more
      convenient environmental factors (e. g. , lower temperatures for
      zeolite), with more precise control of poisons or promoters, and
      with desired material properties, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Support materials can affect the activity of a catalyst.
      Traditionally, the prior art has attributed these effects to
      geometric factors. However, according to the present invention,
      there are spectral factors to consider as well. It has been well
      established that solvents affect the spectral patterns produced by
      their solutes. Solvents can be liquids, solids, gases and/or
      plasmas Support materials can, in many cases, be viewed as nothing
      more than solid solvents for catalysts. As such, support materials
      can affect the spectral patterns produced by their solute
      catalysts.<br>
      <br>
      Just as dissolved sugar can be placed into a solid phase solvent
      (ice), catalysts can be placed into support materials that are
      solid phase solvents. These support material solid solvents can
      have similar spectral effects on catalysts that liquid solvents
      have. Support materials can change spectral frequencies of their
      catalyst solutes by, for example, causing spectral curve
      broadening, changing of curve intensity, gradual or abrupt
      shifting of the resonant frequency fo, and even abrupt
      rearrangement of resonant frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      Further, uses of spectral techniques to affect matter
      transformations are not limited to solvent/solute or
      support/catalysts systems, but rather apply broadly to all
      material systems and phases of matter, and their respective
      properties (e. g. , chemical, physical, electrical, magnetic,
      thermal, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      The use of targeted spectral techniques in numerous materials
      systems (including solid, liquid and gas to control chemical
      reactions, phase changes and material properties<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      (e. g. , chemical physical, electrical, thermal, etc. ) is
      described more fully in the Examples section later herein.<br>
      <br>
      Support materials can be simply viewed as solid solvents for their
      catalyst solutes.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention teaches that spectral techniques can be used
      to control many aspects of matter transformation in solvent/solute
      systems such as chemical reactions, phase changes, and material
      properties. Similarly, spectral techniques can be used to control
      many aspects such as chemical reactions, phase changes, and
      material properties of support/catalyst systems. These spectral
      techniques can be used to affect the synthesis of support/catalyst
      systems, or to affect the subsequent properties of the
      support/catalyst system in a holoreaction system.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, in transformations of matter, substrates are often
      used as a base for the growth of a desired species (e. g. ,
      epitaxial substrates). The methods taught herein can be used to
      control and direct interactions of materials with substrates. For
      example, if the spectral frequencies of a crystallization reaction
      system participant are caused to emanate from an amorphous surface
      (which traditionally does not support formation of the desired
      crystalline species), crystals may be caused to form and adhere to
      that surface. In this manner, it should be understood that methods
      applied to support materials apply also to substrates of all
      kinds.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, due to the disclosure herein, it should become clear to an
      artisan of ordinary skill that changes in support materials can
      have dramatic effects on catalyst activity. The support materials
      affect the spectral frequencies produced by the catalysts. The
      changes in catalyst spectral frequencies produce varying effects
      on chemical reactions and catalyst activity, including
      accelerating the rate of reaction and also guiding the reaction on
      a particular reaction path. Thus support materials can potentially
      influence the matching of frequencies and can thus favor the
      possibility of transferring energy between crystallization
      reaction system components and/or spectral energy patterns, thus
      permitting certain reactions to occur.<br>
      <br>
      <b>POISONING</b><br>
      <br>
      Poisoning of catalysts occurs when the catalyst activity is
      reduced by adding a small amount of another constituent, such as a
      chemical species. The prior art has attributed poisoning to
      chemical species that contain excess electrons (e. g. , electron
      donor materials)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      and to adsorption of poisons onto the physical catalyst surface
      where the poison physically blocks reaction sites. However,
      neither of these theories satisfactorily explains poisoning.<br>
      <br>
      Consider the case of nickel hydrogenation catalysts. These
      physical catalysts are substantially deactivated if only 0. 1%
      sulphur compounds by weight are adsorbed onto them.<br>
      <br>
      It is difficult to believe that 0. 1 % sulphur by weight could
      contribute so many electrons as to inactivate the nickel catalyst.
      Likewise, it is difficult to believe that the presence of 0. 1%
      sulphur by weight occupies so many reaction sites that it
      completely deactivates the catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, neither prior art explanation is satisfying.<br>
      <br>
      Poisoning phenomena can be more logically understood in terms of
      spectral chemistry. In reference to the example in the Solvent
      Section using a benzene solvent and phenylazophenol as the solute,
      in pure benzene the phenylazophenol had a spectral frequency of
      865 Hz. The addition of just a few drops of alcohol (0.5%)
      abruptly changed the phenylazophenol frequency to 855. If the
      expectation was for the phenylazophenol to resonate at 865, then
      the alcohol would have poisoned that particular reaction. The
      addition of small quantities of other chemical species can change
      the resonant frequencies (fo) of catalysts and reacting chemicals.
      The addition of another chemical species can act as a poison to
      take the catalyst and reacting species out of resonance (i. e. ,
      the presence of the additional species can remove any substantial
      overlapping of frequencies and thus prevent any significant
      transfer of energy).<br>
      <br>
      Besides changing resonant frequencies of chemical species, adding
      small amounts of other chemicals can also affect the spectral
      intensities of the catalyst and, for example, other atoms and
      molecules in the crystallization reaction system by either
      increasing or decreasing the spectral intensities. Consider
      cadmium and zinc mixed in an alumina-silica precipitate (see
      Figure 27 which shows the influences of copper and bismuth on the
      zinc/cadmium line ratio). A normal ratio between the cadmium 3252.
      5 spectral line and the zinc 3345.0 spectral line was determined.
      The addition of sodium, potassium, lead, and magnesium had little
      or no effect on the Cd/Zn intensity ratio. However, the addition
      of copper reduced the relative intensity of the zinc line and
      increased the cadmium intensity. Conversely, addition of bismuth
      increased the relative intensity of the zinc line while decreasing
      cadmium.<br>
      <br>
      Also, consider the effect of small amounts of magnesium on a
      copper-aluminum mixture (see Figure 28 which shows the influence
      of magnesium on the copper aluminum intensity ratio). Magnesium
      present at 0.6%, caused significant reductions in line intensity<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      for copper and for aluminum. At 1.4% magnesium, the spectral
      intensities for both copper and aluminum were reduced by about a
      third. If the copper frequency is important for catalyzing a
      reaction, adding this small amount of magnesium would dramatically
      reduce the catalyst activity. Thus, it could be concluded that the
      copper catalyst had been poisoned by the magnesium.<br>
      <br>
      In summary, poisoning effects on catalysts are due to spectral
      changes. Adding a small amount of another chemical species to a
      physical catalyst and/or crystallization reaction system can
      change the resonance frequencies or the spectral intensities of
      one or more chemical species (e. g. , reactant). The catalyst
      might remain the same, while a crucial intermediate is changed.
      Likewise, the catalyst might change, while the intermediate stays
      the same. They might both change, or they might both stay the same
      and be oblivious to the added poison species. This understanding
      is important to achieving the goals of the present invention which
      include targeting species to cause an overlap in frequencies, or
      in this instance, specifically targeting one or more species so as
      to prevent any substantial overlap in frequencies and thus prevent
      reactions from occurring by blocking the transfer of energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PROMOTERS</b><br>
      <br>
      Just as adding a small amount of another chemical species to a
      catalyst and crystallization reaction system can poison the
      activity of the catalyst, the opposite can also happen. When an
      added species enhances the activity of a catalyst, it is called a
      promoter.<br>
      <br>
      For instance, adding a few percent calcium and potassium oxide to
      iron-alumina compounds promotes activity of the iron catalyst for
      ammonia synthesis. Promoters act by all the mechanisms discussed
      previously in the Sections entitled Solvents, Support Materials,
      and Poisoning. Not surprisingly, some support materials actually
      are promoters. Promoters enhance catalysts and specific reactions
      and/or reaction pathways by changing spectral frequencies and
      intensities. While a catalyst poison takes the reacting species
      out of resonance (i. e. , the frequencies do not overlap), the
      promoter brings them into resonance (i. e., the frequencies do
      overlap). Likewise, instead of reducing the spectral intensity of
      crucial frequencies, the promoter may increase the crucial
      intensities.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, if it was desired for phenylazophenol to react at 855 in a
      benzene solvent, alcohol could be added and the alcohol would be
      termed a promoter. If it was desired for the phenylazophenol too
      react at 865, alcohol could be added and the alcohol could be
      considered a poison. Thus understood, the differences between
      poisons and promoters are a<br>
      <br>
      matter of perspective, and depend on which reaction pathways
      and/or reaction products are desired. They both act by the same
      underlying spectral chemistry mechanisms of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, in crystallization and material transformation systems,
      addition of small amounts of other species can change reaction
      dynamics. For example, NaCl structure can be modified from cubic
      to pyramidal or octahedral by the addition of small amounts of
      boron.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, spectral irradiation (and hence activation) of NaCl
      solution through a boron containing substrate (borosilicate glass)
      may cause typical boron modification of NaCl structure to become
      pyramidal or octahedral, even though no boron is physically
      present in the solution. A spectral boron pattern can substitute
      for the effects of a boron crystallizing agent in the actual
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      Thus understood, poisons, promoters, and all manner of
      crystallization agents affect crystallization reaction system
      pathways through spectral mechanisms, which can be duplicated,
      approximated, or initiated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CONCENTRATIONS</b><br>
      <br>
      Concentrations of chemical species are known to affect reaction
      rates and dynamics.<br>
      <br>
      Concentration also affects catalyst activity. The prior art
      explains these effects by the probabilities that various chemical
      species will collide with each other. At high concentrations of a
      particular species, there are many individual atoms or molecules
      present.<br>
      <br>
      The more atoms or molecules present, the more likely they are to
      collide with something else.<br>
      <br>
      However, this statistical treatment by the prior art does not
      explain the entire situation.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 29 shows various concentrations of N-methyl urethane in a
      carbon tetrachloride solution. At low concentrations, the spectral
      lines have a relatively low intensity. However, as the
      concentration is increased, the intensities of the spectral curves
      increase also. At 0.01 molarity, the spectral curve at 3,460 cm-1
      is the only prominent frequency. However, at 0.15 molarity, the
      curves at 3,370 and 3,300 caf are also prominent.<br>
      <br>
      As the concentration of a chemical species is changed, the
      spectral character of that species in the reaction mixture changes
      also. Suppose that 3,300 and 3,370 cri 1 are important frequencies
      for a desired reaction pathway. At low concentrations the desired
      reaction pathway will not occur. However, if the concentrations
      are increased (and hence the intensities of the relevant
      frequencies) the reaction will proceed down the desired pathway.<br>
      Concentration is also related to solvents, support structures,
      poisons and promoters, as previously discussed.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, as discussed previously, the intensity of spectral
      emissions in a holoreaction system affects species attraction and
      phase transformations. The effects of increased concentration can
      be mimiclced spectrally. For example, crystallization can be
      caused to occur in unsaturated solutions, wherein crystallization
      does not normally occur.<br>
      <br>
      Further, by controlling the material transformation spectrally in
      the absence of the inherently chaotic process which normally takes
      place in a saturated solution, structure and morphology can be
      more easily controlled.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FINE STRUCTURE FREQUENCIES</b><br>
      <br>
      The field of science concerned generally with measuring the
      frequencies of energy and matter, known as spectroscopy, has
      already been discussed herein. Specifically, the three broad
      classes of atomic and molecular spectra were reviewed. Electronic
      spectra, which are due to electron transitions, have frequencies
      primarily in the ultraviolet (UV), visible, and infrared (IR)
      regions, and occur in atoms and molecules. Vibrational spectra,
      which are due to, for example, bond motion between individual
      atoms within molecules, are primarily in the IR, and occur in
      molecules. Rotational spectra are due primarily to rotation of
      molecules in space and have microwave or radiowave frequencies,
      and also occur in molecules.<br>
      <br>
      The previous discussion of various spectra and spectroscopy has
      been oversimplified.<br>
      <br>
      There are actually at least three additional sets of spectra,
      which comprise the spectrum discussed above herein, namely, the
      fine structure spectra and the hyperfine structure spectra and the
      superfine structure spectra. These spectra occur in atoms and
      molecules, and extend, for example, from the ultraviolet down to
      the low radio regions. These spectra are often mentioned in prior
      art chemistry and spectroscopy books typically as an aside,
      because prior art chemists typically focus more on the traditional
      types of spectroscopy, namely, electronic, vibrational, and
      rotational.<br>
      <br>
      The fine and hyperfine spectra are quite prevalent in the areas of
      physics and radio astronomy. For example, cosmologists map the
      locations of interstellar clouds of hydrogen, and collect data
      regarding the origins of the universe by detecting signals from
      outerspace, for example, at 1.420 GHz, a microwave frequency which
      is one of the hyperfine splitting frequencies for hydrogen. Most
      of the large databases concerning the microwave and radio
      frequencies of molecules and atoms have been developed by
      astronomers and physicists,<br>
      rather than by chemists. This apparent gap between the use by
      chemists and physicists, of the fine and hyperfine spectra in
      chemistry, has apparently resulted in prior art chemists not
      giving much, if any, attention to these potentially useful
      spectra.<br>
      <br>
      Referring again to Figures 9a and 9b, the Balmer series (i. e. ,
      frequency curve II), begins with a frequency of 456 THz (see
      Figure 30a). Closer examination of this individual frequency shows
      that instead of there being just one crisp narrow curve at 456
      THz, there are really seven different curves very close together
      that comprise the curve at 456 THz. The seven (7) different curves
      are fine structure frequencies. Figure 30b shows the emission
      spectrum for the 456 THz curve in hydrogen. A high-resolution
      laser saturation spectrum, shown in Figure 31, gives even more
      detail. These seven different curves, which are positioned very
      close together, are generally referred to as a multiplet.<br>
      <br>
      Although there are seven different fine structure frequencies
      shown, these seven frequencies are grouped around two major
      frequencies. These are the two, tall, relatively high intensity
      curves shown in Figure 30b. These two high intensity curves are
      also shown in Figure 31 at zero cm' (456.676 THz), and at relative
      wavenumber 0.34 cm~l (456. 686 THz).<br>
      <br>
      What appears to be a single frequency of (456 THz), is actually
      composed predominantly of two slightly different frequencies
      (456.676 and 456.686 THz), and the two frequencies are typically
      referred to as doublet and the frequencies are said to be split.
      The difference or split between the two predominant frequencies in
      the hydrogen 456 THz doublet is 0.010 THz (100 THz) or 0.34 crri 1
      wavnumbers. This difference frequency, 10 GHz, is called the fine
      splitting frequency for the 456 THz frequency of hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the individual frequencies that are typically shown in
      ordinary electronic spectra are composed of two or more distinct
      frequencies spaced very close together. The distinct frequencies
      spaced very close together are called fine structure frequencies.
      The difference, between two fine structure frequencies that are
      split apart by a very slight amount, is a fine splitting frequency
      (see Figure 32 which shows fl and f2 which comprise fo and which
      are shown as underneath fo. The difference between fl and 2 is
      known as the fine splitting frequency). This"difference"between
      two fine structure frequencies is important because such a
      difference between any two frequencies is a heterodyne.<br>
      <br>
      Almost all the hydrogen frequencies shown in Figures 9a and 9b are
      doublets or multiplets. This means that almost all the hydrogen
      electronic spectrum frequencies have fine structure frequencies
      and fine splitting frequencies (which means that these heterodynes<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      are available to be used as spectral catalysts, if desired). The
      present invention discloses that these"differences"or heterodynes
      can be quite useful for certain reactions. However, prior to
      discussing the use of these heterodynes, in the present invention,
      more must be understood about these heterodynes. Some of the fine
      splitting frequencies (i. e. , heterodynes) for hydrogen are
      listed in Table 3. These fine splitting heterodynes range from the
      microwave down into the upper reaches of the radio frequency
      region.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      There are more than 23 fine splitting frequencies (i. e. ,
      heterodynes) for just the first series or curve I in hydrogen.
      Lists of the fine splitting heterodynes can be found, for example,
      in the classic 1949 reference"Atomic Energy Levels"by Charlotte
      Moore. This reference also lists 133 fine splitting heterodyned
      intervals for carbon, whose frequencies range from 14.1 THz (473.3
      cm l) down to 12.2. GHz (0.41 cm-1). Oxygen has 287 fine splitting
      heterodynes listed from 15.9 THz (532.5 cm-1) down to 3.88 GHz
      (0.13 cm~l). The 23 platinum fine splitting intervals detailed are
      from 23.3 THz (775.9 cm-1) to 8.62 THz in frequency (287.9 cri-1).<br>
      <br>
      Diagrammatically, the magnification and resolution of an
      electronic frequency into several closely spaced fine frequencies
      is depicted in Figure 33. The electronic orbit is designated by
      the orbital number n = 0,1, 2, etc. The fine structure is
      designated as a. A quantum diagram for the hydrogen fine structure
      is shown in Figure 34. Specifically, shown is the fine structure
      of the n = 1 and n = 2 levels of the hydrogen atom. Figure 35
      shows the multiplet splittings for the lowest energy levels of
      carbon, oxygen, and fluorine, as represented by"C","O"and"F",
      respectively.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the fine splitting frequencies for atoms (i. e. ,
      heterodynes), molecules also have similar fine structure
      frequencies. The origin and derivation for molecular fine
      structure and splitting is different from that for atoms, however,
      the graphical and practical results are quite similar. In atoms,
      the fine structure frequencies are said to result from the
      interaction of the spinning electron with its'own magnetic field.
      Basically, this means the electron cloud of a single atomic
      sphere, rotating and interacting with its'own magnetic field,
      produces the atomic fine structure frequencies. The prior art
      refers to this phenomena as "spin-orbit coupling". For molecules,
      the fine structure frequencies correspond to the actual rotational
      frequencies of the electronic or vibrational frequencies. So the
      fine structure frequencies for atoms and molecules both result
      from rotation. In the case of atoms, it is the atom spinning and
      rotating around itself, much the way the earth rotates around its
      axis. In the case of molecules, it is the molecule spinning and
      rotating through space.<br>
      <br>
      * Figure 36 shows the infrared absorption spectrum of the SF6
      vibration band near 28.3 THz (10.6 um wavelength, wavenumber 948
      cin-1) of the SF6 molecule. The molecule is highly symmetrical and
      rotates somewhat like a top. The spectral tracing was obtained
      with a high resolution grating spectrometer. There is a broad band
      between 941 and 952 cm-1 (28. 1 and 28.5 THz) with three sharp
      spectral curves at 946,947, and 948 cuff' (28. 3,28. 32, and
      23.834 THz).<br>
      <br>
      Figure 37a shows a narrow slice being taken from between 949 and
      950 off, which is blown up to show more detail in Figure 37b. A
      tunable semiconductor diode laser was used to obtain the detail.
      There are many more spectral curves which appear when the spectrum
      is reviewed in finer detail. These curves are called the fine
      structure frequencies for this molecule. The total energy of an
      atom or molecule is the sum of its'electronic, vibrational, and
      rotational energies. Thus, the simple Planck equation discussed
      previously herein: E =hv can be rewritten as follows: E=Ee+Ev+Er
      where E is the total energy, Ee is the electronic energy, By is
      the vibrational energy, and Er is the rotational energy.
      Diagrammatically, this equation is shown in Figure 38 for
      molecules.<br>
      <br>
      The electronic energy, Ee, involves a change in the orbit of one
      of the electrons in the molecule. It is designated by the orbital
      number n = 0,1, 2,3, etc. The vibrational energy,<br>
      Ev, is produced by a change in the vibration rate between two
      atoms within the molecule, and is designated by a vibrational
      number v = 1,2, 3, etc. Lastly, the rotational energy, Er, is the
      energy of rotation caused by the molecule rotating around
      its'center of mass. The rotational energy is designated by the
      quantum number J = 1,2, and 3, etc. , as determined from angular
      momentum equations.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, by examining the vibrational frequencies of SF6 in more
      detail, the fine structure molecular frequencies become apparent.
      These fine structure frequencies are actually produced by the
      molecular rotations, "J", as a subset of each vibrational
      frequency.<br>
      <br>
      Just as the rotational levels"J"are substantially evenly separated
      in Figure 38, they are also substantially evenly separated when
      plotted as frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      This concept may be easier to understand by viewing some
      additional frequency diagrams. For example, Figure 39a shows the
      pure rotational absorption spectrum for gaseous hydrogen-chloride
      and Figure 39b shows the same spectrum at low resolution. In
      Figure 39a, the separate waves, that look something like teeth on
      a"comb", correspond to the individual rotational frequencies. The
      complete wave (i. e. , that wave comprising the whole comb) that
      extends in frequency from 20 to 500 cm' corresponds to the entire
      vibrational frequency. At low resolution or magnification, this
      set of rotational frequencies appear to be a single frequency
      peaking at about 20 crri (598 GHz) (see Figure 39b). This is very
      similar to the way atomic frequencies such as the 456 THz hydrogen
      frequency appear (i. e. , just one frequency at low resolution,
      that turn out to be several different frequencies at higher
      magnification).<br>
      <br>
      In Figure 40, the rotational spectrum (i. e. , fine structure) of
      hydrogen cyanide is shown, where"J"is the rotational level. Note
      again, the regular spacing of the rotational levels. (Note that
      this spectrum is oriented opposite of what is typical). This
      spectrum uses transmission rather than emission on the horizontal
      Y-axis, thus, intensity increases downward on the Y-axis, rather
      than upwards.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, Figure 41 shows the vl-V5 vibrational bands for FCCF
      (where vl is vibrational level 1 and vs vibrational level 5) which
      includes a plurality of rotational frequencies. All of the fine
      sawtooth spikes are the fine structure frequencies which
      correspond to the rotational frequencies. Note the substantially
      regular spacing of the rotational frequencies. Also note, the
      undulating pattern of the rotational frequency intensity, as well
      as the alternating pattern of the rotational frequency
      intensities.<br>
      <br>
      Consider the actual rotational frequencies (i. e. , fine structure
      frequencies) for the ground state of carbon monoxide listed in
      Table 4.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Table 4. Rotational Frequencies and Derived Rotational Constant
        for CO in the Ground State</b><br>

      806,651. 719 807<br>
      Where; Bo = 57,635. 970 MHz<br>
      Each of the rotational frequencies is regularly spaced at
      approximately 115 GHz apart. Prior art quantum theorists would
      explain this regular spacing as being due to the fact that the
      rotational frequencies are related to Planck's constant and the
      moment of inertia (i. e., center of mass for the molecule) by the
      equation:<br>
      B= h 87r2I where B is the rotational constant, h is Planck's
      constant, and I is the moment of inertia for the molecule. From
      there the prior art established a frequency equation for the
      rotational levels that corresponds to: f=2B (J+l) where f is the
      frequency, B is the rotational constant, and J is the rotational
      level. Thus, the rotational spectrum (i. e. , fine structure
      spectrum) for a molecule turns out to be a harmonic series of
      lines with the frequencies all spaced or split (i. e. ,
      heterodyned) by the same amount.<br>
      <br>
      This amount has been referred to in the prior art as"2B",
      and"B"has been referred to as the "rotational constant". In
      existing charts and databases of molecular frequencies,"B"is
      usually listed as a frequency such as MHz. This is graphically
      represented for the first four rotational frequencies for CO in
      Figure 42.<br>
      <br>
      This fact is interesting for several reasons. The rotational
      constant"B", listed in many databases, is equal to one half of the
      difference between rotational frequencies for a molecule.<br>
      <br>
      That means that B is the first subharmonic frequency, to the
      fundamental frequency"2B", which is the heterodyned difference
      between all the rotational frequencies. The rotational constant B
      listed for carbon monoxide is 57.6 GHz (57,635. 970 MHz). This is
      basically half of the 115 GHz difference between the rotational
      frequencies. Thus, according to the present invention, if it is
      desired to stimulate a molecule's rotational levels, the
      amount"2B"can be used, because it is the fundamental first
      generation heterodyne. Alternatively, the same"B" can be used
      because"B"corresponds to the first subharmonic of that heterodyne.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the prior art teaches that if it is desired to use
      microwaves for stimulation, the microwave frequencies used will be
      restricted to stimulating levels at or near the ground state of
      the molecule (i. e. , n = 0 in Figure 38). The prior art teaches
      that as you progress upward in Figure 38 to the higher electronic
      and vibrational levels, the required frequencies will correspond
      to the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet regions. However, the
      prior art is wrong about this point.<br>
      <br>
      By referring to Figure 38 again, it is clear that the rotational
      frequencies are evenly spaced out no matter what electronic or
      vibrational level is under scrutiny. The even spacing shown in
      Figure 38 is due to the rotational frequencies being evenly spaced
      as progression is made upwards through all the higher vibrational
      and electronic levels. Table 5 lists the rotational frequencies
      for lithium fluoride (LiF) at several different rotational and
      vibrational levels.<br>

      <br>
      It is clear from Table 5 that the differences between rotational
      frequencies, no matter what the vibrational level, is about 86,000
      to about 89,000 MHz (i. e. , 86-89 GHz). Thus, according to the
      present invention, by using a microwave frequency between about
      86,000 MHz and 89,000 MHz, the molecule can be stimulated from the
      ground state level all the way up to its'highest energy levels.
      This effect has not been even remotely suggested by the prior art.
      Specifically, the rotational frequencies of molecules can be
      manipulated in a unique manner. The first rotational level has a
      natural oscillatory frequency (NOF) of 89,740 MHz.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      The second rotational level has an NOF of 179,470 MHz. Thus,
      NOFrotational 1 &lt; 2-NOFrotational 0- &gt; 1 = Subtracted
      Frequency rotational 2. 1 ; or<br>
      179,470 MHz-89,740 MHz = 89,730 MHz.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the present invention has discovered that the NOF's of the
      rotational frequencies heterodyne by adding and subtracting in a
      manner similar to the manner that all frequencies heterodyne.
      Specifically, the two rotational frequencies heterodyne to produce
      a subtracted frequency. This subtracted frequency happens to be
      exactly twice as big as the derived rotational constant"B"listed
      in nuclear physics and spectroscopy manuals. Thus, when the first
      rotational frequency in the molecule is stimulated with the
      Subtracted Frequency rotational 2-1, the first rotational
      frequency will heterodyne (i. e. , in this case add) with the
      NOFrotationai ool (i. e., first rotational frequency) to produce
      NOFrotational 1, 2, which is the natural oscillatory frequency of
      the molecule's second rotational level. In other words:<br>
      Subtracted Frequency rotational2-1 + NOFrotational 0-1 =
      NOFrotational I) 2 ; or<br>
      89,730 MHz + 89,740 MHz = 179, 470 MHz<br>
      <br>
      Since the present invention has disclosed that the rotational
      frequencies are actually evenly spaced harmonics, the subtracted
      frequency will also add with the second level NOF to produce the
      third level NOF. The subtracted frequency will add with the third
      level NOF to produce the fourth level NOF. This procedure can be
      repeated over and over. Thus, according to the present invention,
      by using one single microwave frequency, it is possible to
      stimulate all the rotational levels in a vibratory band.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, if all the rotational levels for a vibrational frequency
      are excited, then the vibrational frequency will also be
      correspondingly excited. Further, if all the vibrational levels
      for an electronic level are excited, then the electronic level
      will be excited as well.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, according to the teachings of the present invention, it is
      possible to excite the highest levels of the electronic and
      vibrational structure of a molecule by using a single microwave
      frequency. This is contrary to the prior art teachings that the
      use of microwaves is restricted to the ground state of the
      molecule. Specifically, if the goal is to resonate directly with
      an upper vibrational or electronic level, the prior art teaches
      that microwave frequencies can not be used. If, however, according
      to the present invention, a catalytic mechanism of action is
      initiated by, for example, resonating with target species
      indirectly through heterodynes, then<br>
      <br>
      one or more microwave frequencies can be used to energize at least
      one upper level vibrational or electronic state. Accordingly, by
      using the teachings of the present invention in conjunction with
      the simple processes of heterodyning it becomes readily apparent
      that microwave frequencies are not limited to the ground state
      levels of molecules.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention has determined that catalysts can actually
      stimulate target species indirectly by utilizing at least one
      heterodyne frequency (e. g. , harmonic). However, catalysts can
      also stimulate the target species by direct resonance with at
      least one fundamental frequency of interest. However, the
      rotational frequencies can result in use of both mechanisms. For
      example, Figure 42 shows a graphical representation of fine
      structure spectrum showing the first four rotational frequencies
      for CO in the ground state. The first rotational frequency for CO
      is 115 GHz. The heterodyned difference between rotational
      frequencies is also 115 GHz. The first rotational frequency and
      the heterodyned difference between frequencies are identical. All
      of the upper level rotational frequencies are harmonics of the
      first frequency. This relationship is not as apparent when one
      deals only with the rotational constant"B"of the prior art.
      However, frequency-based spectral chemistry analyses, like those
      of the present invention, makes such concepts easier to
      understand.<br>
      <br>
      Examination of the first level rotational frequencies for LiF
      shows that it is nearly identical to the heterodyned difference
      between it and the second level rotational frequency.<br>
      <br>
      The rotational frequencies are sequential harmonics of the first
      rotational frequency.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, if a molecule is stimulated with a frequency equal to
      2B (i. e. , a heterodyned harmonic difference between rotational
      frequencies) the present invention teaches that energy will
      resonate with all the upper rotational frequencies indirectly
      through heterodynes, and resonate directly with the first
      rotational frequency. This is an important discovery.<br>
      <br>
      The prior art discloses a number of constants used in spectroscopy
      that relate in some way or another to the frequencies of atoms and
      molecule, just as the rotational constant"B" relates to the
      harmonic spacing of rotational fine structure molecular
      frequencies. The alpha (a) rotation-vibration constant is a good
      example of this. The alpha rotation-vibration frequency constant
      is related to slight changes in the frequencies for the same
      rotational level, when the vibrational level changes. For example,
      Figure 43a shows the frequencies for the same rotational levels,
      but different vibrational levels for LiF. The frequencies are
      almost the same, but vary by a few percent between the different
      vibrational levels.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to Figure 43b, the differences between all the
      frequencies for the various rotational transitions at different
      vibrational levels of Figure 43a are shown. The rotational
      transition 0--+ I in the top line of Figure 43b has a frequency of
      89,740. 46 MHz at vibrational level 0. At vibrational level 1, the
      0--+ 1 transition is 88,319. 18 MHz. The difference between these
      two rotational frequencies is 1,421. 28 MHz. At vibrational level
      2, the 0--+ 1 transition is 86,921. 20 MHz. The difference between
      it and the vibrational level 1 frequency (88,319. 18 MHz) is
      1,397. 98 MHz. These slight differences for the same J rotational
      level between different vibrational levels are nearly identical.
      For the J = 0 rotational level they center around a frequency of
      1,400 MHz.<br>
      <br>
      For the J = 1--+ 2 transition, the differences center around 2,800
      Hz, and for the J = 2- 3 transition, the differences center around
      4,200 Hz. These different frequencies of 1,400, 2,800 and 4,200,
      Hz etc. , are all harmonics of each other. Further, they are all
      harmonics of the alpha rotation-vibration constant. Just as the
      actual molecular rotational frequencies are harmonics of the
      rotational constant B, the differences between the rotational
      frequencies are harmonics of the alpha rotation-vibration
      constant. Accordingly, if a molecule is stimulated with a
      frequency equal to the alpha vibration-rotation frequencies, the
      present invention teaches that energy will resonate with all the
      rotational frequencies indirectly through heterodynes. This is an
      important discovery.<br>
      <br>
      Consider the rotational and vibrational states for the triatomic
      molecule OCS shown in Figure 44. Figure 44 shows the same
      rotational level (J = 1-)-2) for different vibrational states in
      the OCS molecule. For the ground vibrational (000) level, J = 1--+
      2 transition; and the excited vibrational state (100) J = 1- 2
      transition, the difference between the two frequencies is equal to
      4 X alpha (4al). In another excited state, the frequency
      difference between the ground vibrational (000) level, J = 1 &lt;
      2 transition, and the center of the two I- type doublets is 4 X
      alpha2 (4a2). In a higher excited vibrational state, the frequency
      difference between (000) and (02 0) is 8 X alpha2 (8a2). Thus, it
      can be seen that the rotation-vibration constants"a"are actually
      harmonics of molecular frequencies. Thus, according to the present
      invention, stimulating a molecule with an"a"frequency, or a
      harmonic of"a", will either directly resonate with or indirectly
      heterodyne harmonically with various rotational-vibrational
      frequencies of the molecule.<br>
      <br>
      Another interesting constant is the l-type doubling constant. This
      constant is also shown in Figure 44. Specifically, Figure 44 shows
      the rotational transition J = 1- 2 for the<br>
      <br>
      triatomic molecule OCS. Just as the atomic frequencies are
      sometimes split into doublets or multiplets, the rotational
      frequencies are also sometimes split into doublets. The difference
      between them is called the l-type doubling constant. These
      constants are usually smaller (i. e., of a lower frequency) than
      the a constants. For the OCS molecule, the a constants are 20.56
      and 10.56 MHz while the l-type doubling constant is 6.3 MHz. These
      frequencies are all in the radiowave portion of the
      electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      As discussed previously herein, energy is transferred by two
      fundamental frequency mechanisms. If frequencies are substantially
      the same or match, then energy transfers by direct resonance.
      Energy can also transfer indirectly by heterodyning, (i. e. , the
      frequencies substantially match after having been added or
      subtracted with another frequency). Further, as previously stated,
      the direct or indirect resonant frequencies do not have to match
      exactly.<br>
      <br>
      If they are merely close, significant amounts of energy will still
      transfer. Any of these constants or frequencies that are related
      to molecules or other matter via heterodynes, can be used to
      transfer, for example, energy to the matter and hence can directly
      interact with the matter.<br>
      <br>
      In the reaction in which hydrogen and oxygen are combined to form
      water, the present invention teaches that the energizing of the
      reaction intermediates of atomic hydrogen and the hydroxy radical
      are crucial to sustaining the reaction. In this regard, the
      physical catalyst platinum energizes both reaction intermediates
      by directly and indirectly resonating with them. Platinum also
      energizes the intermediates at multiple energy levels, creating
      the conditions for energy amplification. The present invention
      also teaches how to copy platinum's mechanism of action by making
      use of atomic fine structure frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      The invention has previously discussed resonating with the fine
      structure frequencies with only slight variations between the
      frequencies (e. g. , 456.676 and 456.686 THz).<br>
      <br>
      However, indirectly resonating with the fine structure
      frequencies, is a significant difference.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, by using the fine splitting frequencies, which are
      simply the differences or heterodynes between the fine structure
      frequencies, the present invention teaches that indirect resonance
      can be achieved. By examining the hydrogen 456 THz fine structure
      and fine splitting frequencies (see, for example, Figures 30 and
      31 and Table 3 many heterodynes are shown). In other words, the
      difference between the fine structure frequencies can be
      calculated as follows:<br>
      456.686 THz-456.676 THz = 0.0102 THz = 10.2 GHz<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Thus, if hydrogen atoms are subjected to 10.2 GHz electromagnetic
      energy (i. e. , energy corresponding to microwaves), then the 456
      THz electronic spectrum frequency is energized by resonating with
      it indirectly. In other words, the 10.2 GHz will add to 456.676
      THz to produce the resonant frequency of 456.686 THz. The 10.2 GHz
      will also subtract from the 456.686 THz to produce the resonant
      frequency of 456.676 THz. Thus, by introducing 10.2 GHz to a
      hydrogen atom, the hydrogen atom is excited at the 456 THz
      frequency. A microwave frequency can be used to stimulate an
      electronic level.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention, it is also possible to use a
      combination of mimicked catalyst mechanisms. For example, it is
      possible to: 1) resonate with the hydrogen atom frequencies
      indirectly through heterodynes (i. e. , fine splitting
      frequencies); and/or 2) resonate with the hydrogen atom at
      multiple frequencies. Such multiple resonating could occur using a
      combination of microwave frequencies either simultaneously, in
      sequence, and/or in chirps or bursts. For example, the individual
      microwave fine splitting frequencies for hydrogen of 10.87 GHz,
      10.2 GHz, 3.23 GHz, 1.38 GHz, and 1.06 GHz could be used in a
      sequence. Further, there are many fine splitting frequencies for
      hydrogen that have not been expressly included herein, thus,
      depending on the frequency range of equipment available, the
      present invention provides a means for tailoring the chosen
      frequencies to the capabilities of the available equipment. Thus,
      the flexibility according to the teachings of the present
      invention is enormous.<br>
      <br>
      Another method to deliver multiple electromagnetic energy
      frequencies according to the present invention, is to use a lower
      frequency as a carrier wave for a higher frequency.<br>
      <br>
      This can be done, for example, by producing 10.2 GHz EM energy in
      short bursts, with the bursts coming at a rate of about 239 MHz.
      Both of these frequencies are fine splitting frequencies for
      hydrogen. This can also be achieved by continuously delivering EM
      energy and by varying the amplitude at a rate of about 239 MHz.
      These techniques can be used alone or in combination with the
      various other techniques disclosed herein.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, by mimicking one or more mechanisms of action of catalysts
      and by making use of the atomic fine structure and splitting
      frequencies, it is possible to energize upper levels of atoms
      using microwave and radiowave frequencies. Accordingly, by
      selectively energizing or targeting particular atoms, it is
      possible to catalyze and guide desirable reactions to desired end
      products. Depending on the circumstances, the option to use lower
      frequencies may have many advantages. Lower frequencies typically
      have much better<br>
      <br>
      penetration into large reaction spaces and volumes, and may be
      better suited to large-scale industrial applications. Lower
      frequencies may be easier to deliver with portable, compact
      equipment, as opposed to large, bulky equipment which delivers
      higher frequencies (e. g., lasers). The choice of frequencies of a
      spectral catalyst may be for as simple a reason as to avoid
      interference from other sources of EM energy. Thus, according to
      the present invention, an understanding of the basic processes of
      heterodyning and fine structure splitting frequencies confers
      greater flexibility in designing and applying spectral energy
      catalysts in a targeted manner. Specifically, rather than simply
      reproducing the spectral pattern of a physical catalyst, the
      present invention teaches that is possible to make full use of the
      entire range of frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum, so
      long as the teachings of the present invention are followed. Thus,
      certain desirable frequencies can be applied while other not so
      desirable frequencies could be left out of an applied spectral
      energy catalyst targeted to a particular participant and/or
      component in the crystallization reaction system.<br>
      <br>
      As a further example, reference is again made to the hydrogen and
      oxygen reaction for the formation of water. If it is desired to
      catalyze the water reaction by duplicating the catalyst's
      mechanism of action in the microwave region, the present invention
      teaches that several options are available. Another such option is
      use of the knowledge that platinum energizes the reaction
      intermediates of the hydroxy radical. In addition to the hydrogen
      atom, the B frequency for the hydroxy radical is 565. 8 GHz. That
      means that the actual heterodyned difference between the
      rotational frequencies is 2B, or 1,131. 6 GHz.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, such a frequency could be utilized to achieve
      excitement of the hydroxy radical intermediate.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the a constant for the hydroxy radical is 21.4 GHz.
      Accordingly, this frequency could also be applied to energizing
      the hydroxy radical. Thus, by introducing hydrogen and oxygen
      gases into a chamber and irradiating the gases with 21.4 GHz,
      water will be formed. This particular gigahertz energy is a
      harmonic heterodyne of the rotational frequencies for the same
      rotational level but different vibrational levels. The heterodyned
      frequency energizes all the rotational frequencies, which energize
      the vibrational levels, which energize the electronic frequencies,
      which catalyze the reaction. Accordingly, the aforementioned
      reaction could be catalyzed or targeted with a spectral catalyst
      applied at several applicable frequencies, all of which match with
      one or more frequencies in one or more participants and thus
      permit energy to transfer.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Still further, delivery of frequencies of 565.8 GHz, or even
      1,131. 6 GHz, would result in substantially all of the rotational
      levels in the molecule becoming energized, from the ground state
      all the way up. This approach copies a catalyst mechanism of
      action in two ways. The first way is by energizing the hydroxy
      radical and sustaining a crucial reaction intermediate to catalyze
      the formation of water. The second mechanism copied from the
      catalyst is to energize multiple levels in the molecule. Because
      the rotational constant"B" relates to the rotational frequencies,
      heterodynes occur at all levels in the molecule. Thus, using the
      frequency"B"energizes all levels in the molecule. This potentiates
      the establishment of an energy amplification system such as that
      which occurs with the physical catalyst platinum.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, if a molecule was energized with a frequency
      corresponding to an l-type doubling constant, such frequency could
      be used in a substantially similar manner in which a fine
      splitting frequency from an atomic spectrum is used. The
      difference between the two frequencies in a doublet is a
      heterodyne, and energizing the doublet with its'heterodyne
      frequency (i. e. , the splitting frequency) would energize the
      basic frequency and catalyze the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      A still further example utilizes a combination of frequencies for
      atomic fine structure.<br>
      <br>
      For instance, by utilizing a constant central frequency of 1,131.
      6 GHz (i. e. , the heterodyned difference between rotational
      frequencies for a hydroxy radical) with a vibrato varying around
      the central frequency by 21.4 GHz (i. e. , the a constant harmonic
      for variations between rotational frequencies), use could be made
      of 1. 131. 6 GHz EM energy in short bursts, with the bursts coming
      at a rate of 21.4 GHz.<br>
      <br>
      Since there is slight variation between rotational frequencies for
      the same level, that frequency range can be used to construct
      bursts. For example, if the largest"B"is 565.8 GHz, then a
      rotational frequency heterodyne corresponds to 1,131. 6 GHz. If
      the smallest"B" is 551.2 GHz, this corresponds to a rotational
      frequency heterodyne of 1,102 GHz. Thus, "chirps"or bursts of
      energy starting at 1,100 GHz and increasing in frequency to 1,140
      GHz, could be used. In fact, the transmitter could be set
      to"chirp"or burst at a rate of 21.4 GHz.<br>
      <br>
      As previously discussed, fine and fine splitting frequencies can
      also be used in crystallization reaction systems to achieve
      desired results.<br>
      <br>
      In any event, there are many ways to make use of the atomic and
      molecular fine structure frequencies, with their attendant
      heterodynes and harmonics. An understanding of<br>
      <br>
      catalyst mechanisms of action enables one of ordinary skill armed
      with the teachings of the present invention to utilize a spectral
      catalyst from the high frequency ultraviolet and visible light
      regions, down into the sometimes more manageable microwave and
      radiowave regions.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the invention enables an artisan of ordinary skill to
      calculate and/or determine the effects of microwave and radiowave
      energies on chemical reactions and/or reaction pathways.<br>
      <br>
      <b>HYPERFINE FREQUENCIES</b><br>
      <br>
      Hyperfine structure frequencies are similar to the fine structure
      frequencies. Fine structure frequencies can be seen by magnifying
      a portion of a standard frequency spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      Hyperfine frequencies can be seen by magnifying a portion of a
      fine structure spectrum. Fine structure splitting frequencies
      occur at lower frequencies than the electronic spectra, primarily
      in the infrared and microwave regions of the electromagnetic
      spectrum. Hyperfine splitting frequencies occur at even lower
      frequencies than the fine structure spectra, primarily in the
      microwave and radio wave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.
      Fine structure frequencies are generally caused by at least the
      electron interacting with its'own magnetic field. Hyperfine
      frequencies are generally caused by at least the electron
      interacting with the magnetic field of the nucleus.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 36 shows the rotation-vibration band frequency spectra for
      an SF6 molecule.<br>
      <br>
      The rotation-vibration band and fine structure are shown again in
      Figure 45. However, the fine structure frequencies are seen by
      magnifying a small section of the standard vibrational band
      spectrum (i. e. , the lower portion of Figure 45 shows some of the
      fine structure frequencies). In many respects, looking at fine
      structure frequencies is like using a magnifying glass to look at
      a standard spectrum. Magnification of what looks like a flat and
      uninteresting portion of a standard vibrational frequency band
      shows many more curves with lower frequency splitting. These many
      other curves are the fine structure curves. Similarly, by
      magnifying a small and seemingly uninteresting portion of the fine
      structure spectrum of the result is yet another spectrum of many
      more curves known as the hyperfine spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      A small portion (i. e. , from zero to 300) of the SF6 fine
      structure spectrum is magnified in Figure 46. The hyperfine
      spectrum includes many curves split part by even lower
      frequencies. This time the fine structure spectrum was magnified
      instead of the regular vibrational spectrum. What is found is even
      more curves, even closer together. Figures 47a<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      and 47b show a further magnification of the two curves marked with
      asterisks (i. e.,"*"and "**") in Figure 46.<br>
      <br>
      What appears to be a single crisp curve in Figure 46, turns out to
      be a series of several curves spaced very close together. These
      are the hyperfine frequency curves. Accordingly, the fine
      structure spectra is comprised of several more curves spaced very
      close together.<br>
      <br>
      These other curves spaced even closer together correspond to the
      hyperfine frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      Figures 47a and 47b show that the spacing of the hyperfine
      frequency curves are very close together and at somewhat regular
      intervals. The small amount that the hyperfine curves are split
      apart is called the hyperfine splitting frequency. The hyperfine
      splitting frequency is also a heterodyne. This concept is
      substantially similar to the concept of the fine splitting
      frequency. The difference between two curves that are split apart
      is called a splitting frequency. As before, the difference between
      two curves is referred to as a heterodyne frequency. So, hyperfine
      splitting frequencies are all heterodynes of hyperfine
      frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      Because the hyperfine frequency curves result from a magnification
      of the fine structure curves, the hyperfine splitting frequencies
      occur at only a fraction of the fine structure splitting
      frequencies. The fine structure splitting frequencies are really
      just several curves, spaced very close together around the regular
      spectrum frequency. Magnification of fine structure splitting
      frequencies results in hyperfine splitting frequencies. The
      hyperfine splitting frequencies are really just several more
      curves, spaced very close together. The closer together the curves
      are, the smaller the distance or frequency separating them. Now
      the distance separating any two curves is a heterodyne frequency.
      So, the closer together any two curves are, the smaller (lower) is
      the heterodyne frequency between them. The distance between
      hyperfine splitting frequencies (i. e. , the amount that hyperfine
      frequencies are split apart) is the hyperfine splitting frequency.
      It can also be called a constant or interval.<br>
      <br>
      The electronic spectrum frequency of hydrogen is 2,466 THz. The
      2,466 THz frequency is made up of fine structure curves spaced
      10.87 GHz (0.01087 THz) apart. Thus, the fine splitting frequency
      is 10.87 GHz. Now the fine structure curves are made up of
      hyperfine curves. These hyperfine curves are spaced just 23.68 and
      59.21 MHz apart. Thus, 23 and 59 MHz are both hyperfine splitting
      frequencies for hydrogen. Other hyperfine splitting frequencies
      for hydrogen include 2.71, 4.21, 7.02, 17.55, 52.63, 177.64, and
      1,420. 0 MHz. The hyperfine splitting frequencies are spaced even
      closer together than the fine<br>
      <br>
      structure splitting frequencies, so the hyperfine splitting
      frequencies are smaller and lower than the fine splitting
      frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the hyperfine splitting frequencies are lower than the fine
      splitting frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      This means that rather than being in the infrared and microwave
      regions, as the fine splitting frequencies can be, the hyperfine
      splitting frequencies are in the microwave and radiowave regions.
      These lower frequencies are in the MHz (106 hertz) and Khz (103
      hertz) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Several of the
      hyperfine splitting frequencies for hydrogen are shown in Figure
      48. (Figure 48 shows hyperfine structure in the n = 2 to n = 3
      transition of hydrogen).<br>
      <br>
      Figure 49 shows the hyperfine frequencies for CH3I. These
      frequencies are a magnification of the fine structure frequencies
      for that molecule. Since fine structure frequencies for molecules
      are actually rotational frequencies, what is shown is actually the
      hyperfine splitting of rotational frequencies. Figure 49 shows the
      hyperfine splitting of just the J = 1- 2 rotational transition.
      The splitting between the two tallest curves is less than 100 MHz.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 50 shows another example of the molecule C1CN. This set of
      hyperfine frequencies is from the J = 1 &lt; 2 transition of the
      ground vibrational state for C1CN. Notice that the hyperfine
      frequencies are separated by just a few megahertz, (MHz) and in a
      few places by less than even one megahertz.<br>
      <br>
      The energy-level diagram and spectrum of the J = l/2 &lt; 3/2
      rotational transition for NO is shown if Figure 51.<br>
      <br>
      In Figure 52, the hyperfine splitting frequencies for NH3 are
      shown. Notice that the frequencies are spaced so close together
      that the scale at the bottom is in kilohertz (Kc/sec).<br>
      <br>
      The hyperfine features of the lines were obtained using a beam
      spectrometer.<br>
      <br>
      Just as with fine splitting frequencies, the hyperfine splitting
      frequencies are heterodynes of atomic and molecular frequencies.
      Accordingly, if an atom or molecule is stimulated with a frequency
      equal to a hyperfine splitting frequency (a heterodyned difference
      between hyperfine frequencies), the present invention teaches that
      the energy will equal to a hyperfine splitting frequency will
      resonate with the hyperfine frequencies indirectly through
      heterodynes. The related rotational, vibrational, and/or
      electronic energy levels will, in turn, be stimulated. This is an
      important discovery. It allows one to use more radio and microwave
      frequencies to selectively stimulate and target specific
      crystallization<br>
      <br>
      reaction system components (e. g. , atomic hydrogen intermediates
      can be stimulated with, for example, (2.55, 23.68 59.2 and/or
      1,420 MHz).<br>
      <br>
      Hyperfine frequencies, like fine frequencies, also contain
      features such as doublets.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, in a region where one would expect to find only a
      single hyperfine frequency curve, there are two curves instead,
      typically, one on either side of the location where a single
      hyperfine frequency was expected. Hyperfine doubling is shown in
      Figures 53 and 54. This hyperfine spectrum is also from NH3.
      Figure 53 corresponds to the J = 3 rotational level and Figure 54
      corresponds to the J = 4 rotational level. The doubling can be
      seen most easily in the J = 3 curves (i. e. , Figure 53). There
      are two sets of short curves, a tall one, and then two more short
      sets. Each of the short sets of curves is generally located where
      one would expect to find just one curve. There are two curves
      instead, one on either side of the main curve location. Each set
      of curves is a hyperfine doublet.<br>
      <br>
      There are different notations to indicate the source of the
      doubling such as l-type doubling, K doubling, and A doubling, etc.
      , and they all have their own constants or intervals.<br>
      <br>
      Without going into the detailed theory behind the formation of
      various types of doublets, the interval between any two hyperfine
      multiplet curves is also a heterodyne, and thus all of these
      doubling constants represent frequency heterodynes. Accordingly,
      those frequency heterodynes (i. e. , hyperfine constants) can also
      be used as spectral energy catalysts according to the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, a frequency in an atom or molecule can be stimulated
      directly or indirectly. If the goal was to stimulate the 2,466 THz
      frequency of hydrogen for some reason, then, for example, an
      ultraviolet laser could irradiate the hydrogen with 2,466 THz
      electromagnetic radiation. This would stimulate the atom directly.
      However, if such a laser was unavailable, then hydrogen's fine
      structure splitting frequency of 10.87 GHz could be achieved with
      microwave equipment. The gigahertz frequency would heterodyne (i.
      e. , add or subtract) with the two closely spaced fine structure
      curves at 2,466, and stimulate the 2,466 THz frequency band. This
      would stimulate the atom indirectly.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, the atom could be stimulated by using the hyperfine
      splitting frequency for hydrogen at 23.68 MHz as produced by
      radiowave equipment. The 23.68 MHz frequency would heterodyne (i.
      e. , add or subtract) with the two closely spaced hyperfine
      frequency curves at 2,466, and stimulate the fine structure curves
      at the 2,466 THz. Stimulation of the<br>
      <br>
      fine structure curves would in turn lead to stimulation of the
      2,466 THz electronic frequency for the hydrogen atom.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, additional hyperfine splitting frequencies for
      hydrogen in the radiowave and microwave portions of the
      electromagnetic spectrum could also be used to stimulate the atom.
      For example, a radio wave pattern with 2.7 MHz, 4.2 MHz, 7 MHz, 18
      MHz, 23 MHz, 52 MHz, and 59 MHz could be used. This would
      stimulate several different hyperfine frequencies of hydrogen, and
      it would stimulate them essentially all at the same time. This
      would cause stimulation of the fine structure frequencies, which
      in turn would stimulate the electronic frequencies in the hydrogen
      atom.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, depending on available equipment and/or design,
      and/or processing constraints, some delivery mode variations can
      also be used. For example, one of the lower frequencies could be a
      carrier frequency for the upper frequencies. A continuous
      frequency of 52 MHz could be varied in amplitude at a rate of 2.7
      MHz. Or, a 59 MHz frequency could be pulsed at a rate of 4.2 MHz.
      There are various ways in which these frequencies can be combined
      and/or delivered, including different wave shapes durations,
      intensity shapes, duty cycles, etc. Depending on which of the
      hyperfine splitting frequencies are stimulated, the evolution of,
      for example, various and specific transients may be precisely
      tailored and controlled, allowing precise control over
      holoreaction systems using the fine and/or hyperfine splitting
      frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, a major point of the present invention is once it is
      understood the energy transfers when frequencies match, then
      determining which frequencies are available for matching is the
      next step. This invention discloses precisely how to achieve that
      goal.<br>
      <br>
      Interactions between equipment limitations, processing
      constraints, etc. , can decide which frequencies are best suited
      for a particular purpose. Thus, both direct resonance and indirect
      resonance are suitable approaches for the use of spectral energy
      catalysts.<br>
      <br>
      Similar to previous discussions, hyperfine and hyperfine spitting
      frequencies can be used to achieve desired results in
      crystallization reaction systems.<br>

      <b>ELECTRIC FIELDS</b><br>
      <br>
      Another means for modifying the spectral pattern of substances, is
      to expose a substance to an electric field. Specifically, in the
      presence of an electric field, spectral frequency lines of atoms
      and molecules can be split, shifted, broadened, or changed in
      intensity. The effect of an electric field on spectral lines is
      known as the"Stark Effect", in<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      honor of its'discoverer, J. Stark. In 1913, Stark discovered that
      the Balmer series of hydrogen (i. e. , curve II of Figures 9a and
      9b) was split into several different components, while Stark was
      using a high electric field in the presence of a hydrogen flame.
      In the intervening years, Stark's original observation has evolved
      into a separate branch of spectroscopy, namely the study of the
      structure of atoms and molecules by measuring the changes in their
      respective spectral lines caused by an electric field.<br>
      <br>
      The electric field effects have some similarities to fine and
      hyperfine splitting frequencies. Specifically, as previously
      discussed herein, fine structure and hyperfine structure
      frequencies, along with their low frequency splitting or coupling
      constants, were caused by interactions inside the atom or
      molecule, between the electric field of the electron and the
      magnetic field of the electron or nucleus. Electric field effects
      are similar, except that instead of the electric field coming from
      inside the atom, the electric field is applied from outside the
      atom. The Stark effect is primarily the interaction of an external
      electric field, from outside the atom or molecule, with the
      electric and magnetic fields already established within the atom
      or molecule.<br>
      <br>
      When examining electric field effects on atoms, molecules, ions
      and/or components thereof, the nature of the electric field should
      also be considered (e. g. , such as whether the electric field is
      static or dynamic). A static electric field may be produced by a
      direct current.<br>
      <br>
      A dynamic electric field is time varying, and may be produced by
      an alternating current. If the electric field is from an
      alternating current, then the frequency of the alternating current
      compared to the frequencies of the, for instance atom or molecule,
      should also be considered.<br>
      <br>
      In atoms, an external electric field disturbs the charge
      distribution of the atom's electrons. This disturbance of the
      electron's own electric field induces a dipole moment in it (i. e.
      , slightly lopsided charge distribution). This lopsided electron
      dipole moment then interacts with the external electric field. In
      other words, the external electric field first induces a dipole
      moment in the electron field, and then interacts with the dipole.
      The end result is that the atomic frequencies become split into
      several different frequencies. The amount the frequencies are
      split apart depends on the strength of the electric field. In
      other words, the stronger the electric field, the farther apart
      the splitting.<br>
      <br>
      If the splitting varies directly with the electric field strength,
      then it is called first order splitting (i. e., Av = AF where Av
      is the splitting frequency, A is a constant and F is the electric
      field strength. When the splitting varies with the square of the
      field strength, it is<br>
      <br>
      called a second order or quadriatic effect (i. e., Av = Bof2). One
      or both effects may be seen in various forms of matter. For
      example, the hydrogen atom exhibits first order Stark effects at
      low electric field strengths, and second order effects at high
      field strengths. Other electric field effects which vary with the
      cube or the fourth power, etc. , of the electric field strength
      are less studied, but produce splitting frequencies nonetheless. A
      second order electric field effect for potassium is shown in
      Figures 55 and 56. Figure 55 shows the schematic dependence of the
      4s and 5p energy levels on the electric field. Figure 56 shows a
      plot of the deviation from zero-field positions of the 5p2 P1/2.
      3/2 ~ 4S2 S1/2 transition wavenumbers against the square of the
      electric field. Note that the frequency splitting or separation of
      the frequencies (i. e. , deviation from zero-field wavenumber)
      varies with the square of the electric field strength (v/cm) 2.<br>
      <br>
      The mechanism for the Stark effect in molecules is simpler than
      the effect is in atoms.<br>
      <br>
      Most molecules already have an electric dipole moment (i. e. , a
      slightly uneven charge distribution). The external electric field
      simply interacts with the electric dipole moment already inside
      the molecule. The type of interaction, a first or a second order
      Stark effect, is different for differently shaped molecules. For
      example, most symmetric top molecules have first-order Stark
      effects. Asymmetric rotors typically have second-order Stark
      effects. Thus, in molecules, as in atoms, the splitting or
      separation of the frequencies due to the external electric field,
      is proportional either to the electric field strength itself, or
      to the square of the electric field strength.<br>
      <br>
      An example of this is shown in Figure 57, which diagrams how
      frequency components of the J = 0- 1 rotational transition for the
      molecule CH3CI respond to an external electric field. When the
      electric field is very small (e. g. , less than 10 E2 esu2/cm2),
      the primary effect is shifting of the three rotational frequencies
      to higher frequencies. As the field strength is increased (e. g. ,
      between 10 and 20 E2 esu2/cm2), the three rotational frequencies
      split into five different frequencies. With continued increases in
      the electric field strength, the now five frequencies continue to
      shift to even higher frequencies. Some of the intervals or
      differences between the five frequencies remain the same
      regardless of the electric field strength, while other intervals
      become progressively larger and higher. Thus, a heterodyned
      frequency might stimulate splitting frequencies at one electric
      field strength, but not at another.<br>
      <br>
      Another molecular example is shown in Figure 58. (This is a
      diagram of the Stark Effect in the same OCS molecule shown in
      Figure 44 for the J = 1- 2). The J= 1- 2 rotational transition
      frequency is shown centered at zero on the horizontal frequency
      axis in Figure 58. That frequency centered at zero is a single
      frequency when there is no external electric field. When an
      electric field is added, however, the single rotational frequency
      splits into two. The stronger the electric field is, the wider the
      splitting is between the two frequencies. One of the new
      frequencies shifts up higher and higher, while the other frequency
      shifts lower and lower. Because the difference between the two
      frequencies changes when the electric field strength changes, a
      heterodyned splitting frequency might stimulate the rotational
      level at one electric field strength, but not at another. An
      electric field can effect the spectral frequencies of reaction
      participants, and thus impact the spectral chemistry of a
      reaction.<br>
      <br>
      Broadening and shifting of spectral lines also occurs with the
      intermolecular Stark effect. The intermolecular Stark effect is
      produced when the electric field from surrounding atoms, ions, or
      molecules, affects the spectral emissions of the species under
      study. In other words, the external electric field comes from
      other atoms and molecules rather than from a DC or AC current. The
      other atoms and molecules are in constant motion, and thus their
      electric fields are inhomogeneous in space and time. Instead of a
      frequency being split into several easily seen narrow frequencies,
      the original frequency simply becomes much wider, encompassing
      most, if not all, of what would have been the split frequencies,
      (i. e. , it is broadened). Solvents, support materials, poisons,
      promoters, etc. , are composed of atoms and molecules and
      components thereof. It is now understood that many of their
      effects are the result of the intermolecular Stark effect.<br>
      <br>
      The above examples demonstrate how an electric field splits,
      shifts, and broadens spectral frequencies for matter. However,
      intensities of the lines can also be affected. Some of these
      variations in intensity are shown in Figures 59a and 59b. Figure
      59a shows patterns of Stark components for transitions in the
      rotation of an asymmetric top molecule for the J = 4-5 transition;
      whereas Figure 59b corresponds to J = 4 &lt; 4. The intensity
      variations depend on rotational transitions, molecular structure,
      etc. , and the electric field strength.<br>
      <br>
      An interesting Stark effect is shown in a structure such as a
      molecule, which has hyperfine (rotational) frequencies. The
      general rule for the creation of hyperfine frequencies is that the
      hyperfine frequencies result from an interaction between electrons
      and the nucleus.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      This interaction can be affected by an external electric field. If
      the applied external electric field is weak, then the Stark energy
      is much less than the energy of the hyperfine energy (i. e.,
      rotational energy). The hyperfine lines are split into various new
      lines, and the separation (i. e., splitting) between the lines is
      very small (i. e. , at radio frequencies and extra low
      frequencies).<br>
      <br>
      If the external electric field is very strong, then the Stark
      energy is much larger than the hyperfine energy, and the molecule
      is tossed, sometimes violently, back and forth by the electric
      field. In this case, the hyperfine structure is radically changed.
      It is almost as though there no longer is any hyperfine structure.
      The Stark splitting is substantially the same as that which would
      have been observed if there were no hyperfine frequencies, and the
      hyperfine frequencies simply act as a small perturbation to the
      Stark splitting frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      If the external electric field is intermediate in strength, then
      the Stark and hyperfine energies are substantially equivalent. In
      this case, the calculations become very complex.<br>
      <br>
      Generally, the Stark splitting is close to the same frequencies as
      the hyperfine splitting, but the relative intensities of the
      various components can vary rapidly with slight changes in the
      strength of the external electric field. Thus, at one electric
      field strength one splitting frequency may predominate, while at
      an electric field strength just 1% higher, a totally different
      Stark frequency could predominate in intensity.<br>
      <br>
      All of the preceding discussion on the Stark effect has
      concentrated on the effects due to a static electric field, such
      as one would find with a direct current. The Stark effects of a
      dynamic, or time-varying electric field produced by an alternating
      current, are quite interesting and can be quite different. Just
      which of those affects appear, depends on the frequency of the
      electric field (i. e. , alternating current) compared to the
      frequency of the matter in question. If the electric field is
      varying. very slowly, such as with 60 Hz wall outlet electricity,
      then the normal or static type of electric field effect occurs. As
      the electric field varies from zero to maximum field strength, the
      matter frequencies vary from their unsplit frequencies to their
      maximally split frequencies at the rate of the changing electric
      field.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the electric field frequency modulates the frequency of the
      splitting phenomena.<br>
      <br>
      However, as the electrical frequency increases, the first
      frequency measurement it will begin to overtake is the line width
      (see Figure 16 for a diagram of line width). The line width of a
      curve is its'distance across, and the measurement is actually a
      very tiny heterodyne frequency measurement from one side of the
      curve to the other side. Line width frequencies<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      are typically around 100 KHz at room temperature. In practical
      terms, line width represents a relaxation time for molecules,
      where the relaxation time is the time required for any transient
      phenomena to disappear. So, if the electrical frequency is
      significantly smaller than the line width frequency, the molecule
      has plenty of time to adjust to the slowly changing electric
      field, and the normal or static-type Stark effects occur.<br>
      <br>
      If the electrical frequency is slightly less than the line width
      frequency, the molecule changes its'frequencies substantially in
      rhythm with the frequency of the electric field (i. e. , it
      entrains to the frequency of the electric field). This is shown in
      Figure 60 which shows the Stark effect for OCS on the J = I-- &gt;
      2 transition with applied electric fields at various frequencies.
      The letter"a"conesponds to the Stark effect with a static DC
      electric field;"b" corresponds to a broadening and blurring of the
      Stark frequencies with a 1 KHz electric field; and"c"corresponds
      to a normal Stark effect with an electric field of 1,200 KHz. As
      the electric field frequency approaches the KHz line width range,
      the Stark curves vary their frequencies with the electric field
      frequency and become broadened and somewhat blurred.<br>
      <br>
      When the electric field frequency moves up and beyond the line
      width range to about 1,200 KHz, the normal Stark type curves again
      become crisp and distinguishable. In many respects, the molecule
      cannot keep up with the rapid electrical field variation and
      simply averages the Stark effect. In all three cases, the cyclic
      splitting of the Stark frequencies is modulated with the
      electrical field frequency, or its'first harmonic (i. e. , 2X the
      electrical field frequency).<br>
      <br>
      The next frequency measurement that an ever-increasing electrical
      frequency will overtake in a molecule is the transitional
      frequency between two rotational levels (i. e., hyperfine
      frequencies). As the electric field frequency approaches a
      transitional frequency between two levels, the radiation of the
      transitional frequency in the molecule will induce transitions
      back and forth between the levels. The molecule oscillates back
      and forth between both levels, at the frequency of the electric
      field. When the electric field and transition level frequencies
      are substantially the same (i. e. , in resonance), the molecule
      will be oscillating back and forth in both levels, and the
      spectral lines for both levels will appear simultaneously and at
      approximately the same intensity. Normally, only one frequency
      level is seen at a time, but a resonant electric field causes the
      molecule to be at both levels at essentially the same time, and so
      both transitional frequencies appear in its'spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, for sufficiently large electric fields (e. g. , those
      used to generate plasmas) additional transition level frequencies
      can occur at regular spacings substantially equal to the electric
      field frequency. Also, splitting of the transition level
      frequencies can occur, at frequencies of the electric field
      frequency divided by odd numbers (e. g. , electric field
      frequency"fE"divided by 3, or 5, or 7, i. e., fE/3 or fE/5, etc.
      ).<br>
      <br>
      All the varied effects of electric fields cause new frequencies,
      new splitting frequencies and new energy level states.<br>
      <br>
      Further, when the electric field frequency equals a transition
      level frequency of for instance, an atom or molecule, a second
      component with an opposite frequency charge and equal intensity
      can develop. This is negative Stark effect, with the two
      components of equal and opposite frequency charges destructively
      canceling each other. In spectral chemistry terms this amounts to
      a negative catalyst or poison in the crystallization reaction
      system, if the transition thus targeted was important to the
      reaction pathway. Thus, electric fields cause the Stark effect,
      which is the splitting, shifting, broadening, or changing
      intensity and changing transitional states of spectral frequencies
      for matter, (e. g. , atoms and molecules).<br>
      <br>
      As with many of the other mechanisms that have been discussed
      herein, changes in the spectral frequencies of crystallization
      reaction systems can affect the reaction rate and/or reaction
      pathway. For example, consider a crystallization reaction system
      like the following: C C A + B- Intermediates-D+F where A &amp; B
      are reactants, C is a physical catalyst, I stands for the
      intermediates, and D &amp; F are the products.<br>
      <br>
      Assume arguendo that the reaction normally progresses at only a
      moderate rate, by virtue of the fact that the physical catalyst
      produces several frequencies that are merely close to harmonics of
      the intermediates. Further assume that when an electric field is
      added, the catalyst frequencies are shifted so that several of the
      catalyst frequencies are now exact or substantially exact
      harmonics of the intermediates. This will result in, for example,
      the reaction being catalyzed at a faster rate. Thus, the Stark
      effect can be used to obtain a more efficient energy transfer
      through the matching of frequencies (i. e. , when frequencies
      match, energies transfer).<br>
      <br>
      If a reaction normally progresses at only a moderate rate,
      many"solutions"have included subjecting the crystallization
      reaction system to extremely high pressures. The high pressures
      result in a broadening of the spectral patterns, which improves
      the transfer of energy through a matching of resonant frequencies.
      By understanding the underlying catalyst mechanisms of action,
      high-pressure systems could be replaced with, for example, a
      simple electric field which produces broadening. Not only would
      this be less costly to an industrial manufacturer, it could be
      much safer for manufacturing due to the removal of, for example,
      high-pressure equipment.<br>
      <br>
      Some reactants when mixed together do not react very quickly at
      all, but when an electric field is added they react rather
      rapidly. The prior art may refer to such a reaction as being
      catalyzed by an electric field and the equations would look like
      this: E<br>
      A+B &gt; D+FandA+B-D+F where E is the electric field. In this
      case, rather than applying a catalyst"C" (as discussed previously)
      to obtain the products"D + F", an electric field"E'can be applied.
      In this instance, the electric field works by changing the
      spectral frequencies (or spectral pattern) of one or more
      components in the crystallization reaction system so that the
      frequencies come into resonance, and the reaction can proceed
      along a desired reaction pathway (i. e. , when frequencies match,
      energy is transferred). Understood in this way, the electric field
      becomes just another tool to change spectral frequencies of atoms
      and molecules, and thereby affect reaction rates in spectral
      chemistry.<br>
      <br>
      Reaction pathways are also important. In the absence of an
      electrical field, a reaction pathway will progress to one set of
      products: C C A + B) Intermediates &lt; D + F<br>
      However, if an electrical field is added, at some particular
      strength of the field, the spectral frequencies may change so
      much, that a different intermediate is energized and the reaction
      proceeds down a different reaction pathway<br>
      <br>
      c c<br>
      A + B- Intermediates- G + H<br>
      E E This is similar to the concept discussed earlier herein,
      regarding the formation of different products depending on
      temperature. The changes in temperature caused changes in spectral
      frequencies, and hence different reaction pathways were favored at
      different temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      Likewise, electric fields cause changes in spectral frequencies,
      and hence different reactions pathways are favored by different
      electric fields. By tailoring an electric field to a particular
      crystallization reaction system, one can control not only the rate
      of the reaction but also the reaction products produced.<br>
      <br>
      The ability to tailor reactions, with or without a physical
      catalyst, by varying the strength of an electric field should be
      useful in many manufacturing situations. For example, it might be
      more cost effective to build only one physical set-up for a
      crystallization reaction system and to use one or more electric
      fields to change the reaction dynamics and products, depending on
      which product is desired. This would save the expense of having a
      separate physical set-up for production of each group of products.<br>
      <br>
      Besides varying the strength of an electric field, the frequency
      of an electric field can also be varied. Assuming that a reaction
      will proceed at a much faster rate if a particular strength static
      electric field (i. e. , direct current) is added as in the
      following: C C A + B &lt; Intermediates e D + F<br>
      E E<br>
      But further assume, that because of reactor design and location,
      it is much easier to deliver a time-varying electric field with
      alternating current. A very low frequency field, such as with a 60
      Hz wall outlet, can produce the normal or static-type Stark
      effect. Thus, the reactor could be adapted to the 60 Hz electric
      field and enjoy the same increase in reaction rate that would
      occur with the static electric field.<br>
      <br>
      If a certain physical catalyst produces spectral frequencies that
      are close to intermediate frequencies, but are not exact, it is
      possible that the activity of the physical catalyst in the past
      may have been improved by using higher temperatures. As disclosed
      earlier herein, the higher temperatures actually broadened the
      physical catalyst's spectral pattern to cause the frequency of the
      physical catalyst to be at least a partial match for at leas<br>
      <br>
      one of the intermediates. What is significant here is that high
      temperature boilers can be minimized, or eliminated altogether,
      and in their stead a moderate frequency electric field which, for
      example, broadened the spectral frequencies, could be used. For
      example, a frequency of around 100 Khz, equivalent to the typical
      line width frequencies at room temperature, could broaden
      substantially all of the spectral curves and cause the physical
      catalyst's spectral curves to match those of, for example,
      required intermediates. Thus, the electric field could cause the
      matter to behave as though the temperature had been raised, even
      though it had not been. (Similarly, any spectral manipulation, (e.
      g. , electric fields acoustics, heterodynes, etc. , that cause
      changes in the spectral line width, may cause a material to behave
      as though its temperature had been changed).<br>
      <br>
      The cyclic splitting of the Stark frequencies can be modulated
      with the electrical field frequency or its'first harmonic (i. e. ,
      first-order Stark effects are modulated with the electrical field
      frequency, while second-order Stark effects are modulated by two
      times the electrical field, frequency). Assume that a metallic
      platinum catalyst is used in a hydrogen reaction and it is desired
      to stimulate the 2.7 MHz hyperfine frequency of the hydrogen
      atoms. Earlier herein it was disclosed that electromagnetic
      radiation could be used to deliver the 2.7 MHz frequency. However,
      use of an alternating electric field at 2.7 MHz could be used
      instead.<br>
      <br>
      Since platinum is a metal and conducts electricity well, the
      platinum can be considered to be a part of the alternating current
      circuit. The platinum will exhibit a Stark effect, with all the
      frequencies splitting at a rate of 2.7 MHz. At sufficiently strong
      electric fields, additional transition frequencies
      or"sidebands"will occur at regular spacings equal to the electric
      field frequency. There will be dozens of split frequencies in the
      platinum atoms that are heterodynes of 2.7 MHz. This massive
      heterodyned output may stimulate the hydrogen hyperfine frequency
      of 2.7 MHz and direct the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      Another way to achieve this reaction, of course, would be to leave
      the platinum out of the reaction altogether. The 2.7 MHz field
      will have a resonant Stark effect on the hydrogen, separate and
      independent of the platinum catalyst. Copper is not normally
      catalytic for hydrogen, but copper could be used to construct a
      reaction vessel like a Stark waveguide to energize the hydrogen. A
      Stark waveguide is used to perform Stark spectroscopy. It is shown
      as Figures 61a and 61b. Specifically, Figure 61a shows the
      construction of the Stark waveguide, whereas Figure 61b shows the
      distribution of fields in the Stark waveguide. The electrical
      field is delivered through the conducting plate. A reaction vessel
      could be made fo<br>
      <br>
      the flow-through of gases and use an economical metal such as
      copper for the conducting plate. When the 2.7 MHz alternating
      current is delivered through the electrical connection to the
      copper conductor plate, the copper spectral frequencies, none of
      which are particularly resonant with hydrogen, will exhibit a
      Stark effect with normal-type splitting. The Stark frequencies
      will be split at a rate of 2.7 MHz. At a sufficiently strong
      electric field strength, additional sidebands will appear in the
      copper, with regular spacings (i. e. , heterodynes) of 2.7 MHz
      even though none of the actual copper frequencies matches the
      hydrogen frequencies, the Stark splitting or heterodynes will
      match the hydrogen frequency. Dozens of the copper split
      frequencies may resonate indirectly with the hydrogen hyperfine
      frequency and direct the reaction (i. e. , when frequencies match,
      energies transfer).<br>
      <br>
      With sophisticated equipment and a good understanding of a
      particular system, Stark resonance can be used with a transition
      level frequency. For example, assume that to achieve a particular
      reaction pathway, a molecule needs to be stimulated with a
      transition level frequency of 500 MHz. By delivering the 500 MHz
      electrical field to the molecule, this resonant electrical field
      may cause the molecule to oscillate back and forth between the two
      levels at the rate of 500 MHz. This electrically creates the
      conditions for light amplification (i. e. , laser via stimulation
      of multiple upper energy levels) and any added electromagnetic
      radiation at this frequency will be amplified by the molecule. In
      this manner, an electrical field may substitute for the laser
      effects of physical catalysts.<br>
      <br>
      In summary, by understanding the underlying spectral mechanisms of
      chemical reactions, electric fields can be used as yet another
      tool to catalyze and modify those chemical reactions and/or
      reaction pathways by modifying the spectral characteristics, for
      example, at least one participant and/or one or more components in
      the crystallization reaction system. Thus, another tool for
      mimicking catalyst mechanisms of reactions can be utilized.<br>
      <br>
      Similar to other spectral frequencies, as previously discussed,
      control of resonant energy exchange via manipulation of electric
      fields can be used in crystallization reaction systems to achieve
      desired results.<br>
      <br>
      <b>MAGNETIC FIELDS</b><br>
      <br>
      In spectral terms, magnetic fields behave similar to electric
      fields in their effect.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, the spectral frequency lines, for instance of atoms
      and molecules, can be split and shifted by a magnetic field. In
      this case, the external magnetic field from outside the<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      atom or molecule, interacts with the electric and magnetic fields
      already inside the atom or molecule.<br>
      <br>
      This action of an external magnetic field on spectral lines is
      called the"Zeeman Effect", in honor of its'discoverer, Dutch
      physicist Pieter Zeeman. In 1896, Zeeman discovered that the
      yellow flame spectroscopy"D"lines of sodium were broadened when
      the flame was held between strong magnetic poles. It was later
      discovered that the apparent broadening of the sodium spectral
      lines was actually due to their splitting and shifting.<br>
      <br>
      Zeeman's original observation has evolved into a separate branch
      of spectroscopy, relating to the study of atoms and molecules by
      measuring the changes in their spectral lines caused by a magnetic
      field. This in turn has evolved into the nuclear magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging used in
      medicine, as well as the laser magnetic resonance and electron
      spin resonance spectroscopy used in physics and chemistry.<br>
      <br>
      The Zeeman effect for the famous"D"lines of sodium is shown in
      Figures 62a and 62b. Figure 62a shows the Zeeman effect for
      sodium"D"lines; whereas Figure 62b shows the energy level diagram
      for the transitions in the Zeeman effect for the sodium"D"lines.<br>
      <br>
      The"D"lines are traditionally said to result from transition
      between the 3p2p and 3x2S electron orbitals. As is shown, each of
      the single spectral frequencies is split into two or more slightly
      different frequencies, which center around the original unsplit
      frequency.<br>
      <br>
      In the Zeeman effect, the amount that the spectral frequencies are
      split apart depends on the strength of the applied magnetic field.
      Figure 63 shows Zeeman splitting effects for the oxygen atom as a
      function of magnetic field. When there is no magnetic field, there
      are two single frequencies at zero and 4.8. When the magnetic
      field is at low strength (e. g. , 0.2 Tesla) there is just slight
      splitting and shifting of the original two frequencies. However,
      as the magnetic field is increased, the frequencies are split and
      shifted farther and farther apart.<br>
      <br>
      The degree of splitting and shifting in the Zeeman effect,
      depending on magnetic field strength, is shown in Figure 64 for
      the 3P state of silicon.<br>
      <br>
      As with the Stark effect generated from an external electric
      field, the Zeeman effect, generated from an external magnetic
      field, is slightly different depending on whether an atom or
      molecule is subjected to the magnetic field. The Zeeman effect on
      atoms can be divided into three different magnetic field
      strengths: weak; moderate; and strong. If the magnetic field
      strength is weak, the amount that the spectral frequencies will be
      shifted and split apart will be very small. The shifting away from
      the original spectral frequency will still stimulate<br>
      <br>
      the shifted frequencies. This is because they will be so close to
      the original spectral frequency that they will still be well
      within its resonance curve. As for the splitting, it is so small,
      that it is even less than the hyperfine splitting that normally
      occurs. This means that in a weak magnetic field, there will be
      only very slight splitting of spectral frequencies, translating
      into very low splitting frequencies in the lower regions of the
      radio spectrum and down into the very low frequency region. For
      example, the Zeeman splitting frequency for the hydrogen atom,
      which is caused by the earth's magnetic field, is around 30 KHz.
      Larger atoms have even lower frequencies in the lower kilohertz
      and even hertz regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      Without a magnetic field, an atom can be stimulated by using
      direct resonance with a spectral frequency or by using its fine or
      hyperfine splitting frequencies in the infrared through microwave,
      or microwave through radio regions, respectively. By merely adding
      a very weak magnetic field, the atom can be stimulated with an
      even lower radio or very low frequency matching the Zeeman
      splitting frequency. Thus, by simply using a weak magnetic field,
      a spectral catalyst range can be extended even lower into the
      radio frequency range.<br>
      <br>
      The weak magnetic field from the Earth causes Zeeman splitting in
      atoms in the hertz and kilohertz ranges. This means that all
      atoms, including those in biological organisms, are sensitive to
      hertz and kilohertz EM frequencies, by virtue of being subjected
      to the Earth's magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      At the other end of magnetic field strength, is the very strong
      magnetic field. In this case, the splitting apart and shifting of
      the spectral frequencies will be very wide. With this wide
      shifting of frequencies, the difference between the split
      frequencies will be much larger than the difference between the
      hyperfine splitting frequencies. This translates to Zeeman effect
      splitting frequencies at higher frequencies than the hyperfine
      splitting frequencies. This splitting occurs somewhere around the
      microwave region. Although the addition of a strong magnetic field
      does not extend the reach in the electromagnetic spectrum at one
      extreme or the other, as a weak magnetic field does, it still does
      provide an option of several more potential spectral catalyst
      frequencies that can be used in the microwave region.<br>
      <br>
      The moderate magnetic field strength case is more complicated. The
      shifting and splitting caused by the Zeeman effect from a moderate
      magnetic field will be approximately equal to the hyperfine
      splitting. Although not widely discussed in the prior art, it is
      possible to apply a moderate magnetic field to an atom, to produce
      Zeeman splitting which is<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      substantially equivalent to its'hyperfine splitting. This presents
      interesting possibilities.<br>
      <br>
      Methods for guiding atoms in chemical reactions were disclosed
      earlier herein by stimulating atoms with hyperfine splitting
      frequencies. The Zeeman effect provides a way to achieve similar
      effects without introducing any spectral frequencies at all. For
      example, by introducing a moderate magnetic field, resonance may
      be set-up within the atom itself, that stimulates and/or energizes
      and/or stabilizes the atom.<br>
      <br>
      The moderate magnetic field causes low frequency Zeeman splitting
      that matches and hence energizes the low frequency hyperfine
      splitting frequency in the atom. However, the low hyperfine
      splitting frequencies actually correspond to the heterodyned
      difference between two vibrational or fine structure frequencies.
      When the hyperfine splitting frequency is stimulated, the two
      electronic frequencies will eventually be stimulated. This in turn
      causes the atom to be, for example, stimulated. Thus, the Zeeman
      effect permits a spectral energy catalyst stimulation of an atom
      by exposing that atom to a precise strength of a magnetic field,
      and the use of spectral EM frequencies is not required (i. e. , so
      long as frequencies match, energies will transfer). The
      possibilities are quite interesting because an inert
      crystallization reaction system may suddenly spring to life upon
      the application of the proper moderate strength magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      There is also a difference between the"normal"Zeeman effect and
      the"anomalous" Zeeman effect. With the"normal"Zeeman effect, a
      spectral frequency is split by a magnetic field into three
      frequencies, with expected even spacing between them (see Figure
      65a which shows the"normal"Zeeman effects and Figure 65b which
      shows the"anomalous"Zeeman effects). One of the new split
      frequencies is above the original frequency, and the other new
      split frequency is below the original frequency. Both new
      frequencies are split the same distance away from the original
      frequency. Thus, the difference between the upper and original and
      the lower and original frequencies is about the same. This means
      that in terms of heterodyne differences, there are at most, two
      new heterodyned differences with the normal Zeeman effect. The
      first heterodyne or splitting difference is the difference between
      one of the new split frequencies and the original frequency. The
      other splitting difference is between the upper and lower new
      split frequencies. It is, of course, twice the frequency
      difference between either of the upper or lower frequencies and
      the original frequency.<br>
      <br>
      In many instances the Zeeman splitting produced by a magnetic
      field results in more than three frequencies, or in splitting that
      is spaced differently than expected. This is called<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      the"anomalous"Zeeman effect (see Figures 65 and 66; wherein Figure
      66 shows an anomalous Zeeman effect for zinc 3p- 3s.<br>
      <br>
      If there are still just three frequencies, and the Zeeman effect
      is anomalous because the spacing is different than expected, the
      situation is similar to the normal effect. However, there are at
      most, two new splitting frequencies that can be used. If, however,
      the effect is anomalous because more than three frequencies are
      produced, then there will be a much more richly varied situation.
      Assume an easy case where there are four Zeeman splitting
      frequencies (see Figures 67a and Figure 67b). Figure 67a shows
      four Zeeman splitting frequencies and Figure 67b shows four new
      heterodyned differences.<br>
      <br>
      In this example of anomalous Zeeman splitting, there are a total
      of four frequencies, where once existed only one frequency. For
      simplicity's sake, the new Zeeman frequencies will be labeled 1,
      2,3, and 4. Frequencies 3 and 4 are also split apart by the same
      difference "w". Thus, "w"is a heterodyned splitting frequency.
      Frequencies 2 and 3 are also split apart by a different amount"x".
      So far there are two heterodyned splitting frequencies, as in the
      normal Zeeman effect.<br>
      <br>
      However, frequencies 1 and 3 are split apart by a third amount"y",
      where"y"is the sum of"w"and"x". And, frequencies 2 and 4 are also
      split apart by the same third amount "y". Finally, frequencies 1
      and 4 are split even farther apart by an amount"z". Once again,
      "z"is a summation amount from adding"w + x + w". Thus, the result
      is four heterodyned frequencies: w, x, y, and z in the anomalous
      Zeeman effect.<br>
      <br>
      If there were six frequencies present from the anomalous Zeeman
      effect, there would be even more heterodyned differences. Thus,
      the anomalous Zeeman effect results in far greater flexibility in
      the choice of frequencies when compared to the normal Zeeman
      effect.<br>
      <br>
      In the normal Zeeman effect the original frequency is split into
      three evenly spaced frequencies, with a total of just two
      heterodyned frequencies. In the anomalous Zeeman effect the
      original frequency is split into four or more unevenly spaced
      frequencies, with at least four or more heterodyned frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      Similar Zeeman effects can occur in molecules. Molecules come in
      three basic varieties: ferromagnetic; paramagnetic; and
      diamagnetic. Ferromagnetic molecules are typical magnets. The
      materials typically hold a strong magnetic field and are composed
      of magnetic elements such as iron, cobalt, and nickel.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Paramagnetic molecules hold only a weak magnetic field. If a
      paramagnetic material is put into an external magnetic field, the
      magnetic moment of the molecules of the material are lined up in
      the same direction as the external magnetic field. Now, the
      magnetic moment of the molecules is the direction in which the
      molecules own magnetic field is weighted.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, the magnetic moment of a molecule will tip to
      whichever side of the molecule is more heavily weighted in terms
      of its own magnetic field. Thus, paramagnetic molecules will
      typically tip in the same direction as an externally applied
      magnetic field. Because paramagnetic materials line up with an
      external magnetic field, they are also weakly attracted to sources
      of magnetic fields.<br>
      <br>
      Common paramagnetic elements include oxygen, aluminum, sodium,
      magnesium, calcium and potassium. Stable molecules such as oxygen
      ( 2) and nitric oxide (NO) are also paramagnetic. Molecular oxygen
      makes up approximately 20% of our planet's atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      Both molecules play important roles in biologic organisms. In
      addition, unstable molecules, more commonly known as free
      radicals, chemical reaction intermediates or plasmas, are also
      paramagnetic. Paramagnetic ions include hydrogen, manganese,
      chromium, iron, cobalt, and nickel. Many paramagnetic substances
      occur in biological organisms. For instance the blood flowing in
      our veins is an ionic solution containing red blood cells. The red
      blood cells contain hemoglobin, which in turn contains ionized
      iron. The hemoglobin, and hence the red blood cells, are
      paramagnetic. In addition, hydrogen ions can be found in a
      multitude of organic compounds and reactions. For instance, the
      hydrochloric acid in a stomach contains hydrogen ions. Adenosine
      triphosphate (ATP), the energy system of nearly all biological
      organisms, requires hydrogen and manganese ions to function
      properly. Thus, the very existence of life itself depends on
      paramagnetic materials.<br>
      <br>
      Diamagnetic molecules, on the other hand, are repelled by a
      magnetic field, and line up what little magnetic moments they have
      away from the direction of an external magnetic field. Diamagnetic
      substances do not typically hold a magnetic field. Examples of
      diamagnetic elements include hydrogen, helium, neon, argon,
      carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, chlorine, copper, zinc, silver,
      gold, lead, and mercury. Diamagnetic molecules include water, most
      gases, organic compounds, and salts such as sodium chloride. Salts
      are really just crystals of diamagnetic ions. Diamagnetic ions
      include lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, fluorine,
      chlorine, bromine, iodine, ammonium, and sulphate. Ionic crystals
      usually dissolve easily in water, and as such the ionic water
      solution is also<br>
      <br>
      diamagnetic. Biologic organisms are filled with diamagnetic
      materials, because they are carbon-based life forms. In addition,
      the blood flowing in our veins is an ionic solution containing
      blood cells. The ionic solution (i. e. , blood plasma) is made of
      water molecules, sodium ions, potassium ions, chlorine ions, and
      organic protein compounds. Hence, our blood is a diamagnetic
      solution carrying paramagnetic blood cells.<br>
      <br>
      With regard to the Zeeman effect, first consider the case of
      paramagnetic molecules.<br>
      <br>
      As with atoms, the effects can be categorized on the basis of
      magnetic field strength. If the external magnetic field applied to
      a paramagnetic molecule is weak, the Zeeman effect will produce
      splitting into equally spaced levels. In most cases, the amount of
      splitting will be directly proportional to the strength of the
      magnetic field, a"first-order"effect. A general rule of thumb is
      that a field of one (1) oersted (i. e. , slightly larger than the
      earth's magnetic field) will produce Zeeman splittings of
      approximately 1.4 MHz in paramagnetic molecules.<br>
      <br>
      Weaker magnetic fields will produce narrower splittings, at lower
      frequencies. Stronger magnetic fields will produce wider
      splittings, at higher frequencies. In these first order Zeeman
      effects, there is usually only splitting, with no shifting of the
      original or center frequency, as was present with Zeeman effects
      on atoms.<br>
      <br>
      In many paramagnetic molecules there are also second-order effects
      where the Zeeman splitting is proportional to the square of the
      magnetic field strength. In these cases, the splitting is much
      smaller and of much lower frequencies. In addition to splitting,
      the original or center frequencies shift as they do in atoms,
      proportional to the magnetic field strength.<br>
      <br>
      Sometimes the direction of the magnetic field in relation to the
      orientation of the molecule makes a difference. For instance, 71
      frequencies are associated with a magnetic field parallel to an
      exciting electromagnetic field, while a frequencies are found when
      it is perpendicular. Both 7t and a frequencies are present with a
      circularly polarized electromagnetic field. Typical Zeeman
      splitting patterns for a paramagnetic molecule in two different
      transitions are shown in Figure 68a and 68b. The X frequencies are
      seen when AM = 0, and are above the long horizontal line. The a
      frequencies are seen when AM = 1, and are below the long
      horizontal line. If a paramagnetic molecule was placed in a weak
      magnetic field, circularly polarized light would excite both sets
      of frequencies in the molecule. Thus, it is possible to control
      which set of frequencies are excited in a molecule by controlling
      its orientation with respect to the magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      When the magnetic field strength is intermediate, the interaction
      between the paramagnetic molecule's magnetic moments and the
      externally applied magnetic field produces Zeeman effects
      equivalent to other frequencies and energies in the molecule. For
      instance, the Zeeman spitting may be near a rotational frequency
      and disturb the end-overend rotational motion of the molecule. The
      Zeeman splitting and energy may be particular or large enough to
      uncouple the molecule's spin from its molecular axis.<br>
      <br>
      If the magnetic field is very strong, the nuclear magnetic moment
      spin will uncouple from the molecular angular momentum. In this
      case, the Zeeman effects overwhelm the hyperfine structure, and
      are of much higher energies at much higher frequencies. In spectra
      of molecules exposed to strong magnetic fields, hyperfine
      splitting appears as a small perturbation of the Zeeman splitting.<br>
      <br>
      Next, consider Zeeman effects in so called"ordinary molecules"or
      diamagnetic molecules. Most molecules are of the diamagnetic
      variety, hence the designation"ordinary".<br>
      <br>
      This includes, of course, most organic molecules found in biologic
      organisms. Diamagnetic molecules have rotational magnetic moments
      from rotation of the positively charged nucleus, and this magnetic
      moment of the nucleus is only about 1/1000 of that from the
      paramagnetic molecules. This means that the energy from Zeeman
      splitting in diamagnetic molecules is much smaller than the energy
      from Zeeman splitting in paramagnetic molecules. The equation for
      the Zeeman energy in diamagnetic molecules is: Hz =-(gjJ = gs Ho
      where J is the molecular rotational angular momentum, I is the
      nuclear-spin angular momentum, gj is the rotational g factor, and
      gl is the nuclear-spin g factor. This Zeeman energy is much less,
      and of much lower frequency, than the paramagnetic Zeeman energy.
      In terms of frequency, it falls in the hertz and kilohertz regions
      of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, consider the implications of Zeeman splitting for
      catalyst and chemical reactions and for spectral chemistry. A weak
      magnetic field will produce hertz and kilohertz Zeeman splitting
      in atoms and second order effects in paramagnetic molecules.
      Virtually any kind of magnetic field will produce hertz and
      kilohertz Zeeman splitting in diamagnetic molecules. All these
      atoms and molecules will then become sensitive to radio and very
      low frequency (VLF) electromagnetic waves. The atoms and molecules
      will absorb the radio or VLF energy and become stimulated to a
      greater or lesser degree. This could be used to add spectral
      energy to, for instance, a particular molecule or intermediate in
      a chemical<br>
      <br>
      crystallization reaction system. For instance, for hydrogen and
      oxygen gases turning into water over a platinum catalyst, the
      hydrogen atom radical is important for maintaining the reaction.
      In the earth's weak magnetic field, Zeeman splitting for hydrogen
      is around 30 KHz. Thus, the hydrogen atoms in the crystallization
      reaction system, could be energized by applying to them a Zeeman
      splitting frequency for hydrogen (e. g. , 30 KHz). Energizing the
      hydrogen atoms in the crystallization reaction system will
      duplicate the mechanisms of action of platinum, and catalyze the
      reaction. If the reaction was moved into outer space, away from
      the earth's weak magnetic field, hydrogen would no longer have a
      30 KHz Zeeman splitting frequency, and the 30 KHz would no longer
      as effectively catalyze the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      The vast majority of materials on this planet, by virtue of
      existing within the earth's weak magnetic field, will exhibit
      Zeeman splitting in the hertz and kilohertz regions. This applies
      to biologics and organics as well as inorganic or inanimate
      materials. Humans are composed of a wide variety of atoms,
      diamagnetic molecules, and second order effect paramagnetic
      molecules. These atoms and molecules all exist in the earth's weak
      magnetic field. These atoms and molecules in humans all have
      Zeeman splitting in the hertz and kilohertz regions, because they
      are in the earth's magnetic field. Biochemical and biocatalytic
      processes in humans are thus sensitive to hertz and kilohertz
      electromagnetic radiation, by virtue of the fact that they are in
      the earth's weak magnetic field. As long as humans continue to
      exist on this planet, they will be subject to spectral energy
      catalyst effects from hertz and kilohertz EM waves because of the
      Zeeman effect from the planet's magnetic field. This has
      significant implications for low frequency communications, as well
      as chemical and biochemical reactions, diagnostics, and treatment
      of diseases.<br>
      <br>
      A strong magnetic field will produce splitting greater than the
      hyperfine frequencies, in the microwave and infrared regions of
      the EM spectrum in atoms and paramagnetic molecules. In the
      hydrogen/oxygen reaction, a strong field could be added to the
      crystallization reaction system and transmit MHz and/or GHz
      frequencies into the reaction to energize the hydroxy radical and
      hydrogen reaction intermediates. If physical platinum was used to
      catalyze the reaction, the application of a particular magnetic
      field strength could result in both the platinum and the reaction
      intermediate spectra having frequencies that were split and
      shifted in such a way that even more frequencies matched than
      without the magnetic field. In this way, Zeeman splitting can be
      used to improve the effectiveness of a physical<br>
      <br>
      catalyst, by copying its mechanism of action (i. e. , more
      frequencies could be caused to match and thus more energy could
      transfer).<br>
      <br>
      A moderate magnetic field will produce Zeeman splitting in atoms
      and paramagnetic molecules at frequencies on par with the
      hyperfine and rotational splitting frequencies. This means that a
      crystallization reaction system can be energized without even
      adding electromagnetic energy. Similarly, by placing the
      crystallization reaction system in a moderate magnetic field that
      produces Zeeman splitting equal to the hyperfine or rotational
      splitting, increased reaction would occur. For instance, by using
      a magnetic field that causes hyperfine or rotational splitting in
      hydrogen and oxygen gas, that matches the Zeeman splitting in
      hydrogen atom or hydroxy radicals, the hydrogen or hydroxy
      intermediate would be energized and would proceed through the
      reaction cascade to produce water. By using the appropriately
      tuned moderate magnetic field, the magnetic field could be used to
      turn the reactants into catalysts for their own reaction, without
      the addition of physical catalyst platinum or the spectral
      catalyst of platinum. Although the magnetic field would simply be
      copying the mechanism of action of platinum, the reaction would
      have the appearance of being catalyzed solely by an applied
      magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, consider the direction of the magnetic field in relation
      to the orientation of the molecule. When the magnetic field is
      parallel to an exciting electromagnetic field, 7r frequencies are
      produced. When the magnetic field is perpendicular to an exciting
      electromagnetic field, a frequencies are found. Assume that there
      is an industrial chemical crystallization reaction system that
      uses the same (or similar) starting reactants, but the goal is to
      be able to produce different products at will. By using magnetic
      fields combined with spectral energy or physical catalysts, the
      reaction can be guided to one set of products or another. For the
      first set of products, the electromagnetic excitation is oriented
      parallel to the magnetic field, producing one set of 7r
      frequencies, which leads to a first set of products. To achieve a
      different product, the direction of the magnetic field is changed
      so that it is perpendicular to the exciting electromagnetic field.
      This produces a different set of a frequencies, and a different
      reaction pathway is energized, thus producing a different set of
      products. Thus, according to the present invention, magnetic field
      effects, Zeeman splitting, splitting and spectral energy catalysts
      can be used to fine-tune the specificity of many crystallization
      reaction systems.<br>
      <br>
      Similar to other spectral frequencies, as previously discussed,
      control of resonant energy exchange via manipulation of magnetic
      fields can be used in crystallization reaction systems to achieve
      desired results.<br>
      <br>
      In summary, by understanding the underlying spectral mechanism to
      chemical reactions, magnetic fields can be used as yet another
      tool to catalyze and modify those chemical reactions by modifying
      the spectral characteristics of at least one participant and/or at
      least one component in the crystallization reaction system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>REACTION VESSEL AND CONDITIONING REACTION VESSEL SIZE, SHAPE
        AND</b><br>
      <b>COMPOSITION</b><br>
      <br>
      An important consideration in the use of spectral chemistry is the
      reaction vessel size, shape and composition. The reaction vessel
      size and shape can affect the vessel's NOF to various wave
      energies (e. g. , EM, acoustic, electrical current, etc). This in
      turn may affect cell reaction system dynamics. For instance, a
      particularly small bench-top reaction vessel may have an EM NOF of
      1,420 MHz related to a 25 cm dimension. When a reaction with an
      atomic hydrogen intermediate is performed in the small bench-top
      reaction the reaction proceeds quickly, due in part to the fact
      that the reactor vessel and the hydrogen hyperfine splitting
      frequencies match (1,420 MHz). This allows the reaction vessel and
      hydrogen intermediates to resonate, thus transferring energy to
      the intermediate and promoting the reaction pathway.<br>
      <br>
      When the reaction is scaled up for large industrial production,
      the reaction would occur in a much larger reaction vessel with an
      EM NOF of, for example, 100 MHz. Because the reaction vessel is no
      longer resonating with the hydrogen intermediate, the reaction
      proceeds at a slower rate. This deficiency in the larger reaction
      vessel can be compensated for, by, for example, supplementing the
      reaction with 1,420 MHz radiation, thereby restoring the faster
      reaction rate.<br>
      <br>
      Likewise, reaction vessel (or conditioning reaction vessel)
      composition may play a similar role in crystallization reaction
      system dynamics. For example, a stainless steel bench- top
      reaction vessel may produce vibrational frequencies which resonate
      with vibrational frequencies of a reactant, thus, for example,
      promoting disassociation of a reactant into reactive
      intermediates. When the reaction is scaled up for industrial
      production, it may be placed into, for example, a ceramic-lined
      metal reactor vessel. The new reaction vessel typically will not
      produce the reactant vibrational frequency, and the reaction will
      proceed at<br>
      <br>
      a slower rate. Once again, this deficiency in the new reaction
      vessel, caused by its different composition, can be compensated
      for either by returning the reaction to a stainless steel vessel,
      or by supplementing, for example, the vibrational frequency of the
      reactant into the ceramic-lined vessel; and/or conditioning the
      reaction vessel with a suitable conditioning energy prior to some
      or all of the other components of the reaction system being
      introduced into the reaction vessel.<br>
      <br>
      It should now be understood that all the aspects of spectral
      chemistry previously discussed (resonance, targeting, poisons,
      promoters, supporters, electric and magnetic-fields both
      endogenous and exogenous to cell reaction system components, etc.
      ) apply to the reaction vessel (or conditioning reaction vessel),
      as well as to, for example, any participant (or conditionable
      participant) placed inside it. The reaction vessel (or
      conditioning reaction vessel) may be comprised of matter (e. g. ,
      stainless steel, plastic, glass, and/or ceramic, etc.) or it may
      be comprised of a field or energy (e. g. , magnetic bottle, light
      trapping, etc. ) A reaction vessel (or conditioning reactor
      vessel), by possessing inherent properties such as frequencies,
      waves, and/or fields, may interact with other components in the
      cell reaction system and/or at least one participant. Likewise,
      holding vessels, conduits, etc. , some of which may interact with
      the reaction system, but in which the reaction does not actually
      take place, may interact with one or more components in the cell
      reaction system and may potentially affect them, either positively
      or negatively. Accordingly, when reference is made to the reaction
      vessel, it should be understood that all portions associated
      therewith may also be involved in desirable reactions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention will be more clearly perceived and better understood
      from the following specific examples.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><br>
      <b>ENHANCING THE GROWTH OF SODIUM CHLORIDE CRYSTALS</b><br>
      <br>
      This Example shows that the growth of crystals of NaCl was
      enhanced by applying electromagnetic energy from a commercially
      available 70-watt high-pressure sodium bulb to a saturated
      solution of sodium chloride. Specifically, as shown schematically
      in Figure 88, a glass beaker 200 was divided substantially in half
      vertically by a divider or membrane 201.<br>
      <br>
      The divider or membrane 201 was not completely liquid-tight at the
      points where it contacted the glass beaker 200. Thus, ions were
      capable of migrating around and/or underneath the membrane 201 to
      permit substantially equivalent ion concentrations at any point in
      the beaker 200. However, the membrane 201 itself was substantially
      impervious to visible light frequencies. In particular, the
      membrane 201 was comprised of a paper-backed acetate material
      which is similar to the material used for creating overhead
      projector transparencies.<br>
      <br>
      A saturated solution of sodium chloride 202 was prepared by known
      conventional techniques.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, distilled and deionized water was heated to about 45
      C and sodium chloride crystals from Fisher Chemicals (Certified A.
      C. S. and discussed later herein) were added until no more
      dissolution of the sodium chloride crystals occurred. The liquid
      was then decanted and filtered from any remaining undissolved
      sodium chloride and the resulting solution was placed into the
      beaker 200.<br>
      <br>
      A commonly available, 70 watt, high-pressure sodium lamp 203, was
      used to illuminate only side"A"of the beaker 200 containing the
      saturated NaCl solution 202. The lamp 203 was made by Philips and
      was sold under the Trademark CERAMALUX. The electric discharge
      sodium lamp 203 contained primarily sodium, but also contained
      some mercury, as is common in this type of discharge lamp. As
      shown in Figure 88, a camera 204 was positioned on top of a
      magnifying microscopic assembly (not shown) so as to be able to
      view both of sides"A"and"B"from the top of the beaker 200 under 2X
      to 4X magnification.<br>
      <br>
      The sodium lamp 203 was allowed to illuminate only the side"A"of
      the beaker 200 while the saturated solution 202 in both
      sides"A"and"B"was maintained at about room temperature. Even
      though the membrane 201 was not completely light-tight, the
      specific positioning of the light source 203 along with the
      positioning of the membrane 201 prevented almost all light from
      entering side"B"of the beaker 200. The temperature of the solution<br>
      <br>
      202 was maintained at constant temperature (in this Example room
      temperature) by using a conventional heating/cooling stage (not
      shown in Figure 88). In addition, all photomicrographs were taken
      by a computer-controlled system which permitted an instantaneous
      reading of temperature at the moment that the photomicrograph was
      taken.<br>
      <br>
      The entire crystal growth experiment was performed in a darkened
      room.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 89a shows crystals 205 (magnification 4X) which were grown
      from the saturated solution 202 on side"A"of the beaker 200 which
      was illuminated by the sodium lamp 203 of Figure 88. Figure 89b
      shows crystals 205 (magnification 4X) which are grown from a
      solution corresponding to side"B"of the beaker 200. Figure 89c
      shows an actual photomicrograph corresponding to a top view of the
      beaker 200 (by the microscope 204) with the divider or membrane
      201 forming sides"A"and"B". It is clear that side"A"of the chamber
      contained a number of crystals 205, whereas side"B"of the chamber
      did not exhibit nearly as much crystal formation in comparison to
      side"A". Accordingly, the sodium discharge lamp 203 had a dramatic
      impact on the number, size and morphology (more precise faceting,
      pyramidal crystals) of crystals 205 formed from the saturated
      solution 202.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><br>
      <b>ENHANCING THE CRYSTAL GROWTH OF SODIUM CHLORIDE</b><br>
      <br>
      This Example shows that the growth of crystals of NaCl was
      enhanced by applying electromagnetic energy from a commercially
      available 70-watt high pressure sodium bulb to a saturated
      solution of sodium chloride; compared to crystal growth achieved
      with electromagnetic energy of a similar intensity but a different
      wavelength or frequency (e. g., provided by a tungsten light
      source).<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, Figure 90 shows a schematic representation of an
      assembly similar to that assembly used in Example 1. In
      particular, a slide 206, contained a small amount of a saturated
      solution 202 of sodium chloride thereon. The saturated solution of
      sodium chloride 202 was prepared by the same conventional
      techniques discussed in Example 1. A small amount of saturated
      solution 202 was placed onto the slide 206. As discussed in
      Example 1, the saturated solution 202 was made at a temperature
      about 45 C. The solution 202 was transferred to the slide 206
      while its temperature was still elevated (e. g. , was around 25-
      35 C). The slide 206 was placed onto the same heating/cooling
      stage 310 discussed in Example 1. The temperature of the solution
      202 was thereafter cooled by the heating and controlled channels
      311 and 312 which were capable of changing temperature at a rate
      of about 1 C per minute.<br>
      A light source 203 comprising the same sodium light source
      discussed in Example 1, and a light source 203', comprising a
      tungsten bulb, were sequentially exposed to different solutions
      202. Specifically, a first sample of the saturated solution 202
      was cooled down from about 30-45 C, depending on the experiment,
      at a controlled rate of about 1 C per minute while the sodium
      light source 203 was irradiated onto the solution 202 on the slide
      206. Similarly, a second series of samples of saturated solution
      202 was cooled from about 30-45 C, at the same controlled rate of
      about 1 C per minute, while the tungsten light source 203'was
      irradiated onto the solution 202 located on the slide 206. In this
      instance, a 50 A bandpass filter 207 was used which permitted only
      light corresponding to wavelengths of from about 4225 A to about
      4275 A to pass therethrough. Similarly, a third sample of
      saturated solution 202 was cooled from about 30-45 C at the same
      controlled rate of about 1 C per minute while the filtered
      tungsten light source 203'was irradiated onto the solution 202 on
      the stage 206. In this instance, a second bandpass 50 A filter
      207'was used which permitted light corresponding to wavelengths of
      from about 6175 A to about 6225 A to pass therethrough. In each of
      these three different saturated solution samples series, the onset
      of crystallization was monitored and recorded by a
      computer-controlled system which permitted an instantaneous
      reading of temperature at the moment that the photograph was
      taken. It was noted that these solutions, upon cooling, may have
      become slightly supersaturated. However, for comparison purposes,
      the solutions were at the same temperatures and cooled at the same
      rates. Thus, the amount of crystallization observed was only a
      function of the spectral patterns that irradiated the solutions.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 91a shows a transmission optical micrograph of the NaCl
      crystal growth which had resulted at a temperature of
      approximately 20 C. The saturated solution was illuminated by the
      sodium source light 203.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 91b shows a transmission optical micrograph of the NaCl
      crystal growth from the saturated solution taken at about 19 C.
      This saturated solution was illuminated with a tungsten light
      filtered by the bandpass filter 207 (i. e. , 4225 A-4275 A).<br>
      <br>
      Figure 91c shows a transmission optical micrograph of the NaCl
      crystal growth from saturated solution taken at about 19 C. This
      saturated solution was illuminated with a tungsten light filtered
      by the bandpass filter of 207' (i. e., 6175 A-6225 A).<br>
      <br>
      It is clear from comparing the results in Figure 91a, versus the
      results in both of Figures 91b and 91c, that the illumination of
      the saturated solution 202 with a sodium light source 203 had a
      dramatic increase in the amount of crystallization or crystal
      growth compared to illumination with the tungsten light source
      203'filtered by the two filters<br>
      <br>
      207/207', as shown in Figures 91b and 91c, respectively. In
      particular, the amount of field occlusion which is shown in Figure
      91 a is much more dramatic than the amount of field occlusion that
      is shown in Figures 91b or 91c. In this particular example, field
      occlusion is equivalent to the amount of crystallization that
      occurred. Accordingly, it is clear that the sodium light source
      had a dramatic impact on the number and size of crystals 205 which
      were formed from the saturated solution 202. It should be noted
      that the excessive field occlusion shown in Figure 91 a was
      accompanied by an onset of crystallization which began immediately
      upon illumination with the sodium light source. Crystallization
      did not begin in the experiments corresponding to Figures 91b and
      91c until the solutions had cooled 2-3 C.<br>
      <br>
      Typically, in traditional crystallization experiments of this
      general type (e. g. , growing NaCl crystals from solution) less
      crystallization would be expected at higher temperatures. NaCl
      crystal growth began at about 25 C in the experiment corresponding
      to Figure 91a ; at about 23 C in the experiment corresponding to
      Figure 91b; and at about 22 C in the experiment corresponding to
      Figure 91c. Clearly the results shown in this Example 2
      demonstrate that the sodium light influenced not only the amount
      of crystallization, but also the temperature at which the onset of
      crystal growth began.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 3 ENHANCING THE GROWTH OF POTASSIUM DIHYDROGEN
        PHOSPHATE CYRSTALS</b><br>
      <br>
      The procedures of Example 1 were followed except for the following
      differences.<br>
      <br>
      Rather than forming a saturated solution of NaCl in water, a
      saturated solution of"KDP" (Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate) was
      formed. The KDP (molecular weight 136.1) was obtained from Baker
      Analyzed Reagents (Stock #1-3246 ; Bakers Company in Phillipsburg,
      N. J. ). Further, a potassium light source (Thermo Oriel, 10W
      spectral line potassium lamp #65070 ; lamp mount #65160 and
      spectral lamp power supply #65150) was used rather than the sodium
      light source. Moreover, the membrane 201 divided the beaker 202
      into four sections rather than two. The potassium source light was
      introduced to only one portion of the beaker 202. Growth of KDP
      crystals was observed only in the section of the beaker 202 which
      had the potassium light incident thereon. Absolutely no KDP
      crystal growth began in any of the three other chambers in the
      beaker 202 under the experimental conditions of this Example 3.<br>

      <br>
      One or more sodium lamps was/were mounted at various angles, and
      location (s) as specified in each experiment. Unless stated
      differently in the Example, the lamp was located at about 15
      inches (about 38 cm) from the beakers or dishes to maintain
      substantially consistent intensities.<br>
      <br>
      - Potassium lamp, Thermo Oriel, 10 watt spectral line potassium

      b) Preparation of Solutions i) Classical Solution-The apparatus
      used to make a classical solution is shown schematically in Figure
      92. Water (about 800 ml) was placed into a glass Beaker 104 and<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      was heated with a Bunsen burner 101 from room temperature to about
      55 C in about 6-12 minutes. Salt was added in about 50 gram
      amounts and the solution 105 was stirred with a glass stir rod
      (not shown) until no more salt would dissolve and undissolved salt
      remained on the bottom of the Beaker 104. The solution 105 was
      then allowed to equilibrate overnight (about 16 hours) before
      being decanted for use in the various crystallization experiments
      discussed later herein. ii) Conditioned Solution-The apparatus
      used to make a conditioned solution is shown in Figure 93. Water
      (about 800 ml) was heated by the sodium lamp 112 and housing 111,
      which together were positioned below the Beaker 104. The light
      from the bulb 112 was made to be incident on the bottom of the
      Beaker 104 through an aluminum foil cylinder 110 which functioned
      as a light guide. The temperature of the solution 105 was raised
      to about 55 C in about 40 minutes. Salt was added in about 50 gram
      amounts and the solution 105 was stirred with a glass stir rod
      until no more salt would dissolve and undissolved salt remained on
      the bottom of the Beaker 104. The solution 105 was allowed to
      equilibrate overnight (about 16 hours) before being decanted for
      use in the various crystallization experiments discussed later
      herein.<br>
      <br>
      * The D lines in the sodium electronic spectrum are resonant with
      vibrational overtones of water. Energizing these vibrational
      overtones of water changes its material properties as a solvent.
      Thus, the sodium lamp can be used to condition the water and
      change its material properties before it is used in a
      crystallization solution. c) Crystallization Procedures i)
      Classical Crystallization-Solution was placed in a beaker or in a
      crystallization dish and left undisturbed in the presence of
      ambient overhead fluorescent lighting. ii) Spectral
      Crystallization-Solution was placed in a beaker or in a
      crystallization dish and left undisturbed in the presence of
      irradiation from one or more positioned sodium or potassium lamps
      (as discussed in each Example). The sodium electronic spectrum
      produced by the spectral lamp affected metal halide phase changes.
      d) Spectral Delivery Configurations i) Cone-Aluminum foil cone
      light guide fitted around a sodium light bulb, extending about 23
      cm from the bulb, with the distal end formed around a uniform
      diameter of about 1.8 cm. ii) Cylinder-Aluminum foil cylinder
      light guide fitted around a sodium light bulb, extending about 23
      cm from the bulb, with a uniform diameter of about 6 cm.<br>
      <br>
      iii) Parabolic-Aluminum dish (e. g. , from a small stove-top
      burner) fitted around a sodium light bulb without a foil light
      guide. e) Ambient Lighting<br>
      All experimental conditions described in the Examples occurred in
      the presence of standard fluorescent lighting. The fluorescent
      lamps were Sylvania Cool White Deluxe Fluorescent Lamps, 75 watts,
      and were each about eight (8) feet long (about 2.4 meters long).<br>
      <br>
      The lamps were suspended in pairs approximately 3.5 meters above
      the laboratory counter on which the experimental set-up was
      located. There were six (6) pairs of lamps present in a room which
      measured approximately 25 feet by 40 feet (7.6 meters x 12.1
      meters).<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4a-SODIUM CHLORIDE</b><br>
      <br>
      Classical saturated NaCl solution (about 50 ml), at room
      temperature (22 C), was placed into three glass beakers (200 ml).
      One beaker was placed in a 25 C waterbath (making the solution
      slightly unsaturated) with spectral crystallization being
      initiated from a single overhead sodium lamp 112 with a cone
      delivery configuration 120 (as shown in Figure 94). The second
      beaker was placed directly on the laboratory counter with spectral
      crystallization being irradiated from a single overhead sodium
      lamp 112 with a cone delivery configuration 120 (as shown in
      Figure 94). The third beaker was placed into a plastic bucket as a
      control with no ambient light being incident on the saturated
      solution. Crystallization proceeded for about 21 hours under
      overhead fluorescent ambient lights (i. e. , the first and second
      beakers).<br>
      <br>
      Results: Both spectral crystallizations, relative to the control
      (crystals shown in Figure 98a), showed more primary nucleation,
      and increased growth rate. The 25 C unsaturated solution, which
      was spectrally irradiated, showed more crystallization (crystals
      shown in Figure 98c) relative to the saturated spectral
      crystallization experiment (crystals shown in Figure 98b).
      Moreover, the unsaturated solution showed more primary nucleation,
      increased sizes in NaCl crystals (e. g. , about 2 mm average vs.
      about 1 mm average), and certain changes in morphology (rod-like
      structure (see Figure 98d) in addition to cubes) and more precise
      faceting relative to the saturated and spectrally excited
      solution. Thus, the crystals from the thermally unsaturated
      solution shown in Figures 98c and 98d were larger than the
      crystals from the saturated solution shown in Figure 98b.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4b-SODIUM CHLORIDE</b><br>
      <br>
      Classical saturated NaCl solution (about 100 ml), at room
      temperature (22 C), was placed into four glass beakers (about 200
      ml in size). Beaker #1 was suspended over a sodium lamp 112 with
      an aluminum foil cone 120 used to direct the energy from the
      sodium<br>
      <br>
      light 112 and the housing toward the Beaker 104, as shown in
      Figure 95. Beaker #2, which also contained about 100 ml of
      classical saturated NaCl solution, had about 10 ml of water added
      thereto using a glass syringe (i. e., making the solution slightly
      unsaturated). Beaker #2 was also suspended over a sodium lamp 112
      using a cone 120, as shown in Figure 95.<br>
      <br>
      Beaker #3 was placed in an aluminum foil-wrapped bucket as a
      saturated control. After adding about 10 ml of water to beaker #4,
      it too was placed in the aluminum foil-wrapped bucket, but as an
      unsaturated control. Crystallization commenced under ambient
      overhead fluorescent lights. Approximately 2 hours after placing
      the beakers over the sodium lamps 112 (as shown in Figure 95) it
      was noted that heat rising from the sodium lamps and sodium lamp
      housings 111 was heating the NaCl solutions in beakers 1 and 2.
      Solution temperatures were measured and Beaker #1 was about 56 C.
      The temperature of the solution 105 in Beaker #2 was about 58 C
      and there were numerous small crystals on the bottom of the beaker
      and on the surface of the solution 105. A fan was used to cool the
      solutions while still delivering sodium spectra through the
      bottoms of the beakers. After about 21 hours, the temperature in
      Beaker #1 was about 22 C ; and the temperature in Beaker #2 was
      about 27 C.<br>
      <br>
      Results: Both spectral crystallizations in Beakers #1 and #2,
      compared to the saturated control in Beaker #3, showed increased
      primary nucleation and increased crystal growth. The unsaturated
      control in Beaker #4 had no growth. Crystals from the unsaturated
      solution in Beaker #2 showed decreased primary nucleation,
      substantially increased growth rate (about 3-7 mm in size), and
      certain changes in morphology (rods) compared to the saturated
      solution in Beaker #1 (about 1-2 mm in size cubic crystals).<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4c-SODIUM CHLORIDE</b><br>
      <br>
      Classical saturated NaCl solution (about 100 ml), at room
      temperature (22 C), was placed into three beakers (about 200 ml in
      size). Sterile water (about 10 ml) was added to the 100 ml of
      classical saturated solution in Beaker #1 and Beaker #2, which
      were both suspended over a sodium lamp 112 with a cone delivery
      configuration 120, as shown in Figure 95. Beaker #3 was placed
      into an aluminum foil-wrapped bucket as a saturated control.
      Beaker #1 was cooled with a fan. Beaker #2 was shielded from the
      fan until the temperature rose to about 58 C, and the shield was
      removed. Crystallization commenced under ambient overhead
      fluorescent lighting. After about 20 hours, the temperature in
      Beaker #1 was about 23 C and there was no observed crystallization
      growth. The temperature in Beaker #2 was about 25 C.<br>
      <br>
      Results: There were several cubic (approximately 3-8 mm) and a
      rectangular crystal (approximately 4 x 11 mm), similar to Example
      4b, Beaker #2.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4d-SODIUM CHLORIDE</b><br>
      <br>
      Classical saturated NaCl solution (about 100 ml) at room
      temperature (22 C) was placed into Beaker #1. A spectral saturated
      NaCl solution (about 100 ml) at room temperature (22 C) was placed
      into Beaker #2. Beaker #3 with about 100 ml classical solution and
      Beaker #4 with about 100 ml of spectral solution were placed into
      an aluminum foil-wrapped bucket as controls. Beakers #1 and #2
      were each placed under a single overhead sodium lamp 112 with a
      cone delivery configuration 120 (as shown in Figure 94).<br>
      <br>
      Crystallization proceeded overnight (about 20 hours) under ambient
      overhead fluorescent lighting.<br>
      <br>
      Results: Beakers #1 and #2 showed increased primary nucleation,
      and increased growth rate compared to the controls. Beaker #2,
      with a spectral solution, showed substantially increased primary
      nucleation and more overall crystallization (about 3.8 grams
      total) compared to the classical solution in Beaker #1 (about 3.3
      grams total). In addition, crystals from the spectral solution had
      an altered morphology which included glass sheets, pyramid
      structures, and hollow pyramids inside cubic structures.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4e-SODIUM CHLORIDE</b><br>
      <br>
      Classical saturated NaCl solution (about 100 ml), at room
      temperature (22 C), was placed into three beakers (about 200 ml in
      size). Sterile water (about 10 ml) was added to all three beakers.
      Beakers #1 and #2 were both suspended over a sodium lamp 112 with
      a cone delivery configuration 120 (Figure 95). Beaker #3 was
      placed into an aluminum foil- wrapped bucket as an unsaturated
      control. Beaker #1 was shielded from the fan until the temperature
      rose to about 58 C, and the shield was removed. Beaker #2 was
      cooled with the fan. The tops of all three beakers were covered
      with plastic wrap.<br>
      <br>
      Results: After about 20 hours there was no growth in any of the
      beakers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4f-SODIUM CHLORIDE</b><br>
      <br>
      Classical saturated NaCl solution (about 100 ml), at room
      temperature (22 C) was placed into five beakers (about 200 ml in
      size), and 50 ml into Beaker #6. Beakers #'s 1-5 were positioned
      under single overhead sodium lamps 112 with cones 120 (as shown in
      Figure 94). Water was added (in the following amounts) via glass
      syringe to Beakers #'s 1-5 to create serial dilutions as follows:
      1) zero; 2) 2 ml; 3) 4 ml; 4) 6 ml; and 5) 8 ml. Beaker #6 was
      placed into an aluminum foil-wrapped bucket as a saturated
      control. Spectral crystallization proceeded overnight (about 16
      hours) at room temperature under ambient fluorescent lighting.<br>
      <br>
      Results: Spectral crystallization of saturated, and 2 and 4 ml
      dilutions of thelO0 ml<br>
      <br>
      saturated solution showed changes in morphology (e. g. , rods,
      glass sheets, daisy stalks).<br>
      <br>
      Saturated solutions grew cubic crystals about 1-4 mm on a side,
      and a glassy sheet about 5 mm x 5 mm. The 2 and 4 ml diluted
      solutions, relative to the saturated solution, showed
      approximately the same primary nucleation, and increased growth
      rate of individual crystals up to about 5 mm cubic. The 6 and 8 ml
      diluted solutions, compared to the saturated solution, showed
      different morphologies (e. g. , pyramids), and decreased
      nucleation and decreased growth rate (e. g., &lt; 1 mm cubic
      crystals). The 6 and 8 ml diluted solutions showed definite
      spectral crystallization at decreased saturation (i. e. , 103-104
      ml remaining in beakers) with approximately the same primary
      nucleation, and approximately the same growth rate compared to the
      control crystallized traditionally from saturated solution.
      Crystals grown from the 3% unsaturated solution are shown in
      Figure 98e.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4g-SODIUM CHLORIDE</b><br>
      <br>
      Serial dilutions of classically prepared saturated NaCl solution
      (about 100 ml) were created as in Example 4f, with added water per
      100 ml per beaker as follows: 1) zero; 2) 1 ml; 3) 2 ml; 4) 4 ml;
      5) 6 ml; 6) 8 ml. Control Beakers #'s7-10 each contained about 50
      ml of classical saturated solution with added water as follows: 7)
      zero; 8) 0.5 ml; 9) 1 ml; 10) 2 ml. Beakers #1-6 were positioned
      under single overhead sodium lamps 112 with cylinder delivery
      configuration 110 (as shown in Figure 96), and Beakers #'s 7-10
      were placed in a closed, wooden/plastic cupboard. Crystallization
      proceeded at room temperature overnight (about 16 hours) with
      ambient fluorescent lighting on.<br>
      <br>
      Results: All solutions in Beakers #1-6 showed substantially
      increased primary nucleation, increased growth rate, numerous
      clusters with individual cubic crystals about 3-5 mm, and
      increased water evaporation with overhead spectral cylinder
      irradiation (as shown in Figure 96) compared to the results in
      Example 4f with overhead spectral cone irradiation.<br>
      <br>
      Beakers #1-6 also exhibited NaCl dendritic-like growth up the
      sides of the beakers (as shown in Figures 98ad and 98ae)
      apparently originating from NaCl crystals growing expitaxially on
      the beaker. By irradiating the sides of the beaker, which
      reflected the sodium spectral pattern, the beaker apparently
      functioned as an epitaxial substrate for crystallization.<br>
      <br>
      Approximate NaCl crystal weights for Beakers #'s 1-6 were as
      follows: 1) 22.9 g; 2) 10.3 g; 3) 26.4 g; 4) 22.1 g; 5) 23.4 g; 6)
      13.4 g. Saturated control beaker #7 grew a few small crystals,
      while control Beakers #8-10 had no observable crystal growth.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4h-SODIUM CHLORIDE</b><br>

      Serial dilutions of classically prepared saturated NaCl solution
      were created as in Example 15f, with added water per 100 ml per
      beaker as follows: 1) zero; 2) 1 ml; 3) 2 ml; 4)<br>
      <br>
      3 ml; 5) 4 ml; 6) 5 ml. Beakers #1-6 were positioned under single
      overhead sodium lamps 112 with cylinder delivery configuration 110
      (as shown in Figure 96). Crystallization proceeded at room
      temperature with no ambient lighting present for about 65 hours.<br>
      <br>
      Results: Compared to overnight spectral crystallizations of about
      16-20 hours, all 65 hour crystallizations showed increased primary
      nucleation, and substantial increases in crystal size. Although
      crystallization began first in more saturated solutions, the
      largest single crystal (i. e. , about 12 x 12 x 4 mm) was from the
      most dilute (5 ml H20/100 ml) solution. There were between 10 to
      20 crystals greater than 1 cm on a side in each of the Beakers
      #1-6. Remaining saturated solution on the counter about 11 feet in
      front of the sodium lamps (e. g. , there were 6 sodium lamps
      irradiating separate beakers at one time) grew many crystals (see
      Figures 98p and 98q) equal in size (i. e. , about 5-7 mm and cubic
      in size) to those crystals grown overnight from the heated
      solutions in Examples 4b and 4c. Controls for Example 4g left on
      the counter about 12 feet behind the sodium lamps grew about 1 mm
      sand-like crystals in about 85 hours.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4i-SODIUM CHLORIDE</b><br>
      <br>
      Classical saturated NaCl solution was prepared on a counter about
      10 feet away from the nearest sodium lamp while Example 4h, was
      being conducted. Seven days later the classical saturated sodium
      chloride solution (about 50 ml) was placed into each of three
      separate beakers in a dark, shielded room. Spectral cone
      crystallization in various configurations, with no ambient light,
      proceeded overnight as follows: 1) single horizontal sodium lamp
      (Figure 97a); 2) two horizontal sodium lamps at right angles to
      each other (Figure 97b); and 3) two horizontal lamps at right
      angles to each other and one overhead lamp (Figure 97c).<br>
      <br>
      Results: Compared to classical solutions not exposed to ambient
      sodium spectral irradiation during their preparation, this
      solution grew crystals that exhibited substantially increased
      primary nucleation and all crystals were small (e. g. , less than
      1 mm) sand-like crystals.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4i-SODIUM CHLORIDE</b><br>
      <br>
      Classical saturated NaCl solution was filtered and about 50 ml was
      placed into each of three beakers in a dark and EM shielded room.
      Spectral cone crystallization (as discussed in Example 4i) with no
      ambient light present occurred overnight, as above.<br>
      <br>
      Results-From the single horizontal sodium lamp (Figure 97a) a
      single cubic crystal (about 0.27 grams) grew. From two horizontal

      the horizontal plane. Two horizontal lamps at approximate right
      angles and a third lamp overhead at approximate right angles grew
      hoppers and crystals with twinning on 3 planes (3.5 grams total
      weight). Temperature in the shielded room was about 26 C (i. e. ,
      about 2 degrees above room temperature of the original saturated
      solution).<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4k-SODIUM CHLORIDE</b><br>
      <br>
      Classical saturated NaCl solution prepared as above was filtered
      and about 50 ml was placed into each of three beakers which were
      then placed into the aforementioned dark, shielded room. Beaker #1
      had four horizontal sodium lamps with cones (Figure 97d), and all
      at approximate right angles to each other. Beaker #2 had four
      overhead sodium lamps with cones, and positioned at right angles
      to each other and at about a 45 degree angle from the horizontal
      (Figure 97e). Beaker #3 was placed in a control bucket.
      Crystallization proceeded overnight (about 18 hours) with no
      ambient light present in the shielded room.<br>
      <br>
      Results: Beaker #1 (four horizontal sodium lamps at right angles
      and as shown in Figure 97d) grew cubes (about 4-11 mm on a side)
      and large crystals with significant twinning (about 16 mm on a
      side). Four overhead sodium lamps at approximate 45 angles (Figure
      97e), grew twinned cubes (about 5-10 mm) and large hoppers (with
      the largest measuring about 13 x 13 x 7 mm). Figures 98f and 98g
      show some of the crystals grown according to this Example, with
      Figure 98g showing the largest crystal grown. The control in total
      darkness in the shielded room showed no growth. Beaker #1 also
      grew epitaxial crystals and dendritic formations on the side of
      the beaker, where the horizontal light beams intersected the
      glass/solution/air triple point.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 41-SODIUM CHLORIDE</b><br>
      <br>
      The experimental procedure was identical to the experimental
      procedure of Example 4k, except that spectral NaCl solution was
      used rather than classical NaCl solution.<br>
      <br>
      Results: Beaker #1 (four horizontal sodium lamps at approximate
      right angles (Figure 97d), grew many small twinned cubes (about
      3-4 mm on a side). Beaker #2 (four overhead sodium lamps at
      approximately 45 angles from horizontal and substantially equally
      spaced from each other (Figure 97e), grew many small twinned cubes
      (about 4-5 mm on a side) and a few twinned crystals. The control
      maintained in total darkness in the shielded room showed no
      growth. The spectral solution exhibited increased nucleation.<br>
      <br>
      Twinned cubic crystals from Beakers 1 and 2 were removed and
      placed in fresh spectral, saturated, filtered NaCl solution in the
      dark, shielded room with the same spectral cone crystallization
      overnight.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Results: Crystals in both Beakers #1 and #2 grew pyramidal corners
      and rims onto the twinned cubes with substantially increased
      primary nucleation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4m-SODIUM CHLORIDE</b><br>
      <br>
      Seven beakers with different serial dilutions of classical
      saturated filtered NaCl solution were placed under overhead sodium
      lamps with parabolic dishes (Figure 97f). The serial dilutions
      were 0,1, 2,3, 4,5 and 6 ml of water separately added to about 100
      ml of saturated solution. Four more beakers with serial dilutions
      (zero, 2,4, and 6ml) were placed in a cupboard as controls.
      Crystallization proceeded overnight (about 20 hours) with no
      ambient light.<br>
      <br>
      Results: Twinned cubes and/or crystals grew in all beakers, with
      increased primary nucleation in the more saturated solutions and
      increased crystal size in the 4 ml dilution.<br>
      <br>
      Spectral Crystallization-about 3-4 mm cubic; 1 ml diluted solution
      about 3-6 mm cubic with 1 cm polycrystalline mass; 2 ml diluted
      solution about 4-6 mm cubes and 16 mm diameter twinned crystal
      with about 1 cm rod projecting vertically at 45 degrees; 3 ml
      diluted solution about 5-7 mm cubes and about 14 mm
      polycrystalline twinned crystal; 4 ml diluted solution about 3-4
      mm cubes and about 5 x 10 twinned polycrystalline mass; 5 ml
      diluted solution about 2-3 mm cubes; 6 ml diluted solution about
      2-3 mm cubes.<br>
      <br>
      Serial dilution controls had been placed in a wooden/plastic
      cupboard, which was later found to admit a narrow beam of light
      between the cupboard doors (e. g. , sodium light and/or ambient
      fluorescent lights). The saturated control grew many small (about
      1-1.5 mm cubic) primary nucleations overnight while the dilutions
      grew nothing. After an additional approximately 24 hours in the
      cupboard, the saturated and 2 ml serial dilution showed
      substantially increased primary nucleation with about 1-2 mm
      crystals; the 4 ml diluted solution grew large rods (about 4x10 mm
      and about 3x8 mm), a cubic corner (about 8 mm), and two twinned
      crystals (about 10x12 mm and about 9x9 mm); and the 6 ml diluted
      solution grew small sand-like crystals.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4n-SODIUM CHLORIDE</b><br>
      Classical saturated NaCl solution was both prepared and stored in
      the dark. Beakers with 100 ml filtered solution were placed into
      the dark, shielded room with the following set- up: 1) four
      horizontal sodium lamps with cones at approximate right angles
      (Figure 97d); 2) four overhead sodium lamps with cones at about 45
      angles (Figure 97e) ; 3) on a table about 8 feet from the sodium
      lamps; and 4) in an aluminum foil-covered bucket. Crystallization
      proceeded overnight (about 20 hours) with no ambient light
      present.<br>
      Results :-Beaker #1 (four horizontal sodium lamps), Figure 97d,
      grew many twinned cubes (about 3-4 mm), pyramids, rods, twinned
      crystals, and a cubic corner, with a total weight of 6.1 grams.
      Beaker #2 (four sodium lamps at about 45 ), Figure 97e, grew
      twinned cubes and crystals (about 4-5 mm on a side), and a large
      twinned crystal (about 18 x 11 mm) with a total weight of about
      9.5 grams. Beaker #3 (i. e. , on the about table 8 feet away) grew
      many small (about 1 mm) crystals, with a total weight of about 2.7
      grams.<br>
      <br>
      Beaker #4 (aluminum foil-covered bucket) grew about 0.2 grams of
      very small crystals (less than about 1 mm).<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4o-SODIUM CHLORIDE</b><br>
      The experimental procedure was identical to the experimental
      procedure of Example 4n, except that a spectral NaCl solution
      prepared in the dark was used.<br>
      <br>
      Results: Beaker #1 (four horizontal sodium lamps as shown in
      Figure 97d), grew 15 twinned cubes (most about 5-7 mm), hoppers, a
      corner (about 10 x 10 mm), a rod (about 15 x 4) and polycrystals
      (up to about 15 x 12 mm). As shown in Figures 98i, 98j, 98k and
      981, the crystals that were grown according to this Example also
      exhibited modified growth planes at 45 angles to the normal axes.
      Beaker #2 (four sodium lamps oriented overhead at about a
      45'angle, as shown in Figure 97e, grew twinned cubes (about 7 mm),
      2 large hoppers (about 10 x 10 mm and 12 x 12 mm), and 5
      polycrystals with twinning ranging from about 6 x 10 mm to 14 x 18
      mm. As shown in Figures 98m, 98n, 98o, and 98v, the crystals that
      were grown according to this Example also exhibited modified
      growth planes at 45 angles to the normal axes. The control
      maintained in total darkness showed no crystallization at all.
      This experiment demonstrates the effects of directional spectral
      crystallization.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4P-SODIUM CHLORIDE</b><br>
      The experimental procedure was identical to Example 4n, except a
      spectral NaCl solution prepared under ambient fluorescent lighting
      was used.<br>
      <br>
      Results-Beaker #1 (four horizontal sodium lamps; Figure 97d) grew
      clear cubes and rods. Beaker #2 (four sodium lamps oriented at 45
      ; Figure 97e) grew cubes and clumped crystals. The control,
      maintained in total darkness in the shielded room in an aluminum
      foil- wrapped bucket, showed no crystallization. The crystals
      grown from the spectral solution appear to be more clear and more
      perfect than crystals grown from the classical solution.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4a-SODIUM CHLORIDE</b><br>
      The experimental procedure was identical to Example 4n, except
      that a spectral NaCl solution prepared in the dark was used.<br>
      <br>
      Results-Beaker #1 (four horizontal Na lamps; Figure 97d) grew many
      (greater than<br>
      <br>
      50) small cubes (about 2-4 mm on a side). Beaker #2 (four sodium
      lamps oriented at 45 ; Figure 97e) grew fewer (approximately 30)
      but larger cubes (about 5-7 mm on a side) and pyramids. The
      crystals in both Beakers #1 and #2 were growing above a layer of
      sandy consistency crystals. The control, maintained in total
      darkness in the aluminum foil-wrapped bucket, showed no
      crystallization. The spectral solutions appear to produce many
      more nucleations and this solution preparation technique should be
      applicable when a polycrystalline phase or thin film may be
      useful.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4r-SODIUM CHLORIDE</b><br>
      A spectral NaCl solution was prepared and filtered and about 50 ml
      of solution was placed into each of five different sized beakers
      #'s 1-5 as follows: 1) 50 ml beaker; 2) 150 ml beaker; 3) 250 ml
      beaker; 4) 400 ml beaker; and 5) 600 ml beaker. About 50 ml of
      solution was also placed into each of control Beakers #'s 6-10 as
      follows: 6) 50 ml beaker; 7) 150 ml beaker; 8) 250 ml beaker; 9)
      400 ml beaker; and 10) 600 ml beaker. Beakers #'sl-5 were placed
      under overhead sodium lamps 112 with cone delivery configuration
      120, as shown in Figure 94. Beakers #'s 6-10 were placed in a
      cabinet with the doors covered with aluminum foil to block light
      from entering into the cabinet. Crystallization proceeded
      overnight (about 16 hours) with no ambient light present.<br>
      <br>
      Results: For the spectral crystallizations, the following results
      were achieved: 1) approximately 25 cubes (about 1.5-2 mm); 2)
      approximately 12 cubes (about 3-5 mm); 3) approximately 25 cubes
      (about 3-6 mm); 4) approximately 20 cubes (up to about 9 mm); 5)
      approximately 25 cubes (about 3-6 mm).<br>
      <br>
      For the controls, the following results were achieved: 6)
      approximately 15 cubes (most about 1 mm); 7) approximately 10
      cubes (about 1.5 mm); 8) approximately 4 cubes (about 3 mm) and a
      rod (about 1.5 x 9 mm); 9) approximately 8 cubes (about 2-4 mm);
      10) approximately 12 cubes (about 3-6 mm). Thus, with the same
      solution and crystallization time, crystal yields and growth are
      affected by the size and/or shape of the beaker (e. g., container
      or reaction vessel effects).<br>
      <br>
      In this Example, targeted spectral energies were used to affect
      phase changes, material properties, and structure in solid and
      liquid materials.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4s-SODIUM CH LORIDE</b><br>
      Classical NaCl solution prepared in the dark was filtered and
      about 100 ml placed into three separate beakers (about 600 ml in
      size) in the dark, shielded room. Beaker #1 was illuminated by two
      horizontal sodium lamps and one overhead sodium lamp (Figure 97c).<br>
      <br>
      Beaker #2 was illuminated by one horizontal lamp, one overhead
      lamp at about 90 degrees to<br>
      <br>
      the horizontal lamp, and one lamp at about 45 degrees between the
      horizontal and overhead lamps (Figure 97g). The control Beaker #3
      was placed in an aluminum foil-wrapped bucket in the dark,
      shielded room. Crystallization proceeded overnight in the dark,
      shielded room (about 20 hours) with no ambient light present.<br>
      <br>
      Results: The control in the aluminum foil-wrapped bucket showed no
      crystallization.<br>
      <br>
      Beaker #1 (2 horizontal/l overhead ; Figure 97c) grew more than 50
      cubes (2 about 4 mm) and approximately 10 rods (about 3-11 mm in
      length). Beaker #2 (one horizontal, one 45 degrees, one overhead;
      Figure 97g) grew approximately 15 cubes (about 5-12 mm; see
      Figures 98t and 98u) many of which were twinned and/or hoppers, a
      few rods (up to about 22 x 2 mm) and two polycrystalline clusters.
      Thus, it appears that direction and orientation of the spectral
      input during crystallization affects crystal growth and
      morphology.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4t-SODIUM CHLORIDE</b><br>

      crystallization.<br>
      <br>
      Beaker #1 (2 horizontal/l overhead; Figure 97c) grew approximately
      40 cubes (about 3-7 mm) many with twinning and 4-5 polycrystalline
      masses about 5-10 mm. Beaker #2 (horizontal, 45 degrees, overhead;
      Figure 97g) grew approximately 30 slightly larger cubes (about 5-7
      mm) and rods (about 10 x 3 mm). Beaker #3 (control) showed no
      growth.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4u-SODIUM CHLORIDE</b><br>

      overhead sodium lamps with cones (Figure 94). Beakers #'s 6-10
      were placed in a cabinet with the doors covered with aluminum foil
      to block light. Crystallization proceeded overnight (about 16
      hours) with no ambient light present.<br>
      <br>
      Results: For the spectral crystallization in Beakers #'s 1-5
      crystals were about 1.5 mm cubic in shape and weights were about
      as follows: 1) 1.6 gram 2) 2.0 gram; 3) 1.6 gram; 4) 1.2 gram; 5)
      1.3 gram. Control Beakers #6-10 contained crystals which were less
      than 1 mm and weights were about as follows: 6) 0.4 gram; 7) 0.5
      gram; 8) 0.4 gram; 9) 0.4 gram; 10) 0.5 gram. Accordingly, with
      identical size, shape, and composition of the beakers,<br>
      <br>
      classical crystallization was the same regardless of solution
      volume. However, spectral crystallization was about 3-5 times
      greater than classical crystallization and varied with solution
      volume.<br>

      were approximately 1 mm cubic and approximate weights were: 1) 5.0
      gram; 2) 4.5 gram; 3) 5.4 gram; 4) 5.2 gram; 5) 5.1 gram. Control

      grams; 10) 3.1 grams.<br>
      <br>
      With identical size, shape, and composition of the beakers,
      classical crystallization was the same regardless of solution
      volume. Spectral crystallization was about 65% greater than
      classical crystallization and varied with solution volume.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4w-SODIUM BROMIDE</b><br>
      Classical NaBr and NaCl solutions were filtered. A saturated
      solution of NaBr (100 ml) was placed into a 600 ml beaker, Beaker
      #1, and placed under an overhead sodium lamp with cone (Figure
      94). A saturated solution of NaCl (100 ml) was placed into a 600
      ml beaker, Beaker #2, and placed under an overhead sodium lamp
      with cone (Figure 94).<br>
      <br>
      Beakers #3 and #4 were controls of about 100 ml of NaBr and NaCl,
      respectively, placed into 600 ml Pyrex beakers. Crystallization
      proceeded overnight (about 18 hours) with no ambient light
      present.<br>
      <br>
      Results: NaBr solution from Beaker #1 grew approximately 20 flat
      hexagonal sheets (up to about 8 x 15 mm) and some rods (about 2 x
      8 mm). NaCl solution from Beaker #2 grew typical spectral NaCl
      cubic crystals, approximately 100, 2 x 2 mm. Controls of both
      solutions grew only a small amount of sandy type crystals
      overnight. The controls were left out under the ambient
      fluorescent lights for a weekend (about 60 hours), and after the
      additional 60 hours showed crystal growth similar to that in
      Beakers #1 and #2 in aboutl8 hours. While the average control NaBr
      crystal was slightly smaller (about 6 x 8 mm) the largest was in
      this control beaker (about 30mm x 20 mm).<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4x-SODIUM BROMIDE</b><br>
      The spectral NaBr solution was filtered and about 100 ml was
      placed into four beakers (about 600 ml in size) in the dark,
      shielded room. Beaker #1 was illuminated by two horizontal Na
      lamps and one overhead Na lamp (Figure 97c). Beaker #2 was
      illuminated by one horizontal lamp, one overhead lamp at
      approximately 90 degrees to the horizontal lamp, and one lamp
      approximately 45 degrees between the horizontal and overhead lamp
      (Figure<br>
      <br>
      97 g). The control Beaker #3 was placed in the aluminum
      foil-wrapped bucket. Control Beaker #4 was placed under ambient
      fluorescent lights in an office (i. e. , slightly different
      ambient light intensity). Crystallization proceeded with no
      ambient light for Beakers #1, #2 and #3.<br>
      <br>
      Results: Beaker #1 (2 horizontal/l overhead; Figure 97c) and
      Beaker #2 (horizontal, 45 degrees, overhead; Figure 97g) grew
      several large, flat, hexagonal crystals (up to about 30mm x 20
      mm), and weighing about 21.5 grams and 19.32 grams, respectively.
      Beaker #3 in the bucket grew nothing. Beaker #4 under ambient
      lights in an office grew crystals similar in size to Beakers #1
      and #2, but fewer in number, about 4.5 grams in weight. Solution
      levels in Beakers #1 and #2 were about 80 ml, and about 100 ml in
      the control. The control Beaker #3 was next placed under ambient
      fluorescent lights in an office until water had evaporated to
      about the 80 ml level. A small number of moderately sized (about 2
      mm x 4 mm) flat hexagonal crystals grew. Accordingly, the increase
      in crystal growth rate observed with the sodium lamps is not due
      simply to greater evaporation, because control solutions which had
      water evaporated therefrom in approximately the same amount did
      not produce the same amount of crystal growth.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4y-SODIUM BROMIDE</b><br>
      A spectral NaBr solution was prepared and filtered and about 100
      ml was placed into three beakers (about 400 ml in size). Beaker #1
      was placed in a water bath at about 28 C under an overhead sodium
      lamp 112 with cone delivery configuration 120 (Figure 94). The
      room temperature was about 24 C. Beaker #2 was placed on the
      counter under an overhead sodium lamp 112 with cone delivery
      configuration 120 (Figure 94). Crystallization proceeded overnight
      (about 21 hours) with no ambient light. Beaker #3 was placed in an
      office with overhead fluorescent ambient lighting present.<br>
      <br>
      Results: Beakers #1 and #2 had polycrystalline films on the
      surfaces, and flat hexagonal crystals on the bottom. Beaker #1
      crystals were up to about 30 mm x 20 mm and weighed about 14.2
      grams. Beaker #2 crystals measured up to about 25 mm x 15 mm and
      weighed about 6.4 grams. Beaker #3 had similar morphology to
      Beaker #2, but a much lesser quantity of crystals.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLE 4z-SODIUM CHLORIDE</b><br>
      Water in its original clear plastic packaging was conditioned
      overnight (about 19 hours) by irradiation with a sodium lamp.
      Classic NaCl solution was prepared using the conditioned water
      under ambient fluorescent lighting. The saturated classic solution
      was filtered and about 100 ml was placed into three beakers (about
      600 ml in size) in a dark,<br>

      lamp at about 90 degrees to the horizontal lamp, and one lamp at
      about 45 degrees between the horizontal and overhead lamp (Figure

      few pinpoints of crystallization (too little to collect and
      weigh). Beaker #1 (two horizontal/one overhead; Figure 97c) grew
      hundreds of small cubic (about 1.5 mm) crystals and some small
      rods, about 5.9 grams. Beaker #1 fluid level was about 90 ml and
      the solution temperature was about 27 C. Beaker #2 (horizontal, 45
      degrees, overhead; Figure 97g) grew hundreds of small cubic (about
      1.5 mm) crystals with some rods, total weight about 5.6 grams. The
      solution level was approximately 80 ml and the solution
      temperature was about 27 C. Thus, solutions prepared classically
      from irradiated water showed an increase in nucleation.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLE 4aa</b><br>
      Classical NaCl solution, prepared with sodium lamp-conditioned
      water under ambient fluorescent lights and stored in an aluminum
      foil-wrapped beaker, was filtered and about 100 ml was placed into
      two beakers (600 ml in size) in a shielded room at about 24 C.
      Beaker #1 was placed under an overhead sodium lamp with cone
      (Figure 94), and Beaker #2 was placed in the aluminum foil-wrapped
      bucket. A spectral NaBr solution, prepared under ambient
      fluorescent lights and stored in aluminum foil, was also filtered
      and about 100 ml was placed in two beakers (about 600 ml in size)
      in a shielded room at about 24 C. Beaker #3 was placed under an
      overhead sodium lamp with cone (Figure 94), and Beaker #4 was
      placed in an aluminum foil-wrapped bucket. Crystallization
      proceeded overnight (about 18 hours) with no ambient light
      present.<br>
      <br>
      Results: Beaker #1 (conditioned water NaCl solution) had 95 ml of
      solution and many small, sandy crystals, a total weight of about 2
      grams. Beaker #2 also grew small sandy crystals, total weight
      about 0.7 grams. Beaker #3 had about 95 ml solution and several
      flat, hexagonal crystals, up to about 8 x 4 mm and total weight
      about 6.3 grams. Beaker #4 had several smaller sized flat
      hexagonal crystals (most about 2 x 4 mm, although two were up to
      about 10 mm on a side) and weighing about 5.0 grams total.<br>

      and stored in aluminum foil, was filtered and about 100 ml was
      placed into two beakers (about 600 ml in<br>
      <br>
      size) in a shielded, dark room at about 25 C. Beaker #1 was placed
      under an overhead sodium lamp with cone (Figure 94), and Beaker #2
      was placed into an aluminum foil- wrapped bucket. Classic NaCl
      solution, prepared with sodium lamp-conditioned water under
      ambient fluorescent lights and stored in aluminum foil, was also
      filtered and about 100 ml was placed into two beakers (about 600
      ml in size) in a shielded room at about 24 C. Beaker #3 was placed
      under an overhead sodium lamp with cone (Figure 94), and Beaker #4
      was placed into an aluminum foil-wrapped bucket. Crystallization
      proceeded overnight (about 21 hours) with no ambient light present<br>
      Results: Beaker #1 with classic solution grew about 7.0 grams
      total of about 1 mm cubic crystals. Beaker #3 with conditioned
      water solution grew about 6.2 grams total of about 1.5 mm
      crystals. Control Beakers #2 and #4 had essentially no growth.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4ac-SODIUM CHLORIDE</b><br>
      The procedure in Example 4ab was repeated. Results were similar.<br>
      <br>
      Results : Beaker #1 with classic solution grew about 2.5 grams of
      about 1 mm cubic crystals. Beaker #3 with conditioned water
      solution grew about 2.3 grams of about 1.5 mm crystals. Control
      Beakers #2 and #4 had essentially no growth. Both solutions
      crystallized almost the same weight of NaCl, but the crystals from
      the irradiated water solution were larger (and hence fewer in
      number). Thus, it appears that sodium spectral conditioning of
      water prior to preparing classical saturated NaCl solutions
      affects subsequent crystal size and nucleation.<br>

      In this Example, targeted spectral energies were used to affect

      <b>EXAMPLE 4ad-SODIUM CHLORIDE</b><br>
      Classical NaCl was prepared and stored four different ways as
      follows: 1) wrapped in aluminum foil; 2) wax paper over the top;
      3) wrapped in a black plastic bag; 4) wrapped in clear plastic.
      The classical NaCl solution stored in aluminum foil was filtered
      and about 100 ml was placed into Beakers #1, #2 and #3 (about 600

      Control Beakers #2, #4, and #6 were placed in a light-tight
      cabinet. Crystallization proceeded overnight (about 20 hours) with
      no ambient light present.<br>
      <br>
      Results:<br>
      1. (foil, sodium lamp)-about 1 mm crystals, about 0.8 grams total
      weight<br>
      2. (foil, control) -no growth<br>
      3. (black plastic, sodium lamp) -about 3-7 mm cubic crystals, some

      total weight<br>
      Thus, aluminum foil coverings on the outside of the Pyrex beaker
      during storage conditioned the saturated solution and inhibited
      subsequent NaCl crystal nucleation and growth. Solutions exposed
      to ambient light during solution equilibration overnight have more
      crystal growth by weight. Accordingly, it appears that storage
      containers and/or spectral conditions and/or conditioning of
      solutions preparation before, during, and after affect subsequent
      crystallization from solutions.<br>
      <br>

      under an overhead sodium lamp with a cone delivery configuration
      (Figure 94). Dishes #4, #5, and #6 were placed under an overhead
      full spectrum lamp with a cone delivery configuration (similar to

      overnight (about 19 hours) with no ambient light present.<br>
      <br>
      Results-Dishes #1, #2, and #3 (sodium lamp) grew cubes (about 2-4
      mm) and clusters, total weight about 5.5 grams. Dishes #4, #5, and
      #6 (full spectrum lamp) grew cubes (about 3-4 mm), total weight
      about 7.4 grams. The full spectrum lamp had higher wattage than
      the Na lamp and contained frequencies in the spectra for both Na
      and Cl.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4ah-SODIUM CHLORIDE</b><br>
      Classical saturated NaCl solution was filtered and about 100 ml
      was placed into three beakers. Beaker #1 was placed in a dark,
      shielded room directly under an overhead potassium lamp (similar
      to the configuration shown in Figure 94). Beaker #2 was placed in
      a shielded room behind a cardboard shield, in very low level
      ambient potassium spectral light.<br>
      <br>
      Beaker #3 was placed in an office about 3.5 feet from overhead
      fluorescent lights.<br>
      <br>
      Results: Beaker #1 grew cubic crystals (about 3-4 mm), about
      2.7grams total<br>
      <br>
      weight. Beaker #2 grew cubic crystals (about 2-2.5 mm), about 0.5
      grams total weight.<br>
      <br>
      Beaker #3 grew less than 1 mm crystals, about 0.7 grams total
      weight. It appears that the significant direct resonance between
      the sodium and potassium spectra allows one to influence NaCl
      crystal growth using the potassium spectrum alone. Moreover, NaCl
      growth with the potassium lamp may be modulated by spectral
      intensity, similar to the sodium lamp.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OBSERVATIONS FOR EXAMPLES 4a-4ah</b><br>
      Spectral crystallization techniques permitted the
      modification/control of crystals as follows:<br>
      Figures 98a-98v and 98ad-98ae show photomicrographs of various
      crystals formed according to some of the Experiments in Example 4.
      These photomicrographs, along with direct experimental
      observations, showed that spectral crystallization has the
      following general affects: (1) increased primary nucleation; (2)
      increased growth rate; (3) increased temperature at which
      crystallization begins; (4) controlled crystallization from a
      thermally unsaturated solution; (5) controlled crystallization
      from a diluted unsaturated solution; (6) altered morphologies
      including: - altered crystal symmetry; - altered axes; - multiple
      growth axes controlled by multiple axes of spectral irradiation; -
      altered growth axis direction controlled by spectral axis
      directions; (7) altered crystallization controlled by controlling
      spectral conditions during solution preparation ; and (8) altered
      crystallization controlled by controlling ambient spectral

      frequency used in this experiment was calculated to be 2 X Bev or
      13.07372 GHz.<br>
      <br>
      Saturated sodium chloride solution was prepared by heating
      distilled water (about 800 ml) in a 1000 ml Pyrex beaker to about
      55 C, and adding NaCl until no more would dissolve (about 250-300
      grams), under ambient fluorescent lighting. The beaker was wrapped
      in black plastic, stored in a cabinet, and allowed to equilibrate
      overnight (about 15 hours). The saturated solution was filtered
      over the crystals at room temperature (22 C).<br>
      <br>
      Saturated NaCl solution (about 100 ml) was pipetted into each of
      six crystallization dishes. Two crystallization dishes A and B
      were placed in the incubator (set to about 28 C) ; two
      crystallization dishes C and D were placed under a sodium lamp 112
      as shown in Figure 94, the temperature being about 28 C (8.2
      mW/cm2) ; and two crystallization dishes E and F were placed in a
      shielded dark enclosure for microwave irradiation at about 25 C.
      The microwave field was coupled through the air to the outside of
      microwave Dish E. Microwave Dish F was placed adjacent to
      microwave Dish E, in line with the microwave horn. The microwave
      was set in parameter Sll, sweeping from 13. 0736 to 13.0738 GHz.
      The solutions were allowed to crystallize for about 40 hours.<br>
      <br>
      Photomicrographs taken at about at 60X (Figures not shown but were
      used to determine"Relative Crystal Size"reported below) and total
      crystal weight from each crystallization dish A-F was determined.
      The relative sizes of formed crystals were determined from the
      photomicrographs by measuring the dimensions of all discernable
      individual crystals. For rectangular crystals, the smaller
      dimension was used.<br>
      <br>
      Results: Crystals from the incubator at about 28 C in dishes A and
      B were smaller than crystals in dishes C and D which had received
      sodium spectral electronic irradiation; and smaller than the
      crystals in dishes E and F which were grown with the sodium
      microwave rotational frequency. However, crystals grown in dishes
      E and F (microwave irradiated<br>

      grams), under ambient fluorescent lighting. The beaker was wrapped
      in black plastic, stored in a cabinet, and allowed to equilibrate
      overnight (about 15 hours). The saturated solution was filtered
      over the crystals at room temperature (about 20 C).<br>
      <br>
      Saturated NaCl solution (about 100 ml) was pipetted into each of
      four crystallization dishes labeled) O-R, and 85 ml of saturated
      NaCl solution (about 100 ml) was pipetted into each of four
      crystallization dishes labeled S-V. Two crystallization dishes O
      and S were placed in an incubator (set at about 28 C), two
      crystallization dishes P and T were placed under a sodium lamp
      112, as shown in Figure 94, at about 28-30 C (8.2 mW/cm'), two
      crystallization dishes Q and U were placed in a shielded dark
      enclosure for microwave irradiation, and two control
      crystallization dishes R and V were placed in a shielded dark<br>
      <br>
      enclosure at about 25 C. The microwave field was coupled through
      the air to the outside of microwave Dish O. Microwave Dish U was
      placed adjacent to Dish O, in line with the microwave horn. The
      microwave parameter was Sll, sweeping from 13.073719 to 13.073721
      GHz. Ambient room/enclosure temperatures throughout were:<br>
      1) incubator controls about 28 C ;<br>
      2) sodium lamp about 28 C ;<br>
      3) microwave irradiation about 25 C ;<br>
      4) shielded enclosure control about 25 C.<br>
      <br>
      The solutions were allowed to crystallize for about 14.5 hours,
      after which solution temperatures were measured:<br>
      1) incubator control solutions about 26 C ;<br>
      2) sodium lamp solutions about 22 C ;<br>
      3) microwave irradiation about 21 C ; and<br>
      4) shielded enclosure control about 20 C.<br>
      <br>
      The dishes O-V were photomicrographed (not shown) at about 60X
      magnification.<br>
      <br>
      The total crystal weight was determined in each of dishes O-V by
      being dried and weighed.<br>
      <br>
      Relative crystal sizes for only Dishes O-R was determined as in
      Example 5a.<br>
      <br>
      Results: Irradiation with the sodium chloride rotational microwave
      frequency in a shielded dark enclosure inhibited sodium chloride
      crystallization compared to controls in a shielded dark enclosure.<br>
      <br>
      Sodium lamp spectral electronic irradiation enhanced
      crystallization rate compared to controls at the same ambient room
      temperatures, however solution temperatures differed.<br>
      <br>
      The sodium lamp solutions were closest in temperature to the
      microwave irradiated solution.<br>
      <br>
      Although the size of the sodium lamp and microwave crystals was
      essentially the same and the sodium lamp solution was slightly
      warmer, about 2.5 times more salt crystallized under the sodium
      lamp, than with the microwave irradiation.<br>

      Water was heated with a Bunsen burner from room temperature to
      about 55 C. Salt was added to the solution which was stirred with
      a glass stir rod until no more salt would dissolve. The solution
      was allowed to equilibrate overnight (about 18 hours) before being
      decanted and filtered for use in a crystallization procedure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 6a</b><br>
      Classical KCI solution was filtered and about 100 ml was placed
      into each of nine (9) crystallization dishes. Dish #'sl-3 were
      placed in the dark, shielded room under the potassium lamp.
      Cardboard shields were placed between the potassium lamp and Dish
      #'s 4-6 which then received only very low levels of an ambient
      potassium spectrum. Dish #'s 7- 9 were placed onto a counter in
      another room with overhead ambient fluorescent lighting.<br>
      <br>
      Results: Control crystals grew small cubic crystals (see Figure
      98w). The solution was exposed to a low ambient potassium lamp
      light and grew about 25 crystals which showed some twinning. Most
      crystals were about 3-5 mm cubic, and the largest crystal (about
      12 mm cubic) is shown in Figures 98x and 98y. The solution under
      the potassium lamp grew about 15 large crystals, with cubes,
      triangular rods, polycrystalline masses, and twinned crystals (see
      Figures 98z and 98aa).<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 6b</b><br>
      Classical NaCl solution was filtered and about 100 ml was placed
      into each of 3 crystallization dishes. Dish #1 was placed in the
      dark, shielded room under the potassium lamp. Dish #2 was placed
      behind a cardboard shield with only low ambient levels of the
      potassium lamp. Dish #3 was placed in an office under fluorescent
      lights.<br>
      <br>
      Results: All dishes produced small cubic crystals: about 2.8 grams
      in dish #1 under the potassium lamp; about 0.6 grams in dish #2
      with ambient potassium lamp light; and about 0.89 grams in dish #3
      under fluorescent lights.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 6c</b><br>
      Classical KC1 solution was filtered and about 100 ml was placed
      into eight (8) crystallization dishes. Dish #'sl-3 were placed
      into the dark, shielded room under the potassium lamp. Dishes #'s
      4-6 were placed into the same dark, shielded room under the sodium
      lamp. Cardboard shields were placed between the potassium and
      sodium lamps to prevent cross-illumination. Dish #7 was placed in
      an aluminum foil-covered bucket in the shielded room. Dish #8 was
      placed onto a file cabinet in an office, about 40 inches beneath
      fluorescent overhead lights (about 1.12 mW/cm2).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results:</b><br>
      <br>
      There were different crystal sizes and morphologies observed:<br>
      1) Potassium lamp-Several cubic and twinned hoppers, about 1.6 x
      1.6 x 0.7 cm in length for the largest crystal which grew under
      the main part of the potassium bulb;<br>
      2) Sodium lamp-Cubic and twinned hoppers, many rods and glassy
      sheets, the largest of which was about 2 x 2 x 1 cm in length,
      grew directly under the sodium bulb (see Figure 98ab and Figure
      98ac);<br>
      3) Foil bucket-no growth; and<br>
      4) Fluorescent office-many small cubes, about 2-3 mm, a few rods
      and sheets.<br>
      <br>
      Average weights per dish were: 1) potassium lamp, about 1.5 grams;
      2) sodium lamp, about 2.9 grams; 3) foil bucket 0.0 grams; and 6)

      <b>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE</b><br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 7a</b><br>
      Figure 99 is a schematic of the experimental apparatus used to
      generate baseline measured pH information at about 55 C as a
      function of time. In this Example 7a, the Bunsen burner 101 was
      supplied with propane fuel from the fuel source 100 via a flexible
      rubber tube 115. The flame from the Bunsen burner 101 was caused
      to be incident upon a cast iron hot plate 103 which was attached
      to a ring stand 102. A 1000 ml Pyrex cylindrical beaker 104 was
      placed on top of the cast iron hot plate 103. The beaker 104
      contained approximately 800 ml of distilled water obtained from
      American Fare. An AR20 pH/mV/ C/Conductivity meter 107 from
      Accumet Research communicated with the 800 ml of distilled water
      and later with the solution 105 through a temperature probe 108
      and a pH electrode 109. More details of the pH electrode can be
      seen in Figure 102. The pH meter was elevated to a convenient
      height by the use of a support structure 106.<br>
      <br>
      The AR20 meter 107, which used the pH electrode 109 (the electrode
      being shown in more detail in Figure 102), were together
      calibrated by using two different buffer solutions.<br>
      <br>
      The first buffer solution had a pH of 4.00 +/-0.01 at 25 C, and
      was a solution of potassium bipthalate. A second buffer solution
      had a pH of 7.00 +/-0.01 at 25 C, and was a solution of potassium
      phosphate monobasic-sodium hydroxide. Both solutions were 0.05
      Molar, both were certified and both were obtained from Fisher
      Chemicals. The use of these buffer solutions was intended to
      insure accuracy of the readings from the pH electrode.<br>
      <br>
      The pH of the distilled water in the beaker 104 was first measured
      at room temperature and then heated to about 55 C in about 15-20
      minutes by use of the Bunsen burner heating the hot plate 103 and
      the hot plate 103 radiating (e. g. , by radiation and/or
      conduction) its conditioning energy to the beaker 104 containing
      the distilled water. The<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      water temperature was monitored by the Accumet meter 107. Once a
      temperature of about 55 C was obtained, about 50 grams of sodium
      chloride (certified A. C. S. and as discussed above herein), were
      added to the 800 ml of distilled water in the beaker 104 to form
      the solution 105. The sodium chloride was stirred into the 800 ml
      of distilled water by use of glass stirring rod and complete
      dissolution of the sodium chloride occurred within about 30- 45
      seconds. The temperature of the solution 105 was reduced by
      approximately 1/2 to 1 C, but was quickly brought back to about 55
      C by the Bunsen burner 101 and cast iron hot plate 103 in a matter
      of a few seconds. The electrodes 108 and 109 were temporarily
      removed from the solution 105 to permit the stirring, mixing and
      dissolution of the sodium chloride into the distilled water.
      However, the electrodes 108 and 109 were immediately reinserted
      into the solution 105 upon completion of the stirring.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 103a shows the results of three (3) separate experiments
      corresponding to the experimental apparatus of Figure 99. The
      plotted data show the change in measured pH of the solution 105 as
      a function of time from room temperature to about 55 C. In
      particular, the pH of the distilled water alone was first measured
      at room temperature and then measured at about 55 C, and
      thereafter the pH of the solution 105 was measured about every two
      minutes for about 20 minutes after the addition and dissolution of
      sodium chloride. The time measurements were all at intervals of
      about two minutes up to about 20 minutes with a final measurement
      being taken after about 40 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      All experimental conditions described in the Example occurred in
      the presence of standard fluorescent lighting. The fluorescent
      lamps were Sylvania Cool White Deluxe Fluorescent Lamps, 75 watts
      and were each about eight (8) feet (about 2.4 meters) long. The
      lamps were suspended in pairs approximately 3.5 meters above the
      laboratory counter on which the experimental set-up was located.
      There were six (6) pairs of lamps present in a room which measured
      approximately 25 feet by 40 feet (about 7.6 meters x 12.1 meters).<br>
      <br>
      The fluorescent lamps produce a widely broadened and noisy mercury
      spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 7b</b><br>
      Figure 100 is a schematic of the experimental apparatus used to
      generate measured pH information at about 55 C as a function of
      time. In this Example 7b, the Bunsen burner 101 was supplied with
      propane fuel from the fuel source 100 via a flexible rubber tube
      115.<br>
      <br>
      The flame from the Bunsen burner 101 was caused to be incident
      upon a cast iron hot plate 103 which was attached to a ring stand
      102. A 1000 ml Pyrex cylindrical beaker 104 was placed on top of
      the cast iron hot plate 103. The beaker 104 contained
      approximately 800 ml of distilled water obtained from American
      Fare. An AR20 pH/mV/ C/Conductivity meter<br>
      <br>
      107 from Accumet Research communicated with the 800 ml of
      distilled water and later with the solution 105 through a
      temperature probe 108 and a pH electrode 109. More details of the
      pH electrode can be seen in Figure 102. The pH meter was elevated
      to a convenient height by the use of a support structure 106.<br>
      <br>
      The AR20 meter 107, which used the pH electrode 109 (the electrode
      being shown in more detail in Figure 102) were together calibrated
      by using two different buffer solutions.<br>
      <br>
      The first buffer solution had a pH of 4.00 +/-0.01 at about 25 C,
      and was a solution of potassium bipthalate. A second buffer
      solution had a pH of 7.00 +/-0.01 at about 25 C, and was a
      solution of potassium phosphate monobasic-sodium hydroxide. Both
      solutions were 0.05 Molar, both were certified and both were
      obtained from Fisher Chemicals. The use of these buffer solutions
      was intended to insure accuracy of the pH readings from the pH
      electrode.<br>
      <br>
      The pH of the distilled water in the beaker 104 was first measured
      at room temperature and then heated to about 55 C in about 15-20
      minutes by use of the Bunsen burner heating the hot plate 103. The
      water temperature was monitored by the Accumet meter 107. Once a
      temperature of about 55 C was obtained, about 50 grams of sodium
      chloride (certified A. C. S. and discussed above herein), were
      added to the 800 ml of distilled water in the beaker 104 to form
      the solution 105. The sodium chloride was stirred into the 800 ml
      of distilled water by use of glass stirring rod and complete
      dissolution of the sodium chloride occurred within about 30-45
      seconds. The temperature of the solution 105 was reduced by
      approximately 1/2 to 1 C, but was quickly brought back to about 55
      C by the Bunsen burner 101 and cast iron hot plate 103 in a matter
      of a few seconds. The electrodes 108 and 109 were temporarily
      removed from the solution 105 to permit the stirring, mixing and
      dissolution of the sodium chloride into the distilled water.
      However, the electrodes 108 and 109 were immediately reinserted
      upon completion of the stirring.<br>
      <br>
      A ring stand 113 was positioned adjacent to the ring stand 102
      such that a high pressure sodium light 112 contained within a
      housing 111, and surrounded by an aluminum foil tube 110 permitted
      light emitted from the bulb 112 to be transmitted through the
      aluminum foil tube 110 and become incident upon a side of the
      beaker 104. The ring stand 113 was positioned such that the end of
      the aluminum tube 110 adjacent to the side of the beaker 104 was
      about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch away from the side of the beaker 104.
      The tube 110 measured about eight (8) inches long and was about 3
      1/2 inches in diameter. The end of the sodium light bulb 112 was
      about five (5) inches from the end of the tube 110. In this
      Example 18b, the sodium light bulb 112 was actuated at about the
      same time that the<br>
      <br>
      electrodes 108 and 109 were reinserted into the solution 105 which
      is after the sodium chloride had been mixed into and dissolved in
      the distilled water. The light fixture 111 was fixed to the ring
      stand 113 by use of a chain clamp 114.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 103b shows the results of three (3) separate experiments
      corresponding to the experimental apparatus of Figure 100. The
      plotted data show the change in measured pH of the solution 105 as
      a function of time from room temperature to about 55 C. In
      particular, the pH of the distilled water alone was first measured
      at room temperature and then measured at about 55 C, and
      thereafter measured about every two minutes after the addition and
      dissolution of sodium chloride and the activation of the high
      pressure sodium light 112. The time measurements were all at
      intervals of about two minutes for about 20 minutes with a final
      measurement being taken after about 40 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      All experimental conditions described in this Example occurred in
      the presence of standard fluorescent lighting. The fluorescent
      lamps were Sylvania Cool White Deluxe Fluorescent Lamps, 75 watts
      and were each about eight (8) feet (about 2.4 meters) long. The
      lamps were suspended in pairs approximately 3.5 meters above the
      laboratory counter on which the experimental set-up was located.
      There were six (6) pairs of lamps present in a room which measured
      approximately 25 feet by 40 feet (about 7.6 meters x 12.1 meters).
      The fluorescent lamps produce a widely broadened and noisy mercury
      spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 7c</b><br>
      Figure 101 is a schematic of the experimental apparatus used to
      generate measured pH information where the temperature of the
      distilled water in the beaker 104, and later in the solution 105,
      in the beaker 104 was heated exclusively by use of a high pressure
      sodium bulb 112 contained in a fixture 111.<br>
      <br>
      The AR20 meter 107, which used the pH electrode 109 (the electrode
      being shown in more detail in Figure 102) were together calibrated
      by using two different buffer solutions.<br>
      <br>
      The first buffer solution had a pH of 4.00 +/-0.01 at about 25 C,
      and was a solution of potassium bipthalate. A second buffer
      solution had a pH of 7.00 +/-0.01 at about 25 C, and was a
      solution of potassium phosphate monobasic-sodium hydroxide. Both
      solutions were 0.05 Molar, both were certified and both were
      obtained from Fisher Chemicals. The use of these buffer solutions
      was intended to insure accuracy of the pH readings from the pH
      electrode.<br>
      <br>
      This Example 7c differs from the previous Examples 7a and 7b in
      that no Bunsen burner was provided for heating. In this regard,
      heat was generated from the energy emitted by the combination of
      the high-pressure sodium bulb 112, and the fixture 111. In
      particular,<br>
      <br>
      the energy was transmitted to the bottom of the beaker 104
      initially containing the distilled water, and later to the
      solution 105, through the use of the aluminum foil tube 110.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, the ring stand 102 supported the beaker 104 by the
      use of the chain clamp 114.<br>
      <br>
      The beaker 104 was initially lowered into the aluminum foil tube
      110 such that approximately 150-200 ml of the distilled water
      contained in the beaker 104 was physically located inside of the
      aluminum foil tube 110. The tube 110 measured about seven (7)
      inches long and was about four (4) inches in diameter. The top end
      of the sodium light bulb 112 was about four (4) inches from the
      end of the tube 110. Once the distilled water temperature achieved
      about 55 C after about 1 1/4-1 1/2 hours, the sodium chloride was
      added, as discussed above. The chain clamp 114 was then raised
      vertically slightly upon the ring stand 102 so that the bottom of
      the beaker 104 was now positioned slightly outside of the aluminum
      foil tube 110 (as shown in Figure 101). Experience caused the
      precise final location of the bottom of the beaker 104 to be about
      1/2 inch-3/4 inch above the end of the aluminum foil tube 110. The
      primary difference between this Example 7c and the previous two
      Examples 7a and 7b is that the only energy provided to the
      distilled water and the solution 105 came from the combination of
      the sodium bulb 112 and the fixture 111 by radiation and
      convection.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 103c shows the results of three (3) separate experiments
      corresponding to the experimental apparatus of Figure 101. The
      plotted data show the change in measured pH of the solution 105 as
      a function of time at a temperature of about 55 C. In particular,
      the pH of the distilled water alone was first measured at room
      temperature and then measured at about 55 C, and thereafter the pH
      of the solution 105 was measured about every two minutes after the
      addition and dissolution of sodium chloride. The time measurements
      were all at intervals of about two minutes for 20 minutes, with a
      final measurement being taken at about 40 minutes.<br>

      Figure 100 is a schematic of the experimental apparatus used to
      generate measured pH information at about 55 C as a function of

      to the ring stand 102 such that a high pressure sodium light 112
      contained within a housing 111, and surrounded by an aluminum foil
      tube 110 permitted light emitted from the bulb 112 to be

      such that the end of the aluminum tube 110 adjacent to the side of
      the beaker 104 was about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch (about 2.0 cm to
      about 2.5 cm) away from the side of the beaker 104. The tube 110
      measured about eight (8) inches (about 2.4 meters) long and was
      about 3 1/2 inches (about 8.5 cm) in diameter. The top end of the
      sodium light bulb 112 was about five (5) inches (about 12.5 cm)
      from the end of the tube 110. In this Example 7d, the sodium light
      bulb 112 was actuated about 40 minutes before heating the water
      with the Bunsen burner and irradiated the solution continuously
      throughout the pH measurements. The light fixture 111 was fixed to
      the ring stand 113 by use of a chain clamp 114.<br>
      <br>
      The Bunsen burner 101 was supplied with propane fuel from the fuel
      source 100 via a flexible rubber tube 115. The flame from the
      Bunsen burner 101 was caused to be incident upon a cast iron hot
      plate 103 which was attached to a ring stand 102. A 1000 ml Pyrex
      cylindrical beaker 104 was placed on top of the cast iron hot
      plate 103. The beaker 104 contained approximately 800 ml of
      distilled water obtained from American Fare. An AR20 pH/mV/
      C/Conductivity meter 107 from Accumet Research communicated with
      the 800 ml of distilled water and later with the solution 105
      through a temperature probe 108 and a pH electrode 109. More
      details of the pH electrode can be seen in Figure 102. The pH
      meter was elevated to a convenient height by the use of a support
      structure 106.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      The pH of the distilled water in the beaker 104 was first measured
      at room temperature before actuating the sodium lamp. After the 40
      minute sodium lamp<br>
      <br>
      conditioning, the water was then heated to about 55 C in about
      15-20 minutes by use of the Bunsen burner heating the hot plate
      103. The water temperature was monitored by the Accumet meter 107.
      Once a temperature of about 55 C was obtained, about 50 grams of
      sodium chloride (certified A. C. S. and discussed above herein),
      were added to the 800 ml of distilled water in the beaker 104 to
      form the solution 105. The sodium chloride was stirred into the
      800 ml of distilled water by use of glass stirring rod and
      complete dissolution of the sodium chloride occurred within about
      30-45 seconds. The temperature of the solution 105 was reduced by
      approximately 1/2 to 1 C, but was quickly brought back to about 55
      C by the Bunsen burner 101 and cast iron hot plate 103 in a matter

      800 ml of distilled water in the beaker 104 to form the solution
      105. The sodium chloride was stirred into the 800 ml of distilled
      water by use of glass stirring rod and complete dissolution of the
      sodium chloride occurred within about 30-45 seconds. The
      temperature of the solution 105 was reduced by approximately 1/2
      to 1 C, but was quickly brought back to about 55 C by the Bunsen
      burner 101 and cast iron hot plate 103 in a matter of a few
      seconds. The electrodes 108 and 109 were temporarily removed from
      the solution 105 to permit the stirring, mixing<br>
      <br>
      and dissolution of the sodium chloride into the distilled water.
      However, the electrodes 108 and 109 were immediately reinserted
      upon completion of the stirring.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 103h shows the results of three (3) separate experiments
      (#'s 3,4, and 5) corresponding to the experimental apparatus of
      Figure 100, representing decay curves for the sodium lamp
      conditioning effect in water. The plotted data show the change in
      measured pH of the solution 105 as a function of time from room
      temperature to about 55 C (curves 7fl, 7f2 and 7f3 were
      essentially identical). In particular, the pH of the distilled
      water alone was first measured at room temperature and then
      measured when the sodium lamp was terminated, and thereafter
      measured about every two minutes after the addition and
      dissolution of sodium chloride. The time measurements were all at
      intervals of about two (2) minutes for 20 minutes, with a final
      measurement being taken at about 40 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      All experimental conditions described in the Example occurred in
      the presence of standard fluorescent lighting. The fluorescent
      lamps were Sylvania Cool White Deluxe Fluorescent Lamps, 75 watts
      and were each about eight (8) feet (about 2.4 meters) long. The
      lamps were suspended in pairs approximately 3.5 meters above the
      laboratory counter on which the experimental set-up was located.
      There were six (6) pairs of lamps present in a room which measured
      approximately 25 feet by 40 feet (about 2.6 meters x 12.1
      meters).).<br>
      <br>
      The fluorescent lamps produce a widely broadened and noisy mercury
      spectrum.<br>

      <b>DISCUSSION OF EXAMPLES 7a, 7bt 7c, 7d. 7e and 7f</b><br>
      Figure 103d shows the averages calculated from the data from each
      of the three (3) series of experiments from each of Examples 7a,
      7b and 7c. The data show that the Bunsen burner-only heating
      corresponding to Example 7a and Figure 99 had the smallest overall
      measured rise in pH after a period of time of approximately 40
      minutes. The data generated from Example 7b, and corresponding to
      Figure 100, showed an intermediate rise in measured pH with time
      after about 40 minutes. In Example 7b, the sodium spectral pattern
      was added only at the point when the solution 105 had attained a
      temperature of about 55 C.<br>
      <br>
      The greatest overall increase in measured pH from a time of about
      2-40 minutes was shown in the data corresponding to Example 7c,
      which corresponds to the experimental apparatus shown in Figure
      101. In this Example 7c, the distilled water in the beaker 104,
      was exposed to the sodium spectral pattern emitted from the sodium
      light bulb 112 for the longest amount of time (e. g. , energy was
      provided to the distilled water and the solution 105 exclusively
      through the combination of the sodium light bulb 112 and the
      fixture 111) which was about 1 1/4-1 1/2 hours to heat the water
      to about 55 C and then for an additional 40 minutes while the pH
      measurements were made.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the data shown in Figure 103d clearly show the effect
      of a sodium spectral pattern upon the measured pH of the sodium
      chloride/water solution 105, as measured by an AR20 meter from
      Accumet Research used in combination with a pH electrode 109 (as
      shown in more detail in Figure 102).<br>
      <br>
      Figure 103g shows the averages calculated from the data from each
      of the three (3) series of experiments from each of Examples 7a,
      7b and 7e. The data show that the Bunsen burner-only heating
      corresponding to Example 7a and Figure 99 had the smallest overall
      measured rise in pH after a period of time of approximately 40
      minutes. The data generated from Example 7b, and corresponding to
      Figure 100, showed an intermediate rise in measured pH with time
      after about 40 minutes. In Example 7e, the water was conditioned
      by the sodium spectral pattern, after which it was heated to 55 C
      and the NaCl was added and dissolved.<br>
      <br>
      The greatest overall increase in measured pH from a time of about
      2-40 minutes was shown in the data corresponding to Example 7e,
      which corresponds to the experimental apparatus shown in Figure
      100. In this Example 7e, the distilled water in the beaker 104,
      was exposed to the conditioning sodium spectral pattern emitted
      from the sodium light bulb 112 for about forty (40) minutes (e. g.
      , conditioning energy was provided to the distilled water 105
      exclusively with the sodium light bulb 112 for about 40 minutes).<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the data shown in Figure 103g clearly show the pH
      effect of a conditioning sodium spectral pattern upon distilled
      water, which is later used to make a sodium chloride/water
      solution 105, as measured by an AR20 meter from Accumet Research
      used in combination with a pH electrode 109 (as shown in more
      detail in Figure 102).<br>
      <br>
      Figure 103h shows the experimental data from each of the three (3)
      experiments from Example 7f3, 7f4, and 7f5. The data (7f5) show
      that the 120 minute interval between conditioning of the distilled
      water and dissolution of the NaCl salt had the smallest overall
      measured rise in pH after a period of time of approximately 40
      minutes. The data generated from Example 7f4, after about a 60
      minute interval between conditioning of the distilled water and
      dissolution of the NaCl salt, showed an intermediate rise in
      measured pH with time after about 40 minutes. In Example 7f3, the
      water was conditioned by the sodium spectral pattern, and the
      interval between conditioning and dissolution of the NaCl salt was
      only about 40 minutes. This curve was essentially identical to the
      curve for 20 minutes and the normalized curve for zero minutes.
      Example 7f3 showed the greatest rise in pH.<br>
      <br>
      * Accordingly, the data shown in Figure 103h clearly show a
      time-related decay effect of a conditioning sodium spectral
      pattern upon distilled water, which is later used to make a<br>
      <br>
      sodium chloride/water solution 105, as measured by an AR20 meter
      from Accumet Research used in combination with a pH electrode 109
      (as shown in more detail in Figure 102). The conditioning effects
      of a sodium spectral pattern upon distilled water remained in the
      water for a period of time approximately equal to the conditioning
      time. After an interval of 1.5 times the conditioning time, the
      conditioning effects of a sodium spectral pattern upon distilled
      water were beginning to decline. Finally, after an interval of 3.0
      times the conditioning time, the conditioning effects of a sodium
      spectral pattern upon distilled water declined still further.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 7g</b><br>
      <b>Changes in pH Due to Effects of Na Lamp Conditioned NaCI on pH</b><br>
      Sodium chloride (about 50 grams) was spread into a thin layer
      under a sodium lamp in an otherwise dark room overnight. The next
      day the salt was used in a pH experiment.<br>
      <br>
      Overhead fluorescent lighting was present continuously throughout
      both experiments.<br>
      <br>
      Water (about 800 ml) was placed in a 1000 ml beaker and the pH was
      measured. The water was next heated to about 55 C and pH was
      measured again. The water temperature was maintained at about 55 C
      for the remainder of the experiment. NaCl (about 50 grams) was
      added and stirred with a glass stir rod. Ten additional pH
      measurements were taken about every two (2) minutes after the
      addition of the NaCl, for a total of about 20 minutes. Final pH
      was measured about 40 minutes after addition of the NaCI. Figure
      103i shows pH as a function of time for two experiments where
      sodium chloride solute was dissolved in water.<br>
      <br>
      One series of pH tests was performed on a solution made with the
      regular salt (which had not been conditioned), and one series of
      tests was performed on the solution made with the conditioned
      salt.<br>
      <br>
      Results: The pH increased more when the salt had been conditioned
      with its own Na spectral energy pattern. This same effect was seen
      in other similar experiments. When significantly larger amounts of
      salt in a much thicker layer were irradiated with the same
      intensity, this effect was not nearly so pronounced, or was not
      seen at all.<br>
      <br>
      In this Example, targeted spectral energies were used to change
      the material properties of a solid upon subsequent phase change
      into a liquid solution.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLE 8a</b><br>
      <b>Sodium Chloride Solubility in Water at Room Temperature (22 C)</b><br>
      Distilled water (about 500 ml, at about 20 C) was placed into each
      of six beakers (each about 1000 ml in size). One Beaker"EE"was
      placed under a sodium lamp 112, as configured in Figure 97f, while
      the other Beaker"FF"functioning as the control was placed in an
      incubator at about 28 C. Approximately, one hour later, about 500
      ml of water was again placed into two separate beakers.
      Beaker"CC"was placed under another sodium lamp as Beaker"EE" ; and
      Beaker"DD"was placed into the same incubator as Beaker"FF". The
      process was repeated a third time, about one hour later.
      Specifically, Beaker"AA"was placed under another sodium lamp as
      Beakers"EE"and"CC" ; and Becker"BB"was placed into the same
      incubator as Beaker"FF"and"DD". Thus, the result was three sets of
      beakers exposed to the sodium lamp and three sets of beakers in
      the incubator, one set each for one, two, or three hours. Water
      temperatures were as follows:<br>
      1) Beaker AA sodium lamp about 1 hour, at about 21 C ;<br>
      2) Beaker CC sodium lamp about 2 hours, at about 22 C ;<br>
      3) Beaker EE sodium lamp about 3 hours, at about 23 C ;<br>
      4) Beaker BB, a control beaker, about 1 hour, at about 21 C ;<br>
      5) Beaker DD, a control beaker, about 2 hours, at about 22 C ; and<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      6) Beaker FF, a control beaker, about 3 hours, at about 23 C.<br>
      <br>
      Sodium chloride (about 250 grams) was then added to each beaker
      and stirred. The beakers were covered with wax paper, placed in a
      darkened cabinet, and covered with a thick, black, opaque,
      light-blocking drape.<br>
      <br>
      Twenty hours later the solutions in the beakers were filtered over
      their salt into 1000 ml beakers. Two hours later each of the
      solutions (about 85 ml) was pipetted into the Kimex hydrometer
      testing tube, and temperature and hydrometer measurements were
      determined.<br>
      <br>
      The solutions were finally pipetted (about 50 ml) into each of
      five petri dishes, dried, and the dry sodium chloride weight per
      100 ml solution determined.<br>
      <br>
      Results: The rate of NaCl dissolution increased with exposure of
      the solvent water to the conditioning sodium lamp, as compared to
      unconditioned control water. After two hours exposure to the
      sodium lamp, the conditioned water dissolved approximately 7 %
      more NaCl than the unconditioned control water. After three hours
      exposure to the sodium lamp, the conditioned water dissolved
      approximately 9% more NaCl than the unconditioned control water.<br>
      <br>
      The rate of NaCl dissolution also increased with increasing time
      of exposure to the sodium lamp from one hour to two hours. After
      about two hours conditioned water dissolved about 3.5% more NaCl
      than the one hour conditioned water.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLE 8b</b><br>
      <b>Sodium Chloride Solubility in Water at Elevated Temperature (55

      Distilled water (about 500 ml, at about 20 C) was placed in each
      of two beakers 104 as shown in Figure 92 (about 1000 ml) and
      heated to about 55 C on an iron ringplate 103, over a Bunsen
      burner 101. One beaker 105 was then irradiated with a sodium lamp
      112 from the side (as shown in Figure 97h), while the other
      control water beaker 105 was exposed simply to the ambient
      laboratory lighting. One hour later, water was placed into a
      second set of beakers 105, which were treated exactly the same as
      the first set of beakers. The process was repeated a third time
      with a third set of beakers 105, one hour later, producing three
      sets of beakers, each set having been exposed to the sodium lamp
      or just ambient lighting for about one hour, two hours or three
      hours. Temperatures were maintained at about 55 C for all three
      sets of beakers for the entire time prior to sodium chloride being
      added thereto.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, sodium chloride (about 250 grams) was added to each
      beaker and stirred after the treatments discussed above occurred.
      Each of the six the beakers were covered with wax paper, placed in
      a darkened cabinet, and covered with a thick, black, opaque,
      light- blocking, cloth drape.<br>
      <br>
      Twenty hours later the solutions in the beakers were filtered over
      their salt into 1000 ml beakers. Each of the solutions (about 85
      ml) was pipetted into the Kimex hydrometer testing tube, and
      temperature and hydrometer measurements were determined.<br>
      <br>
      Results: Results were virtually identical for all six solutions,
      which were all fully saturated. Temperature was about 23. 5 C,
      salinity was about 99.5-100%, specific gravity was about 1.195 and
      NaCl percent was about 25.5-26%.<br>

      <br>
      Sugar (about 300 grams) was then added to each beaker and stirred.
      The beakers were covered with wax paper, placed in a darkened

      conditioned under a neon lamp; (about 8mW/cm2) in an otherwise
      dark room for about 1.5 hours at about 28 C ambient temperature.
      Tubes were also placed simultaneously in an incubator at about 28
      C for about 1.5 hours.<br>
      <br>
      Phenyl salicylate (about 3.50 grams) was added to each tube
      leaving a layer undissolved on the bottom of each tube. The
      solutions were allowed to equilibrate overnight (about 20 hours).
      Solution was filtered over the crystals and 0.500 ml pipetted into
      fresh tubes.<br>
      <br>
      After the acetone evaporated, dry weights of phenyl salicylate per
      ml dissolved in conditioned and unconditioned acetone were
      determined.<br>
      <br>
      Results: Average amounts of phenyl salicylate dissolved in
      conditioned acetone was 0.78g/ml. Average amount dissolved in
      unconditioned acetone was 0.68 g/ml.<br>

      <br>
      <b>Example 9a</b><br>
      <b>Spectral Enhancement of Mercury-Silver Metal Alloy
        Crystallization</b><br>
      Silver nitrate (about 2.0 grams) was added to about 80 ml
      distilled water (stored in<br>
      <br>
      white, semi-opaque plastic one-gallon jugs in cardboard boxes with
      thick black opaque drapes, in a darkened, shielded room). The
      solution was allowed to equilibrate for about 1.5 hours in ambient
      laboratory lighting before pipetting about two (2) ml into each of
      36 small test tubes. Mercury (about 2 drops) was added to each
      tube. Eighteen of the test tubes were placed into the incubator as
      controls at about 28 C. Eighteen test tubes were placed on a black
      non-reflective surface about 14 inches (about 35 cm) from the
      mercury lamp (47 mW/cm2). Ambient room temperature was about 28 C,
      in an otherwise dark room.<br>
      <br>
      About four hours later the ambient temperature under the mercury
      lamp was noted to be about 30 C and the test tubes on the black
      non-reflective surface were moved to a distance of about 29.5
      inches (about 75 cm) from the mercury lamp at a light intensity of
      about 4.5 mW/cm2, where ambient temperature remained at about 28
      C. Crystals in test tubes under the mercury lamp measured up to
      about 10 mm long at this time, while crystals in the incubator
      measured up to about 3 mm long.<br>
      <br>
      Results: The crystals were evaluated after about 20 hours after
      the addition of the mercury. Photomicrographs were taken at about
      10X magnification (not shown herein).<br>
      <br>
      Heights of the crystals formed were determined from measurements
      taken from the photomicrographs and plotted in graphs shown in
      Figures 104a and 104b. The average height of the incubator control
      metal alloy crystals was about 7 mm, with branched dendrites in
      one tube. The average height of the mercury spectrally irradiated
      metal alloy crystals was about 12 mm, with branched dendrites in 7
      tubes, six of which contained excessively branched dendrites.
      Three of the spectrally grown crystals were about 22-25 mm high
      (an exemplary photograph of the dendlitic formation is shown in
      Figure 105c). The mercury spectral pattern catalyzed enhanced
      growth of the mercury-silver alloy and morphology was
      significantly different.<br>
      <br>
      In this Example, targeted spectral energy was used to affect phase
      change and structure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 9b</b><br>
      <b>Mercury-Silver Metal Alloy Crystallization Usine Water
        Conditioned for One Hour</b><br>
      Distilled water (about 40 ml) at about 18 C (stored in a white,
      semi-opaque plastic one-gallon jug in a dark, shielded cabinet)
      was pipetted into a 125 ml Pyrex beaker and was conditioned by
      irradiation under a sodium-lamp for about one hour. Another 125 ml
      Pyrex beaker with distilled water (about 40 ml) at about 18 C was
      placed into the incubator at 28 C at the same time. At the end of
      about one hour, water temperatures in both beakers were 21 C and
      the volume unchanged. Silver nitrate (about 1.00 gram) was added
      to each beaker.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      The solutions (about 2 ml) were each pipetted into 16 small test
      tubes and mercury (about 100 111) was added to each tube. All of
      the test tubes were placed in the incubator at about 28 C.<br>
      <br>
      Results: The crystals were evaluated after about 17 hours after
      addition of the mercury. Photomicrographs were taken at about 10X
      magnification (not shown herein). The heights of the formed
      crystals were determined from measurements taken from the
      photomicrographs and plotted in graphs shown in Figures 105a and
      105b. The average height of the control metal alloy crystals was
      about 8 mm, the tallest being about 13 mm, and one tube contained
      a simple branched dendritic crystal. The average height of the
      mercury- silver metal alloy crystals grown from conditioned water
      was about 9 mm, the tallest about 25 mm. Three tubes contained
      excessively branched dendritic crystals.<br>
      <br>
      Growth of the mercury-silver alloy was slightly greater in the
      solution made with sodium lamp conditioned water, and morphology
      was different compared to the control solution.<br>

      Conclusion: The sodium lamp irradiation produced varying effects
      on lysozyme protein crystal growth depending on the reagents used,
      including:<br>
      1. Increased precipitation.<br>
      <br>
      2. Decreased precipitation.<br>
      <br>
      3. Increased rate of precipitation.<br>
      <br>
      4. Delayed single crystal growth followed by growth of larger
      single crystals.<br>
      <br>
      5. Increased growth rate of large, single crystals.<br>
      <br>
      6. Altered morphology of crystals.<br>
      <br>
      Differences were noted between the incubator and sodium lamp
      primarily for reservoir solutions containing sodium or potassium.
      Differences were minimal when the reservoir solution did not
      contain sodium or potassium.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLE lla</b><br>
      <b>Sodium Chloride/Potassium Chloride 1: 1 Molar Saturated
        Solution</b><br>
      Saturated sodium chloride (NaCl)/potassium chloride (KC1) 1: 1
      molar solution was prepared by heating distilled/deionized water
      (about 1600 ml) in a 2000 ml Pyrex beaker to about 55 C. NaCl
      (about 29 grams) and KC1 (about 37 grams) were mixed dry and added
      in about 66 gram amounts for a total mixture weight of about 726
      grams, until no more would dissolve, under ambient laboratory
      lighting. The beaker was wrapped in black plastic, stored in a
      cabinet, and allowed to equilibrate overnight (about 18 hours).<br>
      <br>
      The saturated solution was filtered at room temperature at about
      100 ml and was placed into each of 13 crystallization dishes. The
      dishes were treated as follows: - three under the potassium lamp
      in the shielded room surrounded by 1 meter tall light blocking
      barriers (the potassium lamp was suspended on a ring stand such
      that the lamp portion in the rectangular-shaped housing was about
      9 inches above the sample beakers) ; - three under the sodium lamp
      (apparatus similar to that shown in Figure 94) in the shielded
      room surrounded by about 1 meter tall light blocking barriers;<br>
      <br>
      - two in an opaque plastic container with light blocked by an
      entire covering of aluminum foil, in the shielded room; - two in
      an opaque plastic container with light blocked by an entire
      covering of black plastic in the shielded room; - three under
      fluorescent lights (the fluorescent lamps produce a widely
      broadened and noisy mercury spectrum).<br>
      <br>
      The solutions were allowed to crystallize overnight.<br>
      <br>
      Results: All dishes had crystalline masses covering the bottom.
      Weights were about as follows: Average Weight (a) per Dish<br>
      Potassium Lamp 14.94<br>
      Sodium Lamp 15.03<br>
      Al Foil Covered Container 5.75<br>
      Black Plastic Covered Container 5.50<br>
      Fluorescent Lights 13.87<br>
      Elemental analysis for sodium and potassium was performed on the
      mixed NaCl/KCl crystals. Results were:<br>

      Fluorescent Lights 51.7 1.55<br>
      The presence of spectral light frequencies (potassium lamp, sodium
      lamp, and fluorescent lights) enhanced the rate of crystallization
      for both sodium and potassium, compared to conditions in which
      light was blocked (aluminum foil and black plastic covered
      containers).<br>
      <br>
      The potassium lamp inhibited NaCl crystallization preferentially
      in favor of KC1.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, the sodium lamp enhanced crystallization of NaCl
      relative to KC1.<br>
      <br>
      The aluminum-foil covered container inhibited crystallization of
      NaCl, without affecting KC1 crystallization.<br>

      Sodium Chloride/Potassium Chloride 1: 1 Molar Unsaturated Solution
      Saturated sodium chloride (NaCl) /potassium chloride (KC1) 1: 1
      molar solution was prepared by heating distilled/deionized water
      (about 1600 ml) in a 2000 ml Pyrex beaker to about<br>
      <br>
      55 C. NaCl (about 29 grams) and KC1 (about 37 grams) were mixed
      dry and added in about 66 gram amounts for a total mixture weight
      of about 660 grams under ambient laboratory lighting. The beaker
      was wrapped in black plastic, stored in a cabinet, and allowed to
      equilibrate overnight (about 18 hours).<br>
      <br>
      The unsaturated solution was filtered at room temperature and 100
      ml was placed in each of 13 crystallization dishes. Dishes were
      treated as follows: - three under the potassium lamp in the
      shielded room surrounded by about 1 meter tall light blocking
      barriers (the potassium lamp was suspended on a ring stand such
      that the lamp portion in the rectangular-shaped housing was about
      9 inches above the sample beakers); - three under the sodium lamp
      (apparatus similar to that shown in Figure 94) in the shielded
      room surrounded by 1 meter tall light blocking barriers; - two in
      an opaque plastic container with light blocked by an entire
      covering of aluminum foil, in the shielded room; - two in an
      opaque plastic container with light blocked by an entire covering
      of black plastic in the shielded room; - three under fluorescent
      lights (the fluorescent lamps produce a widely broadened and noisy
      mercury spectrum).<br>
      <br>
      The solutions were allowed to crystallize overnight and were
      evaluated after about 20 hours.<br>
      <br>
      Results: Weights and morphologies of crystals grown from
      unsaturated solution were as follows:<br>
      Average Weight (s) Morphology per Dish<br>
      Potassium Lamp 3.4 more than 50 cubic crystals,<br>
      3-4 mm cubic<br>
      Sodium Lamp 3.9 more than 50 cubic crystals, up to 5 mm cubic<br>
      Al Foil Covered Container 1.2 about 15 crystals,<br>
      3-10 mm in size<br>
      Black Plastic Covered Container 1.1 8 crystals, 6-15 mm<br>
      Fluorescent Lights 2.8 more than 50 crystals, 1-2 mm in one dish,
      5-10 mm in two dishes<br>
      <br>
      Elemental analysis for sodium and potassium was performed via ICP
      (Baird) on the mixed NaCl/KCl crystals. Results were:<br>

      The presence of spectral light frequencies (potassium lamp, sodium
      lamp, and fluorescent lights) in a less saturated solution again
      enhanced the overall rates of crystallization and nucleation,
      compared to conditions in which light was blocked (aluminum foil
      and black plastic covered containers). Individual crystals were
      larger in those same light- blocked conditions, with significantly
      less nucleation.<br>
      <br>
      The potassium and sodium lamps did not exhibit preferential
      crystallization in this unsaturated solution.<br>
      <br>
      The aluminum foil-covered container again exhibited inhibition of
      NaCl crystallization, relative to KC1 crystallization.<br>
      <br>
      Conversely, crystallization of Na was enhanced in the unsaturated
      solution under fluorescent lights and in the plastic container
      with light blocking black plastic. (It was noted after the fact
      that the plastic container with light blocking black plastic had
      been placed directly adjacent to a bundle of electrical cords.)<br>

      The unsaturated solution was filtered at room temperature and 100

      (the potassium lamp was suspended on a ring stand such that the
      lamp portion in the rectangular-shaped housing was about 9 inches

      The presence of spectral light frequencies (potassium lamp, sodium

      again enhanced the overall rates of crystallization and
      nucleation, compared to conditions in which light was blocked
      (aluminum foil and black plastic-covered containers).
      Crystallization growth rate was greatest with the sodium lamp.
      Nucleation was approximately equal with all light irradiation.<br>
      <br>
      The potassium and sodium lamps exhibited slight preferential

      beaker was wrapped in black plastic, stored in a cabinet, and
      allowed to equilibrate overnight about 18 hours.<br>
      <br>
      The saturated solution was filtered at room temperature and about
      100 ml was placed into each of 8 crystallization dishes. Dishes
      were treated as follows: - Two dishes in the shielded, dark
      control enclosure (about 22 C) - Two dishes in the second
      shielded, dark enclosure (about 22 C) for microwave irradiation,
      parameter Sll, sweeping more broadly from 13.0736 GHz to 13.0738.<br>
      <br>
      Microwave Dish"A"was immediately adjacent to the microwave horn,
      and microwave Dish "B"was adjacent to dish A, and in line with the
      microwave horn.<br>

      - Two dishes in the incubator (about 28 C) - Two dishes under a
      sodium lamp (about 28 C) as shown in Figure 94.<br>
      <br>
      Microwave irradiation was terminated after about 12 hours and the
      shielded controls were placed in the same enclosure with the
      microwave dishes. After about 5 more hours all the crystallization
      dishes were assessed. Photomicrographs corresponding to the grown
      crystals are shown in Figures 105f-105i. Dry crystal weights were
      also obtained.<br>

      A broader microwave resonance curve was used in the experiment.
      Differences between the microwave crystal weights and the shielded
      control weights were more pronounced, with crystallization during
      microwave irradiation being 18% less.<br>

      Conductivity of Sodium Chloride Aqueous Solution<br>
      Procedures similar to those discussed in detail in Example 7 were
      followed with the following specific differences.<br>
      <br>
      Water (about 800 ml) was placed in a 1000 ml beaker and room
      temperature measurements were obtained for conductivity (S/cm),
      dissolved solids (ppm), and resistance (kOhms), after allowing
      about 10 minutes for the probe to equilibrate to the water. The
      water was then heated to about 56. 1 C, and measurements were
      repeated. Sodium chloride (about 0.01 gram) was added and stirred
      with a glass stir rod for about 30 seconds. Measurements of
      conductivity were obtained about every 2 minutes for about 20
      minutes, and a final measurement was taken at about 40 minutes.
      Dissolved solids and resistance measurements were also obtained at
      about 4 minutes, at about 14 minutes, and at about 20 minutes
      after adding the salt.<br>
      <br>
      The experimental apparatuses used to obtain data are shown in
      Figures 99 and 100. A conditioning probe was substituted for the
      pH probe of Example 7.<br>
      <br>
      Four sets of parameters were evaluated, with three tests within
      each set:<br>
      1. Bunsen burner heating only (apparatus corresponding to Figure
      99);<br>
      2. Sodium lamp irradiation of water about 40 minutes before adding
      the salt (apparatus corresponding to Figure 100);<br>
      3. Sodium lamp irradiation of water about 40 minutes after adding
      the salt (apparatus corresponding to Figure 100);<br>
      <br>
      4. Sodium lamp irradiation of water about 40 minutes before and
      after adding the salt (apparatus corresponding to Figure 100).<br>

      Enhanced Sodium Chloride Battery Current with Sodium Spectral
      Irradiation<br>
      Figure 107 shows an aqueous NaCl battery/flashlight assembly 308.
      Two assemblies 308 were placed side-by-side in a grounded, dark
      enclosure. Electrolyte 310 was distilled water (about 1700 ml) and
      NaCl (about 97 g) mixed at the same time at room temperature in
      2000 ml Pyrex beakers. Thermometer wires 309 were placed on the
      bottom center of the electrolyte receptacles 307. Figure 108 shows
      Sodium lamp 112 in a housing 111 with an aluminum foil cylinder
      110, with the sodium lamp 112 positioned about 18 cm to the
      outside side of each electrolyte receptacle 307 allowing delivery
      of sodium spectral irradiation through the outside of the
      receptacle 307, into the electrolyte solution 310, and onto the
      outside of the anode plate 306.<br>
      <br>
      The electrolyte receptacles 307 were filled with electrolyte 310,
      the anode/cathode assembly 301 was lowered into the electrolyte
      310, and the flashlights 303 of each assembly 308 were turned on
      throughout the experiment. Initial measurements of current (mAmps)
      and temperature were performed and then measured again every 40
      minutes.<br>
      <br>
      The sodium lamp was cycled as follows: 1. Off first 40 minutes;<br>
      2. On second 40 minutes ;<br>
      3. Off third 40 minutes;<br>
      4. On fourth 40 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      Results: As shown in Figure 109, the standard initial current
      increase occurred with the sodium lamp turned off. The current
      increase continued with the sodium lamp turned on during the
      second 40 minutes. When the sodium lamp was turned off at 80
      minutes however, the current stopped increasing and stayed
      essentially the same to 120 minutes. When the sodium lamp was
      turned on again at 120 minutes, the current again increased.
      Finally, when the sodium lamp was turned off again the current
      remained the same.<br>
      <br>
      These current characteristics were not related to temperature.
      Although the temperature increased between 80 and 120 minutes and
      between 160 and 200 minutes, when<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      the sodium lamp was off, the current did not increase, suggesting
      that current increase was not due to an increase in temperature.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 14b</b><br>
      Enhanced Sodium Chloride Battery Current With Sodium Spectral
      Irradiation<br>
      Figure 107 shows an aqueous NaCl battery/flashlight assembly 308.
      Two assemblies 308 were placed side-by-side in a grounded, dark
      enclosure. Electrolyte 310 was distilled water (about 1700 ml) and
      NaCl (about 97 g) mixed at the same time at room temperature in
      2000 ml Pyrex beakers. Figure 108 shows Sodium lamp 112 in a
      housing 111 with an aluminum foil cylinder 110 with the sodium
      lamp 112 that was positioned about 18 cm to the outside side of
      each electrolyte receptacle 307 allowing delivery of sodium
      spectral irradiation through the outside of the receptacle 307,
      into the electrolyte solution 310, and onto the outside of the
      anode plate 306.<br>
      <br>
      The electrolyte receptacles 307 were filled with electrolyte 310,
      the anode/cathode assembly 301 was lowered into the electrolyte
      310, and the flashlights 303 of each assembly 308 were turned on
      throughout the experiment. Initial measurements of current (mAmps)
      and temperature were performed and then measured again every 10
      minutes. Movement of charged species in this battery is
      accomplished by phase changes entailing dissolution of metal atoms
      on the anode, followed by migration across the electrolyte, and
      ending with bonding crystallization onto the cathode. The spectral
      energy pattern used in this Example enhanced these phase changes.<br>
      <br>
      The sodium lamp was cycled as follows:<br>
      1. Off 0-40 minutes;<br>
      2. Off 40-70 minutes;<br>
      2. On 70-110 minutes;<br>
      3. Off 110-150 minutes;<br>
      4. On 150-190 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      Results: As shown in Figure 110, the standard initial current
      increase occurred with the sodium lamp turned off. Rate of rise of
      current had slowed by about 70 minutes. The current increased
      faster with the sodium lamp turned on between 70 and 110 minutes.
      When the sodium lamp was turned off at from 110-150 minutes, the
      rate of current increase went down. When the sodium lamp was
      turned on again at 150 minutes, the rate of current increase went
      up again.<br>
      <br>
      In these examples, the spectral energy pattern of sodium was used
      to increase current in an electrolyte.<br>

      possibility of producing a potentially dangerous explosive risk.
      This experiment replaced the physical platinum catalyst with a
      spectral catalyst comprising the spectral pattern of the physical
      platinum catalyst, which resonates with and transfers energy to
      the hydrogen and hydroxy intermediates.<br>
      <br>
      To demonstrate that oxygen and hydrogen can combine to form water
      utilizing a spectral catalyst, electrolysis of water was performed
      to provide stoichiometric amounts of oxygen and hydrogen starting
      gases. A triple neck flask was fitted with two (2) rubber stoppers
      on the outside necks, each fitted with platinum electrodes encased
      in glass for a four (4) inch length. The flask was filled with
      distilled water and a pinch of salt so that only the glass-encased
      portion of the electrode was exposed to air, and the unencased
      portion of the electrode was completely under water. The central
      neck was connected via a rubber stopper to vacuum tubing, which
      led to a Drierite column to remove any water from the produced
      gases.<br>
      <br>
      After vacuum removal of all gases in the system (to about 700 mm
      Hg), electrolysis was conducted using a 12 V power source attached
      to the two electrodes. Electrolysis was commenced with the
      subsequent production of hydrogen and oxygen gases in
      stoichiometric amounts. The gases passed through the Drierite
      column, through vacuum tubing connected to positive and negative
      pressure gauges and into a sealed 1,000 ml, round quartz flask. A
      strip of filter paper, which contained dried cobalt, had been
      placed in the bottom of the sealed flask. Initially the cobalt
      paper was blue, indicating the absence of water in the flask. A
      similar cobalt test strip exposed to the ambient air was also
      blue.<br>
      <br>
      The traditional physical platinum catalyst was replaced by
      spectral catalyst platinum electronic frequencies (with their
      attendant fine and hyperfine frequencies) from a Fisher Scientific
      Hollow Cathode Platinum Lamp which was positioned approximately
      one inch (about 2 cm) from the flask. This allowed the oxygen and
      hydrogen gases in the round quartz flask to be irradiated with
      emissions from the spectral catalyst. A Cathodeon Hollow Cathode
      Lamp Supply C610 was used to power the Pt lamp at 80% maximum
      current (12 mAmps). The reaction flask was cooled using dry ice in
      a Styrofoam container positioned<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      directly beneath the round quartz flask, offsetting any effects of
      heat from the Pt lamp. The Pt lamp was turned on and within two
      days of irradiation, a noticeable pink color was evident on the
      cobalt paper strip indicating the presence of water in the round
      quartz flask. The cobalt test strip exposed to ambient air in the
      lab remained blue. Over the next four to five days, the pink
      colored area on the cobalt strip became brighter and larger. Upon
      discontinuation of the Pt emission, H20 diffused out of the cobalt
      strip and was taken up by the Drierite column. Over the next four
      to five days, the pink coloration of the cobalt strip in the
      quartz flask faded. The cobalt strip exposed to the ambient air
      remained blue.<br>

      <b>IN A LIQUID PHASE REACTION</b><br>
      H202 platinum catalyst H20 + 02<br>
      The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is an extremely slow
      reaction in the absence of catalysts. Accordingly, an experiment
      was performed which showed that the physical catalyst, finely
      divided platinum, could be replaced with the spectral catalyst
      having the spectral pattern of platinum. Hydrogen peroxide, 3%,
      filled two (2) nippled quartz tubes.<br>
      <br>
      (the nippled quartz tubes consisted of a lower portion about 17 mm
      internal diameter and about 150 mm in length, narrowing over about
      a 10 mm length to an upper capillary portion being about 2.0 mm
      internal diameter and about 140 mm in length and were made from
      PhotoVac Laser quartz tubing). Both quartz tubes were inverted in
      50 ml beaker reservoirs filled with (3%) hydrogen peroxide to
      about 40 ml and were shielded from incident light (cardboard
      cylinders covered with aluminum foil). One of the light shielded
      tubes was used as a control. The other shielded tube was exposed
      to a Fisher Scientific Hollow Cathode Lamp for platinum (Pt) using
      a Cathodeon Hollow Cathode Lamp Supply C610, at 80% maximum
      current (12 mA). The experiment was performed several times with
      an exposure time ranging from about 24 to about 96 hours. The
      shielded tubes were monitored for increases in temperature (there
      was none) to assure that any reaction was not due to thermal
      effects. In a typical experiment the nippled tubes were prepared
      with hydrogen peroxide (3%) as described above herein. Both tubes
      were shielded from light, and the Pt tube was exposed to platinum
      spectral emissions, as described above, for about 24 hours. Gas
      production in the control tube A measured about four (4) mm in
      length in the capillary (i. e.,<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      about2. 5 mm3), while gas in the Pt (tube B) measured about 50 mm
      (i. e. , about 157 mm3).<br>
      <br>
      The platinum spectral catalyst thus increased the reaction rate
      about 12.5 times.<br>
      <br>
      The tubes were then switched and tube A was exposed to the
      platinum spectral catalyst, for about 24 hours, while tube B
      served as the control. Gas production in the control (tube B)
      measured about 2 mm in length in the capillary (i. e. , about 6
      mm3) while gas in the Pt tube (tube A) measured about 36 mm (i. e.
      , about 113 mm3), yielding about a 19 fold difference in reaction
      rate.<br>
      <br>
      As a negative control, to confirm that any lamp would not cause
      the same result, the experiment was repeated with a sodium lamp at
      6 mA (80% of the maximum current). Na in a traditional reaction
      would be a reactant with water releasing hydrogen gas, not a
      catalyst of hydrogen peroxide breakdown. The control tube measured
      gas to be about 4 mm in length (i. e. , about 12 mm3) in the
      capillary portion, while the Na tube gas measured to be about 1 mm
      in length (i. e. , about 3 mm3). This indicated that while
      spectral emissions can substitute for catalysts, they cannot yet
      substitute for reactants. Also, it indicated that the simple
      effect of using a hollow cathode tube emitting heat and energy
      into the hydrogen peroxide was not the cause of the gas bubble
      formation, but instead, the spectral pattern of Pt replacing the
      physical catalyst caused the reaction.<br>

      chemical reaction in a liquid phase and subsequent transformation

      <b>REPLACING A PHYSICAL CATALYST WITH A SPECTRAL CATALYST</b><br>
      <b>IN A SOLID PHASE REACTION</b><br>
      It is well known that certain microorganisms have a toxic reaction
      to silver (Ag). The silver electronic spectrum consists of
      essentially two ultraviolet frequencies that fall between UV-A and
      UV-B. It is now understood through this invention, that the high
      intensity spectral frequencies produced in the silver electronic
      spectrum are ultraviolet frequencies that inhibit bacterial growth
      (by creation of free radicals and by causing bacterial DNA
      damage). These W frequencies are essentially harmless to mammalian
      cells. Thus, it was theorized that the known medicinal and
      anti-microbial uses of silver are due to a spectral catalyst
      effect. In this regard, an experiment was conducted which showed
      that the spectral catalyst emitting the spectrum of silver
      demonstrated a toxic or inhibitory effect on microorganisms.<br>
      <br>
      Bacterial cultures were placed onto standard growth medium in two
      petri dishes (one control and one Ag) using standard plating
      techniques covering the entire dish. Each dish was placed at the
      bottom of a light shielding cylindrical chamber. A light shielding
      foil-<br>
      <br>
      covered, cardboard disc with a patterned slit was placed over each
      culture plate. A Fisher Scientific Hollow Cathode Lamp for Silver
      (Ag) was inserted through the top of the Ag exposure chamber so
      that only the spectral emission pattern from the silver lamp was
      irradiating the bacteria on the Ag culture plate (i. e. , through
      the patterned slit). A Cathodeon Hollow Cathode Lamp Supply C610
      was used to power the Ag lamp at about 80% maximum current (3.6
      mA). The control plate was not exposed to emissions of an Ag lamp,
      and ambient light was blocked. Both control and Ag plates were
      maintained at room temperature (e. g. , about 70-74 F) during the
      silver spectral emission exposure time, which ranged from about
      12-24 hours in the various experiments. Afterwards, both plates
      were incubated using standard techniques (37 C, aerobic Forma
      Scientific Model 3157, Water-Jacketed Incubator) for about 24
      hours.<br>
      <br>
      The following bacteria (obtained from the Microbiology Laboratory
      at People's Hospital in Mansfield, Ohio, US), were studied for
      effects of the Ag lamp spectral emissions:<br>
      1. E. coli ;<br>
      2. Strep. pneumoniae ;<br>
      3. Staph. aureus ; and<br>
      4. Salnaor2ella typhi.<br>
      <br>
      This group included both Gram+ and Gram~ species, as well as cocci
      and rods.<br>
      <br>
      Results were as follows:<br>
      1. Controls-all controls showed full growth covering the culture
      plates;<br>
      2. The Ag plates - areas unexposed to the Ag spectral emission
      pattern showed full growth.<br>

      - areas exposed to the Ag spectral emission pattern showed: a. E.

      <b>PREPARATION</b><br>
      To further demonstrate that certain susceptible organisms which
      have a toxic reaction to silver would have a similar reaction to
      the spectral catalyst emitting the spectrum of silver, cultures
      were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)
      which included Escherichia coli #25922, and Klebsiella praeumonia,
      subsp Pnemnofziae, # 13883. Control and Ag plate cultures were
      performed as described above. After incubation, plates were
      examined using a binocular microscope. The E. coli exhibited
      moderate resistance to the bactericidal effects of the spectral
      silver emission, while the Klebsiella exhibited moderate
      sensitivity. All controls exhibited full growth.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, an experiment was performed which demonstrated a
      similar result using the physical silver catalyst as was obtained
      with the Ag spectral catalyst. Sterile test discs were soaked in
      an 80 ppm, colloidal silver solution. The same two (2) organisms
      were again plated, as described above. Colloidal silver test discs
      were placed on each Ag plate, while the control plates had none.
      The plates were incubated as described above and examined under
      the binocular microscope. The colloidal silver E. coli exhibited
      moderate resistance to the bactericidal effects of the physical
      colloidal silver, while the Klebsiella again exhibited moderate
      sensitivity. All controls exhibited full growth.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLE 20</b><br>
      <b>AUGMENTING A PHYSICAL CATALYST WITH A SPECTRAL CATALYST</b><br>
      To demonstrate that oxygen and hydrogen can combine to form water
      utilizing a spectral catalyst to augment a physical catalyst,
      electrolysis of water was performed to provide the necessary
      oxygen and hydrogen starting gases, as in Example 1.<br>
      <br>
      Two quartz flasks (A and B) were connected separately after the
      Drierite column, each with its own set of vacuum and pressure
      gauges. Platinum powder (about 31 mg) was placed in each flask.
      The flasks were filled with electrolytically produced
      stoichiometric amounts of H2 and 02 to 120 mm Hg. The flasks were
      separated by a stopcock from the electrolysis system and from each
      other. The pressure in each flask was recorded over time as the
      reaction proceeded over the physical platinum catalyst. The
      reaction combines three (3) moles of gases, (i. e. , two (2) moles
      H2 and one (1) mole 02), to produce two (2) moles H20. This
      decrease in molarity, and hence progress of the reaction, can be
      monitored by a decrease in pressure"P"which is proportional, via
      the ideal gas law, (PV = nRT), to molarity<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      "n". A baseline rate of reaction was thus obtained. Additionally,
      the test was repeated filling each flask with H2 and 02 to 220 mm
      Hg. Catalysis of the reaction by only the physical catalyst
      yielded two baseline reaction curves which were in good agreement
      between flasks A and B, and for both the 110 mm and 220 mm Hg
      tests.<br>
      <br>
      Next, the traditional physical platinum catalyst in flask A was
      augmented with spectral catalyst platinum emissions from two (2)
      parallel Fisher Scientific Hollow Cathode Platinum Lamps, as in
      Example 1, which were positioned approximately two (2) cm from
      flask A. The test was repeated as described above, separating the
      two (2) flasks from each other and monitoring the rate of the
      reaction via the pressure decrease in each. Flask B served as a
      control flask. In flask A, the oxygen and hydrogen gases, as well
      as the physical platinum catalyst, were directly irradiated with
      emissions from the Pt lamp spectral catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      Rate of reaction in the control flask B, was in good agreement
      with previous baseline rates. Rate of reaction in flask"A",
      wherein physical platinum catalyst was augmented with the platinum
      spectral pattern, exhibited an overall mean increase of 60%, with
      a maximal increase of 70% over the baseline and flask B.<br>
      <br>
      In this Example, targeted spectral energies were used to change
      the chemical reaction properties of a solid catalyst in a gas
      phase (heterogeneous) reaction system.<br>

      Water was electrolyzed to produce stoichiometric amounts of
      hydrogen and oxygen gases as described above herein. Additionally,
      a dry ice cooled stainless steel coil was placed immediately after
      the Drierite column. After vacuum removal of all gases in the
      system, electrolysis was accomplished using a 12 V power source
      attached to the two electrodes, resulting in a production of
      hydrogen and oxygen gases. After passing through the Drierite
      column, the hydrogen and oxygen gases passed through vacuum tubing
      connected to positive and negative pressure gauges, through the
      dry ice cooled stainless steel coil and then to a 1,000 ml round,
      quartz flask. A strip of filter paper impregnated with dry (blue)
      cobalt was in the bottom of the quartz flask, as an indicator of
      the presence or absence of water.<br>
      <br>
      The entire system was vacuum evacuated to a pressure of about 700
      mm Hg below atmospheric pressure. Electrolysis was performed,
      producing hydrogen and oxygen gases in<br>
      <br>
      stoichiometric amounts, to result in a pressure of about 220 mm Hg
      above atmospheric pressure. The center of the quartz flask, now
      containing hydrogen and oxygen gases, was irradiated for
      approximately 12 hours with continuous microwave electromagnetic
      radiation emitted from a Hewlett Packard microwave spectroscopy
      system which included an HP 83350B Sweep Oscillator, an HP 8510B
      Network Analyzer and an HP 8513A Reflection Transmission Test Set.
      The frequency used was 21.4 GHz, which corresponds to a fine
      splitting constant, the alpha rotation-vibration constant, of the
      hydroxy intermediate, and is thus a harmonic resonant heterodyne
      for the hydroxy radical. The cobalt strip changed strongly in
      color to pink which indicated the presence of water in the quartz
      flask, whose creation was catalyzed by a harmonic resonant
      heterodyne frequency for the hydroxy radical.<br>

      In this Example, targeted spectral energies were used to control a

      <b>REPLACING A PHYSICAL CATALYST WITH A HYPERFINE SPLITTING

      An experimental dark room was prepared, in which there is no
      ambient light, and which can be totally darkened. A shielded,
      ground room (Ace Shielded Room, Ace, Philadelphia, PA, US, Model
      A6H3-16; 8 feet wide, 17 feet long, and 8 feet high (about 2.
      meters x 5.2 meters x 2.4 meters) copper mesh) was installed
      inside the dark room.<br>
      <br>
      Hydrogen peroxide (3%) was placed in nippled quartz tubes, which
      were then inverted in beakers filled with (3%) hydrogen peroxide,
      as described in greater detail herein.<br>
      <br>
      The tubes were allowed to rest for about 18 hours in the dark
      room, covered with non- metallic light blocking hoods (so that the
      room could be entered without exposing the tubes to light).
      Baseline measurements of gases in the nippled tubes were then
      performed.<br>
      <br>
      Three nippled RF tubes were placed on a wooden grid table in the
      shielded room, in the center of grids 4,54, and 127; corresponding
      to distances of about 107 cm, 187 cm, and 312 cm respectively,
      from a frequency-emitting antenna (copper tubing 15 mm diameter,
      4.7 m octagonal circumference, with the center frequency at
      approximately 6.5 MHz. A 25 watt, 17 MHz signal was sent to the
      antenna. This frequency corresponds to a hyperfine splitting
      frequency of the hydrogen atom, which is a transient in the
      dissociation of hydrogen peroxide. The antenna was pulsed
      continuously by a BK Precision RF Signal Generator Model 2005A,
      and amplified by an Amplifier Research amplifier, Model 25A-100. A
      control tube was placed on a wooden cart immediately adjacent to
      the shielded room, in the dark room. All tubes were covered with
      non-metallic light blocking hoods.<br>
      <br>
      After about 18 hours, gas production from dissociation of hydrogen
      peroxide and resultant oxygen formation in the nippled tubes was
      measured. The RF tube closest to the antenna produced 11 mm length
      gas in the capillary (34 mm3), the tube intermediate to the
      antenna produced a 5 mm length (10 mm3) gas, and the RF tube
      farthest from the antenna produced no gas. The control tube
      produced 1 mm gas. Thus, it can be concluded that the RF hyperfine
      splitting frequency for hydrogen increased the reaction rate
      approximately five (5) to ten (10) times.<br>
      <br>
      In this. Example, targeted spectral energy was used to control a

      as described above. The tubes were allowed to rest for about four
      (4) hours on a wooden table in a shielded cage, in a dark room.<br>
      <br>
      Baseline measurements of gases in the nippled tubes were then
      performed.<br>
      <br>
      Remaining in the shielded cage, in the dark room, two (2) control
      tubes were left on a wooden table as controls. Two (2) magnetic
      field tubes were placed on the center platform of an ETS Helmholtz
      single axis coil, Model 6402,1. 06 gauss/Ampere, pulsed at about
      83 Hz by a BK Precision 20 MHz Sweep/Function Generator, Model
      4040. The voltage output of the function generator was adjusted to
      produce an alternating magnetic field of about 19.5 milliGauss on
      the center platform of the Helmholtz Coil, as measured by a
      Holaday Model HI-3627, three (3) axis ELF magnetic field meter and
      probe. Hydrogen atoms, which are a transient in the dissociation
      of hydrogen peroxide, exhibit nuclear magnetic resonance via
      Zeeman splitting at this applied frequency and applied magnetic
      field strength. Thus, frequency of the alternating magnetic field
      was resonant with the hydrogen transients.<br>
      <br>
      After about 18 hours, gas production from dissociation of hydrogen
      peroxide and resultant oxygen formation in the nippled tubes was
      measured. The control tubes averaged about 180 mm gas formation
      (540mm3) while the tubes exposed to the alternating magnetic field
      produced about 810 mm gas (2,430 mm3), resulting in an increase in
      the reaction rate of approximately four (4) times.<br>

      herein. The tubes were placed on a wooden table, in a shielded
      room, in a dark room. After four (4) hours, baseline measurements
      were taken of the gas in the capillary portion of the tubes.<br>
      <br>
      An Amplifier Research self-contained electromagnetic mode cell
      ("TEM") Model TC1510A had been placed in the dark, shielded room.
      A sine wave signal of about 133 MHz was provided to the TEM cell
      by a BK Precision RF Signal Generator, Model 2005A, and an
      Amplifier Research amplifier, Model 25A100. Output levels on the
      signal generator and amplifier wave adjusted to produce an
      electric field (E-field) of about five (5) V/m in the center of
      the TEM cell, as measured with a Holaday Industries electric field
      probe, Model HI- 4433GRE, placed in the center of the lower
      chamber.<br>
      <br>
      Two of the hydrogen peroxide filled tubes were placed in the
      center of the upper chamber of the TEM cell, about 35 cm from the
      wall of the shielded room. The other two (2) tubes served as
      controls and were placed on a wooden table, also about 35 cm from
      the same wall of the shielded, dark room, and removed from the
      immediate vicinity of the TEM cell, so that there was no ambient
      electric field, as confirmed by E-field probe measurements.<br>
      <br>
      The 133 MHz alternating sine wave signal delivered to the TEM cell
      was well above the typical line width frequency at room
      temperature (e. g. , about 100 KHz) and was theorized to be
      resonant with an n=20 Rydberg state of the hydrogen atom as
      derived from A E = c E3" where E is the change in energy in cm~l,
      c is 7.51 +/-0.02 for the hydrogen state n = 20 and E is the
      electric field intensity in (Kv/cm) 2.<br>
      <br>
      After about five (5) hours of exposure to the electric field, the
      mean gas production in the tubes subjected to the E-field was
      about 17.5 mm, while mean gas production in the control tubes was
      about 58 mm.<br>
      <br>
      While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory or
      explanation, it is believed that the alternating electric field
      resonated with an upper energy level in the hydrogen atoms,
      producing a negative Stark effect, and thereby negatively
      catalyzing the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 25</b><br>
      <b>AUGMENTATION OF A PHYSICAL CATALYST BY IRRADIATING</b><br>
      <b>REACTANTS/TRANSIENTS WITH A SPECTRAL CATALYST</b><br>
      Hydrogen and oxygen gases were produced in stoichiometric amounts
      by electrolysis, as previously described in greater detail above
      herein. A stainless steel coil cooled in dry ice was placed
      immediately after the Drierite column. Positive and negative
      pressure gauges<br>
      <br>
      were connected after the coil, and then a 1,000 ml round quartz
      flask was sequentially connected with a second set of pressure
      gauges.<br>
      <br>
      At the beginning of each experimental run, the entire system was
      vacuum evacuated to a pressure of about minus 650 mm Hg. The
      system was sealed for about 15 minutes to confirm the maintenance
      of the generated vacuum and integrity of the connections.<br>
      <br>
      Electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen and oxygen gases was
      performed, as described previously.<br>
      <br>
      Initially, about 10 mg of finely divided platinum was placed into
      the round quartz flask. Reactant gases were allowed to react over
      the platinum and the reaction rate was monitored by increasing the
      rate of pressure drop over time, as previously described. The
      starting pressure was approximately in the mid-90's mm Hg positive
      pressure, and the ending pressure was approximately in the low
      30's over the amount of time that measurements were taken. Two (2)
      control runs were performed, with reaction rates of about 0.47 mm
      Hg/minute and about 0.48 mm Hg/minute.<br>
      <br>
      For the third run, a single platinum lamp was applied, as
      previously described, except that the operating current was
      reduced to about eight (8) mA and the lamp was positioned through
      the center of the flask to irradiate only the reactant/transient
      gases, and not the physical platinum catalyst. The reaction rate
      was determined, as described above, and was found to be about 0.63
      mm Hg/minute, an increase of 34%.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 26</b><br>
      <b>APPARENT POISONING OF A REACTION BY THE SPECTRAL PATTERN</b><br>
      <b>OF A PHYSICAL POISON</b><br>
      The conversion of hydrogen and oxygen gases to water, over a
      stepped platinum physical catalyst, is known to be poisoned by
      gold. Addition of gold to this platinum catalyzed reaction reduces
      reaction rates by about 95%. The gold blocks only about one sixth
      of the platinum binding sites, which according to prior art, would
      need to be blocked to poison the physical catalyst to this degree.
      Thus, it was theorized that a spectral interaction of the physical
      gold with the physical platinum and/or reaction system could also
      be responsible for the poisoning effects of gold on the reaction.
      It was further theorized that addition of the gold spectral
      pattern to the reaction catalyzed by physical platinum could also
      poison the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      Hydrogen and oxygen gases were produced by electrolysis, as
      described above in greater detail. Finely directed platinum, about
      15 mg, was added to the round quartz flask.<br>
      <br>
      Starting pressures were about in the 90's mm Hg positive pressure,
      and ending pressures<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      were about in the 20's mm Hg over the amount of time that
      measurements were taken.<br>
      <br>
      Reaction rates were determined as previously described. The first
      control run revealed a reaction rate of about 0. 81 mm Hg/minute.<br>
      <br>
      In the second run, a Fisher Hollow Cathode Gold lamp was applied,
      as previously described, at an operating frequency of about eight
      (8) mA, (80% maximum current), through about the center of the
      round flask. The reaction rate increased to about 0.87 mm
      Hg/minute.<br>
      <br>
      A third run was then performed on the same reaction flask and
      physical platinum that had been in the flask exposed to the gold
      spectral pattern. The reaction rate decreased to about 0.75 mm
      Hg/minute.<br>
      <br>
      In this Example, targeted spectral energies were used to control
      an environmental reaction condition (poison) and change the
      chemical reaction properties of a physical catalyst in a
      heterogeneous catalyst reaction system.<br>
      <br>
      In these experiments, targeted spectral energies were used to
      change the chemical and material properties of solutions,
      resulting in altered electrochemical reaction rates and corrosion
      of solids.<br>

      </b><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to a novel method to affect, control and/or
      direct a reaction pathway (e. g., organic, inorganic, biologic or
      other reaction) by, for example, exposing one or more participants
      in a reaction system to at least one spectral energy pattern (e.
      g., at least one spectral pattern comprising at least one
      frequency of electromagnetic radiation) which can be made to
      correspond to at least a portion of a spectral catalyst or a
      spectral energy catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also relates to mimicking various mechanisms of
      action of various catalysts in reaction systems under various
      environmental reaction conditions. The invention further discloses
      methods for simulating, at least partially, one or more
      environmental reaction conditions by the application of one or
      more spectral environmental reaction conditions. The invention
      specifically discloses different means for achieving the matching
      of energy frequencies between, for example, applied energy and
      matter (e. g., solids, liquids, gases, plasmas and/or combinations
      or portions thereof), to achieve energy transfer to, for example,
      at least one participant in a reaction system by taking into
      account various energy considerations in the reaction system. The
      invention also discloses an approach for designing or determining
      appropriate physical catalyst (s) to be used in a reaction system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Chemical reactions are driven by energy. The energy comes in many
      different forms including chemical, thermal, mechanical, acoustic,
      and electromagnetic. Various features of each type of energy are
      thought to contribute in different ways to the driving of chemical
      reactions. Irrespective of the type of energy involved, chemical
      reactions are undeniably and inextricably intertwined with the
      transfer and combination of energy. An understanding of energy is,
      therefore, vital to an understanding of chemical reactions.<br>
      <br>
      A chemical reaction can be controlled and/or directed either by
      the addition of energy to the reaction medium in the form of
      thermal, mechanical, acoustic and/or electromagnetic energy or by
      means of transferring energy through a physical catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      These methods are traditionally not that energy efficient and can
      produce, for example, either unwanted by-products, decomposition
      of required transients, and/or intermediates and/or activated
      complexes and/or insufficient quantities of preferred products of
      a reaction.<br>
      <br>
      It has been generally believed that chemical reactions occur as a
      result of collisions between reacting molecules. In terms of the
      collision theory of chemical kinetics, it has been expected that
      the rate of a reaction is directly proportional to the number of
      the molecular collisions per second: rate a number of
      collisions/sec<br>
      This simple relationship explains the dependence of reaction rates
      on concentration.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, with few exceptions, reaction rates have been
      believed to increase with increasing temperature because of
      increased collisions.<br>
      <br>
      The dependence of the rate constant k of a reaction can be
      expressed by the following equation, known as the Arrhenius
      equation: -Ea/RT where Ea is the activation energy of the reaction
      which is the minimum amount of energy required to initiate a
      chemical reaction, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute
      temperature and e is the base of the natural logarithm scale. The
      quantity A represents the collision rate and shows that the rate
      constant is directly proportional to A and, therefore, to the
      collision rate. Furthermore, because of the minus sign associated
      with the exponent EaART, the rate constant decreases with
      increasing activation energy and increases with increasing
      temperature.<br>
      <br>
      Normally, only a small fraction of the colliding molecules,
      typically the fastestmoving ones, have enough kinetic energy to
      exceed the activation energy, therefore, the increase in the rate
      constant k can now be explained with the temperature increase.
      Since more high-energy molecules are present at a higher
      temperature, the rate of product formation is also greater at the
      higher temperature. But, with increased temperatures there are a
      number of problems which are introduced into the reaction system.
      With thermal excitation other competing processes, such as bond
      rupture, may occur before the desired energy state can be reached.
      Also, there are a number of decomposition products which often
      produce fragments that are extremely reactive, but they can be so
      short-lived because of their thermodynamic instability, that a
      preferred reaction may be dampened.<br>
      <br>
      Radiant or light energy is another form of energy that may be
      added to the reaction medium that also may have negative side
      effects but which may be different from (or the same as) those
      side effects from thermal energy. Addition of radiant energy to a
      system produces electronically excited molecules that are capable
      of undergoing chemical reactions.<br>
      <br>
      A molecule in which all the electrons are in stable orbitals is
      said to be in the ground electronic state. These orbitals may be
      either bonding or non-bonding. If a photon of the proper energy
      collides with the molecule the photon may be absorbed and one of
      the electrons may be promoted to an unoccupied orbital of higher
      energy. Electronic excitation results in spatial redistribution of
      the valence electrons with concomitant changes in internuclear
      configurations. Since chemical reactions are controlled to a great
      extent by these factors, an electronically excited molecule
      undergoes a chemical reaction that may be distinctly different
      from those of its ground-state counterpart.<br>
      <br>
      The energy of a photon is defined in terms of its frequency or
      wavelength,<br>
      E = hv = hc/k where E is energy ; h is Plank's constant, 6.6 x
      10-34 J-sec ; v is the frequency of the radiation, sec 1 ; c is
      the speed of light; and X is the wavelength of the radiation. When
      a photon is absorbed, all of its energy is imparted to the
      absorbing species. The primary act following absorption depends on
      the wavelength of the incident light. Photochemistry studies
      photons whose energies lie in the ultraviolet region (100-4000 A)
      and in the visible region (40007000A) of the electromagnetic
      spectrum. Such photons are primarily a cause of electronically
      excited molecules.<br>
      <br>
      Since the molecules are imbued with electronic energy upon
      absorption of light, reactions occur from different
      potential-energy surfaces from those encountered in thermally
      excited systems. However, there are several drawbacks of using the
      known techniques of photochemistry, that being, utilizing a broad
      band of frequencies thereby causing unwanted side reactions, undue
      experimentation, and poor quantum yield. Some good examples of
      photochemistry are shown in the following patents.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, U. S. Patent No. 5,174,877 issued to Cooper, et.
      al., (1992) discloses an apparatus for the photocatalytic
      treatment of liquids. In particular, it is disclosed that
      ultraviolet light irradiates the surface of a prepared slurry to
      activate the photocatalytic properties of the particles contained
      in the slurry. The transparency of the slurry affects, for
      example, absorption of radiation. Moreover, discussions of
      different frequencies suitable for achieving desirable
      photocatalytic activity are disclosed.<br>
      <br>
      Further, U. S. Patent No. 4,755,269 issued to Brumer, et. al.,
      (1998) discloses a photodisassociation process for disassociating
      various molecules in a known energy level. In particular, it is
      disclosed that different disassociation pathways are possible and
      the different pathways can be followed due to selecting different
      frequencies of certain electromagnetic radiation. It is further
      disclosed that the amplitude of electromagnetic radiation applied
      corresponds to amounts of product produced.<br>
      <br>
      Selective excitation of different species is shown in the
      following three (3) patents.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, U. S. Patent No. 4,012,301 to Rich, et. al., (1977)
      discloses vapor phase chemical reactions that are selectively
      excited by using vibrational modes corresponding to the
      continuously flowing reactant species. Particularly, a continuous
      wave laser emits radiation that is absorbed by the vibrational
      mode of the reactant species.<br>
      <br>
      U. S. Patent No. 5,215,634 issued to Wan, et al., (1993) discloses
      a process of selectively converting methane to a desired
      oxygenate. In particular, methane is irradiated in the presence of
      a catalyst with pulsed microwave radiation to convert reactants to
      desirable products. The physical catalyst disclosed comprises
      nickel and the microwave radiation is applied in the range of
      about 1.5 to 3.0 GHz.<br>
      <br>
      U. S. Patent No. 5,015,349 issued to Suib, et. al., (1991)
      discloses a method for cracking a hydrocarbon to create cracked
      reaction products. It is disclosed that a stream of hydrocarbon is
      exposed to a microwave energy which creates a low power density
      microwave discharge plasma, wherein the microwave energy is
      adjusted to achieve desired results. A particular frequency
      desired of microwave energy is disclosed as being 2.45 GHz.<br>
      <br>
      Physical catalysts are well known in the art. Specifically, a
      physical catalyst is a substance which alters the reaction rate of
      a chemical reaction without appearing in the end product. It is
      known that some reactions can be speeded up or controlled by the
      presence of substances which themselves appear to remain unchanged
      after the reaction has ended. By increasing the velocity of a
      desired reaction relative to unwanted reactions, the formation of
      a desired product can be maximized compared with unwanted
      by-products. Often only a trace of physical catalyst is necessary
      to accelerate the reaction. Also, it has been observed that some
      substances, which if added in trace amounts, can slow down the
      rate of a reaction. This looks like the reverse of catalysis, and,
      in fact, substances which slow down a reaction rate have been
      called negative catalysts or poisons. Known physical catalysts go
      through a cycle in which they are used and regenerated so that
      they can be used again and again. A physical catalyst operates by
      providing another path for the reaction which can have a higher
      reaction rate or slower rate than available in the absence of the
      physical catalyst. At the end of the reaction, because the
      physical catalyst can be recovered, it appears the physical
      catalyst is not involved in the reaction. But, the physical
      catalyst must somehow take part in the reaction, or else the rate
      of the reaction would not change. The catalytic act has
      historically been represented by five essential steps originally
      postulated by Ostwald around the late 1800's: 1. Diffusion to the
      catalytic site (reactant);<br>
      2. Bond formation at the catalytic site (reactant) ;<br>
      3. Reaction of the catalyst-reactant complex;<br>
      4. Bond rupture at the catalytic site (product); and<br>
      5. Diffusion away from the catalytic site (product).<br>
      <br>
      The exact mechanisms of catalytic actions are unknown in the art
      but it is known that physical catalysts can speed up a reaction
      that otherwise would take place too slowly to be practical.<br>
      <br>
      There are a number of problems involved with known industrial
      catalysts: firstly, physical catalysts can not only lose their
      efficiency but also their selectivity, which can occur due to, for
      example, overheating or contamination of the catalyst; secondly,
      many physical catalysts include costly metals such as platinum or
      silver and have only a limited life span, some are difficult to
      rejuvenate, and the precious metals not easily reclaimed. There
      are numerous physical limitations associated with physical
      catalysts which render them less than ideal participants in many
      reactions.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, what is needed is an understanding of the catalytic
      process so that biological processing, chemical processing,
      industrial processing, etc., can be engineered by more precisely
      controlling the multitude of reaction processes that currently
      exist, as well as developing completely new reaction pathways
      and/or reaction products. Examples of such understandings include
      methods to catalyze reactions without the drawbacks of : (1) known
      physical catalysts; and (2) utilizing energy with much greater
      specificity than the prior art teachings which utilize less than
      ideal thermal and electromagnetic radiation methods and which
      result in numerous inefficiencies.<br>

      This invention overcomes many of the deficiencies associated with
      the use of various known physical catalysts in a variety of
      different environments. More importantly, this invention, for the
      first time ever, discloses a variety of novel spectral energy
      techniques, referred to sometimes herein as spectral chemistry,
      that can be utilized in a number of reactions, including very
      basic reactions, which may be desirable to achieve or to permit to
      occur in a virtually unlimited number of areas. These spectral
      energy techniques can be used in, for example, any types of
      biological reactions (i. e., plant and animal), physical
      reactions, chemical reactions (i. e., organic or inorganic)
      industrial (i. e., any industrial reactions of large scale or
      small scale), and/or energy reactions of any type, etc.<br>
      <br>
      These novel spectral energy techniques (now referred to as
      spectral chemistry) are possible to achieve due to the fundamental
      discoveries contained herein that disclose various means for
      achieving the transfer of energy between, for example, two
      entities. The invention teaches that the key for transferring
      energy between two entities (e. g., one entity sharing energy with
      another entity) is that when frequencies match, energy transfers.
      For example, matching of frequencies of spectral energy patterns
      of two different forms of matter; or matching of frequencies of a
      spectral energy pattern of matter with energy in the form of a
      spectral energy catalyst. The entities may both be comprised of
      matter (solids, liquids, gases and/or plasmas and/or mixtures
      and/or components thereof), both comprised of various form (s) of
      energy, or one comprised of various form (s) of energy and the
      other comprised of matter (solids, liquids, gases and/or plasmas
      and/or mixtures and/or components thereof).<br>
      <br>
      More specifically, all matter can be represented by spectral
      energy patterns, which can be quite simple to very complex in
      appearance, depending on, for example, the complexity of the
      matter. One example of a spectral energy pattern is a spectral
      pattern which likewise can be quite simple to quite complex in
      appearance, depending on, for example, the complexity of the
      matter. In the case of matter represented by spectral patterns,
      matter can exchange energy with other matter if, for example, the
      spectral patterns of the two forms of matter match, at least
      partially, or can be made to match or overlap, at least partially
      (e. g., spectral curves or spectral patterns comprising one or
      more electromagnetic frequencies may overlap with each other). In
      general, but not in all cases, the greater the overlap in spectral
      patterns (and thus, the greater the overlap of frequencies
      comprising the spectral patterns), the greater the amount of
      energy transferred. Likewise, for example, if the spectral pattern
      of at least one form of energy can be caused to match or overlap,
      at least partially, with the spectral pattern of matter, energy
      will also transfer to the matter. Thus, energy can be transferred
      to matter by causing frequencies to match.<br>
      <br>
      As discussed elsewhere herein, energy (E), frequency (v) and
      wavelength (X) and the speed of light (c) in a vacuum are
      interrelated through, for example, the following equation:
      E=hv=helk<br>
      When a frequency or set of frequencies corresponding to at least a
      first form of matter can be caused to match with a frequency or
      set of frequencies corresponding to at least a second form of
      matter, energy can transfer between the different forms of matter
      and permit at least some interaction and/or reaction to occur
      involving at least one of the two different forms of matter. For
      example, solid, liquid, gas and/or plasma (and/or mixtures and/or
      portions thereof) forms of matter can interact and/or react and
      form a desirable reaction product or result. Any combination (s)
      of the above forms of matter (e. g., solid/solid, solid/liquid,
      solid/gas, solid/plasma, solid/gas/plasma, solid/liquid/gas, etc.,
      and/or mixtures and/or portions thereof) are possible to achieve
      for desirable interactions and/or reactions to occur.<br>
      <br>
      Further, matter (e. g., solids, liquids, gases and/or plasmas
      and/or mixtures and/or portions thereof) can be caused, or
      influenced, to interact and/or react with other matter and/or
      portions thereof in, for example, a reaction system along a
      desired reaction pathway by applying energy, in the form of, for
      example, a catalytic spectral energy pattern, a catalytic spectral
      pattern, a spectral energy pattern, a spectral energy catalyst, a
      spectral pattern, a spectral catalyst, a spectral environmental
      reaction condition and/or combinations thereof, which can
      collectively result in an applied spectral energy pattern.<br>
      <br>
      In these cases, interactions and/or reactions may be caused to
      occur when the applied spectral energy pattern results in, for
      example, some type of modification to the spectral energy pattern
      of one or more of the forms of matter in the reaction system. The
      various forms of matter include: reactants; transients;
      intermediates; activated complexes; physical catalysts; reaction
      products; promoters; poisons; solvents; physical catalyst support
      materials; reaction vessels; and/or mixtures of components
      thereof. For example, the applied spectral energy provider (i. e.,
      at least one of spectral energy catalyst; spectral catalyst;
      spectral energy pattern; spectral pattern; catalytic spectral
      energy pattern; catalytic spectral pattern; applied spectral
      energy pattern and spectral environmental reaction conditions)
      when targeted appropriately to, for example, a participant and/or
      component in the reaction system, can result in the generation of,
      and/or desirable interaction with, one or more participants.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, the applied spectral energy provider can be targeted
      to achieve very specific desirable results and/or reaction product
      and/or reaction product at a desired rate. The targeting can occur
      by a direct resonance approach, (i. e., direct resonance
      targeting), a harmonic resonance approach (i. e., harmonic
      targeting) and/or a non-harmonic heterodyne resonance approach (i.
      e., non-harmonic heterodyne targeting). The spectral energy
      provider can be targeted to, for example, interact with at least
      one frequency of an atom or molecule, including, but not limited
      to, electronic frequencies, vibrational frequencies, rotational
      frequencies, rotational-vibrational frequencies, fine splitting
      frequencies, hyperfine splitting frequencies, magnetic field
      induced frequencies, electric field induced frequencies, natural
      oscillating frequencies, and all components and/or portions
      thereof (discussed in greater detail later herein). These
      approaches may result in, for example, the mimicking of at least
      one mechanism of action of a physical catalyst in a reaction
      system. For example, in some cases, desirable results may be
      achieved by utilizing a single applied spectral energy pattern
      targeted to a single participant; while in other cases, more than
      one applied spectral energy pattern may be targeted to a single
      participant or multiple participants, by, for example, multiple
      approaches. Specifically, combinations of direct resonance
      targeting, harmonic targeting and non-harmonic heterodyne
      targeting, which can be made to interact with one or more
      frequencies occurring in atoms and/or molecules, could be used
      sequentially or substantially continuously. Further, in certain
      cases, the spectral energy provider targeting may result in
      various interactions at predominantly the upper energy levels of
      one or more of the various forms of matter present in a reaction
      system.<br>
      <br>
      The invention further recognizes and explains that various
      environmental reaction conditions are capable of influencing
      reaction pathways in a reaction system when using a spectral
      energy catalyst such as a spectral catalyst. The invention teaches
      specific methods for controlling various environmental reaction
      conditions in order to achieve desirable results in a reaction (e.
      g., desirable reaction product (s) in one or more desirable
      reaction pathway (s)) and/or interaction. The invention further
      discloses an applied spectral energy approach which permits the
      simulation, at least partially, of desirable environmental
      reaction conditions by the application of at least one, for
      example, spectral environmental reaction conditions. Thus,
      environmental reaction conditions can be controlled and used in
      combination with at least one spectral energy pattern to achieve a
      desired reaction pathway. Alternatively, traditionally utilized
      environmental reaction conditions can be modified in a desirable
      manner (e. g., application of a reduced temperature and/or reduced
      pressure) by supplementing and/or replacing the traditional
      environmental reaction condition (s) with at least one spectral
      environmental reaction condition.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also provides a method for determining desirable
      physical catalysts (i. e., comprising previously known materials
      or materials not previously known to function as a physical
      catalyst) which can be utilized in a reaction system to achieve a
      desired reaction pathway and/or desired reaction rate. In this
      regard, the invention may be able to provide a recipe for a
      physical and/or spectral catalyst for a particular reaction system
      where no physical catalyst previously existed. In this embodiment
      of the invention, spectral energy patterns are determined or
      calculated by the techniques of the invention and corresponding
      physical catalysts can be supplied or manufactured and thereafter
      included in the reaction system to generate the calculated
      required spectral energy patterns. In certain cases, one or more
      existing physical species could be used or combined in a suitable
      manner, if a single physical species was deemed to be
      insufficient, to obtain the appropriate calculated spectral energy
      pattern to achieve a desired reaction pathway and/or desired
      reaction rate. Such catalysts can be used alone, in combination
      with other physical catalysts, spectral energy catalysts,
      controlled environmental reaction conditions and/or spectral
      environmental reaction conditions to achieve a desired resultant
      energy pattern and consequent reaction pathway and/or desired
      reaction rate.<br>
      <br>
      The invention discloses many different permutations of the basic
      theme stated throughout namely, that when frequencies match,
      energy transfers. It should be understood that these many
      different permutations can be used alone to achieve desirable
      results (e. g., desired reaction pathways and/or a desired
      reaction rates) or can be used in a limitless combination of
      permutations, to achieve desired results (e. g., desired reaction
      pathways and/or desired reaction rates). However, common to all of
      these seemingly complicated permutations and combinations is the
      basic understanding first provided by this invention that in order
      to control or enable any reaction, so long as frequencies of two
      entities match (e. g., spectral patterns overlap), energy can be
      transferred. If energy is transferred, desirable interactions
      and/or reactions can result.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, this concept can also be used in the reverse.
      Specifically, if a reaction is occurring because frequencies
      match, the reaction can be slowed or stopped by causing the
      frequencies to no longer match or at least match to a lesser
      degree. In this regard, one or more reaction system components (e.
      g., environmental reaction condition, spectral environmental
      reaction condition and/or an applied spectral energy pattern) can
      be modified and/or applied so as to minimize, reduce or eliminate
      frequencies from matching. This also permits reactions to be
      started and stopped with ease providing for novel control in a
      myriad of reactions.<br>
      <br>
      To simplify the disclosure and understanding of the invention,
      specific categories or sections have been created in the"Summary
      of the Invention"and in the"Detailed<br>
      Description of the Preferred Embodiments". However, it should be
      understood that these categories are not mutually exclusive and
      that some overlap exists. Accordingly, these artificially created
      sections should not be used in an effort to limit the scope of the
      invention defined in the appended claims.<br>
      <br>
      <b> 1. WAVE ENERGIES</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b>In general, thermal energy has traditionally been
      used to drive chemical reactions by applying heat and increasing
      the temperature of a reaction system. The addition of heat
      increases the kinetic (motion) energy of the chemical reactants.
      It has been believed that a reactant with more kinetic energy
      moves faster and farther, and is more likely to take part in a
      chemical reaction. Mechanical energy likewise, by stirring and
      moving the chemicals, increases their kinetic energy and thus
      their reactivity. The addition of mechanical energy often
      increases temperature, by increasing kinetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      Acoustic energy is applied to chemical reactions as orderly
      mechanical waves.<br>
      <br>
      Because of its mechanical nature, acoustic energy can increase the
      kinetic energy of chemical reactants, and can also elevate their
      temperature (s). Electromagnetic (EM) energy consists of waves of
      electric and magnetic fields. EM energy may also increase the
      kinetic energy and heat in reaction systems. It also may energize
      electronic orbitals or vibrational motion in some reactions.<br>
      <br>
      Both acoustic and electromagnetic energy consist of waves. Energy
      waves and frequency have some interesting properties, and may be
      combined in some interesting ways.<br>
      <br>
      The manner in which wave energy transfers and combines, depends
      largely on the frequency.<br>
      <br>
      For example, when two waves of energy, each having the same
      amplitude, but one at a frequency of 400 Hz and the other at 100
      Hz are caused to interact, the waves will combine and their
      frequencies will add, to produce a new frequency of 500 Hz (i. e.,
      the"sum" frequency). The frequency of the waves will also subtract
      when they combine to produce a frequency of 300 Hz (i. e.,
      the"difference"frequency). All wave energies typically add and
      subtract in this manner, and such adding and subtracting is
      referred to as heterodyning.<br>
      <br>
      Common results of heterodyning are familiar to most as harmonics
      in music. The importance of heterodyning will be discussed in
      greater detail later herein.<br>
      <br>
      Another concept important to the invention is wave interactions or
      interference. In particular, wave energies are known to interact
      constructively and destructively. This phenomena is important in
      determining the applied spectral energy pattern. Figures la-lc
      show two different incident sine waves 1 (Figure la) and 2 (Figure
      lb) which correspond to two different spectral energy patterns
      having two different wavelengths B1 and 2 (and thus different
      frequencies) which could be applied to a reaction system. Assume
      arguendo that the energy pattern of Figure 1 a corresponds to an
      electromagnetic spectral pattern and that Figure lb corresponds to
      one spectral environmental reaction condition. Each of the sine
      waves 1 and 2 has a different differential equation which
      describes its individual motion. However, when the sine waves are
      combined into the resultant additive wave 1 + 2 (Figure l c), the
      resulting complex differential equation, which describes the
      totality of the combined energies (i. e., the applied spectral
      energy pattern) actually results in certain of the input energies
      being high (i. e., constructive interference shown by a higher
      amplitude) at certain points in time, as well as being low (i. e.,
      destructive interference shown by a lower amplitude) at certain
      points in time.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, the portions"X"represent areas where the
      electromagnetic spectral pattern of wave 1 has constructively
      interfered with the spectral environmental reaction condition wave
      2, whereas the portions"Y"represent areas where the two waves 1
      and 2 have destructively interfered. Depending upon whether the
      portions"X"corresponds to desirable or undesirable wavelengths,
      frequencies or energies (e. g., causing the applied spectral
      energy pattern to have positive or negative interactions with, for
      example, one or more participants and/or components in the
      reaction system), then the portions"X"could enhance a positive
      effect in the reaction system or could enhance a negative effect
      in the reaction system. Similarly, depending on whether the
      portions"Y"correspond to desirable or undesirable wavelengths,
      frequencies, or energies, then the portions"Y"may correspond to
      the effective loss of either a positive or negative effect.<br>
      <br>
      It should be clear from this particular analysis that constructive
      interferences (i. e., the points"X") could, for example, maximize
      both positive and negative effects in a reaction system.
      Accordingly, this simplified example shows that by combining, for
      example, certain frequencies from a spectral pattern with one or
      more other frequencies from, for example, at least one spectral
      environmental reaction condition, that the applied spectral energy
      pattern that is actually applied to the reaction system can be a
      combination of constructive and destructive interference (s).
      Accordingly, these factors should also be taken into account when
      choosing appropriate spectral energy patterns that are to be
      applied to a reaction system. In this regard, it is noted that in
      practice many desirable incident wavelengths can be applied to a
      reaction system. Moreover, it should also be clear that wave
      interaction effects include, but are not limited to, heterodyning,
      direct resonance, indirect resonance, additive waves, subtractive
      waves, constructive or destructive interference, etc. Further, as
      discussed in detail later herein, additional effects such as
      electric effects and/or magnetic field effects can also influence
      spectral energy patterns (e. g., spectral patterns).<br>
      <br>
      <b>II. SPECTRAL CATALYSTS AND SPECTROSCOPY</b><br>
      A wide variety of reactions can be advantageously affected and
      directed with the assistance of a spectral energy catalyst having
      a specific spectral energy pattern (e. g., spectral pattern or
      electromagnetic pattern) which transfers a predetermined quanta of
      targeted energy to initiate, control and/or promote desirable
      reaction pathways and/or desirable reaction rates within a
      reaction system. This section discusses spectral catalysts in more
      detail and explains various techniques for using spectral
      catalysts in reaction systems. For example, a spectral catalyst
      can be used in a reaction system to replace and provide the
      additional energy normally supplied by a physical catalyst. The
      spectral catalyst can actually mimic or copy the mechanisms of
      action of a physical catalyst. The spectral catalyst can act as
      both a positive catalyst to increase the rate of a reaction or as
      a negative catalyst or poison to decrease the rate of reaction.
      Furthermore, the spectral catalyst can augment a physical catalyst
      by utilizing both a physical catalyst and a spectral catalyst in a
      reaction system. The spectral catalyst can improve the activity of
      a physical chemical catalyst. Also, the spectral catalyst can
      partially replace a specific quantity or amount of the physical
      catalyst, thereby reducing the high cost of physical catalysts in
      many industrial reactions.<br>
      <br>
      In the present invention, the spectral energy catalyst provides
      targeted energy (e. g., electromagnetic radiation comprising a
      specific frequency or combination of frequencies), in a sufficient
      amount for a sufficient duration to initiate and/or promote and/or
      direct a chemical reaction (e. g., follow a particular reaction
      pathway). The total combination of targeted energy applied at any
      point in time to the reaction system is referred to as the applied
      spectral energy pattern. The applied spectral energy pattern may
      be comprised of a single spectral catalyst, multiple spectral
      catalysts and/or other spectral energy catalysts as well.<br>
      <br>
      With the absorption of targeted energy into a reaction system (e.
      g., electromagnetic energy from a spectral catalyst), a reactant
      may be caused to proceed through one or several reaction pathways
      including: energy transfer which can, for example, excite
      electrons to higher energy states for initiation of chemical
      reaction, by causing frequencies to match; ionize or dissociate
      reactants which may participate in a chemical reaction; stabilize
      reaction products; energize and/or stabilize intermediates and/or
      transients and/or activated complexes that participate in a
      reaction pathway ; and/or cause one or more components in a
      reaction system to have spectral patterns which at least partially
      overlap.<br>
      <br>
      For example, in a simple reaction system, if a chemical reaction
      provides for at least one reactant"A"to be converted into at least
      one reaction product"B", a physical catalyst "C"may be utilized.
      In contrast, a portion of the catalytic spectral energy pattern
      (e. g., in this section the catalytic spectral pattern) of the
      physical catalyst"C"may be applied in the form of, for example, an
      electromagnetic beam to catalyze the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      C<br>
      A~B<br>
      Substances A and B = unknown frequencies, and C = 30 Hz;<br>
      Therefore, Substance A + 30 HZ- Substance B<br>
      In the present invention, for example, the spectral pattern (e.
      g., electromagnetic spectral pattern) of the physical
      catalyst"C"can be determined by known methods of spectroscopy.
      Utilizing spectroscopic instrumentation, the spectral pattern of
      the physical catalyst is preferably determined under conditions
      approximating those occurring in the reaction system using the
      physical catalyst (e. g., spectral energy patterns as well as
      spectral patterns can be influenced by environmental reaction
      conditions, as discussed later herein).<br>
      <br>
      Spectroscopy is a process in which the energy differences between
      allowed states of any system are measured by determining the
      frequencies of the corresponding electromagnetic energy which is
      either being absorbed or emitted. Spectroscopy in general deals
      with the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter.
      When photons interact with, for example, atoms or molecules,
      changes in the properties of atoms and molecules are observed.<br>
      <br>
      Atoms and molecules are associated with several different types of
      motion. The entire molecule rotates, the bonds vibrate, and even
      the electrons move, albeit so rapidly that electron density
      distributions have historically been the primary focus of the
      prior art. Each of these kinds of motion is quantified. That is,
      the atom, molecule or ion can exist only in distinct states that
      correspond to discrete energy amounts. The energy difference
      between the different quantum states depends on the type of motion
      involved. Thus, the frequency of energy required to bring about a
      transition is different for the different types of motion. That
      is, each type of motion corresponds to the absorption of energy in
      different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum and different
      spectroscopic instrumentation may be required for each spectral
      region. The total motion energy of an atom or molecule may be
      considered to be at least the sum of its electronic, vibrational
      and rotational energies.<br>
      <br>
      In both emission and absorption spectra, the relation between the
      energy change in the atom or molecule and the frequency of the
      electromagnetic energy emitted or absorbed is given by the
      so-called Bohr frequency condition:<br>
      JE = hv where h is Planck's constant; v is the frequency ; and dE,
      is the difference of energies in the final and initial states.<br>
      <br>
      Electronic spectra are the result of electrons moving from one
      electronic energy level to another in an atom, molecule or ion. A
      molecular physical catalyst's spectral pattern includes not only
      electronic energy transitions but also may involve transitions
      between rotational and vibrational energy levels. As a result, the
      spectra of molecules are much more complicated than those of
      atoms. The main changes observed in the atoms or molecules after
      interaction with photons include excitation, ionization and/or
      rupture of chemical bonds, all of which may be measured and
      quantified by spectroscopic methods including emission or
      absorption spectroscopy which give the same information about
      energy level separation.<br>
      <br>
      In emission spectroscopy, when an atom or molecule is subjected to
      a flame or an electric discharge, such atoms or molecules may
      absorb energy and become"excited."On their return to
      their"normal"state they may emit radiation. Such an emission is
      the result of a transition of the atom or molecule from a high
      energy or"excited"state to one of lower state. The energy lost in
      the transition is emitted in the form of electromagnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      "Excited"atoms usually produce line spectra
      while"excited"molecules tend to produce band spectra.<br>
      <br>
      In absorption spectroscopy, the absorption of nearly monochromatic
      incident radiation is monitored as it is swept over a range of
      frequencies. During the absorption process the atoms or molecules
      pass from a state of low energy to one of high energy. Energy
      changes produced by electromagnetic energy absorption occur only
      in integral multiples of a unit amount of energy called a quantum,
      which is characteristic of each absorbing species.<br>
      <br>
      Absorption spectra may be classified into four types: rotational;
      rotation-vibration ; vibrational ; and electronic.<br>
      <br>
      The rotational spectrum of a molecule is associated with changes
      which occur in the rotational states of the molecule. The energies
      of the rotational states differ only by a relatively small amount,
      and hence, the frequency which is necessary to effect a change in
      the rotational levels is very low and the wavelength of
      electromagnetic energy is very large. The energy spacing of
      molecular rotational states depends on bond distances and angles.
      Pure rotational spectra are observed in the far infrared and
      microwave and radio regions (See<br>
      Table 1).<br>
      <br>
      Rotation-vibrational spectra are associated with transitions in
      which the vibrational states of the molecule are altered and may
      be accompanied by changes in rotational states.<br>
      <br>
      Absorption occurs at higher frequencies or shorter wavelength and
      usually occurs in the middle of the infrared region (See Table 1).<br>
      <br>
      Vibrational spectra from different vibrational energy levels occur
      because of motion of bonds. A stretching vibration involves a
      change in the interatomic distance along the axis of the bond
      between two atoms. Bending vibrations are characterized by a
      change in the angle between two bonds. The vibrational spectra of
      a molecule are typically in the nearinfrared range.<br>
      <br>
      Electronic spectra are from transitions between electronic states
      for atoms and molecules and are accompanied by simultaneous
      changes in the rotational and vibrational states in molecules.
      Relatively large energy differences are involved, and hence
      absorption occurs at rather large frequencies or relatively short
      wavelengths. Different electronic states of atoms or molecules
      correspond to energies in the infrared, ultraviolet-visible or
      x-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum (See Table 1).<br>

      Electromagnetic radiation as a form of energy can be absorbed or
      emitted, and therefore many different types of spectroscopy may be
      used in the present invention to determine a desired spectral
      pattern of a spectral catalyst (e. g., a spectral pattern of a
      physical catalyst) including, but not limited to, x-ray,
      ultraviolet, infrared, microwave, atomic absorption, flame
      emissions, atomic emissions, inductively coupled plasma, DC argon
      plasma, arc-source emission, spark-source emission,
      high-resolution laser, radio, Raman and the like.<br>
      <br>
      In order to study the electronic transitions, the material to be
      studied may need to be heated to a high temperature, such as in a
      flame, where the molecules are atomized and excited. Another very
      effective way of atomizing gases is the use of gaseous discharges.<br>
      <br>
      When a gas is placed between charged electrodes, causing an
      electrical field, electrons are liberated from the electrodes and
      from the gas atoms themselves and may form a plasma or plasma-like
      conditions. These electrons will collide with the gas atoms which
      will be atomized, excited or ionized. By using high frequency
      fields, it is possible to induce gaseous discharges without using
      electrodes. By varying the field strength, the excitation energy
      can be varied. In the case of a solid material, excitation by
      electrical spark or arc can be used. In the spark or arc, the
      material to be analyzed is evaporated and the atoms are excited.<br>
      <br>
      The basic scheme of an emission spectrophotometer includes a
      purified silica cell containing the sample which is to be excited.
      The radiation of the sample passes through a slit and is separated
      into a spectrum by means of a dispersion element. The spectral
      pattern can be detected on a screen, photographic film or by a
      detector.<br>
      <br>
      An atom will most strongly absorb electromagnetic energy at the
      same frequencies it emits. Measurements of absorption are often
      made so that electromagnetic radiation that is emitted from a
      source passes through a wavelength-limiting device, and impinges
      upon the physical catalyst sample that is held in a cell. When a
      beam of white light passes through a material, selected
      frequencies from the beam are absorbed. The electromagnetic
      radiation that is not absorbed by the physical catalyst passes
      through the cell and strikes a detector.<br>
      <br>
      When the remaining beam is spread out in a spectrum, the
      frequencies that were absorbed show up as dark lines in the
      otherwise continuous spectrum. The position of these dark lines
      correspond exactly to the positions of lines in an emission
      spectrum of the same molecule or atom. Both emission and
      absorption spectrophotometers are available through regular
      commercial channels.<br>
      <br>
      In 1885, Balmer discovered that hydrogen vibrates and produces
      energy at frequencies in the visible light region of the
      electromagnetic spectrum which can be expressed by a simple
      formula: 1/k = R (1/22-l/m2) when X is the wavelength of the
      light, R is Rydberg's constant and m is an integer greater than or
      equal to 3 (e. g., 3,4, or 5, etc.). Subsequently, Rydberg
      discovered that this equation could be adapted to result in all
      the wavelengths in the hydrogen spectrum by changing the 1/22 to
      1/n2, as in, 1/k = R (l/n2-l/m2) where n is an integer &gt; 1, and
      m is an integer &gt; n+1. Thus, for every different number n, the
      result is a series of numbers for wavelength, and the names of
      various scientists were assigned to each such series which
      resulted. For instance, when n=2 and m &gt; 3, the energy is in
      the visible light spectrum and the series is referred to as the
      Balmer series. The Lyman series is in the ultraviolet spectrum
      with n = 1, and the Paschen series is in the infrared spectrum
      with n = 3.<br>
      <br>
      In the prior art, energy level diagrams were the primary means
      used to describe energy levels in the hydrogen atom (see Figures
      7a and 7b).<br>
      <br>
      After determining the electromagnetic spectral pattern of a
      desired catalyst (e. g., a physical catalyst), the catalytic
      spectral pattern may be duplicated, at least partially, and
      applied to the reaction system. Any generator of one or more
      frequencies within an acceptable approximate range of, for
      example, frequencies of electromagnetic radiation may be used in
      the present invention. When duplicating one or more frequencies
      of, for example, a spectral pattern, it is not necessary to
      duplicate the frequency exactly. For instance, the effect achieved
      by a frequency of 1,000 THz, can also be achieved by a frequency
      very close to it, such as 1,001 or 999 THz. Thus, there will be a
      range above and below each exact frequency which will also
      catalyze a reaction. Specifically, Figure 12 shows a typical
      bellcurve"B"distribution of frequencies around the desired
      frequency to, wherein desirable frequencies can be applied which
      do not correspond exactly to fo, but are close enough to the
      frequency to to achieve a desired effect, such as those
      frequencies between and including the frequencies within the range
      of fi and f2. Note that fi and f2 correspond to about one half the
      maximum amplitude, amax, of the curve"B". Thus, whenever the
      term"exact"or specific reference to"frequency"or the like is used,
      it should be understood to have this meaning. In addition,
      harmonics of spectral catalyst frequencies, both above and below
      the exact spectral catalyst frequency, will cause sympathetic
      resonance with the exact frequency and will catalyze the reaction.
      Finally, it is possible to catalyze reactions by duplicating one
      or more of the mechanisms of action of the exact frequency, rather
      than using the exact frequency itself. For example, platinum
      catalyzes the formation of water from hydrogen and oxygen, in
      part, by energizing the hydroxyl radical at its frequency of
      roughly 1,060 THz. The reaction can also be catalyzed by
      energizing the hydroxy radical with its microwave frequency,
      thereby duplicating platinum's mechanism of action.<br>
      <br>
      An electromagnetic radiation emitting source should have the
      following characteristics: high intensity of the desired
      wavelengths; long life; stability; and the ability to emit the
      electromagnetic energy in a pulsed and/or continuous mode.<br>
      <br>
      Irradiating sources can include, but are not limited to, arc
      lamps, such as xenon-arc, hydrogen and deuterium, krypton-arc,
      high-pressure mercury, platinum, silver; plasma arcs, discharge
      lamps, such as As, Bi, Cd, Cs, Ge, Hg, K, P, Pb, Rb, Sb, Se, Sn,
      Ti, Tl and Zn; hollow-cathode lamps, either single or multiple
      elements such as Cu, Pt, and Ag; and sunlight and coherent
      electromagnetic energy emissions, such as masers and lasers.<br>
      <br>
      Masers are devices which amplify or generate electromagnetic
      energy waves with great stability and accuracy. Masers operate on
      the same principal as lasers, but produce electro-magnetic energy
      in the radio and microwave, rather than visible range of the
      spectrum. In masers, the electromagnetic energy is produced by the
      transition of molecules between rotational energy levels.<br>
      <br>
      Lasers are powerful coherent photon sources that produce a beam of
      photons having the same frequency, phase and direction, that is, a
      beam of photons that travel exactly alike.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, for example, the predetermined spectral pattern of a
      desired catalyst can be generated by a series or grouping of
      lasers producing one or more required frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      Any laser capable of emitting the necessary electromagnetic
      radiation with a frequency or frequencies of the spectral catalyst
      may be used in the present invention. Lasers are available for use
      throughout much of the spectral range. They can be operated in
      either a continuous or a pulsed mode. Lasers that emit lines and
      lasers that emit a continuum may be used in the present invention.
      Line sources may include argon ion laser, ruby laser, the nitrogen
      laser, the Nd : YAG laser, the carbon dioxide laser, the carbon
      monoxide laser and the nitrous oxide-carbon dioxide laser. Tn
      addition to the snectrat neR thst prP emie-2 hl rq can be tuned to
      various frequency ranges, thereby providing several different
      frequencies from one instrument and applying them to the reaction
      system (See Examples in Table 2).<br>

      The coherent light from a single laser or a series of lasers is
      simply brought to focus or introduced to the region where a
      desired reaction is to take place. The light source should be
      close enough to avoid a"dead space"in which the light does not
      reach the reaction system, but far enough apart to assure complete
      incident-light absorption. Since ultraviolet sources generate
      heat, such sources may need to be cooled to maintain efficient
      operation. Irradiation time, causing excitation of the reaction
      system, may be individually tailored for each reaction: some
      short-term for a continuous reaction with large surface exposure
      to the light source ; or long light-contact time for other
      systems.<br>
      <br>
      An object of this invention is to provide a spectral energy
      pattern (e. g., a spectral pattern of electromagnetic energy) to
      the reaction system by applying at least a portion of (or
      substantially all of) a required spectral energy catalyst (e. g.,
      a spectral catalyst) determined and calculated by, for example,
      waveform analysis of the spectral patterns of, for example, the
      reactant (s) and the reaction product (s). Accordingly, in the
      case of a spectral catalyst, a calculated electromagnetic pattern
      will be a spectral pattern or will act as a spectral catalyst to
      generate a preferred reaction pathway and/or preferred reaction
      rate. In basic terms, spectroscopic data for identified substances
      can be used to perform a simple waveform calculation to arrive at,
      for example, the correct electromagnetic energy frequency, or
      combination of frequencies, needed to catalyze a reaction. In
      simple terms,<br>
      Au B<br>
      Substance A = 50 Hz, and Substance B = 80 Hz<br>
      80 Hz-50 Hz = 30 Hz:<br>
      Therefore, Substance A + 30 Hz o Substance B.<br>
      <br>
      The spectral energy pattern (e. g., spectral patterns) of both the
      reactant (s) and reaction product (s) can be determined. In the
      case of a spectral catalyst, this can be accomplished by the
      spectroscopic means mentioned earlier. Once the spectral patterns
      are determined (e. g., having a specific frequency or combination
      of frequencies) within an appropriate set of environmental
      reaction conditions, the spectral energy pattern (s) (e. g.,
      electromagnetic spectral pattern (s)) of the spectral energy
      catalyst (e. g., spectral catalyst) can be determined.<br>
      <br>
      Using the spectral energy pattern (s) (e. g., spectral patterns)
      of the reactant (s) and reaction product (s), a waveform analysis
      calculation can determine the energy difference between the
      reactant (s) and reaction product (s) and at least a portion of
      the calculated spectral energy pattern (e. g., electromagnetic
      spectral pattern) in the form of a spectral energy pattern (e. g.,
      a spectral pattern) of a spectral energy catalyst (e. g., a
      spectral catalyst) can be applied to the reaction system to cause
      the reaction system to follow along the desired reaction pathway.<br>
      <br>
      The specific frequency or frequencies of the calculated spectral
      energy pattern (e. g., spectral pattern) corresponding to the
      spectral energy catalyst (e. g., spectral catalyst) will provide
      the necessary energy input into the reaction system to affect and
      initiate a desired reaction pathway.<br>
      <br>
      Performing the waveform analysis calculation to arrive at, for
      example, the correct electromagnetic energy frequency or
      frequencies can be accomplished by using complex algebra, Fourier
      transformation or Wavelet Transforms, which is available through
      commercial channels under the trademark Mathematical and supplied
      by Wolfram, Co. It should be noted that only a portion of a
      calculated spectral energy catalyst (e. g., spectral catalyst) may
      be sufficient to catalyze a reaction or a substantially complete
      spectral energy catalyst (e. g., spectral catalyst) may be applied
      depending on the particular circumstances.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, at least a portion of the spectral energy pattern (e.
      g., electromagnetic pattern of the required spectral catalyst) may
      be generated and applied to the reaction system by, for example,
      the electromagnetic radiation emitting sources defined and
      explained earlier.<br>
      <br>
      The use of a spectral catalyst may be applicable in many different
      areas of technology ranging from biochemical processes to
      industrial reactions.<br>
      <br>
      The specific physical catalysts that may be replaced or augmented
      in the present invention may include any solid, liquid, gas or
      plasma catalyst, having either homogeneous or heterogeneous
      catalytic activity. A homogeneous physical catalyst is defined as
      a catalyst whose molecules are dispersed in the same phase as the
      reacting chemicals. A heterogeneous physical catalyst is defined
      as one whose molecules are not in the same phase as the reacting
      chemicals. In addition, enzymes which are considered biological
      catalysts are to be included in the present invention. Some
      examples of physical catalysts that may be replaced or augmented
      comprise both elemental and molecular catalysts, including, not
      limited to, metals, such as silver, platinum, nickel, palladium,
      rhodium, ruthenium and iron; semiconducting metal oxides and
      sulfides, such as Ni02, Zn), MgO, Bi203/Mo03, TiO2, SrTiO3, CdS,
      CdSe, SiC, GaP, Wo2 and MgO3 ; copper sulfate ; insulating oxides
      such as Al203, Si02 and MgO ; and Ziegler-Natta catalysts, such as
      titanium tetrachloride, and trialkyaluminum.<br>

      <b>III. TARGETING</b><br>
      The frequency and wave nature of energy has been discussed herein.
      Additionally,<br>
      Section I entitled"Wave Energies"disclosed the concepts of various
      potential interactions between different waves. The general
      concepts of"targeting","direct resonance targeting", "harmonic
      targeting"and"non-harmonic heterodyne targeting" (all defined
      terms herein) build on these and other understandings.<br>
      <br>
      Targeting has been defined generally as the application of a
      spectral energy provider (e. g., spectral energy catalyst,
      spectral catalyst, spectral energy pattern, spectral pattern,
      catalytic spectral energy pattern, catalytic spectral pattern,
      spectral environmental reaction conditions and applied spectral
      energy pattern) to a reaction system. The application of these
      types of energies to a reaction system can result in interaction
      (s) between the applied spectral energy provider (s) and matter
      (including all components thereof) in the reaction system. This
      targeting can result in at least one of direct resonance, harmonic
      resonance, and/or non harmonic heterodyne resonance with at least
      a portion, for example, at least one form of matter in a reaction
      system. In this invention, targeting should be generally
      understood as meaning applying a particular spectral energy
      provider (e. g., a spectral energy pattern) to another entity
      comprising matter (or any component thereof) to achieve a
      particular desired result (e. g., desired reaction product and/or
      desired reaction product at a desired reaction rate). Further, the
      invention provides techniques for achieving such desirable results
      without the production of, for example, undesirable transients,
      intermediates, activated complexes and/or reaction products. In
      this regard, some limited prior art techniques exist which have
      applied certain forms of energies (as previously discussed) to
      reaction systems. These certain forms of energies have been
      limited to direct resonance and harmonic resonance with some
      electronic frequencies and/or vibrational frequencies of some
      reactants. These limited forms of energies used by the prior art
      were due to the fact that the prior art lacked an adequate
      understanding of the spectral energy mechanisms and techniques
      disclosed herein.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, it has often been the case in the prior art that at
      least some undesirable intermediate, transient, activated complex
      and/or reaction product was formed, and/or a less than optimum
      reaction rate for a desired reaction pathway occurred. The present
      invention overcomes the limitations of the prior art by
      specifically targeting, for example, various forms of matter in a
      reaction system (and/or components thereof), with, for example, an
      applied spectral energy pattern. Heretofore, such selective
      targeting of the invention was never disclosed or suggested.
      Specifically, at best, the prior art has been reduced to using
      random, trial and error or feedback-type analyses which, although
      may result in the identification of a single spectral catalyst
      frequency, such approach may be very costly and very
      time-consuming, not to mention potentially unreproducible under a
      slightly different set of reaction conditions. Such trial and
      error techniques for determining appropriate catalysts also have
      the added drawback, that having once identified a particular
      catalyst that works, one is left with no idea of what it means. If
      one wishes to modify the reaction, including simple reactions
      using size and shape, another trial and error analysis becomes
      necessary rather than a simple, quick calculation offered by the
      techniques of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, whenever use of the word"targeting"is made herein, it
      should be understood that targeting does not correspond to
      undisciplined energy bands being applied to a reaction system ;
      but rather to well defined, targeted, applied spectral energy
      patterns, each of which has a particular desirable purpose in, for
      example, a reaction pathway to achieve a desired result and/or a
      desired result at a desired reaction rate.<br>
      <br>
      <b>IV. ENVIRONMENTAL REACTION CONDITIONS</b><br>
      Environmental reaction conditions are important to understand
      because they can influence, positively or negatively, reaction
      pathways in a reaction system. Traditional environmental reaction
      conditions include temperature, pressure, surface area of
      catalysts, catalyst size and shape, solvents, support materials,
      poisons, promoters, concentrations, electromagnetic radiation,
      electric fields, magnetic fields, mechanical forces, acoustic
      fields, reaction vessel size, shape and composition and
      combinations thereof, etc.<br>
      <br>
      The following reaction can be used to discuss the effects of
      environmental reaction conditions which may need to be taken into
      account in order to cause the reaction to proceed along the simple
      reaction pathway shown below. c AB<br>
      Specifically, in some instances, reactant A will not form into
      reaction product B in the presence of any catalyst C unless the
      environmental reaction conditions in the reaction system include
      certain maximum or minimum conditions of environmental reaction
      conditions such as pressure and/or temperature. In this regard,
      many reactions will not occur in the presence of a physical
      catalyst unless the environmental reactions conditions include,
      for example, an elevated temperature and/or an elevated pressure.
      In the present invention, such environmental reaction conditions
      should be taken into consideration when applying a particular
      spectral energy catalyst (e. g., a spectral catalyst). Many
      specifics of the various environmental reaction conditions are
      discussed in greater detail in the Section herein entitled
      "Description of the Preferred Embodiments".<br>
      <br>
      <b>V. SPECTRAL ENVIRONMENTAL REACTION CONDITIONS</b><br>
      If it is known that certain reaction pathways will not occur
      within a reaction system (or not occur at a desirable rate) even
      when a catalyst is present unless, for example, certain minimum or
      maximum environmental reaction conditions are present (e. g., the
      temperature and/or pressure is/are elevated), then an additional
      frequency or combination of frequencies (i. e., an applied
      spectral energy pattern) can be applied to the reaction system. In
      this regard, spectral environmental reaction condition (s), can be
      applied instead of, or to supplement, those environmental reaction
      conditions that are naturally present, or need to be present, in
      order for a desired reaction pathway and/or desired reaction rate
      to be followed. The environmental reaction conditions that can be
      supplemented or replaced with spectral environmental reaction
      conditions include, for example, temperature, pressure, surface
      area of catalysts, catalyst size and shape, solvents, support
      materials, poisons, promoters, concentrations, electric fields,
      magnetic fields, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, a particular frequency or combination of
      frequencies and/or fields that can produce one or more spectral
      environmental reaction conditions can be combined with one or more
      spectral energy catalysts and/or spectral catalysts to generate an
      applied spectral energy pattern. Accordingly, various
      considerations can be taken into account for what particular
      frequency or combination of frequencies and/or fields may be
      desirable to combine with (or replace) various environmental
      reaction conditions, for example.<br>
      <br>
      As an example, in a simple reaction, assume that a first
      reactant"A"has a frequency or simple spectral pattern of 3 THz and
      a second reactant"B"has a frequency or simple spectral pattern of
      7 THz. At room temperature, no reaction occurs. However, when
      reactants A and B are exposed to high temperatures, their
      frequencies, or simple spectral patterns, both shift to 5 THz.
      Since their frequencies match, they transfer energy and a reaction
      occurs. By applying a frequency of 2 THz, at room temperature, the
      applied 2 THz frequency will heterodyne with the 3 THz pattern to
      result in, both 1 Thz and 5 THz heterodyned frequencies; while the
      applied frequency of 2 THz will heterodyne with the spectral
      pattern of 7 THz of reactant"B"and result in heterodyned
      frequencies of 5 THz and 9 THz in reactant"B". Thus, the
      heterodyned frequencies of 5 THz are generated at room temperature
      in each of the reactants"A"and"B". Accordingly, frequencies in
      each of the reactants match and thus energy can transfer between
      the reactants"A"and"B". When the energy can transfer between such
      reactants, all desirable reactions along a reaction pathway may be
      capable of being achieved. However, in certain reactions, only
      some desirable reactions along a reaction pathway are capable of
      being achieved by the application of a singular frequency. In
      these instances, additional frequencies and/or fields may need to
      be applied to result in all desirable steps along a reaction
      pathway being met, including but not limited to, the formation of
      all required reaction intermediates and/or transients.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, by applying a frequency, or combination of frequencies
      and/or fields (i. e., creating an applied spectral energy pattern)
      which corresponds to at least one spectral environmental reaction
      condition, the spectral energy patterns (e. g., spectral patterns
      of, for example, reactant (s), intermediates, transients,
      catalysts, etc.) can be effectively modified which may result in
      broader spectral energy patterns (e. g., broader spectral
      patterns), in some cases, or narrower spectral energy patterns (e.
      g., spectral patterns) in other cases. Such broader or narrower
      spectral energy patterns (e. g., spectral patterns) may correspond
      to a broadening or narrowing of line widths in a spectral energy
      pattern (e. g., a spectral pattern).<br>
      <br>
      As stated throughout herein, when frequencies match, energy
      transfers. In this particular embodiment, frequencies can be
      caused to match by, for example, broadening the spectral pattern
      of one or more participants in a reaction system. For example, as
      discussed in much greater detail later herein, the application of
      temperature to a reaction system typically causes the broadening
      of one or more spectral patterns (e. g., line width broadening)
      of, for example, one or more reactants in the reaction system. It
      is this broadening of spectral patterns that can cause spectral
      patterns of one or more reactants to, for example, overlap. The
      overlapping of the spectral patterns can cause frequencies to
      match, and thus energy to transfer. When energy is transferred,
      reactions can occur. The scope of reactions which occur, include
      all of those reactions along any particular reaction pathway.
      Thus, the broadening of spectral pattern (s) can result in, for
      example, formation of reaction product, formation of and/or
      stimulation and/or stabilization of reaction intermediates and/or
      transients, catalyst frequencies, poisons, promoters, etc. All of
      the environmental reaction conditions that are discussed in detail
      in the section entitled"Detailed Description of the Preferred<br>
      Embodiments"can be at least partially stimulated in a reaction
      system by the application of a spectral environmental reaction
      condition.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, spectral patterns can be caused to become
      non-overlapping by changing, for example, at least one spectral
      environmental reaction condition, and thus changing the applied
      spectral energy pattern. In this instance, energy will not
      transfer (or the rate at which energy transfers can be reduced)
      and reactions will not occur (or the rates of reactions can be
      slowed).<br>
      <br>
      Spectral environmental reaction conditions can be utilized to
      start and/or stop reactions in a reaction pathway. Thus, certain
      reactions can be started, stopped, slowed and/or speeded up by,
      for example, applying different spectral environmental reaction
      conditions at different times during a reaction and/or at
      different intensities. Thus, spectral environmental reaction
      conditions are capable of influencing, positively or negatively,
      reaction pathways and/or reaction rates in a reaction system.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>VI. DESIGNING PHYSICAL AND SPECTRAL CATALYSTS</b><br>
      Moreover, by utilizing the above techniques to design (e. g.,
      calculate or determine) a desirable spectral energy pattern, such
      as a desirable spectral pattern for a spectral energy catalyst (e.
      g., spectral catalyst) rather than applying the spectral energy
      catalyst (e. g., spectral catalyst) per se, for example, the
      designed spectral pattern can be used to design and/or determine
      an optimum physical and/or spectral catalyst that could be used in
      the reaction system. Further, the invention may be able to provide
      a recipe for a physical and/or spectral catalyst for a particular
      reaction system where no catalyst previously existed. For example
      in a reaction where: A-I-B where A = reactant, B = product and I =
      known intermediate, and there is no known catalyst, either a
      physical or spectral catalyst that could be designed which, for
      example, resonates with the intermediate"I", thereby catalyzing
      the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      As a first step, the designed spectral pattern could be compared
      to known spectral patterns for existing materials to determine if
      similarities exist between the designed spectral pattern and
      spectral patterns of known materials. If the designed spectral
      pattern at least partially matches against a spectral pattern of a
      known material, then it is possible to utilize the known material
      as a physical catalyst in a reaction system. In this regard, it
      may be desirable to utilize the known material alone or in
      combination with a spectral energy catalyst and/or a spectral
      catalyst. Still further, it may be possible to utilize
      environmental reaction conditions and/or spectral environmental
      reaction conditions to cause the known material to behave in a
      manner which is even closer to the designed energy pattern or
      spectral pattern.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the application of different spectral energy patterns may
      cause the designed catalyst to behave in different manners, such
      as, for example, encouraging a first reaction pathway with the
      application of a first spectral energy pattern and encouraging a
      second reaction pathway with the application of a second spectral
      energy pattern. Likewise, the changing of one or more
      environmental reaction conditions could have a similar effect.<br>
      <br>
      Further, this designed catalyst has applications in all types of
      reactions including, but not limited to, chemical (organic and
      inorganic), biological, physical, energy, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, in certain cases, one or more physical species
      could be used or combined in a suitable manner, for example,
      physical mixing or by a chemical reaction, to obtain a physical
      catalyst material exhibiting the appropriate designed spectral
      energy pattern (e. g., spectral pattern) to achieve a desired
      reaction pathway. Accordingly, a combination of designed catalyst
      (s) (e. g., a physical catalyst which is known or manufactured
      expressly to function as a physical catalyst), spectral energy
      catalyst (s) and/or spectral catalyst (s) can result in a
      resultant energy pattern (e. g., which in this case can be a
      combination of physical catalyst (s) and/or spectral catalyst (s))
      which is conducive to forming desired reaction product (s) and/or
      following a desired reaction pathway at a desired reaction rate.
      In this regard, various line width broadening and/or narrowing of
      spectral energy pattern (s) and/or spectral pattern (s) may occur
      when the designed catalyst is combined with various spectral
      energy patterns and/or spectral patterns.<br>
      <br>
      It is important to consider the energy interactions between all
      components of the reaction system when calculating or determining
      an appropriate designed catalyst. There will be a particular
      combination of specific energy pattern (s) (e. g., electromagnetic
      energy) that will interact with the designed catalyst to form an
      applied spectral energy pattern. The particular frequencies, for
      example, of electromagnetic radiation that should be caused to be
      applied to a reaction system should be as many of those
      frequencies as possible, when interacting with the frequencies of
      the designed catalyst, that can result in desirable effects to one
      or more participants in the reaction system, while eliminating as
      many of those frequencies as possible which result in undesirable
      effects within the reaction system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>VII. SPECTRAL PHARMACEUTICALS</b><br>
      Many pharmaceutical agents act as catalysts in biochemical
      reactions. While there are several types of exceptions, the
      effects of the preponderance of drugs result from their
      interaction with functional macromolecular components of the host
      organism. Such interaction alters the function of the pertinent
      cellular components and thereby initiates the series of
      biochemical and physiological changes that are characteristic of
      the response to the drug.<br>
      <br>
      A drug is usually described by its prominent effect or by the
      action thought to be the basis of that effect. However, such
      descriptions should not obscure the fact that no drug produces
      only a single effect. Morphine is correctly described as an
      analgesic, but it also suppresses the cough reflex, causes
      sedation, respiratory depression, constipation, bronchiolar
      constriction, release of histamine, antiduresis, and a variety of
      other side effects. A drug is adequately characterized only in
      terms of its full spectrum of effects and few drugs are
      sufficiently selective to be described as specific.<br>
      <br>
      One of the objects of this invention is to provide a more targeted
      mode for achieving a desired response from a biological system by
      introducing a spectral energy catalyst (e. g., a spectral
      catalyst) in place of, or to augment, pharmaceutical agents which
      may mimic the effect or mechanism of action of a given enzyme, and
      thereby, limit the occurrence of unwanted side effects commonly
      associated with pharmaceutical agents. Moreover, certain reactions
      can be achieved with spectral catalysts that are not achievable
      with any specific physical catalyst pharmaceutical.<br>
      <br>
      A first embodiment of this aspect of the invention involves DHEA
      and melatonin which are both pharmaceuticals thought to be
      involved in slowing and/or reversing the aging process. The
      electromagnetic spectral pattern for DHEA and melatonin could be
      emitted from light bulbs present in the home or the workplace. The
      resultant EM radiation can be absorbed directly into the central
      nervous system via the optic nerves and tracts, producing
      anti-aging effects at the site of the genesis of the aging
      phenomenon, namely, the central nervous system and the
      pineal-hypothalamus-pituitary system.<br>
      <br>
      A second embodiment of this aspect of the invention involves a
      lowering of LDL cholesterol levels with pharmaceutical spectral
      patterns emitted by, for example, coils in the mattress of a bed
      or in a mattress pad that negatively catalyzes HMG CoA reductase.
      Thus, desirable effects can be achieved by targeting appropriate
      biologics with unique spectral patterns designed to produce a
      desired reaction product.<br>
      <br>
      A third embodiment of this aspect of the invention involves the
      treatment of bacterial, fungal, parasitic, and viral illnesses
      using spectral pharmaceuticals. Specifically, by generating the
      catalytic spectral pattern of known drug catalysts, similar
      effects to physical drug catalysts can be achieved.<br>
      <br>
      Another embodiment of this aspect of the invention provides a
      treatment for asthma which involves the autonomic nervous system
      playing a key role in the control of bronchometer tone both in
      normal airways and in those of individuals with bronchospastic
      disease. The effects of the autonomic nervous system are thought
      to be mediated through their action on the stores of cyclic
      adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate
      (GMP) in bronchial smooth muscle cells. Further, acetycholine, or
      stimulation by the vagus nerve, is thought to provide an increase
      in the amounts of cyclic<br>
      GMP relative to cyclic AMP, leading to smooth muscle contraction
      and asthma attacks.<br>
      <br>
      Conversely, an increase within bronchial smooth muscle cells in
      the levels of cyclic AMP relative to cyclic GMP leads to
      relaxation of the bronchial muscles and thus provides a treatment
      for asthma. The enzyme, adenylate cyclase, catalyses the formation
      of cyclic AMP.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, by applying (e. g. a pendant worn around the neck)
      the catalytic spectral pattern for adenylate cyclase, relief from
      asthma could be achieved.<br>
      <br>
      Some of the most amazing physical catalysts are enzymes which
      catalyze the multitudinous reactions in living organisms. Of all
      the intricate processes that have evolved in living systems, none
      are more striking or more essential than enzyme catalysis. The
      amazing fact about enzymes is that not only can they increase the
      rate of biochemical reactions by factors ranging from 106 to 1012,
      but they are also highly specific. An enzyme acts only on certain
      molecules while leaving the rest of the system unaffected. Some
      enzymes have been found to have a high degree of specificity while
      others can catalyze a number of reactions. If a biological
      reaction can be catalyzed by only one enzyme, then the loss of
      activity or reduced activity of that enzyme could greatly inhibit
      the specific reaction and could be detrimental to a living
      organism. If this situation occurs, a catalytic spectral energy
      pattern could be determined for the exact enzyme or mechanism,
      then genetic deficiencies could be augmented by providing the
      spectral energy catalyst to replace the enzyme.<br>

      <br>
      Moreover, the application of different spectral energy patterns

      <br>
      While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory or
      explanation of operation, it is believed that when frequencies
      match, energy transfers. The transfer of energy can be a sharing
      of energy between two entities and/or, for example, a transfer of
      energy from one entity into another entity. The entities may both
      be, for example, matter, or one entity may be matter and the other
      energy (e. g. energy may be a spectral energy pattern such as
      electromagnetic frequencies, and/or an electric field and/or a
      magnetic field).<br>

      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      In general, thermal energy is used to drive chemical reactions by
      applying heat and increasing the temperature. The addition of heat
      increases the kinetic (motion) energy of the chemical reactants. A
      reactant with more kinetic energy moves faster and farther, and is
      more likely to take part in a chemical reaction. Mechanical energy
      likewise, by stirring and moving the chemicals, increases their
      kinetic energy and thus their reactivity. The addition of
      mechanical energy often increases temperature, by increasing
      kinetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      Acoustic energy is applied to chemical reactions as orderly
      mechanical waves.<br>
      <br>
      Because of its mechanical nature, acoustic energy can increase the
      kinetic energy of chemical reactants, and can also elevate their
      temperature (s). Electromagnetic (EM) energy consists of waves of
      electric and magnetic fields. EM energy may also increase the
      kinetic energy and heat in reaction systems. It may energize
      electronic orbitals or vibrational motion in some reactions.<br>
      <br>
      Both acoustic and electromagnetic energy may consist of waves. The
      number of waves in a period of time can be counted. Waves are
      often drawn, as in Figure la. Usually, time is placed on the
      horizontal X-axis. The vertical Y-axis shows the strength or
      intensity of the wave. This is also called the amplitude. A weak
      wave will be of weak intensity and will have low amplitude (see
      Figure 2a). A strong wave will have high amplitude (see Figure
      2b).<br>
      <br>
      Traditionally, the number of waves per second is counted, to
      obtain the frequency.<br>
      <br>
      Frequency = Number of waves/time = Waves/second = Hz.<br>
      <br>
      Another name for"waves per second", is"hertz" (abbreviated"Hz").
      Frequency is drawn on wave diagrams by showing a different number
      of waves in a period of time (see<br>
      Figure 3a which shows waves having a frequency of 2 Hz and 3 Hz).
      It is also drawn by placing frequency itself, rather than time, on
      the X-axis (see Figure 3b which shows the same 2 Hz and 3Hz waves
      plotted differently).<br>
      <br>
      Energy waves and frequency have some interesting properties, and
      may interact in some interesting ways. The manner in which wave
      energies interact, depends largely on the frequency. For example,
      when two waves of energy interact, each having the same amplitude,
      but one at a frequency of 400 Hz and the other at 100 Hz, the
      waves will add their frequencies, to produce a new frequency of
      500 Hz (i. e., the"sum"frequency). The frequency of the waves will
      also subtract to produce a frequency of 300 HZ (i. e., the
      "difference"frequency). All wave energies typically add and
      subtract in this manner, and such adding and subtracting is
      referred to as heterodyning. Common results of heterodyning are
      familiar to most as harmonics in music.<br>
      <br>
      There is a mathematical, as well as musical basis, to the
      harmonics produced by heterodyning. Consider, for example, a
      continuous progression of heterodyned frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      As discussed above, beginning with 400 Hz and 100 Hz, the sum
      frequency is 500 Hz and the difference frequency is 300 Hz. If
      these frequencies are further heterodyned (added and subtracted)
      then new frequencies of 800 (i. e., 500 + 300) and 200 (i. e.,
      500-300) are obtained.<br>
      <br>
      The further heterodyning of 800 and 200 results in 1,000 and 600
      Hz as shown in Figure 4.<br>
      <br>
      A mathematical pattern begins to emerge. Both the sum and the
      difference columns contain alternating series of numbers that
      double with each set of heterodynes. In the sum column, 400 Hz,
      800 Hz, and 1,600 Hz, alternates with 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, and 2000
      Hz. The same sort of doubling phenomenon occurs in the difference
      column.<br>
      <br>
      Heterodyning of frequencies is the natural process that occurs
      whenever waveform energies interact. Heterodyning results in
      patterns of increasing numbers that are mathematically derived.
      The number patterns are integer multiples of the original
      frequencies. These multiples are called harmonics. For example,
      800 Hz and 1600 Hz are harmonics of 400 Hz. In musical terms, 800
      Hz is one octave above 400 Hz, and 1600 Hz is two octaves higher.
      It is important to understand the mathematical heterodyne basis
      for harmonics, which occurs in all waveform energies, and thus in
      all of nature.<br>
      <br>
      The mathematics of frequencies is very important. Frequency
      heterodynes increase mathematically in visual patterns (see Figure
      5). Mathematics has a name for these visual patterns of Figure 5.
      These patterns are called fractals. A fractal is defined as a
      mathematical function which produces a series of self-similar
      patterns or numbers. Fractal patterns have spurred a great deal of
      interest historically because fractal patterns are found
      everywhere in nature. Fractals can be found in the patterning of
      large expanses of coastline, all the way down to microorganisms.
      Fractals are found in the behavior of organized insects and in the
      behavior of fluids. The visual patterns produced by fractals are
      very distinct and recognizable. A typical fractal pattern is shown
      in Figure 6.<br>
      <br>
      A heterodyne is a mathematical function, governed by mathematical
      equations, just like a fractal. A heterodyne also produces
      self-similar patterns of numbers, like a fractal. If graphed, a
      heterodyne series produces the same familiar visual shape and form
      which is so characteristic of fractals. It is interesting to
      compare the heterodyne series in Figure 5, with the fractal series
      in Figure 6.<br>
      <br>
      Heterodynes are fractals; the conclusion is inescapable.
      Heterodynes and fractals are both mathematical functions which
      produce a series of self-similar patterns or numbers.<br>
      <br>
      Wave energies interact in heterodyne patterns. Thus, all wave
      energies interact as fractal patterns. Once it is understood that
      the fundamental process of interacting energies is itself a
      fractal process, it becomes easier to understand why so many
      creatures and systems in nature also exhibit fractal patterns. The
      fractal processes and patterns of nature are established at a
      fundamental or basic level.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, since energy interacts by heterodyning, matter should
      also be capable of interacting by a heterodyning process. All
      matter whether in large or small forms, has what is called a
      natural oscillatory frequency. The natural oscillatory frequency
      ("NOF") of an object, is the frequency at which the object prefers
      to vibrate, once set in motion. The NOF of an object is related to
      many factors including size, shape, dimension, and composition.<br>
      <br>
      The smaller an object is, the smaller the distance it has to cover
      when it oscillates back and forth. The smaller the distance, the
      faster it can oscillate, and the higher its NOF.<br>
      <br>
      For example, consider a wire composed of metal atoms. The wire has
      a natural oscillatory frequency. The individual metal atoms also
      have unique natural oscillatory frequencies. The NOF of the atoms
      and the NOF of the wire heterodyne by adding and subtracting, just
      the way energy heterodynes.<br>
      <br>
      NOFatom + NOFre = Sum Frequencyatom+wire and NOFatom-NOFwire =
      Difference FrequencyatOm wire<br>
      If the wire is stimulated with the Difference Frequencyato",-wire,
      the difference frequency will heterodyne (add) with the NOF, ire
      to produce NOFatom, (natural oscillatory frequency of the atom)
      and the atom will absorb with the energy, thereby becoming
      stimulated to a higher energy level. Cirac and Zoeller reported
      this phenomenon in 1995, and they used a laser to generate the
      Difference Frequency.<br>
      <br>
      Difference Frequencyatom-wire + NOFwire = NOFatom<br>
      Matter heterodynes with matter in a manner similar to the way in
      which wave energies heterodyne with other wave energies. This
      means that matter in its various states may also interact in
      fractal processes. This interaction of matter by fractal processes
      assists in explaining why so many creatures and systems in nature
      exhibit fractal processes and patterns. Matter, as well as energy,
      interacts by the mathematical equations of heterodynes, to produce
      harmonics and fractal patterns. That is why there are fractals
      everywhere around us.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, energy heterodynes with energy, and matter heterodynes with
      matter.<br>
      <br>
      However, perhaps even more important is that matter can heterodyne
      with energy (and visa versa). In the metal wire discussion above,
      the Difference Frequency atom-wire in the experiment by Cirac and
      Zoeller was provided by a laser which used electromagnetic wave
      energy at a frequency equal to the Difference Frequency atom-wire.
      The matter in the wire, via its natural oscillatory frequency,
      heterodyned with the electromagnetic wave energy frequency of the
      laser to produce the frequency of an individual atom of matter.
      This shows that energy and matter do heterodyne with each other.<br>
      <br>
      In general, when energy encounters matter, one of three
      possibilities occur. The energy either bounces off the matter (i.
      e., is reflected energy), passes through the matter (i. e., is
      transmitted energy), or interacts and/or combines with the matter
      (e. g., is absorbed or heterodynes with the matter). If the energy
      heterodynes with the matter, new frequencies of energy and/or
      matter will be produced by mathematical processes of sums and
      differences. If the frequency thus produced matches an NOF of the
      matter, the energy will be, at least partially, absorbed, and the
      matter will be stimulated to, for example, a higher energy level,
      (i. e., it possesses more energy). A crucial factor which
      determines which of these three possibilities will happen is the
      frequency of the energy compared to the frequency of the matter.
      If the frequencies do not match, the energy will either be
      reflected, or will pass on through as transmitted energy. If the
      frequencies of the energy and the matter match either directly (e.
      g., are close to each other, as discussed in greater detail later
      herein), or match indirectly (e. g., heterodynes), then the energy
      is capable of interacting and/or combining with the matter.<br>
      <br>
      Another term often used for describing the matching of frequencies
      is resonance. In this invention, use of the term resonance will
      typically mean that frequencies of matter and/or energy match. For
      example, if the frequency of energy and the frequency of matter
      match, the energy and matter are in resonance and the energy is
      capable of combining with the matter. Resonance, or frequency
      matching, is merely an aspect of heterodyning that permits the
      coherent transfer and combination of energy with matter.<br>
      <br>
      In the example above with the wire and atoms, resonance could have
      been created with the atom, by stimulating the atom with a laser
      frequency exactly matching the NOF of the atom. In this case, the
      atom would be energized with its own resonant frequency and the
      energy would be transferred to the atom directly. Alternatively,
      as was performed in the actual wire/laser experiment, resonance
      could also have been created with the atom by using the
      heterodyning that naturally occurs between differing frequencies.
      Thus, the resonant frequency of the atom (NOFatom) can be produced
      indirectly, as an additive (or subtractive) heterodyned frequency,
      between the resonant frequency of the wire (NOFwjre) and the
      applied frequency of the laser. Either direct resonance, or
      indirect resonance through heterodyned frequency matching,
      produces resonance and thus permits the combining of matter and
      energy. When frequencies match, energy transfers.<br>
      <br>
      Heterodyning produces indirect resonance. Heterodyning also
      produces harmonics, (i. e., frequencies that are integer multiples
      of the resonant (NOF) frequency. For example, the music note"A"is
      approximately 440 Hz. If that frequency is doubled to about 880
      Hz, the note"A"is heard an octave higher. This first octave is
      called the first harmonic.<br>
      <br>
      Doubling the note or frequency again, from 880 Hz to 1,760 Hz (i.
      e., four times the frequency of the original note) results in
      another"A", two octaves above the original note.<br>
      <br>
      This is called the third harmonic. Every time the frequency is
      doubled another octave is achieved, so these are the even integer
      multiples of the resonant frequency.<br>
      <br>
      In between the first and third harmonic is the second harmonic,
      which is three times the original note. Musically, this is not an
      octave like the first and third harmonics. It is an octave and a
      fifth, equal to the second"E"above the original"A". All of the odd
      integer multiples are fifths, rather than octaves. Because
      harmonics are simply multiples of the fundamental natural
      oscillatory frequency, harmonics stimulate the NOF or resonant
      frequency indirectly. Thus by playing the high"A"at 880 Hz on a
      piano, the string for middle"A"at 440 Hz should also begin to
      vibrate due to the phenomenon of harmonics.<br>
      <br>
      Matter and energy in chemical reactions respond to harmonics of
      resonant frequencies much the way musical instruments do. Thus,
      the resonant frequency of the atom (NOFatom) can be stimulated
      indirectly, using one or more of its'harmonic frequencies. This is
      because the harmonic frequency heterodynes with the resonant
      frequency of the atom itself (NOFatom).<br>
      <br>
      For example, in the wire/atom example above, if the laser is tuned
      to 800 THz and the atom resonates at 400 THz, heterodyning the two
      frequencies results in:<br>
      800 THz-400 THz = 400 THz<br>
      The 800 THz (the atom's first harmonic), heterodynes with the
      resonant frequency of the atom, to produce the atom's own resonant
      frequency. Thus the first harmonic indirectly resonates with the
      atom's NOF, and stimulates the atom's resonant frequency as a
      first generation heterodyne.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, the two frequencies will also heterodyne in the other
      direction, producing:<br>
      800 THz + 400 THz = 1, 200 THz<br>
      The 1,200 THz frequency is not the resonant frequency of the atom.
      Thus, part of the energy of the laser will heterodyne to produce
      the resonant frequency of the atom. The other part of the energy
      of the laser heterodynes to a different frequency, that does not
      itself stimulate the resonant frequency of the atom. That is why
      the stimulation of an object by a harmonic frequency of particular
      strength of amplitude, is typically less than the stimulation by
      its'own resonant (NOF) frequency at the same particular strength.<br>
      <br>
      Although it appears that half the energy of a harmonic is wasted,
      that is not necessarily the case. Referring again to the exemplary
      atom vibrating at 400 THz, exposing the atom to electromagnetic
      energy vibrating at 800 THz will result in frequencies subtracting
      and adding as follows:<br>
      800 THz-400 THz = 400 THz and<br>
      800 THz + 400 THz = 1, 200 THz<br>
      The 1,200 THz heterodyne, for which about 50% of the energy
      appears to be wasted, will heterodyne with other frequencies also,
      such as 800 THz. Thus,<br>
      1,200 THz-800 THz = 400 THz<br>
      Also, the 1,200 THz will heterodyne with 400 THz:<br>
      1,200 THz-400 THz = 800 THz, thus producing 800 THz, and the 800
      THz will heterodyne with 400 THz:<br>
      800 THz-400 THz = 400 THz, thus producing 400 THz frequency again.
      When other generations of heterodynes of the seemingly wasted
      energy are taken into consideration, the amount of energy
      transferred by a first harmonic frequency is much greater than the
      previously suggested 50% transfer of energy. There is not as much
      energy transferred by this approach when compared to direct
      resonance, but this energy transfer is sufficient to produce a
      desired effect (see Figure 14).<br>
      <br>
      As stated previously, Ostwald's theories on catalysts and bond
      formation were based on the kinetic theories of chemistry from the
      turn of the century. However, it should now be understood that
      chemical reactions are interactions of matter, and that matter
      interacts with other matter through resonance and heterodyning of
      frequencies ; and energy can just as easily interact with matter
      through a similar processes of resonance and heterodyning. With
      the advent of spectroscopy (discussed in more detail elsewhere
      herein), it is evident that matter produces, for example,
      electromagnetic energy at the same or substantially the same
      frequencies at which it vibrates. Energy and matter can move about
      and recombine with other energy or matter, as long as their
      frequencies match, because when frequencies match, energy
      transfers. In many respects, both philosophically and
      mathematically, both matter and energy can be fundamentally
      construed as corresponding to frequency. Accordingly, since
      chemical reactions are recombinations of matter driven by energy,
      chemical reactions are in effect, driven just as much by
      frequency.<br>
      <br>
      Analysis of a typical chemical reaction should be helpful in
      understanding the normal processes disclosed herein. A
      representative reaction to examine is the formation of water from
      hydrogen and oxygen gases, catalyzed by platinum. Platinum has
      been known for some time to be a good hydrogen catalyst, although
      the reason for this has not been well understood.<br>
      EMI59.1<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      This reaction is proposed to be a chain reaction, depending on the
      generation and stabilization of the hydrogen and hydroxy
      intermediates. The proposed reaction chain is:<br>
      EMI59.2<br>
      <br>
      EMI60.1<br>
      <br>
      Generation of the hydrogen and hydroxy intermediates are thought
      to be crucial to this reaction chain. Under normal circumstances,
      hydrogen and oxygen gas can be mixed together for an indefinite
      amount of time, and they will not form water. Whenever the
      occasional hydrogen molecule splits apart, the hydrogen atoms do
      not have adequate energy to bond with an oxygen molecule to form
      water. The hydrogen atoms are very short-lived as they simply
      re-bond again to form a hydrogen molecule. Exactly how platinum
      catalyzes this reaction chain is a mystery to the prior art.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention teaches that an important step to catalyzing
      this reaction is the understanding now provided that it is crucial
      not only to generate the intermediates, but also to energize
      and/or stabilize (i. e., maintain the intermediates for a longer
      time), so that the intermediates have sufficient energy to, for
      example, react with other components in the reaction system. In
      the case of platinum, the intermediates react with the reactants
      to form product and more intermediates (i. e., by generating,
      energizing and stabilizing the hydrogen intermediate, it has
      sufficient energy to react with the molecular oxygen reactant,
      forming water and the hydroxy intermediate, instead of falling
      back into a hydrogen molecule).<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, by energizing and stabilizing the hydroxy intermediates,
      the hydroxy intermediates can react with more reactant hydrogen
      molecules, and again water and more intermediates result from this
      chain reaction. Thus, generating energizing and/or stabilizing the
      intermediates, influences this reaction pathway. Paralleling
      nature in this regard would be desirable (e. g., nature can be
      paralleled by increasing the energy levels of the intermediates).<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, desirable, intermediates can be energized and/or
      stabilized by applying at least one appropriate electromagnetic
      frequency resonant with the intermediate, thereby stimulating the
      intermediate to a higher energy level. Interestingly, that is what
      platinum does (e. g., various platinum frequencies resonate with
      the intermediates on the reaction pathway for water formation).
      Moreover, in the process of energizing and stabilizing the
      reaction intermediates, platinum fosters the generation of more
      intermediates, which allows the reaction chain to continue, and
      thus catalyzes the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      As a catalyst, platinum takes advantage of many of the ways that
      frequencies interact with each other. Specifically, frequencies
      interact and resonate with each other: 1) directly, by matching a
      frequency; or 2) indirectly, by matching a frequency through
      harmonics or heterodynes. In other words, platinum vibrates at
      frequencies which both directly match the natural oscillatory
      frequencies of the intermediates, and which indirectly match their
      frequencies, for example, by heterodyning harmonics with the
      intermediates.<br>
      <br>
      Further, in addition to the specific intermediates of the reaction
      discussed above herein, it should be understood that in this
      reaction, like in all reactions, various transients or transient
      states also exist. In some cases, transients or transient states
      may only involve different bond angles between similar chemical
      species or in other cases transients may involve completely
      different chemistries altogether. In any event, it should be
      understood that numerous transient states exist between any
      particular combination of reactant and reaction product.<br>
      <br>
      It should now be understood that physical catalysts produce
      effects by generating, energizing and/or stabilizing all manner of
      transients, as well as intermediates. In this regard,<br>
      Figure 8a shows a single reactant and a single product. The
      point"A"corresponds to the reactant and the point"B"corresponds to
      the reaction product. The point"C"corresponds to an activated
      complex. Transients correspond to all those points on the curve
      between reactant"A"and product"B", and can also include the
      activated complex"C".<br>
      <br>
      In a more complex reaction which involves formation of at least
      one intermediate, the reaction profile looks somewhat different.
      In this regard, reference is made to Figure 8b, which shows
      reactant"A", product"B", activated complex"C'and C", and
      intermediate "D". In this particular example, the
      intermediate"D"exists as a minimum in the energy reaction profile
      of the reaction, while it is surrounded by the activated complexes
      C and C'.<br>
      <br>
      However, again, in this particular reaction, transients correspond
      to anything between the reactant"A"and the reaction product"B",
      which in this particular example, includes the two activated
      complexes"C"'and"C","as well as the intermediate"D". In the
      particular example of hydrogen and oxygen combining to form water,
      the reaction profile is closer to that shown in Figure 8c. In this
      particular reaction profile,"D"'and"D""'could correspond generally
      to the intermediates of the hydrogen atom and hydroxy molecule.<br>
      <br>
      Now, with specific reference to the reaction to form water, both
      intermediates are good examples of how platinum produces resonance
      in an intermediate by directly matching a frequency. Hydroxy
      intermediates vibrate strongly at frequencies of 975 THz and 1,060<br>
      THz. Platinum also vibrates at 975 THz and 1,060 THz. By directly
      matching the frequencies of the hydroxy intermediates, platinum
      can cause resonance in hydroxy intermediates, enabling them to be
      energized, stimulated and/or stabilized long enough to take part
      in chemical reactions. Similarly, platinum also directly matches
      frequencies of the hydrogen intermediates. Platinum resonates with
      about 10 out of about 24 hydrogen frequencies in its electronic
      spectrum (see Figure 69). Specifically, Figure 69 shows the
      frequencies of hydrogen listed horizontally across the Table and
      the frequencies of platinum listed vertically on the Table. Thus,
      by directly resonating with the intermediates in the
      above-described reaction, platinum facilitates the generation,
      energizing, stimulating, and/or stabilizing of the intermediates,
      thereby catalyzing the desired reaction.<br>
      <br>
      Platinum's interactions with hydrogen are also a good example of
      matching frequencies through heterodyning. It is disclosed herein,
      and shown clearly in Figure 69, that many of the platinum
      frequencies resonate indirectly as harmonics with the hydrogen
      atom intermediate (e. g., harmonic heterodynes). Specifically,
      fifty-six (56) frequencies of platinum (i. e., 33 % of all its
      frequencies) are harmonics of nineteen (19) hydrogen frequencies
      (i. e., 80% of its 24 frequencies). Fourteen (14) platinum
      frequencies are first harmonics (2X) of seven (7) hydrogen
      frequencies. And, twelve (12) platinum frequencies are third
      harmonics (4X) of four (4) hydrogen frequencies. Thus, the
      presence of platinum causes massive indirect harmonic resonance in
      the hydrogen atom, as well as significant direct resonance.<br>
      <br>
      Further focus on the individual hydrogen frequencies is even more
      informative.<br>
      <br>
      Figures 9-10 show a different picture of what hydrogen looks like
      when the same information used to make energy level diagrams is
      plotted as actual frequencies and intensities instead.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, the X-axis shows the frequencies emitted and
      absorbed by hydrogen, while the<br>
      Y-axis shows the relative intensity for each frequency. The
      frequencies are plotted in terahertz (THz, 1012 Hz) and are
      rounded to the nearest THz. The intensities are plotted on a
      relative scale of 1 to 1,000. The highest intensity frequency that
      hydrogen atoms produce is 2,466 THz. This is the peak of curve I
      to the far right in Figure 9a. This curve I shall be referred to
      as the first curve. Curve I sweeps down and to the right, from
      2,466 THz at a relative intensity of 1,000 to 3,237 THz at a
      relative intensity of only about 15.<br>
      <br>
      The second curve in Figure 9a, curve II, starts at 456 THz with a
      relative intensity of about 300 and sweeps down and to the right.
      It ends at a frequency of 781 THz with a relative intensity of
      five (5). Every curve in hydrogen has this same downward sweep to
      the right. Progressing from right to left in Figure 9, the curves
      are numbered I through V ; going from high to low frequency and
      from high to low intensity.<br>
      <br>
      The hydrogen frequency chart shown in Figure 10 appears to be much
      simpler than the energy level diagrams. It is thus easier to
      visualize how the frequencies are organized into the different
      curves shown in Figure 9. In fact, there is one curve for each of
      the series described by Rydberg. Curve"I"contains the frequencies
      in the Lyman series, originating from what quantum mechanics
      refers to as the first energy level. The second curve from the
      right, curve"II", equates to the second energy level, and so on.<br>
      <br>
      The curves in the hydrogen frequency chart of Figure 9 are
      composed of sums and differences (i. e., they are heterodyned).
      For example, the smallest curve at the far left, labeled curve"V",
      has two frequencies shown, namely 40 THz and 64 THz, with relative
      intensities of six (6) and four (4), respectively (see also Figure
      10). The next curve, IV, begins at 74 THz, proceeds to 114 THz and
      ends with 138 THz. The summed heterodyne calculations are thus: 40
      + 74 = 114<br>
      64+74+138.<br>
      <br>
      The frequencies in curve IV are the sum of the frequencies in
      curve V plus the peak intensity frequency in curve IV.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the frequencies in curve IV, minus the frequencies
      in curve V, yield the peak of curve IV: 114-40 = 74<br>
      138-64 = 74.<br>
      <br>
      This is not just a coincidental set of sums or differences in
      curves IV and V. Every curve in hydrogen is the result of adding
      each frequency in any one curve, with the highest intensity
      frequency in the next curve.<br>
      <br>
      These hydrogen frequencies are found in both the atom itself, and
      in the electromagnetic energy it radiates. The frequencies of the
      atom and its energy, add and subtract in regular fashion. This is
      heterodyning. Thus, not only matter and energy heterodyne
      interchangeably, but matter heterodynes its'own energy within
      itself.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the highest intensity frequencies in each curve are
      heterodynes of heterodynes. For example, the peak frequency in
      Curve I of Figure 9 is 2,466 THz, which is the third harmonic of
      616 THz;<br>
      4 x 616 THz = 2,466 THz.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, 2,466 THz is the third harmonic of 616 THz (Recall that for
      heterodyned harmonics, the result is even multiples of the
      starting frequency, i. e., for the first harmonic 2X the original
      frequency and the third harmonic is 4X the original frequency.
      Multiplying a frequency by four (4) is a natural result of the
      heterodyning process.) Thus, 2,466 THz is a fourth generation
      heterodyne, namely the third harmonic of 616 THz.<br>
      <br>
      The peak of curve II of Figure 9, a frequency corresponding to 456
      THz, is the third harmonic of 114 THz in curve IV. The peak of
      curve III, corresponding to a frequency of 160 THz, is the third
      harmonic of 40 THz in curve V. The peaks of the curves shown in<br>
      Figure 9 are not only heterodynes between the curves but are also
      harmonics of individual frequencies which are themselves
      heterodynes. The whole hydrogen spectrum turns out to be an
      incestuously heterodyned set of frequencies and harmonics.<br>
      <br>
      Theoretically, this heterodyne process could go on forever. For
      example, if 40 is the peak of a curve, that means the peak is four
      (4) times a lower number, and it also means that the peak of the
      previous curve is 24 (64-40 = 24). It is possible to
      mathematically extrapolate backwards and downwards this way to
      derive lower and lower frequencies. Peaks of successive curves to
      the left are 24.2382,15.732, and 10.786 THz, all generated from
      the heterodyne process. These frequencies are in complete
      agreement with the Rydberg formula for energy levels 6,7 and 8,
      respectively. Not much attention has historically been given by
      the prior art to these lower frequencies and their heterodyning.<br>
      <br>
      This invention teaches that the heterodyned frequency curves
      amplify the vibrations and energy of hydrogen. A low intensity
      frequency on curve IV or V has a very high intensity by the time
      it is heterodyned out to curve 1. In many respects, the hydrogen
      atom is just one big energy amplification system. Moving from low
      frequencies to high frequencies, (i. e., from curve V to curve I
      in Figure 9), the intensities increase dramatically. By
      stimulating hydrogen with 2,466 THz at an intensity of 1,000, the
      result will be 2,466 THz at 1,000 intensity. However, if hydrogen
      is stimulated with 40 THz at an intensity of 1,000, by the time it
      is amplified back out to curve I of Figure 9, the result will be
      2,466 THz at an intensity of 167,000. This heterodyning turns out
      to have a direct bearing on platinum, and on how platinum
      interacts with hydrogen. It all has to do with hydrogen being an
      energy amplification system. That is why the lower frequency
      curves are perceived as being higher energy levels. By
      understanding this process, the low frequencies of low intensity
      suddenly become potentially very significant.<br>
      <br>
      Platinum resonates with most, if not all, of the hydrogen
      frequencies with one notable exception, the highest intensity
      curve at the far right in the frequency chart of Figure 9 (i. e.,
      curve I) representing energy level 1, and beginning with 2,466
      THz. Platinum does not appear to resonate significantly with the
      ground state transition of the hydrogen atom.<br>
      <br>
      However, it does resonate with multiple upper energy levels of
      lower frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      With this information, one ongoing mystery can be solved. Ever
      since lasers were developed, the prior art chemists believed that
      there had to be some way to catalyze a reaction using lasers.
      Standard approaches involved using the single highest intensity
      frequency of an atom (such as 2,466 THz of hydrogen) because it
      was apparently believed that the highest intensity frequency would
      result in the highest reactivity. This approach was taken due to
      considering only the energy level diagrams. Accordingly, prior art
      lasers are typically tuned to a ground state transition frequency.
      This use of lasers in the prior art has been minimally successful
      for catalyzing chemical reactions. It is now understood why this
      approach was not successful. Platinum, the quintessential hydrogen
      catalyst, does not resonate with the ground state transition of
      hydrogen. It resonates with the upper energy level frequencies, in
      fact, many of the upper level frequencies. Without wishing to be
      bound by any particular theory or explanation, this is probably
      why platinum is such a good hydrogen catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      Einstein essentially worked out the statistics on lasers at the
      turn of the century when atoms at the ground energy level (El) are
      resonated to an excited energy level (E2). Refer to the number of
      atoms in the ground state as"Ni"and the number of excited atoms
      as"N2", with the total "Ntotal". Since there are only two possible
      states that atoms can occupy:<br>
      Ntotal = Na + N2.<br>
      <br>
      After all the mathematics are performed, the relationship which
      evolves is:<br>
      N2 N2 1 ~~~~~ ~ = ~~ &lt; ~<br>
      Ntotal Ni + N2 2<br>
      In a two level system, it is predicted that there will never by
      more than 50% of the atoms in the higher energy level, E2, at the
      same time.<br>
      <br>
      If, however, the same group of atoms is energized at three (3) or
      more energy levels (i. e., a multi-level system), it is possible
      to obtain more than 50% of the atoms energized above the first
      level. By referring to the ground and energized levels as El, E2,
      and E3, respectively, and the numbers of atoms as Ntota, Ni, N2,
      and N3, under certain circumstances, the number of atoms at an
      elevated energy level (N3) can be more than the number at a lower
      energy level (N2). When this happens, it is referred to as
      a"population inversion".<br>
      <br>
      Population inversion means that more of the atoms are at higher
      energy levels that at the lower energy levels.<br>
      <br>
      Population inversion in lasers is important. Population inversion
      causes amplification of light energy. For example, in a two-level
      system, one photon in results in one photon out.<br>
      <br>
      In a system with three (3) or more energy levels and population
      inversion, one photon in may result in 5,10, or 15 photons out
      (see Figure 11). The amount of photons out depends on the number
      of levels and just how energized each level becomes. All lasers
      are based on this simple concept of producing a population
      inversion in a group of atoms, by creating a multilevel energized
      system among the atoms. Lasers are simply devices to amplify
      electromagnetic wave energy (i. e., light) Laser is actually an
      abbreviation for Light<br>
      Amplification System for Emitting Radiation.<br>
      <br>
      By referring back to the interactions discussed herein between
      platinum and hydrogen, platinum energizes 19 upper level
      frequencies in hydrogen (i. e., 80% of the total hydrogen
      frequencies). But only three frequencies are needed for a
      population inversion.<br>
      <br>
      Hydrogen is stimulated at 19. This is a clearly multi-level
      system. Moreover, consider that seventy platinum frequencies do
      the stimulating. On average, every hydrogen frequency involved is
      stimulated by three or four (i. e., 70/19) different platinum
      frequencies ; both directly resonant frequencies and/or indirectly
      resonant harmonic frequencies. Platinum provides ample stimulus,
      atom per atom, to produce a population inversion in hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, consider the fact that every time a stimulated hydrogen
      atom emits some electromagnetic energy, that energy is of a
      frequency that matches and stimulates platinum in return.<br>
      <br>
      Platinum and hydrogen both resonate with each other in their
      respective multi-level systems. Together, platinum and hydrogen
      form an atomic scale laser (i. e., an energy amplification system
      on the atomic level). In so doing, platinum and hydrogen amplify
      the energies that are needed to stabilize both the hydrogen and
      hydroxy intermediates, thus catalyzing the reaction pathway for
      the formation of water. Platinum is such a good hydrogen catalyst
      because it forms a lasing system with hydrogen on the atomic
      level, thereby amplifying their respective energies.<br>
      <br>
      Further, this reaction hints that in order to catalyze a reaction
      system and/or control the reaction pathway in a reaction system it
      is possible for only a single transient and/or intermediate to be
      formed and/or energized by an applied frequency (e. g., a spectral
      catalyst) and that by forming and/or stimulating at least one
      transient and/or at least one intermediate that is required to
      follow for a desired reaction pathway (e. g., either a complex
      reaction or a simple reaction), then a frequency, or combination
      of frequencies, which result in such formation or stimulation of
      only one of such required transients and/or intermediates may be
      all that is required. Accordingly, the present invention
      recognizes that in some reaction systems, by determining at least
      one required transient and/or intermediate, and by applying at
      least one frequency which generates, energizes and/or stabilizes
      said at least one transient and/or intermediate, then all other
      transients and/or intermediates required for a reaction to proceed
      down a desired reaction pathway may be self-generated. However, in
      some cases, the reaction could be increased in rate by applying
      the appropriate frequency or spectral energy pattern, which
      directly stimulates all transients and/or intermediates that are
      required in order for a reaction to proceed down a desired
      reaction pathway. Accordingly, depending upon the particulars of
      any reaction system, it may be desirable for a variety of reasons,
      including equipment, environmental reaction conditions, etc., to
      provide or apply a frequency or spectral energy pattern which
      results in the formation and/or stimulation and/or stabilization
      of any required transients and/or intermediates. Thus, in order to
      determine an appropriate frequency or spectral energy pattern, it
      is first desirable to determine which transients and/or
      intermediates are present in any reaction pathway.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, once all known required transients and/or
      intermediates are determined, then, one can determine
      experimentally or empirically which transients and/or
      intermediates are essential to a reaction pathway and then
      determine, which transients and or intermediates can be
      self-generated by the stimulation and/or formation of a different
      transient or intermediate. Once such determinations are made,
      appropriate spectral energies (e. g., electromagnetic frequencies)
      can then be applied to the reaction system to obtain the desirable
      reaction product and/or desirable reaction pathway.<br>
      <br>
      It is known that an atom of platinum interacts with an atom of
      hydrogen and/or a hydroxy intermediate. And, that is exactly what
      modern chemistry has taught for the last one hundred years, based
      on Ostwald's theory of catalysis. However, the prior art teaches
      that catalysts must participate in the reaction by binding to the
      reactants, in other words, the prior art teaches a matter: matter
      bonding interaction is required for physical catalysts. As
      previously stated, these reactions follow these steps:<br>
      1. Reactant diffusion to the catalyst site ;<br>
      2. Bonding of reactant to the catalyst site;<br>
      3. Reaction of the catalyst-reactant complex;<br>
      4. Bond rupture at the catalytic site (product); and<br>
      5. Diffusion of the product away from the catalyst site.<br>
      <br>
      However, according to the present invention, for example, energy:
      energy frequencies can interact as well as energy: matter
      frequencies. Moreover, matter radiates energy, with the energy
      frequencies being substantially the same as the matter
      frequencies. So platinum vibrates at the frequency of 1,060 THz,
      and it also radiates electromagnetic energy at 1,060<br>
      THz. Thus, according to the present invention, the distinction
      between energy frequencies and matter frequencies starts to look
      less important.<br>
      <br>
      Resonance can be produced in, for example, the reaction
      intermediates by permitting them to come into contact with
      additional matter vibrating at substantially the same frequencies,
      such as those frequencies of a platinum atom (e. g., platinum
      stimulating the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form
      water). Alternatively, according to the present invention,
      resonance can be produced in the intermediates by introducing
      electromagnetic energy corresponding to one or more platinum
      energies, which also vibrate at the same frequencies, thus at
      least partially mimicking (an additional mechanism of platinum is
      resonance with the H2 molecule, a pathway reactant) the mechanism
      of action of a platinum catalyst. Matter, or energy, it makes no
      difference as far as the frequencies are concerned, because when
      the frequencies match, energy transfers. Thus, physical catalysts
      are not required. Rather, the application of at least a portion of
      the spectral pattern of a physical catalyst may be sufficient (i.
      e. at least a portion of the catalytic spectral pattern).<br>
      <br>
      However, in another preferred embodiment, substantially all of a
      spectral pattern can be applied.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, by understanding the catalyst mechanism of action,
      particular frequencies can be applied to, for example, one or more
      reactants in a reaction system and, for example, cause the applied
      frequencies to heterodyne with existing frequencies in the matter
      itself to result in frequencies which correspond to one or more
      platinum catalyst or other relevant spectral frequencies. For
      example, both the hydrogen atom and the hydrogen molecule have
      unique frequencies. By heterodyning the frequencies a subtractive
      frequency can be determined:<br>
      NOF H atom-NOF H molecule = Difference H atom-molecule<br>
      The Difference H atom-molecule frequency applied to the H2
      molecule reactant will heterodyne with the molecule and energize
      the individual hydrogen atoms as intermediates. Similarly, any
      reaction participant can serve as the heterodyning backboard for
      stimulation of another participant. For example,<br>
      Difference H atom-Oxygen molecule + NOF oxygen molecule = NOF H
      atom or<br>
      Difference OH-water + NOF water = NOFoH<br>
      This approach enables greater flexibility for choice of
      appropriate equipment to apply appropriate frequencies. However,
      the key to this approach is understanding catalyst mechanisms of
      action and the reaction pathway so that appropriate choices for
      application of frequencies can be made.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, whenever reference is made to, for example, a
      spectral catalyst duplicating at least a portion of a physical
      catalyst's spectral pattern, this reference is to all the
      different frequencies produced by a physical catalyst ; including,
      but not necessarily limited to, electronic, vibrational,
      rotational, and NOF frequencies. To catalyze, control, and/or
      direct a chemical reaction then, all that is needed is to
      duplicate one or more frequencies from a physical catalyst, with,
      for example, an appropriate electromagnetic energy. The actual
      physical presence of the catalyst is not necessary. A spectral
      catalyst can substantially completely replace a physical catalyst,
      if desired.<br>
      <br>
      A spectral catalyst can also augment or promote the activity of a
      physical catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      The exchange of energy at particular frequencies, between
      hydrogen, hydroxy, and platinum is primarily what drives the
      conversion to water. These participants interact and create a
      miniature atomic scale lasing system that amplify their respective
      energies. The addition of these same energies to a reaction
      system, using a spectral catalyst, does the same thing. The
      spectral catalyst amplifies the participant energies by resonating
      with them and when frequencies match, energy transfers and the
      chemicals (matter) can absorb the energy. Thus, a spectral
      catalyst can augment a physical catalyst, as well as replace it.
      In so doing, the spectral catalyst may increase the reaction rate,
      enhance specificity, and/or allow for the use of less physical
      catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 12 shows a basic bell-shaped curve produced by comparing
      how much energy an object absorbs, as compared to the frequency of
      the energy. This curve is called a resonance curve. As elsewhere
      herein stated, the energy transfer between, for example, atoms or
      molecules, reaches a maximum at the resonant frequency (fo). The
      farther away an applied frequency is from the resonant frequency,
      fo, the lower the energy transfer (e. g., matter to matter, energy
      to matter, etc.). At some point the energy transfer will fall to a
      value representing only about 50% of that at the resonant
      frequency to. The frequency higher than the resonant frequency, at
      which energy transfer is only about 50% is called"f2."The
      frequency lower than the resonant frequency, at which about 50%
      energy transfer occurs, is labeled''fi.<br>
      <br>
      The resonant characteristics of different objects can be compared
      using the information from the simple exemplary resonance curve
      shown in Figure 12. One such useful characteristic is called
      the"resonance quality"or"Q"factor. To determine the resonance
      quality for an object the following equation is utilized: fo<br>
      Q= (f2-fl)<br>
      Accordingly, as shown from the equation, if the bell-shaped
      resonance curve is tall and narrow, then (f2-fl) will be a very
      small number and Q, the resonance quality, will be high (see
      Figure 13 a). An example of a material with a high"Q"is a high
      quality quartz crystal resonator. If the resonance curve is low
      and broad, then the spread or difference between f2 and fi will be
      relatively large. An example of a material with a low"Q"is a
      marshmallow.<br>
      <br>
      The dividing of the resonant frequency by this large number will
      produce a much lower Q value (see Figure 13b).<br>
      <br>
      Atoms and molecules, for example, have resonance curves which
      exhibit properties similar to larger objects such as quartz
      crystals and marshmallows. If the goal is to stimulate atoms in a
      reaction (e. g., hydrogen in the reaction to produce water as
      mentioned previously) a precise resonant frequency produced by a
      reaction system component or environmental reaction condition (e.
      g., hydrogen) can be used. It is not necessary to use the precise
      frequency, however. Use of a frequency that is near a resonant
      frequency of, for example, one or more reaction system components
      or environmental reaction conditions is adequate.<br>
      <br>
      There will not be quite as much of an effect as using the exact
      resonant frequency, because less energy will be transferred, but
      there will still be an effect. The closer the applied frequency is
      to the resonant frequency, the more the effect. The farther away
      the applied frequency is from the resonant frequency, the less
      effect that is present (i. e., the less energy transfer that
      occurs).<br>
      <br>
      Harmonics present a similar situation. As previously stated,
      harmonics are created by the heterodyning (i. e., adding and
      subtracting) of frequencies, allowing the transfer of significant
      amounts of energy. Accordingly, for example, desirable results can
      be achieved in chemical reactions if applied frequencies (e. g.,
      at least a portion of a spectral catalyst) are harmonics (i. e.,
      matching heterodynes) with one or more resonant frequency (ies) of
      one or more reaction system components or environmental reaction
      conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Further, similar to applied frequencies being close to resonant
      frequencies, applied frequencies which are close to the harmonic
      frequency can also produce desirable results.<br>
      <br>
      The amplitude of the energy transfer will be less relative to a
      harmonic frequency, but an effect will still occur. For example,
      if the harmonic produces 70% of the amplitude of the fundamental
      resonant frequency and by using a frequency which is merely close
      to the harmonic, for example, about 90% on the harmonic's
      resonance curve, then the total effect will be 90% of 70%, or
      about 63% total energy transfer in comparison to a direct resonant
      frequency. Accordingly, according to the present invention, when
      at least a portion of the frequencies of one or more reaction
      system components or environmental reaction conditions at least
      partially match, then at least some energy will transfer and at
      least some reaction will occur (i. e., when frequencies match,
      energy transfers).<br>
      <br>
      <b>DUPLICATING THE CATALYST MECHANICS OF ACTION</b><br>
      As stated previously, to catalyze, control, and/or direct a
      chemical reaction, a spectral catalyst can be applied. The
      spectral catalyst may correspond to at least a portion of a
      spectral pattern of a physical catalyst or the spectral catalyst
      may correspond to frequencies which form or stimulate required
      participants (e. g., heterodyned frequencies) or the spectral
      catalyst may substantially duplicate environmental reaction
      conditions such as temperature or pressure. Thus, as now taught by
      the present invention, the actual physical presence of a catalyst
      is not required to achieve the desirable chemical reactions. The
      removal of a physical catalyst is accomplished by understanding
      the underlying mechanism inherent in catalysis, namely that
      desirable energy can be exchanged (i. e., transferred) between,
      for example, (1) at least one participant (e. g., reactant,
      transient, intermediate, activated complex, reaction product,
      promoter and/or poison) and/or at least one component in a
      reaction system and (2) an applied electromagnetic energy (e. g.,
      spectral catalyst) when such energy is present at one or more
      specific frequencies. In other words, the targeted mechanism that
      nature has built into the catalytic process can be copied
      according to the teachings of the present invention. Nature can be
      further mimicked because the catalyst process reveals several
      opportunities for duplicating catalyst mechanisms of action, and
      hence improving the use of spectral catalysts, as well as the
      control of countless chemical reactions.<br>
      <br>
      For example, the previously discussed reaction of hydrogen and
      oxygen to produce water, which used platinum as a catalyst, is a
      good starting point for understanding catalyst mechanisms of
      action. For example, this invention discloses that platinum
      catalyzes the reaction in several ways not contemplated by the
      prior art:<br>
      Platinum directly resonates with and energizes reaction
      intermediates and/or transients (e. g., atomic hydrogen and
      hydroxy radicals) ;<br>
      Platinum harmonically resonates with and energizes at least one
      reaction intermediate and or transient (e. g., atomic hydrogen) ;
      and<br>
      Platinum energizes multiple upper energy levels of at least one
      reaction intermediate and or transient (e. g., atomic hydrogen).<br>
      <br>
      This knowledge can be utilized to improve the functioning of the
      spectral catalyst and/or spectral energy catalyst to design
      spectral catalysts and spectral energy catalysts which differ from
      actual catalytic spectral patterns, and to design physical
      catalysts, and to optimize environmental reaction conditions. For
      example, the frequencies of atomic platinum are in the
      ultraviolet, visible light, and infrared regions of the
      electromagnetic spectrum. The electronic spectra of virtually all
      atoms are in these same regions. However, these very high
      electromagnetic frequencies can be a problem for large-scale and
      industrial applications because wave energies having high
      frequencies typically do not penetrate matter very well (i. e., do
      not penetrate far into matter). The tendency of wave energy to be
      absorbed rather than transmitted, can be referred to as
      attenuation. High frequency wave energies have a high attenuation,
      and thus do not penetrate far into a typical industrial scale
      reaction vessel containing typical reactants for a chemical
      reaction. Thus, the duplication and application of at least a
      portion of the spectral pattern of platinum into a commercial
      scale reaction vessel will typically be a slow process because a
      large portion of the applied spectral pattern of the spectral
      catalysts may be rapidly absorbed near the edges of the reaction
      vessel.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, in order to input energy into a large industrial-sized
      commercial reaction vessel, a lower frequency energy could be used
      that would penetrate farther into the reactants housed within the
      reaction vessel. The present invention teaches that this can be
      accomplished in a unique manner by copying nature. As discussed
      herein, the spectra of atoms and molecules are broadly classified
      into three (3) different groups: electronic, vibrational, and
      rotational.<br>
      <br>
      The electronic spectra of atoms and small molecules are said to
      result from transitions of electrons from one energy level to
      another, and have the corresponding highest frequencies, typically
      occurring in the ultraviolet (UV), visible, and infrared (IR)
      regions of the EM spectrum. The vibrational spectra are said to
      result primarily from this movement of bonds between individual
      atoms within molecules, and typically occur in the infrared and
      microwave regions. Rotational spectra occur primarily in the
      microwave and radiowave regions of the EM spectrum due, primarily,
      to the rotation of the molecules.<br>
      <br>
      Microwave or radiowave radiation could be an acceptable frequency
      to be used as a spectral catalyst because it would penetrate well
      into a large reaction vessel. Unfortunately, platinum atoms do not
      produce frequencies in the microwave or radiowave portions of the
      electromagnetic spectrum because they do not have vibrational or
      rotational spectra.<br>
      <br>
      However, by copying the mechanism of action platinum, selected
      platinum frequencies can be used as a model for a spectral
      catalyst in the microwave portion of the spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, as previously discussed, one mechanism of action of
      platinum in the reaction system to produce water involves
      energizing at least one reaction intermediate and/or transient.
      Reaction intermediates in this reaction are atomic hydrogen and
      the hydroxy radical. Atomic hydrogen has a high frequency
      electronic spectrum without vibrational or rotational spectra. The
      hydroxy radical, on the other hand, is a molecule, and has
      vibrational and rotational spectra as well as an electronic
      spectrum. Thus, the hydroxy radical emits, absorbs and heterodynes
      frequencies in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic
      spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, to copy the mechanism of action of platinum in the reaction
      to form water, namely resonating with at least one reaction
      intermediate and/or transient, the hydroxy intermediate can be
      specifically targeted via resonance. However, instead of
      resonating with the hydroxy radical in its electronic spectrum, as
      physical platinum catalyst does, at least one hydroxy frequency in
      the microwave portion of the EM spectrum can be used to resonate
      with the hydroxy radical. Hydroxy radicals heterodyne at a
      microwave frequency of about 21.4 GHz. Energizing a reaction
      system of hydrogen and oxygen gas with a spectral catalyst at
      about 21.4 GHz will catalyze the formation of water. In this
      instance, the mechanism of action of the physical catalyst
      platinum has been partially copied and the mechanism has been
      shifted to a different region of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      The second method discussed above for platinum catalyzing a
      reaction, involves harmonically energizing at least one reaction
      intermediate in the reaction system. For example, assume that one
      or more lasers was available to catalyze the hydrogen-oxygen
      reaction to form water, however, the frequency range of such
      lasers was only from, for example, 1,500 to 2,000 THz. Platinum
      does not produce frequencies in that portion of the<br>
      EM spectrum. Moreover, the two hydroxy frequencies that platinum
      resonates with, 975 and 1,060 THz, are outside the frequency range
      that the lasers, in this example, can generate.<br>
      <br>
      Likewise, the hydrogen spectrum does not have any frequencies
      between 1,500 and 2,000<br>
      THz (see Figures 9-10).<br>
      <br>
      However, according to the present invention, by again copying the
      mechanism of action of platinum, frequencies can be adapted or
      selected to be convenient and/or efficient for the equipment
      available. Specifically, harmonic frequencies corresponding to the
      reaction intermediates and/or transients, and also corresponding
      to frequencies capable of being generated by the lasers of this
      example, can be utilized. For the hydroxy radical, having a
      resonant frequency of 975 THz, the first harmonic is 1,950 THz.
      Thus, a laser of this example could be tuned to 1,950 THz to
      resonate harmonically with the hydroxy intermediate. The first
      harmonics of three different hydrogen frequencies also fall within
      the operational range of the lasers of this example. The
      fundamental frequencies are 755,770 and 781 THz and the first
      harmonics are 1,510,1,540, and 1,562 THz, respectively. Thus, a
      laser of this example could be tuned to the first harmonics
      1,510,1,540, and 1,562 THz in order to achieve a heterodyned
      matching of frequencies between electromagnetic energy and matter
      and thus achieve a transfer and absorption of said energy.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, depending on how many lasers are available and the
      frequencies to which the lasers can be tuned, third or fourth
      harmonics could also be utilized. The third harmonic of the
      hydrogen frequency, 456 THz, occurs at 1,824 THz, which is also
      within the operating range of the lasers of this example.
      Similarly, the fourth harmonic of the hydrogen frequency, 314 THz,
      occurs at 1,570 THz, which again falls within the operating range
      of the lasers of this example. In summary, a mechanism of action
      of a physical catalyst can be copied, duplicated or mimicked while
      moving the relevant spectral catalyst frequencies, to a portion of
      the electromagnetic spectrum that matches equipment available for
      the reaction system and the application of electromagnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      The third method discussed above for platinum catalyzing this
      reaction involves energizing at least one reaction intermediate
      and/or transient at multiple upper energy levels and setting up,
      for example, an atomic scale laser system. Again, assume that the
      same lasers discussed above are the only electromagnetic energy
      sources available and assume that there are a total of ten (10)
      lasers available. There are four (4) first harmonics available for
      targeting within the operating frequency range of 1,500 to 2,000
      THz. Some portion of the lasers should be adjusted to four (4)
      first harmonics and some should be adjusted to the third, fourth,
      and higher harmonics. Specifically, the present invention has
      discovered that a mechanism of action that physical platinum uses
      is to resonate with multiple upper energy levels of at least one
      reaction participant. It is now understood that the more upper
      energy levels that are involved, the better. This creates an
      atomic scale laser system with amplification of the
      electromagnetic energies being exchanged between the atoms of
      platinum and hydrogen. This amplification of energy catalyzes the
      reaction at a much faster rate than the reaction would ordinarily
      proceed. This mechanism of action can also be exploited to
      catalyze, for example, the reaction with the available lasers
      discussed above.<br>
      <br>
      For example, rather than setting all ten (10) lasers to the four
      (4) first harmonics and energizing only four (4) levels, it should
      now be understood that it would be desirable to energize as many
      different energy levels as possible. This task can be accomplished
      by setting each of the ten (10) lasers to a different frequency.
      Even though the physical catalyst platinum is not present, the
      energizing of multiple upper energy levels in the hydrogen will
      amplify the energies being exchanged between the atoms, and the
      reaction system will form its'own laser system between the
      hydrogen atoms. This will permit the reaction to proceed at a much
      faster rate than it ordinarily would. Once again, nature can be
      mimicked by duplicating one of her mechanisms of action by
      specifically targeting multiple energy levels with a spectral
      catalyst to achieve energy transfer in a novel manner.<br>
      <br>
      The preceding discussion on duplicating catalyst mechanisms of
      action is just the beginning of an understanding of many variables
      associated with the use of spectral catalysts.<br>
      <br>
      These additional variables should be viewed as potentially very
      useful tools for enhancing the performance of spectral energy,
      and/or physical catalysts. There are many factors and variables
      that affect both catalyst performance, and chemical reactions in
      general. For example, when the same catalyst is mixed with the
      same reactant, but exposed to different environmental reaction
      conditions such as temperature or pressure, different products can
      be produced. Consider the following example: 300 C<br>
      EMI77.1<br>
      <br>
      1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cyclohexene&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Benzene+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2H2<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Pd catalyst &lt; 300 C<br>
      EMI77.2<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cyclohexene&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Benzene&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2Cyclohexane<br>
      <br>
      Pd catalyst<br>
      <br>
      The same catalyst with the same reactant, produces quite different
      products in these two reactions, namely molecular hydrogen or
      cyclohexane, depending on the reaction temperature.<br>
      <br>
      Many factors are known in the art which affect the direction and
      intensity with which a physical catalyst guides a reaction or with
      which a reaction proceeds in general.<br>
      <br>
      Temperature is but one of these factors. Other factors include
      pressure, volume, surface area of physical catalysts, solvents,
      support materials, contaminants, catalyst size and shape and
      composition, reactor vessel size, shape and composition, electric
      fields, magnetic fields, and acoustic fields. The present
      invention teaches that these factors all have one thing in common.
      These factors are capable of changing the spectral patterns (i.
      e., frequency pattern) of, for example, participants and/or
      reaction system components. Some changes in spectra are very well
      studied and thus much information is available for consideration
      and application thereof. The prior art does not contemplate,
      however, the spectral chemistry basis for each of these factors,
      and how they relate to catalyst mechanisms of action, and chemical
      reactions in general. Further, alternatively, effects of the
      aforementioned factors can be enhanced or diminished by the
      application of additional spectral, spectral energy, and/or
      physical catalyst frequencies. Moreover, these environmental
      reaction conditions can be at least partially simulated in a
      reaction system by the application of one or more corresponding
      spectral environmental reaction conditions (e. g., a spectral
      energy pattern which duplicates at least a portion of one or more
      environmental reaction conditions). Alternatively, one spectral
      environmental reaction condition (e. g., a spectral energy pattern
      corresponding to temperature) could be substituted for another (e.
      g., spectral energy pattern corresponding to pressure) so long as
      the goal of matching of frequencies was met.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TEMPERATURE</b><br>
      At very low temperatures, the spectral pattern of an atom or
      molecule has clean, crisp peaks (see Figure 15a). As the
      temperature increases, the peaks begin to broaden, producing a
      bell-shaped curve of a spectral pattern (see Figure 15b). At even
      higher temperatures, the bell-shaped curve broadens even more, to
      include more and more frequencies on either side of the primary
      frequency (see Figure 15c). This phenomenon is called"broadening".<br>
      <br>
      These spectral curves are very much like the resonance curves
      discussed in the previous section. Spectroscopists use resonance
      curve terminology to describe spectral frequency curves for atoms
      and molecules (see Figure 16). The frequency at the top of the
      curve, fo, is called the resonance frequency. There is a frequency
      (f2) above the resonance frequency and another (fl) below it (i.
      e., in frequency), at which the energy or intensity (i. e.,
      amplitude) is 50% of that for the resonance frequency to. The
      quantity 12-fi is a measure of how wide or narrow the spectral
      frequency curve is. This quantity (f2-fl) is the"line width". A
      spectrum with narrow curves has a small line width, while a
      spectrum with wide curves has a large line width.<br>
      <br>
      Temperature affects the line width of spectral curves. Line width
      can affect catalyst performance, chemical reactions and/or
      reaction pathways At low temperatures, the spectral curves of
      chemical species will be separate and distinct, with a lesser
      possibility for the transfer of resonant energy between potential
      reaction system components (see Figure 17a).<br>
      <br>
      However, as the line widths of potentially reactive chemical
      species broaden, their spectral curves may start to overlap with
      spectral curves of other chemical species (see Figure 17b).<br>
      <br>
      When frequencies match, or spectral energy patterns overlap,
      energy transfers. Thus, when temperatures are low, frequencies do
      not match and reactions are slow. At higher temperatures, resonant
      transfer of energy can take place and reactions can proceed very
      quickly or proceed along a different reaction pathway than they
      otherwise would have at a lower temperature.<br>
      <br>
      Besides affecting the line width of the spectral curves,
      temperature also can change, for example, the resonant frequency
      of reaction system components. For some chemical species, the
      resonant frequency will shift as temperature changes. This can be
      seen in the infrared absorption spectra in Figure 18a and
      blackbody radiation graphs shown in Figure<br>
      18b. Further, atoms and molecules do not all shift their resonant
      frequencies by the same amount or in the same direction, when they
      are at the same temperature. This can also affect catalyst
      performance. For example, if a catalyst resonant frequency shifts
      more with increased temperature than the resonant frequency of its
      targeted chemical species, then the catalyst could end up matching
      the frequency of a chemical species, and resonance may be created
      where none previously existed (see Figure 18c). Specifically,
      Figure 18c shows catalyst"C"at low temperature and"C*"at high
      temperature. The catalyst"C*"resonates with reactant"A"at high
      temperatures, but not at low temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      The amplitude or intensity of a spectral line may be affected by
      temperature also. For example, linear and symmetric rotor
      molecules will have an increase in intensity as the temperature is
      lowered while other molecules will increase intensity as the
      temperature is raised. These changes of spectral intensity can
      also affect catalyst performance. Consider the example where a low
      intensity spectral curve of a catalyst is resonant with one or
      more frequencies of a specific chemical target. Only small amounts
      of energy can be transferred from the catalyst to the target
      chemical (e. g., a hydroxy intermediate). As temperature
      increases, the amplitude of the catalyst's curve increases also.
      In this example, the catalyst can transfer much larger amounts of
      energy to the chemical target when the temperature is raised.<br>
      <br>
      If the chemical target is the intermediate chemical species for an
      alternative reaction route, the type and ratio of end products may
      be affected. By examining the above cyclohexene/palladium reaction
      again, at temperatures below 300 C, the products are benzene and
      hydrogen gas. However, when the temperature is above 300 C, the
      products are benzene and cyclohexane. Temperature is affecting the
      palladium and/or other constituents in the reaction system
      (including, for example, reactants, intermediates, and/or
      products) in such a way that an alternative reaction pathway
      leading to the formation of cyclohexane is favored above 300 C.
      This could be a result of, for example, increased line width,
      altered resonance frequencies, or changes in spectral curve
      intensities for any of the components in the reaction system.<br>
      <br>
      It is important to consider not only the spectral catalyst
      frequencies one may wish to use to catalyze a reaction, but also
      the reaction conditions under which those frequencies are supposed
      to work. For example, in the palladium/cyclohexene reaction at low
      temperatures, the palladium may match frequencies with an
      intermediate for the formation of hydrogen molecules (H2). At
      temperatures above 300 C the reactants and transients may be
      unaffected, but the palladium may have an increased line width,
      altered resonant frequency and/or increased intensity. The changes
      in the line width, resonant frequency and/or intensity may cause
      the palladium to match frequencies and transfer energy to an
      intermediate in the formation of cyclohexane instead. If a
      spectral catalyst was to be used to assist in the formation of
      cyclohexane at room temperature, the frequency for the cyclohexane
      intermediate would be more effective if used, rather than the
      spectral catalyst frequency used at room temperature.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, it may be important to understand the reaction system
      dynamics in designing and selecting an appropriate spectral
      catalyst. The transfer of energy between different reaction system
      components will vary, depending on temperature. Once understood,
      this allows one to knowingly adjust temperature to optimize a
      reaction, reaction product, interaction and/or formation of
      reaction product at a desirable reaction rate, without the trial
      and error approaches of prior art. Further, it allows one to
      choose catalysts such as physical catalysts, spectral catalysts,
      and/or spectral energy patterns to optimize a desired reaction
      pathway. This understanding of the spectral impact of temperature
      allows one to perform customarily high temperature (and, sometimes
      high danger) chemical processes at safer, room temperatures. It
      also allows one to design physical catalysts which work at much
      broader temperature ranges (e. g., frigid arctic temperatures or
      hot furnace temperatures), as desired.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PRESSURE</b><br>
      Pressure and temperature are directly related to each other.
      Specifically, from the ideal gas law, we know that PV = nRT where
      P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles of gas, R is
      the gas constant, and<br>
      T is the absolute temperature. Thus, at equilibrium, an increase
      in temperature will result in a corresponding increase in
      pressure. Pressure also has an effect on spectral patterns.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, increases in pressure can cause broadening and
      changes in spectral curves, just as increases in temperature do
      (see Figure 19 which shows the pressure broadening effects on the
      NH3 3.3 absorption line).<br>
      <br>
      Mathematical treatments of pressure broadening are generally
      grouped into either collision or statistical theories. In
      collision theories, the assumption is made that most of the time
      an atom or molecule is so far from other atoms or molecules that
      their energy fields do not interact. Occasionally, however, the
      atoms or molecules come so close together that they collide. In
      this case, the atom or molecule may undergo a change in wave phase
      (spectral) function, or may change to a different energy level.
      Collision theories treat the matter's emitted energy as occurring
      only when the atom or molecule is far from others, and is not
      involved in a collision. Because collision theories ignore
      spectral frequencies during collisions, collision theories fail to
      predict accurately chemical behavior at more than a few
      atmospheres of pressure, when collisions are frequent.<br>
      <br>
      Statistical theories, however, consider spectral frequencies
      before, during and after collisions. They are based on calculating
      the probabilities that various atoms and/or molecules are
      interacting with, or perturbed by other atoms or molecules. The
      drawback with statistical treatments of pressure effects is that
      the statistical treatments do not do a good job of accounting for
      the effects of molecular motion. In any event, neither collision
      nor statistical theories adequately predict the rich interplay of
      frequencies and heterodynes that take place as pressure is
      increased. Experimental work has demonstrated that increased
      pressure can have effects similar to those produced by increased
      temperature, by:<br>
      1) broadening of the spectral curve, producing increased line
      width; and<br>
      2) shifting of the resonant frequency (fo).<br>
      <br>
      Pressure effects different from those produced by temperatures
      are: (1) pressure changes typically do not affect intensity, (see
      Figure 20 which shows a theoretical set of curves exhibiting an
      unchanged intensity for three applied different pressures) as with
      temperature changes; and (2) the curves produced by pressure
      broadening are often less symmetric than the temperature-affected
      curves. Consider the shape of the three theoretical curves shown
      in Figure 20. As the pressure increases, the curves become less
      symmetrical.<br>
      <br>
      A tail extending into the higher frequencies develops. This upper
      frequency extension is confirmed by the experimental work shown in
      Figure 21. Specifically, Figure 21a shows a pattern for the
      absorption by water vapor in air (lOg of H20 per cubic meter) ;
      and Figure 21b shows the absorption in NH3 at 1 atmosphere
      pressure.<br>
      <br>
      Pressure broadening effects on spectral curves are broadly grouped
      into two types: resonance or"Holtsmark"broadening,
      and"Lorentz"broadening. Holtsmark broadening is secondary to
      collisions between atoms of the same element, and thus the
      collisions are considered to be symmetrical. Lorentz broadening
      results from collisions between atoms or molecules which are
      different. The collisions are asymmetric, and the resonant
      frequency, fo, is often shifted to a lower frequency. This shift
      in resonant frequency is shown in Figure 20.<br>
      <br>
      The changes in spectral curves and frequencies that accompany
      changes in pressure can affect catalysts, both physical and
      spectral, and chemical reactions and/or reaction pathways.<br>
      <br>
      At low pressures, the spectral curves tend to be fairly narrow and
      crisp, and nearly symmetrical about the resonant frequency.
      However, as pressures increase, the curves may broaden, shift, and
      develop high frequency tails.<br>
      <br>
      At low pressures the spectral frequencies in the reaction system
      might be so different for the various atoms and molecules that
      there may be little or no resonant effect, and thus little or no
      energy transfer. At higher pressures, however, the combination of
      broadening, shifting and extension into higher frequencies can
      produce overlapping between the spectral curves, resulting in the
      creation of resonance, where none previously existed, and thus,
      the transfer of energy. The reaction system may proceed down one
      reaction pathway or another, depending on the changes in spectral
      curves produced by various pressure changes. One reaction pathway
      may be resonant and proceed at moderate pressure, while another
      reaction pathway may be resonant and predominate at higher
      pressures. As with temperature, it is important to consider the
      reaction system frequencies and mechanisms of action of various
      catalysts under the environmental reaction conditions one wishes
      to duplicate. Specifically, in order for an efficient transfer of
      energy to occur between, for example, a spectral catalyst and at
      least one reactant in a reaction system, there must be at least
      some overlap in frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      For example, a reaction with a physical catalyst at 400 THz and a
      key transient at 500<br>
      THz may proceed slowly at atmospheric pressure. Where the
      frequency pressure is raised to about five (5) atmospheres, the
      catalyst broadens out through the 500 THz, for example, of the
      transient. This allows the transfer of energy between the catalyst
      and transient by, for example, energizing and stimulating the
      transient. The reaction then proceeds very quickly.<br>
      <br>
      Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory or
      explanation, it appears that, the speed of the reaction has much
      less to do with the number of collisions (as taught by the prior
      art) than it has to do with the spectral patterns of the reaction
      system components. In the above example, the reaction could be
      energized at low pressures by applying the 500 THz frequency to
      directly stimulate the key transient. This could also be
      accompanied indirectly using various heterodynes, (e. g., @ 1,000
      THz harmonic, or a 100 THz non-harmonic heterodyne between the
      catalyst and transient (500 THz-400 THz = 100 THz.).<br>
      <br>
      As shown herein, the transfer of energy between different reaction
      system components will vary, depending on pressure. Once
      understood, this allows one to knowingly adjust pressure to
      optimize a reaction, without the trial and error approaches of
      prior art. Further, it allows one to choose catalysts such as
      physical catalysts, spectral catalysts, and/or spectral energy
      patterns to optimize one or more desired reaction pathways.<br>
      <br>
      This understanding of the spectral impact of pressure allows one
      to perform customarily high pressure (and thus, typically, high
      danger) chemical processes at safer, room pressures. It also
      allows one to design physical catalysts which work over a large
      range of acceptable pressures (e. g., low pressures approaching a
      vacuum to several atmospheres of pressure).<br>
      <br>
      <b>SURFACE AREA</b><br>
      Traditionally, the surface are of a catalyst has been considered
      to be important because the available surface area controls the
      number of available binding sites.<br>
      <br>
      Supposedly, the more exposed binding sites, the more catalysis. In
      light of the spectral mechanisms disclosed in the present
      invention, surface area may be important for another reason.<br>
      <br>
      Many of the spectral catalyst frequencies that correspond to
      physical catalysts are electronic frequencies in the visible light
      and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum. These high frequencies
      have relatively poor penetrance into, for example, large reaction
      vessels that contain one or more reactants. The high frequency
      spectral emissions from a catalyst such as platinum or palladium
      (or the equivalent spectral catalyst) will thus not travel very
      far into such a reaction system before such spectral emissions (or
      spectral catalysts) are absorbed.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, for example, an atom or molecule must be fairly close to a
      physical catalyst so that their respective electronic frequencies
      can interact.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, surface area primarily affects the probability that a
      particular chemical species, will be close enough to the physical
      catalyst to interact with its electromagnetic spectra emission
      (s). With small surface area, few atoms or molecules will be close
      enough to interact. However, as surface area increases, so too
      does the probability that more atoms or molecules will be within
      range for reaction. Thus, rather than increasing the available
      number of binding sites, larger surface area probably increases
      the volume of the reaction system exposed to the spectral catalyst
      frequencies or patterns. This is similar to the concept of
      assuring adequate penetration of a spectral catalyst into a
      reaction system (e. g., assuming that there are adequate
      opportunities for species to interact with each other).<br>
      <br>
      An understanding of the effects of surface area on catalysts and
      reaction system components allows one to knowingly adjust surface
      area and other reaction system components to optimize a reaction,
      reaction pathway and/or formation of reaction product (s), at a
      desirable reaction rate, without the drawbacks of the prior art.
      For instance, surface area is currently optimized by making
      catalyst particles as small as possible, thereby maximizing the
      overall surface area. The small particles have a tendency to, for
      example, sinter (merge or bond together) which decreases the
      overall surface area and catalytic activity. Rejuvenation of a
      large surface area catalyst can be a costly and time-consuming
      process. This process can be avoided with an understanding of the
      herein presented invention in the field of spectral chemistry. For
      example, assume a reaction is quickly catalyzed by a 3 m2 catalyst
      bed (in a transfer of energy from catalyst to a key reactant and
      product). After sintering takes place, however, the surface area
      is reduced to 1 m2. Thus, the transfer of energy from the catalyst
      is dramatically reduced, and the reaction slows down. The costly
      and time consuming process of rejuvenating the surface area can be
      avoided (or at least delayed) by augmenting the reaction system
      with one or more desirable spectral energy patterns. In addition,
      because spectral energy patterns can affect the final physical
      form or phase of a material, as well as its chemical formula, the
      sintering process itself may be reduced or eliminated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CATALYST SIZE AND SHAPE</b><br>
      In a related line of reasoning, catalyst size and shape are
      classically thought to affect physical catalyst activity.
      Selectivity of reactions controlled by particle size has
      historically been used to steer catalytic pathways. As with
      surface area, certain particle sizes are thought to provide a
      maximum number of active binding sites and thus maximize the
      reaction rate.<br>
      <br>
      The relationship between size and surface area has been previously
      discussed.<br>
      <br>
      In light of the current understanding of the spectral mechanisms
      underlying the activity of physical catalysts and reactions in
      general, catalyst size and shape may be important for other
      reasons. One of those reasons is a phenomenon called"self
      absorption".<br>
      <br>
      When a single atom or molecule produces its'classical spectral
      pattern it radiates electromagnetic energy which travels outward
      from the atom or molecule into neighboring space. Figure 22a shows
      radiation from a single atom versus radiation from a group of
      atoms as shown in Figure 22b. As more and more atoms or molecules
      group together, radiation from the center of the group is absorbed
      by its'neighbors and may never make it out into space. Depending
      on the size and shape of the group of atoms, self absorption can
      cause a number of changes in the spectral emission pattern (see
      Figure 23). Specifically, Figure 23a shows a normal spectral curve
      produced by a single atom; Figure 23b shows a resonant frequency
      shift due to self absorption; Figure 23c shows a self-reversal
      spectral pattern produced by self absorption in a group of atoms
      and Figure 23d shows a self-reversal spectral pattern produced by
      self absorption in a group of atoms. These changes include a shift
      in resonant frequency and self-reversal patterns.<br>
      <br>
      The changes in spectral curves and frequencies that accompany
      changes in catalyst size and shape can affect catalysts, chemical
      reactions and/or reaction pathways. For example, atoms or
      molecules of a physical catalyst may produce spectral frequencies
      in the reaction system which resonate with a key transient and/or
      reaction product. With larger groups of atoms, such as in a
      sintered catalyst, the combination of resonant frequency shifting
      and self-reversal may eliminate overlapping between the spectral
      curves of chemical species, thereby minimizing or destroying
      conditions of resonance.<br>
      <br>
      A reaction system may proceed down one reaction pathway or
      another, depending on the changes in spectral curves produced by
      the particle sizes. For example, a catalyst having a moderate
      particle size may proceed down a first reaction pathway while a
      larger size catalyst may direct the reaction down another reaction
      pathway.<br>
      <br>
      The changes in spectral curves and frequencies that accompany
      changes in catalyst size and shape are relevant for practical
      applications. Industrial catalysts are manufactured in a range of
      sizes and shapes, depending on the design requirements of the
      process and the type of reactor used. Catalyst activity is
      typically proportional to the surface area of the catalyst bed in
      the reactor. Surface area increases as the size of the catalyst
      particles decreases.<br>
      <br>
      Seemingly, the smaller the catalyst particles, the better for
      industrial applications. This is not always the case, however.
      When a very fine bed of catalyst particles is used, high pressures
      may be required to force the reacting chemicals across or through
      the catalyst bed. The chemicals enter the catalyst bed under high
      pressure, and exit the bed (e. g., the other side) at a lower
      pressure. This large difference between entry and exit pressures
      is called a"pressure drop". A compromise is often required between
      catalyst size, catalyst activity, and pressure drop across the
      catalyst bed.<br>
      <br>
      The use of spectral catalysts according to the present invention
      allows for much finer tuning of this compromise. For example, a
      large catalyst size can be used so that pressure drops across the
      catalyst bed are minimized. At the same time, the high level of
      catalyst activity obtained with a smaller catalyst size can still
      be obtained by, for example, augmenting the physical catalyst with
      at least a portion of one or more spectral catalyst (s).<br>
      <br>
      For example, assume that a 10mm average particle size catalyst has
      50% of the activity of a 5mm average particle size catalyst. With
      a 5mm-diameter catalyst, however, the pressure drop across the
      reactor may be so large that the reaction cannot be economically
      performed. The compromise in historical processes has typically
      been to use twice as much of the 1 Omm catalyst, to obtain the
      same, or approximately the same, amount of activity as with the
      original amount of 5mm catalyst. However, an alternative desirable
      approach is to use the original amount of 1 Omm physical catalyst
      and augment the physical catalyst with at least a portion of at
      least one spectral catalyst. Catalyst activity can be effectively
      doubled (or increased even more) by the spectral catalyst,
      resulting in approximately the same degree of activity (or perhaps
      even greater activity) as with the 5mm catalyst. Thus, the present
      invention permits the size of the catalyst to be larger, while
      retaining favorable reactor vessel pressure conditions so that the
      reaction can be performed economically, using half as much (or
      less) physical catalyst as compared to traditional prior art
      approaches.<br>
      <br>
      Another manner to approach the problem of pressure drops in
      physical catalyst beds, is to eliminate the physical catalyst
      completely. For example, in another embodiment of the invention, a
      fiberoptic sieve, (e. g., one with very large pores) can be used
      in a flow-through reactor vessel. If the pore size is designed to
      be large enough there can be virtually no pressure drop across the
      sieve, compared to a pressure drop accompanying the use of a 5 mm
      diameter or even a 10 mm diameter physical catalyst discussed
      above. According to the present invention, the spectral catalyst
      can be emitted through the fiberoptic sieve, thus catalyzing the
      reacting species as they flow by. This improvement over the prior
      art approaches has significant processing implications including
      lower costs, higher rates and improved safety, to mention only a
      few.<br>
      <br>
      Industrial catalysts are also manufactured in a range of shapes,
      as well as sizes.<br>
      <br>
      Shapes include spheres, irregular granules, pellets, extrudate,
      and rings. Some shapes are more expensive to manufacture than
      others, while some shapes have superior properties (e. g.,
      catalyst activity, strength, and less pressure drop) than others.
      While spheres are inexpensive to manufacture, a packed bed of
      spheres produces high pressure drops and the spheres are typically
      not very strong. Physical catalyst rings on the other hand, have
      superior strength and activity and produce very little pressure
      drop, but they are also relatively expensive to produce.<br>
      <br>
      Spectral energy catalysts permit a greater flexibility in choosing
      catalyst shape. For example, instead of using a packed bed of
      inexpensive spheres, with the inevitable high pressure drop and
      resulting mechanical damage to the catalyst particles, a single
      layer of spheres augmented, for example, with a spectral energy
      catalyst can be used. This catalyst is inexpensive, activity is
      maintained, and large pressure drops are not produced, thus
      preventing mechanical damage and extending the useful life of
      physical catalyst spheres.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, far smaller numbers of catalyst rings can be used while
      obtaining the same or greater catalyst activity by, for example,
      supplementing with at least a portion of a spectral catalyst. The
      process can proceed at a faster flow-through rate because the
      catalyst bed will be smaller relative to a bed that is not
      augmented with a spectral catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      The use of spectral energy catalysts and/or spectral environmental
      reaction conditions to augment existing physical catalysts has the
      following advantages: -permit the use of less expensive shaped
      catalyst particles; -permit the use of fewer catalyst particles
      overall; -permit the use of stronger shapes of catalyst particles;
      and -permit the use of catalyst particle shapes with better
      pressure drop characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      * Their use to replace existing physical catalysts has similar
      advantages: -eliminate the use and expense of catalyst particles
      altogether; -allow use of spectral catalyst delivery systems that
      are stronger ; and -delivery systems can be designed to
      incorporate superior pressure drop characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      Catalyst size and shape are also important to spectral emission
      patterns because all objects have an NOF depending on their size
      and shape. The smaller an object is in dimension, the higher its
      NOF will be in frequency (because speed = length x frequency).<br>
      <br>
      Also, two (2) objects of the same size, but different shape will
      have different NOF's (e. g., the resonant NOF frequency of a 1.0 m
      diameter sphere, is different from the NOF for a 1.0 m edged
      cube). Wave energies (both acoustic and EM) will have unique
      resonant frequencies for particular objects. The objects, such as
      physical catalyst particles or powder granules of reactants in a
      slurry, will act like antennas, absorbing and emitting energies at
      their structurally resonant frequencies. With this understanding,
      one is further able to manipulate and control the size and shape
      of reaction system components (e. g., physical catalysts,
      reactants, etc.) to achieve desired effects. For example, a
      transient for a desired reaction pathway may produce a spectral
      rotational frequency of 30 GHz. Catalyst spheres lcm in diameter
      with structural EM resonant frequency of 30 GHz (3xl08m/s lxl0~2m
      = 30x109Hz), can be used to catalyze the reaction. The catalyst
      particles will structurally resonate with the rotational frequency
      of the transient, providing energy to the transient and catalyzing
      the reaction. Likewise, the structurally resonant catalyst
      particles may be further energized by a spectral energy catalyst,
      such as, for example, 30 GHz microwave radiation. Thus understood,
      the spectral dynamics of chemical reactions can be much more
      precisely controlled than in prior art trial and error approaches.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SOLVENTS</b><br>
      Typically, the term solvent is applied to mixtures for which the
      solvent is a liquid, however, it should be understood that
      solvents may also comprise solids, liquids, gases or plasmas
      and/or mixtures and/or components thereof. The prior art typically
      groups liquid solvents into three broad classes: aqueous, organic,
      and non-aqueous. If an aqueous solvent is used, it means that the
      solvent is water. Organic solvents include hydrocarbons such as
      alcohols and ethers. Non-aqueous solvents include inorganic
      non-water substances. Many catalyzed reactions take place in
      solvents.<br>
      <br>
      Because solvents are themselves composed of atoms, molecules
      and/or ions they can have pronounced effects on chemical
      reactions. Solvents are comprised of matter and they emit their
      own spectral frequencies. The present invention teaches that these
      solvent frequencies undergo the same basic processes discussed
      earlier, including heterodyning, resonance, and harmonics.
      Spectroscopists have known for years that a solvent can
      dramatically affect the spectral frequencies produced by
      its'solutes. Likewise, chemists have known for years that solvents
      can affect catalyst activity. However, the spectroscopists and
      chemists in the prior art have apparently not associated these
      long studied changes in solute frequencies with changes in
      catalyst activity. The present invention recognizes that these
      changes in solute spectral frequencies can affect catalyst
      activity and chemical reactions and/or reaction pathways in
      general, changes include spectral curve broadening. Changes of
      curve intensity, gradual or abrupt shifting of the resonant
      frequency fo, and even abrupt rearrangement of resonant
      frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      When reviewing Figure 24a, the solid line represents a portion of
      the spectral pattern of phthalic acid in alcohol while the dotted
      line represents phthalic acid in the solvent hexane.<br>
      <br>
      Consider a reaction taking place in alcohol, in which the catalyst
      resonates with phthalic acid at a frequency of 1,250, the large
      solid curve in the middle. If the solvent is changed to hexane,
      the phthalic acid no longer resonates at a frequency of 1,250 and
      the catalyst can not stimulate and energize it. The change in
      solvent will render the catalyst ineffective.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, in reference to Figure 24b, iodine produces a high
      intensity curve at 580 when dissolved in carbon tetrachloride, as
      shown in curve B. In alcohol, as shown by curve<br>
      A the iodine produces instead, a moderate intensity curve at 1,050
      and a low intensity curve at 850. Accordingly, assume that a
      reaction uses a spectral catalyst that resonates directly with the
      iodine in carbon tetrachloride at 580. If the spectral catalyst
      does not change and the solvent is changed to alcohol, the
      spectral catalyst will no longer function because frequencies no
      longer match and energy will not transfer. Specifically, the
      spectral catalyst's frequency of 580 will no longer match and
      resonate with the new iodine frequencies of 850 and 1,050.<br>
      <br>
      However, there is the possibility that the catalyst will change
      its spectral pattern with a change in the solvent. The catalyst
      could change in a similar manner to the iodine, in which case the
      catalyst may continue to catalyze the reaction regardless of the
      change in solvent.<br>
      <br>
      Conversely, the spectral catalyst pattern could change in a
      direction opposite to the spectral pattern of the iodine. In this
      instance, the catalyst will again fail to catalyze the original
      reaction. There is also the possibility that the change in the
      catalyst could bring the catalyst into resonance with a different
      chemical species and help the reaction proceed down an alternative
      reaction pathway.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, consider the graph in Figure 24c, which shows a variety
      of solvent mixtures ranging from 100% benzene at the far left, to
      a 50: 50 mixture of benzene and alcohol in the center, to 100%
      alcohol at the far right. The solute is phenylazophenol. The
      phenylazophenol has a frequency of 855-860 for most of the solvent
      mixtures. For a 50: 50 benzene: alcohol mixture the frequency is
      855; or for a 98: 2 benzene: alcohol mixture the frequency is
      still 855. However, at 99.5: 0.5 benzene: alcohol mixture, the
      frequency abruptly changes to about 865. A catalyst active in 100%
      benzene by resonating with the phenylazophenol at 865, will lose
      its activity if there is even a slight amount of alcohol (e. g.,
      0.5%) in the solvent.<br>
      <br>
      Thus understood, the principles of spectral chemistry presented
      herein can be applied to catalysis, and reactions and/or reaction
      pathways in general. Instead of using the prior art trial and
      error approach to the choice of solvents and/or other reaction
      system components, solvents can be tailored and/or modified to
      optimize the spectral environmental reaction conditions. For
      example, a reaction may have a key reaction participant which
      resonates at 400 THz, while the catalyst resonates at 800 THz
      transferring energy harmonically.<br>
      <br>
      Changing the solvent may cause the resonant frequencies of both
      the participant and the catalyst to abruptly shift to 600 THz.
      There the catalyst would resonate directly with the participant,
      transferring even more energy, and catalyzing the reaction system
      more efficiently.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUPPORT MATERIALS</b><br>
      Catalysts can be either unsupported or supported. An unsupported
      catalyst is a formulation of the pure catalyst, with substantially
      no other molecules present. Unsupported catalysts are rarely used
      industrially because these catalysts generally have low surface
      area and hence low activity. The low surface area can result from,
      for example, sintering, or coalescence of small molecules of the
      catalyst into larger particles in a process which reduces surface
      tension of the particles. An example of an unsupported catalyst is
      platinum alloy gauze, which is sometimes used for the selective
      oxidation of ammonia to nitric oxide.<br>
      <br>
      Another example is small silver granules, sometimes used to
      catalyze the reaction of methanol with air, to form formaldehyde.
      When the use of unsupported catalysts is possible, their
      advantages include straightforward fabrication and relatively
      simple installation in various industrial processes.<br>
      <br>
      A supported catalyst is a formulation of the catalyst with other
      particles, the other particles acting as a supporting skeleton for
      the catalyst. Traditionally, the support particles are thought to
      be inert, thus providing a simple physical scaffolding for the
      catalyst molecules. Thus, one of the traditional functions of the
      support material is to give the catalyst shape and mechanical
      strength. The support material is also said to reduce sintering
      rates. If the catalyst support is finely divided similar to the
      catalyst, the support will act as a "spacer"between the catalyst
      particles, and hence prevent sintering. An alternative theory
      holds that an interaction takes place between the catalyst and
      support, thereby preventing sintering. This theory is supported by
      the many observations that catalyst activity is altered by changes
      in support material structure and composition.<br>
      <br>
      Supported catalysts are generally made by one or more of the
      following three methods: impregnation, precipitation, and/or
      crystallization. Impregnation techniques use preformed support
      materials, which are then exposed to a solution containing the
      catalyst or its precursors. The catalyst or precursors diffuse
      into the pores of the support. Heating, or another conversion
      process, drives off the solvent and transforms the catalyst or
      precursors into the final catalyst. The most common support
      materials for impregnation are refractory oxides such as aluminas
      and aluminum hydrous oxides. These support materials have found
      their greatest use for catalysts that must operate under extreme
      conditions such as steam reforming, because they have reasonable
      mechanical strengths.<br>
      <br>
      Precipitation techniques use concentrated solutions of catalyst
      salts (e. g., usually metal salts). The salt solutions are rapidly
      mixed and then allowed to precipitate in a finely divided form.
      The precipitate is then prepared using a variety of processes
      including washing, filtering, drying, heating, and pelleting.
      Often a graphitic lubricant is added.<br>
      <br>
      Precipitated catalysts have high catalytic activity secondary to
      high surface area, but they are generally not as strong as
      impregnated catalysts.<br>
      <br>
      Crystallization techniques produce support materials called
      zeolites. The structure of these crystallized catalyst zeolites is
      based on Si04 and A104 (see Figure 25a which shows the tetrahedral
      units of silicon; and Figure 25b which shows the tetrahedral units
      of aluminum). These units link in different combinations to form
      structural families, which include rings, chains, and complex
      polyhedra. For example, the Si04 and A104 tetrahderal units can
      form truncated octahedron structures, which form the building
      blocks for A, X, and<br>
      Y zeolites (see Figure 26a which shows a truncated octahedron
      structure with lines representing oxygen atoms and corners are Al
      or Si atoms; Figure 26b which shows zeolite with joined truncated
      octahedrons joined by oxygen bridges between square faces; and
      Figure 26c which shows zeolites X and Y with joined truncated
      octahedrons joined by oxygen bridges between hexagonal faces).<br>
      <br>
      The crystalline structure of zeolites gives them a well defined
      pore size and structure.<br>
      <br>
      This differs from the varying pore sizes found in impregnated or
      precipitated support materials. Zeolite crystals are made by
      mixing solutions of silicates and aluminates and the catalyst.
      Crystallization is generally induced by heating (see spectral
      effects of temperture in the Section entitled"Temperature"). The
      structure of the resulting zeolite depends on the silicon/aluminum
      ratio, their concentration, the presence of added catalyst, the
      temperature, and even the size of the reaction vessels used, all
      of which are environmental reaction conditions. Zeolites generally
      have greater specificity than other catalyst support materials (e.
      g., they do not just speed up the reaction). They also may steer
      the reaction towards a particular reaction pathway.<br>
      <br>
      Support materials can affect the activity of a catalyst.
      Traditionally, the prior art has attributed these effects to
      geometric factors. However, according to the present invention,
      there are spectral factors to consider as well. It has been well
      established that solvents affect the spectral patterns produced by
      their solutes. Solvents can be liquids, solids, gases and/or
      plasmas Support materials can, in many cases, be viewed as nothing
      more than solid solvents for catalysts. As such, support materials
      can affect the spectral patterns produced by their solute
      catalysts.<br>
      <br>
      Just as dissolved sugar can be placed into a solid phase solvent
      (ice), catalysts can be placed into support materials that are
      solid phase solvents. These support material solid solvents can
      have similar spectral effects on catalysts that liquid solvents
      have. Support materials can change spectral frequencies of their
      catalyst solutes by, for example, causing spectral curve
      broadening, changing of curve intensity, gradual or abrupt
      shifting of the resonant frequency to, and even abrupt
      rearrangement of resonant frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, due to the disclosure herein, it should become clear to an
      artisan of ordinary skill that changes in support materials can
      have dramatic effects on catalyst activity. The support materials
      affect the spectral frequencies produced by the catalysts. The
      changes in catalyst spectral frequencies produce varying effects
      on chemical reactions and catalyst activity, including
      accelerating the rate of reaction and also guiding the reaction on
      a particular reaction path. Thus support materials can potentially
      influence the matching of frequencies and can thus favor the
      possibility of transferring energy between reaction system
      components and/or spectral energy patterns, thus permitting
      certain reactions to occur.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>POISONING</b><br>
      Poisoning of catalysts occurs when the catalyst activity is
      reduced by adding a small amount of another constituent, such as a
      chemical species. The prior art has attributed poisoning to
      chemical species that contain excess electrons (e. g., electron
      donor materials) and to adsorption of poisons onto the physical
      catalyst surface where the poison physically blocks reaction
      sites. However, neither of these theories satisfactorily explains
      poisoning.<br>
      <br>
      Consider the case of nickel hydrogenation catalysts. These
      physical catalysts are substantially deactivated if only 0.1%
      sulphur compounds by weight are adsorbed onto them.<br>
      <br>
      It is difficult to believe that 0.1% sulphur by weight could
      contribute so many electrons as to inactivate the nickel catalyst.
      Likewise, it is difficult to believe that the presence of 0.1 %
      sulphur by weight occupies so many reaction sites that it
      completely deactivates the catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, neither prior art explanation is satisfying.<br>
      <br>
      Poisoning phenomena can be more logically understood in terms of
      spectral chemistry. In reference to the example in the Solvent
      Section using a benzene solvent and phenylazophenol as the solute,
      in pure benzene the phenylazophenol had a spectral frequency of
      865 Hz. The addition of just a few drops of alcohol (0.5%)
      abruptly changed the phenylazophenol frequency to 855. If the
      expectation was for the phenylazophenol to resonate at 865, then
      the alcohol would have poisoned that particular reaction. The
      addition of small quantities of other chemical species can change
      the resonant frequencies (fo) of catalysts and reacting chemicals.
      The addition of another chemical species can act as a poison to
      take the catalyst and reacting species out of resonance. (i. e.,
      the presence of the additional species can remove any substantial
      overlapping of frequencies and thus prevent any significant
      transfer of energy).<br>
      <br>
      Besides changing resonant frequencies of chemical species, adding
      small amounts of other chemicals can also affect the spectral
      intensities of the catalyst and, for example, other atoms and
      molecules in the reaction system by either increasing or
      decreasing the spectral intensities. Consider cadmium and zinc
      mixed in an alumina-silica precipitate (see Figure 27 which shows
      the influences of copper and bismuth on the zinc/cadmium line
      ratio). A normal ratio between the cadmium 3252. 5 spectral line
      and the zinc 3345.0 spectral line was determined. The addition of
      sodium, potassium, lead, and magnesium had little or no effect on
      the Cd/Zn intensity ratio. However, the addition of copper reduced
      the relative intensity of the zinc line and increased the cadmium
      intensity. Conversely, addition of bismuth increased the relative
      intensity of the zinc line while decreasing cadmium.<br>
      <br>
      Also, consider the effect of small amounts of magnesium on a
      copper-aluminum mixture (see Figure 28 which shows the influence
      of magnesium on the copper aluminum intensity ratio). Magnesium
      present at 0.6%, caused significant reductions in line intensity
      for copper and for aluminum. At 1.4% magnesium, the spectral
      intensities for both copper and aluminum were reduced by about a
      third. If the copper frequency is important for catalyzing a
      reaction, adding this small amount of magnesium would dramatically
      reduce the catalyst activity. Thus, it could be concluded that the
      copper catalyst had been poisoned by the magnesium.<br>
      <br>
      In summary, poisoning effects on catalysts are due to spectral
      changes. Adding a small amount of another chemical species to a
      physical catalyst and/or reaction system can change the resonance
      frequencies or the spectral intensities of one or more chemical
      species (e. g., reactant). The catalyst might remain the same,
      while a crucial intermediate is changed.<br>
      <br>
      Likewise, the catalyst might change, while the intermediate stays
      the same. They might both change, or they might both stay the same
      and be oblivious to the added poison species. This understanding
      is important to achieving the goals of the present invention which
      include targeting species to cause an overlap in frequencies, or
      in this instance, specifically targeting one or more species so as
      to prevent any substantial overlap in frequencies and thus prevent
      reactions from occurring by blocking the transfer of energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PROMOTERS</b><br>
      Just as adding a small amount of another chemical species to a
      catalyst and reaction system can poison the activity of the
      catalyst, the opposite can also happen. When an added species
      enhances the activity of a catalyst, it is called a promoter. For
      instance, adding a few percent calcium and potassium oxide to
      iron-alumina compounds promotes activity of the iron catalyst for
      ammonia synthesis. Promoters act by all the mechanisms discussed
      previously in the Sections entitled Solvents, Support Materials,
      and Poisoning. Not surprisingly, some support materials actually
      are promoters. Promoters enhance catalysts and specific reactions
      and/or reaction pathways by changing spectral frequencies and
      intensities.<br>
      <br>
      While a catalyst poison takes the reacting species out of
      resonance (i. e., the frequencies do not overlap), the promoter
      brings them into resonance (i. e., the frequencies do overlap).<br>
      <br>
      Likewise, instead of reducing the spectral intensity of crucial
      frequencies, the promoter may increase the crucial intensities.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, if it was desired for phenylazophenol to react at 855 in a
      benzene solvent, alcohol could be added and the alcohol would be
      termed a promoter. If it was desired for the phenylazophenol too
      react at 865, alcohol could be added and the alcohol could be
      considered a poison. Thus understood, the differences between
      poisons and promoters are a matter of perspective, and depend on
      which reaction pathways and/or reaction products are desired. They
      both act by the same underlying spectral chemistry mechanisms of
      the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CONCENTRATION</b><b><br>
      </b>Concentrations of chemical species are known to affect
      reaction rates and dynamics.<br>
      <br>
      Concentration also affects catalyst activity. The prior art
      explains these effects by the probabilities that various chemical
      species will collide with each other. At high concentrations of a
      particular species, there are many individual atoms or molecules
      present.<br>
      <br>
      The more atoms or molecules present, the more likely they are to
      collide with something else.<br>
      <br>
      However, this statistical treatment by the prior art does not
      explain the entire situation.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 29 shows various concentrations of N-methyl urethane in a
      carbon tetrachloride solution. At low concentrations, the spectral
      lines have a relatively low intensity. However, as the
      concentration is increased, the intensities of the spectral curves
      increase also. At 0.01 molarity, the spectral curve at 3,460 cm~1
      is the only prominent frequency. However, at 0.15 molarity, the
      curves at 3,370 and 3,-300 cm-1 are also prominent.<br>
      <br>
      As the concentration of a chemical species is changed, the
      spectral character of that species in the reaction mixture changes
      also. Suppose that 3,300 and 3,370 cm-1 are important frequencies
      for a desired reaction pathway. At low concentrations the desired
      reaction pathway will not occur. However, if the concentrations
      are increased (and hence the intensities of the relevant
      frequencies) the reaction will proceed down the desired pathway.<br>
      <br>
      Concentration is also related to solvents, support structures,
      poisons and promoters, as previously discussed.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>FINE STRUCTURE FREQUENCIES</b><br>
      The field of science concerned generally with measuring the
      frequencies of energy and matter, known as spectroscopy, has
      already been discussed herein. Specifically, the three broad
      classes of atomic and molecular spectra were reviewed. Electronic
      spectra, which are due to electron transitions, have frequencies
      primarily in the ultraviolet (UV), visible, and infrared (IR)
      regions, and occur in atoms and molecules. Vibrational spectra,
      which are due to, for example, bond motion between individual
      atoms within molecules, are primarily in the<br>
      IR, and occur in molecules. Rotational spectra are due primarily
      to rotation of molecules in space and have microwave or radiowave
      frequencies, and also occur in molecules.<br>
      <br>
      The previous discussion of various spectra and spectroscopy has
      been oversimplified.<br>
      <br>
      There are actually at least three additional sets of spectra,
      which comprise the spectrum discussed above herein, namely, the
      fine structure spectra and the hyperfine structure spectra and the
      superfine structure spectra. These spectra occur in atoms and
      molecules, and extend, for example, from the ultraviolet down to
      the low radio regions. These spectra are often mentioned in prior
      art chemistry and spectroscopy books typically as an aside,
      because prior art chemists typically focus more on the traditional
      types of spectroscopy, namely, electronic, vibrational, and
      rotational.<br>
      <br>
      The fine and hyperfine spectra are quite prevalent in the areas of
      physics and radio astronomy. For example, cosmologists map the
      locations of interstellar clouds of hydrogen, and collect data
      regarding the origins of the universe by detecting signals from
      outerspace, for example, at 1.420 GHz, a microwave frequency which
      is one of the hyperfine splitting frequencies for hydrogen. Most
      of the large databases concerning the microwave and radio
      frequencies of molecules and atoms have been developed by
      astronomers and physicists, rather than by chemists. This apparent
      gap between the use by chemists and physicists, of the fine and
      hyperfine spectra in chemistry, has apparently resulted in prior
      art chemists not giving much, if any, attention to these
      potentially useful spectra.<br>
      <br>
      Referring again to Figures 9a and 9b, the Balmer series (i. e.,
      frequency curve II), begins with a frequency of 456 THz (see
      Figure 30a). Closer examination of this individual frequency shows
      that instead of there being just one crisp narrow curve at 456
      THz, there are really seven different curves very close together
      that comprise the curve at 456 THz. The seven (7) different curves
      are fine structure frequencies. Figure 30b shows the emission
      spectrum for the 456 THz curve in hydrogen. A high-resolution
      laser saturation spectrum, shown in Figure 31, gives even more
      detail. These seven different curves, which are positioned very
      close together, are generally referred to as a multiplet.<br>
      <br>
      Although there are seven different fine structure frequencies
      shown, these seven frequencies are grouped around two major
      frequencies. These are the two, tall, relatively high intensity
      curves shown in Figure 30b. These two high intensity curves are
      also shown in<br>
      Figure 31 at zero cm~l (456. 676 THz), and at relative wavenumber
      0.34 cm~l (456. 686 THz).<br>
      <br>
      What appears to be a single frequency of (456 THz), is actually
      composed predominantly of two slightly different frequencies
      (456.676 and 456.686 THz), and the two frequencies are typically
      referred to as doublet and the frequencies are said to be split.
      The difference or split between the two predominant frequencies in
      the hydrogen 456 THz doublet is 0.010 THz (100 THz) or 0.34 cnf 1
      wavnurnbers. This difference frequency, 10 GHz, is called the fine
      splitting frequency for the 456 THz frequency of hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the individual frequencies that are typically shown in
      ordinary electronic spectra are composed of two or more distinct
      frequencies spaced very close together. The distinct frequencies
      spaced very close together are called fine structure frequencies.
      The difference, between two fine structure frequencies that are
      split apart by a very slight amount, is a fine splitting frequency
      (see Figure 32 which shows fi and f2 which comprise fo and which
      are shown as underneath fo. The difference between fi and fa is
      known as the fine splitting frequency). This"difference"between
      two fine structure frequencies is important because such a
      difference between any two frequencies is a heterodyne.<br>
      <br>
      Almost all the hydrogen frequencies shown in Figures 9a and 9b are
      doublets or multiplets. This means that almost all the hydrogen
      electronic spectrum frequencies have fine structure frequencies
      and fine splitting frequencies (which means that these heterodynes
      are available to be used as spectral catalysts, if desired). The
      present invention discloses that these"differences"or heterodynes
      can be quite useful for certain reactions. However, prior to
      discussing the use of these heterodynes, in the present invention,
      more must be understood about these heterodynes. Some of the fine
      splitting frequencies (i. e., heterodynes) for hydrogen are listed
      in Table 3. These fine splitting heterodynes range from the
      microwave down into the upper reaches of the radio frequency
      region.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Table 3-Fine Splitting Frequencies for Hydrogen</b><b><br>

      3,082 4f 0.008 239.00 MHz<br>
      There are more than 23 fine splitting frequencies (i. e.,
      heterodynes) for just the first series or curve I in hydrogen.
      Lists of the fine splitting heterodynes can be found, for example,
      in the classic 1949 reference"Atomic Energy Levels"by Charlotte
      Moore. This reference also lists 133 fine splitting heterodyned
      intervals for carbon, whose frequencies range from 14.1 THz (473.3
      cm~1) down to 12.2. GHz (0.41 cm~1). Oxygen has 287 fine splitting
      heterodynes listed from 15.9 THz (532.5 cm-1) down to 3.88 GHz
      (0.13 cm~1). The 23 platinum fine splitting intervals detailed are
      from 23.3 THz (775.9 cm~1) to 8.62 THz in frequency (287.9 cm~1).<br>
      <br>
      Diagrammatically, the magnification and resolution of an
      electronic frequency into several closely spaced fine frequencies
      is depicted in Figure 33. The electronic orbit is designated by
      the orbital number n = 0,1,2, etc. The fine structure is
      designated as a. A quantum diagram for the hydrogen fine structure
      is shown in Figure 34. Specifically, shown is the fine structure
      of the n = 1 and n = 2 levels of the hydrogen atom. Figure 35
      shows the multiplet splittings for the lowest energy levels of
      carbon, oxygen, and fluorine, as represented by"C","O"and"F",
      respectively.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the fine splitting frequencies for atoms (i. e.,
      heterodynes), molecules also have similar fine structure
      frequencies. The origin and derivation for molecular fine
      structure and splitting is different from that for atoms, however,
      the graphical and practical results are quite similar. In atoms,
      the fine structure frequencies are said to result from the
      interaction of the spinning electron with its'own magnetic field.
      Basically, this means the electron cloud of a single atomic
      sphere, rotating and interacting with its'own magnetic field,
      produces the atomic fine structure frequencies. The prior art
      refers to this phenomena as "spin-orbit coupling". For molecules,
      the fine structure frequencies correspond to the actual rotational
      frequencies of the electronic or vibrational frequencies. So the
      fine structure frequencies for atoms and molecules both result
      from rotation. In the case of atoms, it is the atom spinning and
      rotating around itself, much the way the earth rotates around its
      axis. In the case of molecules, it is the molecule spinning and
      rotating through space.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 36 shows the infrared absorption spectrum of the SF6
      vibration band near 28.3<br>
      THz (10.6, um wavelength, wavenumber 948 cm~l) of the SF6
      molecule. The molecule is highly symmetrical and rotates somewhat
      like a top. The spectral tracing was obtained with a high
      resolution grating spectrometer. There is a broad band between 941
      and 952 cm~1 (28. 1 and 28.5 THz) with three sharp spectral curves
      at 946,947, and 948 cm~1 (28. 3,28.32, and<br>
      23.834 THz).<br>
      <br>
      Figure 37a shows a narrow slice being taken from between 949 and
      950 cm~1, which is blown up to show more detail in Figure 37b. A
      tunable semiconductor diode laser was used to obtain the detail.
      There are many more spectral curves which appear when the spectrum
      is reviewed in finer detail. These curves are called the fine
      structure frequencies for this molecule. The total energy of an
      atom or molecule is the sum of its'electronic, vibrational, and
      rotational energies. Thus, the simple Planck equation discussed
      previously herein: E=hv can be rewritten as follows: E = Ee + Ev +
      E r where E is the total energy, Ee is the electronic energy, By
      is the vibrational energy, and Er is the rotational energy.
      Diagrammatically, this equation is shown in Figure 38 for
      molecules.<br>
      <br>
      The electronic energy, Ee, involves a change in the orbit of one
      of the electrons in the molecule. It is designated by the orbital
      number n = 0,1,2,3, etc. The vibrational energy,<br>
      Ev, is produced by a change in the vibration rate between two
      atoms within the molecule, and is designated by a vibrational
      number v = 1, 2,3, etc. Lastly, the rotational energy, Er, is the
      energy of rotation caused by the molecule rotating around
      its'center of mass. The rotational energy is designated by the
      quantum number J = 1, 2, and 3, etc., as determined form angular
      momentum equations.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, by examining the vibrational frequencies of SF6 in more
      detail, the fine structure molecular frequencies become apparent.
      These fine structure frequencies are actually produced by the
      molecular rotations,"J", as a subset of each vibrational
      frequency.<br>
      <br>
      Just as the rotational levels"J"are substantially evenly separated
      in Figure 38, they are also substantially evenly separated when
      plotted as frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      This concept may be easier to understand by viewing some
      additional frequency diagrams. For example, Figure 39a shows the
      pure rotational absorption spectrum for gaseous hydrogen-chloride
      and Figure 39b shows the same spectrum at low resolution. In<br>
      Figure 39a, the separate waves, that look something like teeth on
      a"comb", correspond to the individual rotational frequencies. The
      complete wave (i. e., that wave comprising the whole comb) that
      extends in frequency from 20 to 500 cm~1 corresponds to the entire
      vibrational frequency. At low resolution or magnification, this
      set of rotational frequencies appear to be a single frequency
      peaking at about 20 cm~1 (598 GHz) (see Figure 39b). This is very
      similar to the way atomic frequencies such as the 456 THz hydrogen
      frequency appear (i. e., just one frequency at low resolution,
      that turn out to be several different frequencies at higher
      magnification).<br>
      <br>
      In Figure 40, the rotational spectrum (i. e., fine structure) of
      hydrogen cyanide is shown, where"J"is the rotational level. Note
      again, the regular spacing of the rotational levels. (Note that
      this spectrum is oriented opposite of what is typical). This
      spectrum uses transmission rather than emission on the horizontal
      Y-axis, thus, intensity increases downward on the Y-axis, rather
      than upwards.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, Figure 41 shows the vu-vs vibrational bands for FCCF
      (where v1 is vibrational level 1 and vs vibrational level 5) which
      includes a plurality of rotational frequencies. All of the fine
      sawtooth spikes are the fine structure frequencies which
      correspond to the rotational frequencies. Note, the substantially
      regular spacing of the rotational frequencies. Also note, the
      undulating pattern of the rotational frequency intensity, as well
      as the alternating pattern of the rotational frequency
      intensities.<br>
      <br>
      Consider the actual rotational frequencies (i. e., fine structure
      frequencies) for the ground state of carbon monoxide listed in
      Table 4.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b> Table 4. Rotational Frequencies and Derived Rotational
        Constant for CO in the Ground State</b> <br>

      Where; Bo = 57,635.970 MHz<br>
      Each of the rotational frequencies is regularly spaced at
      approximately 115 GHz apart. Prior art quantum theorists would
      explain this regular spacing as being due to the fact that the
      rotational frequencies are related to Planck's constant and the
      moment of inertia (i. e., center of mass for the molecule) by the
      equation: B= h 87r2I where B is the rotational constant, h is
      Planck's constant, and I is the moment of inertia for the
      molecule. From there the prior art established a frequency
      equation for the rotational levels that corresponds to: f = 2B (J
      + 1) where f is the frequency, B is the rotational constant, and J
      is the rotational level. Thus, the rotational spectrum (i. e.,
      fine structure spectrum) for a molecule turns out to be a harmonic
      series of lines with the frequencies all spaced or split (i. e.,
      heterodyned) by the same amount.<br>
      <br>
      This amount has been referred to in the prior art as"2B",
      and"B"has been referred to as the "rotational constant". In
      existing charts and databases of molecular frequencies,"B"is
      usually listed as a frequency such as MHz. This is graphically
      represented for the first four rotational frequencies for CO in
      Figure 42.<br>
      <br>
      This fact is interesting for several reasons. The rotational
      constant"B", listed in many databases, is equal to one half of the
      difference between rotational frequencies for a molecule.<br>
      <br>
      That means that B is the first subharmonic frequency, to the
      fundamental frequency"2B", which is the heterodyned difference
      between all the rotational frequencies. The rotational constant B
      listed for carbon monoxide is 57.6 GHz (57,635.970 MHz). This is
      basically half of the 115 GHz difference between the rotational
      frequencies. Thus, according to the present invention, if it is
      desired to stimulate a molecule's rotational levels, the
      amount"2B"can be used, because it is the fundamental first
      generation heterodyne. Alternatively, the same"B" can be used
      because"B"corresponds to the first subharmonic of that heterodyne.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the prior art teaches that if it is desired to use
      microwaves for stimulation, the microwave frequencies used will be
      restricted to stimulating levels at or near the ground state of
      the molecule (i. e., n = 0 in Figure 38). The prior art teaches
      that as you progress upward in<br>
      Figure 38 to the higher electronic and vibrational levels, the
      required frequencies will correspond to the infrared, visible, and
      ultraviolet regions. However, the prior art is wrong about this
      point.<br>
      <br>
      By referring to Figure 38 again, it is clear that the rotational
      frequencies are evenly spaced out no matter what electronic or
      vibrational level is under scrutiny. The even spacing shown in
      Figure 38 is due to the rotational frequencies being evenly spaced
      as progression is made upwards through all the higher vibrational
      and electronic levels. Table 5 lists the rotational frequencies
      for lithium fluoride (LiF) at several different rotational and
      vibrational levels.<br>
      <br>

      3 3--+4 342,082.66<br>
      It is clear from Table 5 that the differences between rotational
      frequencies, no matter what the vibrational level, is about 86,000
      to about 89, 000 MHz (i. e., 86-89 GHz). Thus, according to the
      present invention, by using a microwave frequency between about
      86,000<br>
      MHz and 89,000 MHz, the molecule can be stimulated from the ground
      state level all the way up to its'highest energy levels. This
      effect has not been even remotely suggested by the prior art.
      Specifically, the rotational frequencies of molecules can be
      manipulated in a unique manner. The first rotational level has a
      natural oscillatory frequency (NOF) of 89,740 MHz.<br>
      <br>
      The second rotational level has an NOF of 179,470 MHz. Thus,<br>
      NOFrotational1#2 - NOFrotational 0#1 = Subtracted Frequency
      rotational 2-1 ; or<br>
      179,470 MHz - 89,740 MHz = 89,730 MHz<br>
      Thus, the present invention has discovered that the NOF's of the
      rotational frequencies heterodyne by adding and subtracting in a
      manner similar to the manner that all frequencies heterodyne.
      Specifically, the two rotational frequencies heterodyne to produce
      a subtracted frequency. This subtracted frequency happens to be
      exactly twice as big as the derived rotational constant"B"listed
      in nuclear physics and spectroscopy manuals. Thus, when the first
      rotational frequency in the molecule is stimulated with the
      Subtracted<br>
      Frequency rotational 2-1, the first rotational frequency will
      heterodyne (i. e., in this case add) with the NOFrotational o-,
      (i. e., first rotational frequency) to produce NOFrotationat 1,
      which is the natural oscillatory frequency of the molecule's
      second rotational level.<br>
      <br>
      In other words:<br>
      Subtracted Frequency rotational 2-1 + NOFrotational o, 1 =
      NOFrotatjonal l 2i<br>
      Or 89,730 MHz + 89,740 MHz = 179, 470 MHz<br>
      Since the present invention has disclosed that the rotational
      frequencies are actually evenly spaced harmonics, the subtracted
      frequency will also add with the second level NOF to produce the
      third level NOF. The subtracted frequency will add with the third
      level NOF to produce the fourth level NOF. And so on and so on.
      Thus, according to the present invention, by using one single
      microwave frequency, it is possible to stimulate all the
      rotational levels in a vibratory band.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, if all the rotational levels for a vibrational frequency
      are excited, then the vibrational frequency will also be
      correspondingly excited. Further, if all the vibrational levels
      for an electronic level are excited, then the electronic level
      will be excited as well.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, according to the teachings of the present invention, it is
      possible to excite the highest levels of the electronic and
      vibrational structure of a molecule by using a single microwave
      frequency. This is contrary to the prior art teachings that the
      use of microwaves is restricted to the ground state of the
      molecule. Specifically, if the goal is to resonate directly with
      an upper vibrational or electronic level, the prior art teaches
      that microwave frequencies can not be used. If, however, according
      to the present invention, a catalytic mechanism of action is
      initiated by, for example, resonating with target species
      indirectly through heterodynes, then one or more microwave
      frequencies can be used to energize at least one upper level
      vibrational or electronic state. Accordingly, by using the
      teachings of the present invention in conjunction with the simple
      processes of heterodyning it becomes readily apparent that
      microwave frequencies are not limited to the ground state levels
      of molecules.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention has determined that catalysts can actually
      stimulate target species indirectly by utilizing at least one
      heterodyne frequency (e. g., harmonic). However, catalysts can
      also stimulate the target species by direct resonance with at
      least one fundamental frequency of interest. However, the
      rotational frequencies can result in use of both mechanisms. For
      example, Figure 42 shows a graphical representation of fine
      structure spectrum showing the first four rotational frequencies
      for CO in the ground state. The first rotational frequency for CO
      is 115 GHz. The heterodyned difference between rotational
      frequencies is also 115 GHz. The first rotational frequency and
      the heterodyned difference between frequencies are identical. All
      of the upper level rotational frequencies are harmonics of the
      first frequency. This relationship is not as apparent when one
      deals only with the rotational constant"B"of the prior art.
      However, frequency-based spectral chemistry analyses, like those
      of the present invention, makes such concepts easier to
      understand.<br>
      <br>
      Examination of the first level rotational frequencies for LiF
      shows that it is nearly identical to the heterodyned difference
      between it and the second level rotational frequency.<br>
      <br>
      The rotational frequencies are sequential harmonics of the first
      rotational frequency.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, if a molecule is stimulated with a frequency equal to
      2B (i. e., a heterodyned harmonic difference between rotational
      frequencies) the present invention teaches that energy will
      resonate with all the upper rotational frequencies indirectly
      through heterodynes, and resonate directly with the first
      rotational frequency. This is an important discovery.<br>
      <br>
      The prior art discloses a number of constants used in spectroscopy
      that relate in some way or another to the frequencies of atoms and
      molecule, just as the rotational constant"B" relates to the
      harmonic spacing of rotational fine structure molecular
      frequencies. The alpha (a) rotation-vibration constant is a good
      example of this. The alpha rotation-vibration frequency constant
      is related to slight changes in the frequencies for the same
      rotational level, when the vibrational level changes. For example,
      Figure 43 a shows the frequencies for the same rotational levels,
      but different vibrational levels for LiF. The frequencies are
      almost the same, but vary by a few percent between the different
      vibrational levels.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to Figure 43b, the differences between all the
      frequencies for the various rotational transitions at different
      vibrational levels of Figure 43 a are shown. The rotational
      transition 0--- &gt; 1 in the top line of Figure 43b has a
      frequency of 89,740.46 MHz at vibrational level 0. At vibrational
      level 1, the 0- 1 transition is 88,319.18 MHz. The difference
      between these two rotational frequencies is 1,421.28 MHz. At
      vibrational level 2, the 0 ~ 1 transition is 86,921.20 MHz. The
      difference between it and the vibrational level 1 frequency
      (88,319.18 MHz) is 1,397.98 MHz. These slight differences for the
      same J rotational level between different vibrational levels are
      nearly identical. For the J = 0--+ I rotational level they center
      around a frequency of 1,400 MHz.<br>
      <br>
      For the J = 1- 2 transition, the differences center around 2,800
      Hz, and for the<br>
      J = 2- &gt; 3 transition, the differences center around 4,200 Hz.
      These different frequencies of 1,400,2,800 and 4,200, Hz etc., are
      all harmonics of each other. Further, they are all harmonics of
      the alpha rotation-vibration constant. Just as the actual
      molecular rotational frequencies are harmonics of the rotational
      constant B, the differences between the rotational frequencies are
      harmonics of the alpha rotation-vibration constant. Accordingly,
      if a molecule is stimulated with a frequency equal to the alpha
      vibration-rotation frequencies, the present invention teaches that
      energy will resonate with all the rotational frequencies
      indirectly through heterodynes. This is an important discovery.<br>
      <br>
      Consider the rotational and vibrational states for the triatomic
      molecule OCS shown in Figure 44. Figure 44 shows the same
      rotational level (J = 1 ~ 2) for different vibrational states in
      the OCS molecule. For the ground vibrational (000) level, J = 1 #
      2 transition; and the excited vibrational state (100) J = 1- 2
      transition, the difference between the two frequencies is equal to
      4 X alpha, (4al). In another excited state, the frequency
      difference between the ground vibrational (000) level, J = I--+ 2
      transition, and the center of the two 1- type doublets is 4 X
      alpha2 (4a2). In a higher excited vibrational state, the frequency
      difference between (000) and (02 0) is 8 X alpha2 (8a2). Thus, it
      can be seen that the rotation-vibration constants"a"are actually
      harmonics of molecular frequencies. Thus, according to the present
      invention, stimulating a molecule with an"a"frequency, or a
      harmonic of"a", will either directly resonate with or indirectly
      heterodyne harmonically with various rotational-vibrational
      frequencies of the molecule.<br>
      <br>
      Another interesting constant is the l-type doubling constant. This
      constant is also shown in Figure 44. Specifically, Figure 44 shows
      the rotational transition J = 1 # 2 for the triatomic molecule
      OCS. Just as the atomic frequencies are sometimes split into
      doublets or multiplets, the rotational frequencies are also
      sometimes split into doublets. The difference between them is
      called the l-type doubling constant. These constants are usually
      smaller (i. e., of a lower frequency) than the a constants. For
      the OCS molecule, the a constants are 20.56 and 10.56 MHz while
      the l-type doubling constant is 6.3 MHz. These frequencies are all
      in the radiowave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      As discussed previously herein, energy is transferred by two
      fundamental frequency mechanisms. If frequencies are substantially
      the same or match, then energy transfers by direct resonance.
      Energy can also transfer indirectly by heterodyning, (i. e., the
      frequencies substantially match after having been added or
      subtracted with another frequency). Further, as previously stated,
      the direct or indirect resonant frequencies do not have to match
      exactly.<br>
      <br>
      If they are merely close, significant amounts of energy will still
      transfer. Any of these constants or frequencies that are related
      to molecules or other matter via heterodynes, can be used to
      transfer, for example, energy to the matter and hence can directly
      interact with the matter.<br>
      <br>
      In the reaction in which hydrogen and oxygen are combined to form
      water, the present invention teaches that the energizing of the
      reaction intermediates of atomic hydrogen and the hydroxy radical
      are crucial to sustaining the reaction. In this regard, the
      physical catalyst platinum energizes both reaction intermediates
      by directly and indirectly resonating with them. Platinum also
      energizes the intermediates at multiple energy levels, creating
      the conditions for energy amplification. The present invention
      also teaches how to copy platinum's mechanism of action by making
      use of atomic fine structure frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      The invention has previously discussed resonating with the fine
      structure frequencies with only slight variations between the
      frequencies (e. g., 456.676 and 456.686 THz).<br>
      <br>
      However, indirectly resonating with the fine structure
      frequencies, is a significant difference.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, by using the fine splitting frequencies, which are
      simply the differences or heterodynes between the fine structure
      frequencies, the present invention teaches that indirect resonance
      can be achieved. By examining the hydrogen 456 THz fine structure
      and fine splitting frequencies (see, for example, Figures 30 and
      31 and Table 3 many heterodynes are shown). In other words, the
      difference between the fine structure frequencies can be
      calculated as follows:<br>
      456.686 THz-456. 676 THz = 0.0102 THz = 10. 2 GHz<br>
      Thus, if hydrogen atoms are subjected to 10.2 GHz electromagnetic
      energy (i. e., energy corresponding to microwaves), then the 456
      THz electronic spectrum frequency is energized by resonating with
      it indirectly. In other words, the 10.2 GHz will add to 456.676
      THz to produce the resonant frequency of 456.686 THz. The 10.2 GHz
      will also subtract from the 456.686 THz to produce the resonant
      frequency of 456.676 THz. Thus, by introducing 10.2<br>
      GHz to a hydrogen atom, the hydrogen atom is excited at the 456
      THz frequency. A microwave frequency can be used to stimulate an
      electronic level.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention, it is also possible to use a
      combination of mimicked catalyst mechanisms. For example, it is
      possible to: 1) resonate with the hydrogen atom frequencies
      indirectly through heterodynes (i. e., fine splitting frequencies)
      ; and/or 2) resonate with the hydrogen atom at multiple
      frequencies. Such multiple resonating could occur using a
      combination of microwave frequencies either simultaneously, in
      sequence, and/or in chirps or bursts. For example, the individual
      microwave fine splitting frequencies for hydrogen of 10.87 GHz,
      10.2 GHz, 3.23 GHz, 1.38 GHz, and 1.06 GHz could be used in a
      sequence. Further, there are many fine splitting frequencies for
      hydrogen that have not been expressly included herein, thus,
      depending on the frequency range of equipment available, the
      present invention provides a means for tailoring the chosen
      frequencies to the capabilities of the available equipment. Thus,
      the flexibility according to the teachings of the present
      invention is enormous.<br>
      <br>
      Another method to deliver multiple electromagnetic energy
      frequencies according to the present invention, is to use a lower
      frequency as a carrier wave for a higher frequency.<br>
      <br>
      This can be done, for example, by producing 10.2 GHz EM energy in
      short bursts, with the bursts coming at a rate of about 239 MHz.
      Both of these frequencies are fine splitting frequencies for
      hydrogen. This can also be achieved by continuously delivering EM
      energy and by varying the amplitude at a rate of about 239 MHz.
      These techniques can be used alone or in combination with the
      various other techniques disclosed herein.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, by mimicking one or more mechanisms of action of catalysts
      and by making use of the atomic fine structure and splitting
      frequencies, it is possible to energize upper levels of atoms
      using microwave and radiowave frequencies. Accordingly, by
      selectively energizing or targeting particular atoms, it is
      possible to catalyze and guide desirable reactions to desired end
      products. Depending on the circumstances, the option to use lower
      frequencies may have many advantages. Lower frequencies typically
      have much better penetration into large reaction spaces and
      volumes, and may be better suited to large-scale industrial
      applications. Lower frequencies may be easier to deliver with
      portable, compact equipment, as opposed to large, bulky equipment
      which delivers higher frequencies (e. g., lasers). The choice of
      frequencies of a spectral catalyst may be for as simple a reason
      as to avoid interference from other sources of EM energy. Thus,
      according to the present invention, an understanding of the basic
      processes of heterodyning and fine structure splitting frequencies
      confers greater flexibility in designing and applying spectral
      energy catalysts in a targeted manner. Specifically, rather than
      simply reproducing the spectral pattern of a physical catalyst,
      the present invention teaches that is possible to make full use of
      the entire range of frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum,
      so long as the teachings of the present invention are followed.
      Thus, certain desirable frequencies can be applied while other not
      so desirable frequencies could be left out of an applied spectral
      energy catalyst targeted to a particular participant and/or
      component in the reaction system.<br>
      <br>
      As a further example, reference is again made to the hydrogen and
      oxygen reaction for the formation of water. If it is desired to
      catalyze the water reaction by duplicating the catalyst's
      mechanism of action in the microwave region, the present invention
      teaches that several options are available. Another such option is
      use of the knowledge that platinum energizes the reaction
      intermediates of the hydroxy radical. In addition to the hydrogen
      atom, the B frequency for the hydroxy radical is 565.8 GHz. That
      means that the actual heterodyned difference between the
      rotational frequencies is 2B, or 1,131.6 GHz.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, such a frequency could be utilized to achieve
      excitement of the hydroxy radical intermediate.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the a constant for the hydroxy radical is 21.4 GHz.
      Accordingly, this frequency could also be applied to energizing
      the hydroxy radical. Thus, by introducing hydrogen and oxygen
      gases into a chamber and irradiating the gases with 21.4 GHz,
      water will be formed. This particular gigahertz energy is a
      harmonic heterodyne of the rotational frequencies for the same
      rotational level but different vibrational levels. The heterodyned
      frequency energizes all the rotational frequencies, which energize
      the vibrational levels, which energize the electronic frequencies,
      which catalyze the reaction. Accordingly, the aforementioned
      reaction could be catalyzed or targeted with a spectral catalyst
      applied at several applicable frequencies, all of which match with
      one or more frequencies in one or more participants and thus
      permit energy to transfer.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, delivery of frequencies of 565.8 GHz, or even
      1,131.6 GHz, would result in substantially all of the rotational
      levels in the molecule becoming energized, from the ground state
      all the way up. This approach copies a catalyst mechanism of
      action in two ways. The first way is by energizing the hydroxy
      radical and sustaining a crucial reaction intermediate to catalyze
      the formation of water. The second mechanism copied from the
      catalyst is to energize multiple levels in the molecule. Because
      the rotational constant"B" relates to the rotational frequencies,
      heterodynes occur at all levels in the molecule. Thus, using the
      frequency"B"energizes all levels in the molecule. This potentiates
      the establishment of an energy amplification system such as that
      which occurs with the physical catalyst platinum.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, if a molecule was energized with a frequency
      corresponding to an l-type doubling constant, such frequency could
      be used in a substantially similar manner in which a fine
      splitting frequency from an atomic spectrum is used. The
      difference between the two frequencies in a doublet is a
      heterodyne, and energizing the doublet with its'heterodyne
      frequency (i. e., the splitting frequency) would energize the
      basic frequency and catalyze the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      A still further example utilizes a combination of frequencies for
      atomic fine structure.<br>
      <br>
      For instance, by utilizing a constant central frequency of 1,131.6
      GHz (i. e., the heterodyned difference between rotational
      frequencies for a hydroxy radical) with a vibrato varying around
      the central frequency by i 21.4 GHz (i. e., the a constant
      harmonic for variations between rotational frequencies), use could
      be made of 1.131.6 GHz EM energy in short bursts, with the bursts
      coming at a rate of 21.4 GHz.<br>
      <br>
      Since there is slight variation between rotational frequencies for
      the same level, that frequency range can be used to construct
      bursts. For example, if the largest"B"is 565.8<br>
      GHz, then a rotational frequency heterodyne corresponds to 1,131.6
      GHz. If the smallest"B" is 551.2 GHz, this corresponds to a
      rotational frequency heterodyne of 1,102 GHz. Thus, "chirps"or
      bursts of energy starting at 1,100 GHz and increasing in frequency
      to 1,140 GHz, could be used. In fact, the transmitter could be set
      to"chirp"or burst at a rate of 21.4 GHz.<br>
      <br>
      In any event, there are many ways to make use of the atomic and
      molecular fine structure frequencies, with their attendant
      heterodynes and harmonics. An understanding of catalyst mechanisms
      of action enables one of ordinary skill armed with the teachings
      of the present invention to utilize a spectral catalyst from the
      high frequency ultraviolet and visible light regions, down into
      the sometimes more manageable microwave and radiowave regions.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the invention enables an artisan of ordinary skill to
      calculate and/or determine the effects of microwave and radiowave
      energies on chemical reactions and/or reaction pathways.<br>
      <br>
      <b>HYPERFINE FREQUENCIES</b><br>
      Hyperfine structure frequencies are similar to the fine structure
      frequencies. Fine structure frequencies can be seen by magnifying
      a portion of a standard frequency spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      Hyperfine frequencies can be seen by magnifying a portion of a
      fine structure spectrum. Fine structure splitting frequencies
      occur at lower frequencies than the electronic spectra, primarily
      in the infrared and microwave regions of the electromagnetic
      spectrum. Hyperfine splitting frequencies occur at even lower
      frequencies than the fine structure spectra, primarily in the
      microwave and radio wave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.
      Fine structure frequencies are generally caused by at least the
      electron interacting with its'own magnetic field. Hyperfine
      frequencies are generally caused by at least the electron
      interacting with the magnetic field of the nucleus.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 36 shows the rotation-vibration band frequency spectra for
      an SF6 molecule.<br>
      <br>
      The rotation-vibration band and fine structure are shown again in
      Figure 45. However, the fine structure frequencies are seen by
      magnifying a small section of the standard vibrational band
      spectrum (i. e., the lower portion of Figure 45 shows some of the
      fine structure frequencies). In many respects, looking at fine
      structure frequencies is like using a magnifying glass to look at
      a standard spectrum. Magnification of what looks like a flat and
      uninteresting portion of a standard vibrational frequency band
      shows many more curves with lower frequency splitting. These many
      other curves are the fine structure curves. Similarly, by
      magnifying a small and seemingly uninteresting portion of the fine
      structure spectrum of the result is yet another spectrum of many
      more curves known as the hyperfine spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      A small portion (i. e., from zero to 300) of the SF6 fine
      structure spectrum is magnified in Figure 46. The hyperfine
      spectrum includes many curves split part by even lower
      frequencies. This time the fine structure spectrum was magnified
      instead of the regular vibrational spectrum. What is found is even
      more curves, even closer together. Figures 47a and 47b show a
      further magnification of the two curves marked with asterisks (i.
      e.,"*"and "**") in Figure 46.<br>
      <br>
      What appears to be a single crisp curve in Figure 46, turns out to
      be a series of several curves spaced very close together. These
      are the hyperfine frequency curves. Accordingly, the fine
      structure spectra is comprised of several more curves spaced very
      close together.<br>
      <br>
      These other curves spaced even closer together correspond to the
      hyperfine frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      Figures 47a and 47b show that the spacing of the hyperfine
      frequency curves are very close together and at somewhat regular
      intervals. The small amount that the hyperfine curves are split
      apart is called the hyperfine splitting frequency. The hyperfine
      splitting frequency is also a heterodyne. This concept is
      substantially similar to the concept of the fine splitting
      frequency. The difference between two curves that are split apart
      is called a splitting frequency. As before, the difference between
      two curves is referred to as a heterodyne frequency. So, hyperfine
      splitting frequencies are all heterodynes of hyperfine
      frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      Because the hyperfine frequency curves result from a magnification
      of the fine structure curves, the hyperfine splitting frequencies
      occur at only a fraction of the fine structure splitting
      frequencies. The fine structure splitting frequencies are really
      just several curves, spaced very close together around the regular
      spectrum frequency. Magnification of fine structure splitting
      frequencies results in hyperfine splitting frequencies. The
      hyperfine splitting frequencies are really just several more
      curves, spaced very close together. The closer together the curves
      are, the smaller the distance or frequency separating them. Now
      the distance separating any two curves is a heterodyne frequency.
      So, the closer together any two curves are, the smaller (lower) is
      the heterodyne frequency between them. The distance between
      hyperfine splitting frequencies (i. e., the amount that hyperfine
      frequencies are split apart) is the hyperfine splitting frequency.
      It can also be called a constant or interval.<br>
      <br>
      The electronic spectrum frequency of hydrogen is 2,466 THz. The
      2,466 THz frequency is made up of fine structure curves spaced
      10.87 GHz (0.01087 THz) apart. Thus, the fine splitting frequency
      is 10.87 GHz. Now the fine structure curves are made up of
      hyperfine curves. These hyperfine curves are spaced just 23.68 and
      59.21 MHz apart. Thus, 23 and 59 MHz are both hyperfine splitting
      frequencies for hydrogen. Other hyperfine splitting frequencies
      for hydrogen include 2.71,4.21,7.02,17.55,52.63,177.64, and

      MHz. The hyperfine splitting frequencies are spaced even closer
      together than the fine structure splitting frequencies, so the
      hyperfine splitting frequencies are smaller and lower than the
      fine splitting frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the hyperfine splitting frequencies are lower than the fine
      splitting frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      This means that rather than being in the infrared and microwave
      regions, as the fine splitting frequencies can be, the hyperfine
      splitting frequencies are in the microwave and radiowave regions.
      These lower frequencies are in the MHz (106 hertz) and Khz (103
      hertz) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Several of the
      hyperfine splitting frequencies for hydrogen are shown in Figure
      48. (Figure 48 shows hyperfine structure in the n = 2 to n = 3
      transition of hydrogen).<br>
      <br>
      Figure 49 shows the hyperfine frequencies for CH3I. These
      frequencies are a magnification of the fine structure frequencies
      for that molecule. Since fine structure frequencies for molecules
      are actually rotational frequencies, what is shown is actually the
      hyperfine splitting of rotational frequencies. Figure 49 shows the
      hyperfine splitting of just the J = 1- 2 rotational transition.
      The splitting between the two tallest curves is less than 100 MHz.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 50 shows another example of the molecule C1CN. This set of
      hyperfine frequencies is from the J == 1- 2 transition of the
      ground vibrational state for C1CN. Notice that the hyperfine
      frequencies are separated by just a few megahertz, (MHz) and in a
      few places by less than even one megahertz.<br>
      <br>
      The energy-level diagram and spectrum of the J = l/2 ~ 3/2
      rotational transition for<br>
      NO is shown if Figure 51.<br>
      <br>
      In Figure 52, the hyperfine splitting frequencies for NH3 are
      shown. Notice that the frequencies are spaced so close together
      that the scale at the bottom is in kilohertz (Kc/sec).<br>
      <br>
      The hyperfine features of the lines were obtained using a beam
      spectrometer.<br>
      <br>
      Just as with fine splitting frequencies, the hyperfine splitting
      frequencies are heterodynes of atomic and molecular frequencies.
      Accordingly, if an atom or molecule is stimulated with a frequency
      equal to a hyperfine splitting frequency (a heterodyned difference
      between hyperfine frequencies), the present invention teaches that
      the energy will equal to a hyperfine splitting frequency will
      resonate with the hyperfine frequencies indirectly through
      heterodynes. The related rotational, vibrational, and/or
      electronic energy levels will, in turn, be stimulated. This is an
      important discovery. It allows one to use more radio and microwave
      frequencies to selectively stimulate and target specific reaction
      system components (e. g., atomic hydrogen intermediates can be
      stimulated with, for example, (2.55, 23.68 59.2 and/or 1,420 MHz).<br>
      <br>
      Hyperfine frequencies, like fine frequencies, also contain
      features such as doublets.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, in a region where one would expect to find only a
      single hyperfine frequency curve, there are two curves instead.
      Typically, one on either side of the location where a single
      hyperfine frequency was expected. Hyperfine doubling is shown in
      Figures 53 and 54.<br>
      <br>
      This hyperfine spectrum is also from NH3. Figure 53 corresponds to
      the J = 3 rotational level and Figure 54 corresponds to the J = 4
      rotational level. The doubling can be seen most easily in the J =
      3 curves (i. e., Figure 53). There are two sets of short curves, a
      tall one, and then two more short sets. Each of the short sets of
      curves is generally located where one would expect to find just
      one curve. There are two curves instead, one on either side of the
      main curve location. Each set of curves is a hyperfine doublet.<br>
      <br>
      There are different notations to indicate the source of the
      doubling such as l-type doubling, K doubling, and A doubling,
      etc., and they all have their own constants or intervals.<br>
      <br>
      Without going into the detailed theory behind the formation of
      various types of doublets, the interval between any two hyperfine
      multiplet curves is also a heterodyne, and thus all of these
      doubling constants represent frequency heterodynes. Accordingly,
      those frequency heterodynes (i. e., hyperfine constants) can also
      be used as spectral energy catalysts according to the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, a frequency in an atom or molecule can be stimulated
      directly or indirectly. If the goal was to stimulate the 2,466 THz
      frequency of hydrogen for some reason, then, for example, an
      ultraviolet laser could irradiate the hydrogen with 2,466 THz
      electromagnetic radiation. This would stimulate the atom directly.
      However, if such a laser was unavailable, then hydrogen's fine
      structure splitting frequency of 10.87 GHz could be achieved with
      microwave equipment. The gigahertz frequency would heterodyne (i.
      e., add or subtract) with the two closely spaced fine structure
      curves at 2,466, and stimulate the 2,466<br>
      THz frequency band. This would stimulate the atom indirectly.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, the atom could be stimulated by using the hyperfine
      splitting frequency for hydrogen at 23.68 MHz as produced by
      radiowave equipment. The 23.68 MHz frequency would heterodyne (i.
      e., add or subtract) with the two closely spaced hyperfine
      frequency curves at 2,466, and stimulate the fine structure curves
      at the 2,466 THz. Stimulation of the fine structure curves would
      in turn lead to stimulation of the 2,466 THz electronic frequency
      for the hydrogen atom.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, additional hyperfine splitting frequencies for
      hydrogen in the radiowave and microwave portions of the
      electromagnetic spectrum could also be used to stimulate the atom.
      For example, a radio wave pattern with 2.7 MHz, 4.2 MHz, 7 MHz, 18
      MHz, 23 MHz, 52 MHz, and 59 MHz could be used. This would
      stimulate several different hyperfine frequencies of hydrogen, and
      it would stimulate them essentially all at the same time. This
      would cause stimulation of the fine structure frequencies, which
      in turn would stimulate the electronic frequencies in the hydrogen
      atom.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, depending on available equipment and/or design,
      and/or processing constraints, some delivery mode variations can
      also be used. For example, one of the lower frequencies could be a
      carrier frequency for the upper frequencies. A continuous
      frequency of 52 MHz could be varied in amplitude at a rate of 2.7
      MHz. Or, a 59 MHz frequency could be pulsed at a rate of 4.2 MHz.
      There are various ways in which these frequencies can be combined
      and/or delivered, including different wave shapes durations,
      intensity shapes, duty cycles, etc. Depending on which of the
      hyperfine splitting frequencies are stimulated, the evolution of,
      for example, various and specific transients may be precisely
      tailored and controlled, allowing precise control over reaction
      systems using the fine and/or hyperfine splitting frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, a major point of the present invention is once it is
      understood the energy transfers when frequencies match, then
      determining which frequencies are available for matching is the
      next step. This invention discloses precisely how to achieve that
      goal.<br>
      <br>
      Interactions between equipment limitations, processing
      constraints, etc., can decide which frequencies are best suited
      for a particular purpose. Thus, both direct resonance and indirect
      resonance are suitable approaches for the use of spectral energy
      catalysts.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ELECTRIC FIELDS</b><br>
      Another means for modifying the spectral pattern of substances, is
      to expose a substance to an electric field. Specifically, in the
      presence of an electric field, spectral frequency lines of atoms
      and molecules can be split, shifted, broadened, or changed in
      intensity. The effect of an electric field on spectral lines is
      known as the"Stark Effect", in honor of its'discoverer, J. Stark.
      In 1913, Stark discovered that the Balmer series of hydrogen (i.
      e., curve II of Figures 9a and 9b) was split into several
      different components, while Stark was using a high electric field
      in the presence of a hydrogen flame. In the intervening years,
      Stark's original observation has evolved into a separate branch of
      spectroscopy, namely the study of the structure of atoms and
      molecules by measuring the changes in their respective spectral
      lines caused by an electric field.<br>
      <br>
      The electric field effects have some similarities to fine and
      hyperfine splitting frequencies. Specifically, as previously
      discussed herein, fine structure and hyperfine structure
      frequencies, along with their low frequency splitting or coupling
      constants, were caused by interactions inside the atom or
      molecule, between the electric field of the electron and the
      magnetic field of the electron or nucleus. Electric field effects
      are similar, except that instead of the electric field coming from
      inside the atom, the electric field is applied from outside the
      atom. The Stark effect is primarily the interaction of an external
      electric field, from outside the atom or molecule, with the
      electric and magnetic fields already established within the atom
      or molecule.<br>
      <br>
      When examining electric field effects on atoms, molecules, ions
      and/or components thereof, the nature of the electric field should
      also be considered (e. g., such as whether the electric field is
      static or dynamic). A static electric field may be produced by a
      direct current.<br>
      <br>
      A dynamic electric field is time varying, and may be produced by
      an alternating current. If the electric field is from an
      alternating current, then the frequency of the alternating current
      compared to the frequencies of the, for instance atom or molecule,
      should also be considered.<br>
      <br>
      In atoms, an external electric field disturbs the charge
      distribution of the atom's electrons. This disturbance of the
      electron's own electric field induces a dipole moment in it (i.
      e., slightly lopsided charge distribution). This lopsided electron
      dipole moment then interacts with the external electric field. In
      other words, the external electric field first induces a dipole
      moment in the electron field, and then interacts with the dipole.
      The end result is that the atomic frequencies become split into
      several different frequencies. The amount the frequencies are
      split apart depends on the strength of the electric field. In
      other words, the stronger the electric field, the farther apart
      the splitting.<br>
      <br>
      If the splitting varies directly with the electric field strength,
      then it is called first order splitting (i. e., Av = AF where Av
      is the splitting frequency, A is a constant and F is the electric
      field strength. When the splitting varies with the square of the
      field strength, it is called a second order or quadriatic effect
      (i. e., Av = BF2). One or both effects may be seen in various
      forms of matter. For example, the hydrogen atom exhibits first
      order Stark effects at low electric field strengths, and second
      order effects at high field strengths. Other electric field
      effects which vary with the cube or the fourth power, etc., of the
      electric field strength are less studied, but produce splitting
      frequencies nonetheless. A second order electric field effect for
      potassium is shown in Figures 55 and 56. Figure 55 shows the
      schematic dependence of the 4s and 5p energy levels on the
      electric field. Figure 56 shows a plot of the deviation from
      zero-field positions of the 5p2 P112. 3/2 v 4S2 S1/2 transition
      wavenumbers against the square of the electric field. Note that
      the frequency splitting or separation of the frequencies (i. e.,
      deviation from zero-field wavenumber) varies with the square of
      the electric field strength (v/cm) 2.<br>
      <br>
      The mechanism for the Stark effect in molecules is simpler than
      the effect is in atoms.<br>
      <br>
      Most molecules already have an electric dipole moment (i. e., a
      slightly uneven charge distribution). The external electric field
      simply interacts with the electric dipole moment already inside
      the molecule. The type of interaction, a first or a second order
      Stark effect, is different for differently shaped molecules. For
      example, most symmetric top molecules have first-order Stark
      effects. Asymmetric rotors typically have second-order Stark
      effects. Thus, in molecules, as in atoms, the splitting or
      separation of the frequencies due to the external electric field,
      is proportional either to the electric field strength itself, or
      to the square of the electric field strength.<br>
      <br>
      An example of this is shown in Figure 57, which diagrams how
      frequency components of the J = 0-- &gt; 1 rotational transition
      for the molecule CHsCI respond to an external electric field. When
      the electric field is very small (e. g., less than 10 E2
      esu2/cm2), the primary effect is shifting of the three rotational
      frequencies to higher frequencies. As the field strength is
      increased (e. g., between 10 and 20 E2 esu2/cm2), the three
      rotational frequencies split into five different frequencies. With
      continued increases in the electric field strength, the now five
      frequencies continue to shift to even higher frequencies. Some of
      the intervals or differences between the five frequencies remain
      the same regardless of the electric field strength, while other
      intervals become progressively larger and higher. Thus, a
      heterodyned frequency might stimulate splitting frequencies at one
      electric field strength, but not at another.<br>
      <br>
      Another molecular example is shown in Figure 58. (This is a
      diagram of the Stark<br>
      Effect in the same OCS molecule shown in Figure 44 for the J = 1 ~
      2). The J= I--* 2 rotational transition frequency is shown
      centered at zero on the horizontal frequency axis in<br>
      Figure 58. That frequency centered at zero is a single frequency
      when there is no external electric field. When an electric field
      is added, however, the single rotational frequency splits into
      two. The stronger the electric field is, the wider the splitting
      is between the two frequencies. One of the new frequencies shifts
      up higher and higher, while the other frequency shifts lower and
      lower. Because the difference between the two frequencies changes
      when the electric field strength changes, a heterodyned splitting
      frequency might stimulate the rotational level at one electric
      field strength, but not at another. An electric field can effect
      the spectral frequencies of reaction participants, and thus impact
      the spectral chemistry of a reaction.<br>
      <br>
      Broadening and shifting of spectral lines also occurs with the
      intermolecular Stark effect. The intermolecular Stark effect is
      produced when the electric field from surrounding atoms, ions, or
      molecules, affects the spectral emissions of the species under
      study. In other words, the external electric field comes from
      other atoms and molecules rather than from a<br>
      DC or AC current. The other atoms and molecules are in constant
      motion, and thus their electric fields are inhomogeneous in space
      and time. Instead of a frequency being split into several easily
      seen narrow frequencies, the original frequency simply becomes
      much wider, encompassing most, if not all, of what would have been
      the split frequencies, (i. e., it is broadened). Solvents, support
      materials, poisons, promoters, etc., are co+mposed of atoms and
      molecules and components thereof. It is now understood that many
      of their effects are the result of the intermolecular Stark
      effect.<br>
      <br>
      The above examples demonstrate how an electric field splits,
      shifts, and broadens spectral frequencies for matter. However,
      intensities of the lines can also be affected. Some of these
      variations in intensity are shown in Figures 59a and 59b. Figure
      59a shows patterns of Stark components for transitions in the
      rotation of an asymmetric top molecule for the J = 4--), 5
      transition; whereas Figure 59b corresponds to J = 4- 4. The
      intensity variations depend on rotational transitions, molecular
      structure, etc., and the electric field strength.<br>
      <br>
      An interesting Stark effect is shown in a structure such as a
      molecule, which has hyperfine (rotational) frequencies. The
      general rule for the creation of hyperfine frequencies is that the
      hyperfine frequencies result from an interaction between electrons
      and the nucleus.<br>
      <br>
      This interaction can be affected by an external electric field. If
      the applied external electric field is weak, then the Stark energy
      is much less than the energy of the hyperfine energy (i. e.,
      rotational energy). The hyperfine lines are split into various new
      lines, and the separation (i. e., splitting) between the lines is
      very small (i. e., at radio frequencies and extra low
      frequencies).<br>
      <br>
      If the external electric field is very strong, then the Stark
      energy is much larger than the hyperfine energy, and the molecule
      is tossed, sometimes violently, back and forth by the electric
      field. In this case, the hyperfine structure is radically changed.
      It is almost as though there no longer is any hyperfine structure.
      The Stark splitting is substantially the same as that which would
      have been observed if there were no hyperfine frequencies, and the
      hyperfine frequencies simply act as a small perturbation to the
      Stark splitting frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      If the external electric field is intermediate in strength, then
      the Stark and hyperfine energies are substantially equivalent. In
      this case, the calculations become very complex.<br>
      <br>
      Generally, the Stark splitting is close to the same frequencies as
      the hyperfine splitting, but the relative intensities of the
      various components can vary rapidly with slight changes in the
      strength of the external electric field. Thus, at one electric
      field strength one splitting frequency may predominate, while at
      an electric field strength just 1% higher, a totally different
      Stark frequency could predominate in intensity.<br>
      <br>
      All of the preceding discussion on the Stark effect has
      concentrated on the effects due to a static electric field, such
      as one would find with a direct current. The Stark effects of a
      dynamic, or time-varying electric field produced by an alternating
      current, are quite interesting and can be quite different. Just
      which of those affects appear, depends on the frequency of the
      electric field (i. e., alternating current) compared to the
      frequency of the matter in question. If the electric field is
      varying very slowly, such as with 60 Hz wall outlet electricity,
      then the normal or static type of electric field effect occurs. As
      the electric field varies from zero to maximum field strength, the
      matter frequencies vary from their unsplit frequencies to their
      maximally split frequencies at the rate of the changing electric
      field.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the electric field frequency modulates the frequency of the
      splitting phenomena.<br>
      <br>
      However, as the electrical frequency increases, the first
      frequency measurement it will begin to overtake is the line width
      (see Figure 16 for a diagram of line width). The line width of a
      curve is its'distance across, and the measurement is actually a
      very tiny heterodyne frequency measurement from one side of the
      curve to the other side. Line width frequencies are typically
      around 100 KHz at room temperature. In practical terms, line width
      represents a relaxation time for molecules, where the relaxation
      time is the time required for any transient phenomena to
      disappear. So, if the electrical frequency is significantly
      smaller than the line width frequency, the molecule has plenty of
      time to adjust to the slowly changing electric field, and the
      normal or static-type Stark effects occur.<br>
      <br>
      If the electrical frequency is slightly less than the line width
      frequency, the molecule changes its'frequencies substantially in
      rhythm with the frequency of the electric field (i. e., it
      entrains to the frequency of the electric field). This is shown in
      Figure 60 which shows the<br>
      Stark effect for OCS on the J =1- &gt; 2 transition with applied
      electric fields at various frequencies. The letter"a"corresponds
      to the Stark effect with a static DC electric field;"b"
      corresponds to a broadening and blurring of the Stark frequencies
      with a 1 KHz electric field ; and"c"corresponds to a normal Stark
      effect with an electric field of 1,200 KHz.. As the electric field
      frequency approaches the KHz line width range, the Stark curves
      vary their frequencies with the electric field frequency and
      become broadened and somewhat blurred.<br>
      <br>
      When the electric field frequency moves up and beyond the line
      width range to about 1,200<br>
      KHz, the normal Stark type curves again become crisp and
      distinguishable. In many respects, the molecule cannot keep up
      with the rapid electrical field variation and simply averages the
      Stark effect. In all three cases, the cyclic splitting of the
      Stark frequencies is modulated with the electrical field
      frequency, or its'first harmonic (i. e., 2X the electrical field
      frequency).<br>
      <br>
      The next frequency measurement that an ever-increasing electrical
      frequency will overtake in a molecule is the transitional
      frequency between two rotational levels (i. e., hyperfine
      frequencies). As the electric field frequency approaches a
      transitional frequency between two levels, the radiation of the
      transitional frequency in the molecule will induce transitions
      back and forth between the levels. The molecule oscillates back
      and forth between both levels, at the frequency of the electric
      field. When the electric field and transition level frequencies
      are substantially the same (i. e., in resonance), the molecule
      will be oscillating back and forth in both levels, and the
      spectral lines for both levels will appear simultaneously and at
      approximately the same intensity. Normally, only one frequency
      level is seen at a time, but a resonant electric field causes the
      molecule to be at both levels at essentially the same time, and so
      both transitional frequencies appear in its'spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, for sufficiently large electric fields (e. g., those
      used to generate plasmas) additional transition level frequencies
      can occur at regular spacings substantially equal to the electric
      field frequency. Also, splitting of the transition level
      frequencies can occur, at frequencies of the electric field
      frequency divided by odd numbers (e. g., electric field
      frequency"fE"divided by 3, or 5, or 7, i. e., fE/3 or fE/5, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      All the varied effects of electric fields cause new frequencies,
      new splitting frequencies and new energy level states.<br>
      <br>
      Further, when the electric field frequency equals a transition
      level frequency of for instance, an atom or molecule, a second
      component with an opposite frequency charge and equal intensity
      can develop. This is negative Stark effect, with the two
      components of equal and opposite frequency charges destructively
      canceling each other. In spectral chemistry terms this amounts to
      a negative catalyst or poison in the reaction system, if the
      transition thus targeted was important to the reaction pathway.
      Thus, electric fields cause the Stark effect, which is the
      splitting, shifting, broadening, or changing intensity and
      changing transitional states of spectral frequencies for matter,
      (e. g., atoms and molecules). As with many of the other mechanisms
      that have been discussed herein, changes in the spectral
      frequencies of reaction systems can affect the reaction rate
      and/or reaction pathway. For example, consider a reaction system
      like the following: C C A + B- Intermediates-D+F where A &amp; B
      are reactants, C is a physical catalyst, I stands for the
      intermediates, and D &amp; F are the products.<br>
      <br>
      Assume arguendo that the reaction normally progresses at only, a
      moderate rate, by virtue of the fact that the physical catalyst
      produces several frequencies that are merely close to harmonics of
      the intermediates. Further assume that when an electric field is
      added, the catalyst frequencies are shifted so that several of the
      catalyst frequencies are now exact or substantially exact
      harmonics of the intermediates. This will result in, for example,
      the reaction being catalyzed at a faster rate. Thus, the Stark
      effect can be used to obtain a more efficient energy transfer
      through the matching of frequencies (i. e., when frequencies
      match, energies transfer).<br>
      <br>
      If a reaction normally progresses at only a moderate rate,
      many"solutions"have included subjecting the reaction system to
      extremely high pressures. The high pressures result in a
      broadening of the spectral patterns, which improves the transfer
      of energy through a matching of resonant frequencies. By
      understanding the underlying catalyst mechanisms of action, high
      pressure systems could be replaced with, for example, a simple
      electric field which produces broadening. Not only would this be
      less costly to an industrial manufacturer, it could be much safer
      for manufacturing due to the removal of, for example, high
      pressure equipment.<br>
      <br>
      Some reactants when mixed together do not react very quickly at
      all, but when an electric field is added they react rather
      rapidly. The prior art may refer to such a reaction as being
      catalyzed by an electric field and the equations would look like
      this:<br>
      E A+B &gt; D+FandA+B- &gt; D+F where E is the electric field. In
      this case, rather than applying a catalyst"C" (as discussed
      previously) to obtain the products"D + F", an electric field"E"can
      be applied. In this instance, the electric field works by changing
      the spectral frequencies (or spectral pattern) of one or more
      components in the reaction system so that the frequencies come
      into resonance, and the reaction can proceed along a desired
      reaction pathway (i. e., when frequencies match, energy is
      transferred). Understood in this way, the electric field becomes
      just another tool to change spectral frequencies of atoms and
      molecules, and thereby affect reaction rates in spectral
      chemistry.<br>
      <br>
      Reaction pathways are also important. In the absence of an
      electrical field, a reaction pathway will progress to one set of
      products: C C A + B &lt; Intermediates &lt; D + F<br>
      However, if an electrical field is added, at some particular
      strength of the field, the spectral frequencies may change so
      much, that a different intermediate is energized and the reaction
      proceeds down a different reaction pathway: C C A + B #
      Intermediates # G + H<br>
      E E<br>
      This is similar to the concept discussed earlier herein, regarding
      the formation of different products depending on temperature. The
      changes in temperature caused changes in spectral frequencies, and
      hence different reaction pathways were favored at different
      temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      Likewise, electric fields cause changes in spectral frequencies,
      and hence different reactions pathways are favored by different
      electric fields. By tailoring an electric field to a particular
      reaction system, one can control not only the rate of the reaction
      but also the reaction products produced.<br>
      <br>
      The ability to tailor reactions, with or without a physical
      catalyst, by varying the strength of an electric field should be
      useful in many manufacturing situations. For example, it might be
      more cost effective to build only one physical set-up for a
      reaction system and to use one or more electric fields to change
      the reaction dynamics and products, depending on which product is
      desired. This would save the expense of having a separate physical
      set-up for production of each group of products.<br>
      <br>
      Besides varying the strength of an electric field, the frequency
      of an electric field can also be varied. Assuming that a reaction
      will proceed at a much faster rate if a particular strength static
      electric field (i. e., direct current) is added as in the
      following: C C A + B # Intermediates # D + F<br>
      E E<br>
      But further assume, that because of reactor design and location,
      it is much easier to deliver a time-varying electric field with
      alternating current. A very low frequency field, such as with a 60
      Hz wall outlet, can produce the normal or static-type Stark
      effect. Thus, the reactor could be adapted to the 60 Hz electric
      field and enjoy the same increase in reaction rate that would
      occur with the static electric field.<br>
      <br>
      If a certain physical catalyst produces spectral frequencies that
      are close to intermediate frequencies, but are not exact, it is
      possible that the activity of the physical catalyst in the past
      may have been improved by using higher temperatures. As disclosed
      earlier herein, the higher temperatures actually broadened the
      physical catalyst's spectral pattern to cause the frequency of the
      physical catalyst to be at least a partial match for at least one
      of the intermediates. What is significant here is that high
      temperature boilers can be minimized, or eliminated altogether,
      and in their stead a moderate frequency electric field which, for
      example, broadened the spectral frequencies, could be used. For
      example, a frequency of around 100 Khz, equivalent to the typical
      line width frequencies at room temperature, could broaden
      substantially all of the spectral curves and cause the physical
      catalyst's spectral curves to match those of, for example,
      required intermediates. Thus, the electric field could cause the
      matter to behave as though the temperature had been raised, even
      though it had not been. (Similarly, any spectral manipulation, (e.
      g., electric fields acoustics, heterodynes, etc., that cause
      changes in the spectral line width, may cause a material to behave
      as though its temperature had been changed).<br>
      <br>
      The cyclic splitting of the Stark frequencies can be modulated
      with the electrical field frequency or its'first harmonic (i. e.,
      first-order Stark effects are modulated with the electrical field
      frequency, while second-order Stark effects are modulated by two
      times the electrical field, frequency). Assume that a metallic
      platinum catalyst is used in a hydrogen reaction and it is desired
      to stimulate the 2.7 MHz hyperfine frequency of the hydrogen
      atoms. Earlier herein it was disclosed that electromagnetic
      radiation could be used to deliver the 2.7 MHz frequency. However,
      use of an alternating electric field at 2.7 MHz could be used
      instead.<br>
      <br>
      Since platinum is a metal and conducts electricity well, the
      platinum can be considered to be a part of the alternating current
      circuit. The platinum will exhibit a Stark effect, with all the
      frequencies splitting at a rate of 2.7 MHz. At sufficiently strong
      electric fields, additional transition frequencies
      or"sidebands"will occur at regular spacings equal to the electric
      field frequency. There will be dozens of split frequencies in the
      platinum atoms that are heterodynes of 2.7 MHz. This massive
      heterodyned output may stimulate the hydrogen hyperfine frequency
      of 2.7 MHz and direct the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      Another way to achieve this reaction, of course, would be to leave
      the platinum out of the reaction altogether. The 2.7 MHz field
      will have a resonant Stark effect on the hydrogen, separate and
      independent of the platinum catalyst. Copper is not normally
      catalytic for hydrogen, but copper could be used to construct a
      reaction vessel like a Stark waveguide to energize the hydrogen. A
      Stark waveguide is used to perform Stark spectroscopy. It is shown
      as Figures 61a and 61b. Specifically, Figure 61a shows the
      construction of the Stark waveguide, whereas Figure 61b shows the
      distribution of fields in the Stark waveguide. The electrical
      field is delivered through the conducting plate. A reaction vessel
      could be made for the flow-through of gases and use an economical
      metal such as copper for the conducting plate. When the 2.7 MHz
      alternating current is delivered through the electrical connection
      to the copper conductor plate, the copper spectral frequencies,
      none of which are particularly resonant with hydrogen, will
      exhibit a Stark effect with normal-type splitting. The Stark
      frequencies will be split at a rate of 2.7 MHz. At a sufficiently
      strong electric field strength, additional sidebands will appear
      in the copper, with regular spacings (i. e., heterodynes) of 2.7<br>
      MHz even though none of the actual copper frequencies matches the
      hydrogen frequencies, the Stark splitting or heterodynes will
      match the hydrogen frequency. Dozens of the copper split
      frequencies may resonate indirectly with the hydrogen hyperfine
      frequency and direct the reaction (i. e., when frequencies match,
      energies transfer).<br>
      <br>
      With sophisticated equipment and a good understanding of a
      particular system, Stark resonance can be used with a transition
      level frequency. For example, assume that to achieve a particular
      reaction pathway, a molecule needs to be stimulated with a
      transition level frequency of 500 MHz. By delivering the 500 MHz
      electrical field to the molecule, this resonant electrical field
      may cause the molecule to oscillate back and forth between the two
      levels at the rate of 500 MHz. This electrically creates the
      conditions for light amplification (i. e., laser via stimulation
      of multiple upper energy levels) and any added electromagnetic
      radiation at this frequency will be amplified by the molecule. In
      this manner, an electrical field may substitute for the laser
      effects of physical catalysts.<br>
      <br>
      In summary, by understanding the underlying spectral mechanisms of
      chemical reactions, electric fields can be used as yet another
      tool to catalyze and modify those chemical reactions and/or
      reaction pathways by modifying the spectral characteristics, for
      example, at least one participant and/or one or more components in
      the reaction system.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, another tool for mimicking catalyst mechanisms of reactions
      can be utilized.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>MAGNETIC FIELDS</b><br>
      In spectral terms, magnetic fields behave similar to electric
      fields in their effect.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, the spectral frequency lines, for instance of atoms
      and molecules, can be split and shifted by a magnetic field. In
      this case, the external magnetic field from outside the atom or
      molecule, interacts with the electric and magnetic fields already
      inside the atom or molecule.<br>
      <br>
      This action of an external magnetic field on spectral lines is
      called the"Zeeman<br>
      Effect", in honor of its'discoverer, Dutch physicist Pieter
      Zeeman. In 1896, Zeeman discovered that the yellow flame
      spectroscopy"D"lines of sodium were broadened when the flame was
      held between strong magnetic poles. It was later discovered that
      the apparent broadening of the sodium spectral lines was actually
      due to their splitting and shifting.<br>
      <br>
      Zeeman's original observation has evolved into a separate branch
      of spectroscopy, relating to the study of atoms and molecules by
      measuring the changes in their spectral lines caused by a magnetic
      field. This in turn has evolved into the nuclear magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging used in
      medicine, as well as the laser magnetic resonance and electron
      spin resonance spectroscopy used in physics and chemistry.<br>
      <br>
      The Zeeman effect for the famous"D"lines of sodium is shown in
      Figures 62a and 62b. Figure 62a shows the Zeeman effect for
      sodium"D"lines ; whereas Figure 62b shows the energy level diagram
      for the transitions in the Zeeman effect for the sodium"D"lines.<br>
      <br>
      The"D"lines are traditionally said to result from transition
      between the 3p2p and 3s2S electron orbitals. As is shown, each of
      the single spectral frequencies is split into two or more slightly
      different frequencies, which center around the original unsplit
      frequency.<br>
      <br>
      In the Zeeman effect, the amount that the spectral frequencies are
      split apart depends on the strength of the applied magnetic field.
      Figure 63 shows Zeeman splitting effects for the oxygen atom as a
      function of magnetic field. When there is no magnetic field, there
      are two single frequencies at zero and 4.8. When the magnetic
      field is at low strength (e. g., 0.2<br>
      Tesla) there is just slight splitting and shifting of the original
      two frequencies. However, as the magnetic field is increased, the
      frequencies are split and shifted farther and farther apart.<br>
      <br>
      The degree of splitting and shifting in the Zeeman effect,
      depending on magnetic field strength, is shown in Figure 64 for
      the 3P state of silicon.<br>
      <br>
      As with the Stark effect generated from an external electric
      field, the Zeeman effect, generated from an external magnetic
      field, is slightly different depending on whether an atom or
      molecule is subjected to the magnetic field. The Zeeman effect on
      atoms can be divided into three different magnetic field
      strengths: weak; moderate ; and strong. If the magnetic field
      strength is weak, the amount that the spectral frequencies will be
      shifted and split apart will be very small. The shifting away from
      the original spectral frequency will still stimulate the shifted
      frequencies. This is because they will be so close to the original
      spectral frequency that they will still be well within its
      resonance curve. As for the splitting, it is so small, that it is
      even less than the hyperfine splitting that normally occurs. This
      means that in a weak magnetic field, there will be only very
      slight splitting of spectral frequencies, translating into very
      low splitting frequencies in the lower regions of the radio
      spectrum and down into the very low frequency region. For example,
      the Zeeman splitting frequency for the hydrogen atom, which is
      caused by the earth's magnetic field, is around 30 KHz. Larger
      atoms have even lower frequencies in the lower kilohertz and even
      hertz regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      Without a magnetic field, an atom can be stimulated by using
      direct resonance with a spectral frequency or by using its fine or
      hyperfine splitting frequencies in the infrared through microwave,
      or microwave through radio regions, respectively. By merely adding
      a very weak magnetic field, the atom can be stimulated with an
      even lower radio or very low frequency matching the Zeeman
      splitting frequency. Thus, by simply using a weak magnetic field,
      a spectral catalyst range can be extended even lower into the
      radio frequency range.<br>
      <br>
      The weak magnetic field from the Earth causes Zeeman splitting in
      atoms in the hertz and kilohertz ranges. This means that all
      atoms, including those in biological organisms, are sensitive to
      hertz and kilohertz EM frequencies, by virtue of being subjected
      to the Earth's magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      At the other end of magnetic field strength, is the very strong
      magnetic field. In this case, the splitting apart and shifting of
      the spectral frequencies will be very wide. With this wide
      shifting of frequencies, the difference between the split
      frequencies will be much larger than the difference between the
      hyperfine splitting frequencies. This translates to Zeeman effect
      splitting frequencies at higher frequencies than the hyperfine
      splitting frequencies. This splitting occurs somewhere around the
      microwave region. Although the addition of a strong magnetic field
      does not extend the reach in the electromagnetic spectrum at one
      extreme or the other, as a weak magnetic field does, it still does
      provide an option of several more potential spectral catalyst
      frequencies that can be used in the microwave region.<br>
      <br>
      The moderate magnetic field strength case is more complicated. The
      shifting and splitting caused by the Zeeman effect from a moderate
      magnetic field will be approximately equal to the hyperfine
      splitting. Although not widely discussed in the prior art, it is
      possible to apply a moderate magnetic field to an atom, to produce
      Zeeman splitting which is substantially equivalent to
      its'hyperfine splitting. This presents interesting possibilities.<br>
      <br>
      Methods for guiding atoms in chemical reactions were disclosed
      earlier herein by stimulating atoms with hyperfine splitting
      frequencies. The Zeeman effect provides a way to achieve similar
      effects without introducing any spectral frequencies at all. For
      example, by introducing a moderate magnetic field, resonance may
      be set-up within the atom itself, that stimulates and/or energizes
      and/or stabilizes the atom.<br>
      <br>
      The moderate magnetic field causes low frequency Zeeman splitting,
      that matches and hence energizes the low frequency hyperfine
      splitting frequency in the atom. However, the low hyperfine
      splitting frequencies actually correspond to the heterodyned
      difference between two vibrational or fine structure frequencies.
      When the hyperfine splitting frequency is stimulated, the two
      electronic frequencies will eventually be stimulated. This in turn
      causes the atom to be, for example, stimulated. Thus, the Zeeman
      effect permits a spectral energy catalyst stimulation of an atom
      by exposing that atom to a precise strength of a magnetic field,
      and the use of spectral EM frequencies is not required (i. e., so
      long as frequencies match, energies will transfer). The
      possibilities are quite interesting because an inert reaction
      system may suddenly spring to life upon the application of the
      proper moderate strength magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      There is also a difference between the"normal"Zeeman effect and
      the"anomalous"<br>
      Zeeman effect. With the"normal"Zeeman effect, a spectral frequency
      is split by a magnetic field into three frequencies, with expected
      even spacing between them (see Figure 65a which shows
      the"normal"Zeeman effects and Figure 65b which shows
      the"anomalous"Zeeman effects). One of the new split frequencies is
      above the original frequency, and the other new split frequency is
      below the original frequency. Both new frequencies are split the
      same distance away from the original frequency. Thus, the
      difference between the upper and original and the lower and
      original frequencies is about the same. This means that in terms
      of heterodyne differences, there are at most, two new heterodyned
      differences with the normal<br>
      Zeeman effect. The first heterodyne or splitting difference is the
      difference between one of the new split frequencies and the
      original frequency. The other splitting difference is between the
      upper and lower new split frequencies. It is, of course, twice the
      frequency difference between either of the upper or lower
      frequencies and the original frequency.<br>
      <br>
      In many instances the Zeeman splitting produced by a magnetic
      field results in more than three frequencies, or in splitting that
      is spaced differently than expected. This is called
      the"anomalous"Zeeman effect (see Figures 65 and 66; wherein Figure
      66 shows an anamolous Zeeman effect for zinc 3p ~ 3s.<br>
      <br>
      If there are still just three frequencies, and the Zeeman effect
      is anomalous because the spacing is different than expected, the
      situation is similar to the normal effect. However, there are at
      most, two new splitting frequencies that can be used. If, however,
      the effect is anomalous because more than three frequencies are
      produced, then there will be a much more richly varied situation.
      Assume an easy case where there are four Zeeman splitting
      frequencies (see Figures 67a and Figure 67b). Figure 67a shows
      four Zeeman splitting frequencies and Figure 67b shows four new
      heterodyned differences.<br>
      <br>
      In this example of anomalous Zeeman splitting, there are a total
      of four frequencies, where once existed only one frequency. For
      simplicity's sake, the new Zeeman frequencies will be labeled 1,
      2,3, and 4. Frequencies 3 and 4 are also split apart by the same
      difference "w". Thus,"w"is a heterodyned splitting frequency.
      Frequencies 2 and 3 are also split apart by a different amount"x".
      So far there are two heterodyned splitting frequencies, as in the
      normal Zeeman effect.<br>
      <br>
      However, frequencies 1 and 3 are split apart by a third amount"y",
      where"y"is the sum of"w"and"x". And, frequencies 2 and 4 are also
      split apart by the same third amount "y". Finally, frequencies 1
      and 4 are split even farther apart by an amount"z". Once again,
      "z"is a summation amount from adding"w + x + w". Thus, the result
      is four heterodyned frequencies : w, x, y, and z in the anomalous
      Zeeman effect.<br>
      <br>
      If there were six frequencies present from the anomalous Zeeman
      effect, there would be even more heterodyned differences. Thus,
      the anomalous Zeeman effect results in far greater flexibility in
      the choice of frequencies when compared to the normal Zeeman
      effect.<br>
      <br>
      In the normal Zeeman effect the original frequency is split into
      three evenly spaced frequencies, with a total of just two
      heterodyned frequencies. In the anomalous Zeeman effect the
      original frequency is split into four or more unevenly spaced
      frequencies, with at least four or more heterodyned frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      Now for a discussion of the Zeeman effect in molecules. Molecules
      come in three basic varieties: ferromagnetic ; paramagnetic ; and
      diamagnetic. Ferromagnetic molecules are typical magnets. The
      materials typically hold a strong magnetic field and are composed
      of magnetic elements such as iron, cobalt, and nickel.<br>
      <br>
      Paramagnetic molecules hold only a weak magnetic field. If a
      paramagnetic material is put into an external magnetic field, the
      magnetic moment of the molecules of the material are lined up in
      the same direction as the external magnetic field. Now, the
      magnetic moment of the molecules is the direction in which the
      molecules own magnetic field is weighted.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, the magnetic moment of a molecule will tip to
      whichever side of the molecule is more heavily weighted in terms
      of its own magnetic field. Thus, paramagnetic molecules will
      typically tip in the same direction as an externally applied
      magnetic field. Because paramagnetic materials line up with an
      external magnetic field, they are also weakly attracted to sources
      of magnetic fields.<br>
      <br>
      Common paramagnetic elements include oxygen, aluminum, sodium,
      magnesium, calcium and potassium. Stable molecules such as oxygen
      (Oz) and nitric oxide (NO) are also paramagnetic. Molecular oxygen
      makes up approximately 20% of our planet's atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      Both molecules play important roles in biologic organisms. In
      addition, unstable molecules, more commonly known as free
      radicals, chemical reaction intermediates or plasmas, are also
      paramagnetic. Paramagnetic ions include hydrogen, manganese,
      chromium, iron, cobalt, and nickel. Many paramagnetic substances
      occur in biological organisms. For instance the blood flowing in
      our veins is an ionic solution containing red blood cells. The red
      blood cells contain hemoglobin, which in turn contains ionized
      iron. The hemoglobin, and hence the red blood cells, are
      paramagnetic. In addition, hydrogen ions can be found in a
      multitude of organic compounds and reactions. For instance, the
      hydrochloric acid in a stomach contains hydrogen ions. Adenosine
      triphosphate (ATP), the energy system of nearly all biological
      organisms, requires hydrogen and manganese ions to function
      properly. Thus, the very existence of life itself depends on
      paramagnetic materials.<br>
      <br>
      Diamagnetic molecules, on the other hand, are repelled by a
      magnetic field, and line up what little magnetic moments they have
      away from the direction of an external magnetic field. Diamagnetic
      substances do not typically hold a magnetic field. Examples of
      diamagnetic elements include hydrogen, helium, neon, argon,
      carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, chlorine, copper, zinc, silver,
      gold, lead, and mercury. Diamagnetic molecules include water, most
      gases, organic compounds, and salts such as sodium chloride. Salts
      are really just crystals of diamagnetic ions. Diamagnetic ions
      include lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, fluorine,
      chlorine, bromine, iodine, ammonium, and sulphate. Ionic crystals
      usually dissolve easily in water, and as such the ionic water
      solution is also diamagnetic. Biologic organisms are filled with
      diamagnetic materials, because they are carbon-based life forms.
      In addition, the blood flowing in our veins is an ionic solution
      containing blood cells. The ionic solution (i. e., blood plasma)
      is made of water molecules, sodium ions, potassium ions, chlorine
      ions, and organic protein compounds. Hence, our blood is a
      diamagnetic solution carrying paramagnetic blood cells.<br>
      <br>
      With regard to the Zeeman effect, first consider the case of
      paramagnetic molecules.<br>
      <br>
      As with atoms, the effects can be categorized on the basis of
      magnetic field strength. If the external magnetic field applied to
      a paramagnetic molecule is weak, the Zeeman effect will produce
      splitting into equally spaced levels. In most cases, the amount of
      splitting will be directly proportional to the strength of the
      magnetic field, a"first-order"effect. A general rule of thumb is
      that a field of one (1) oersted (i. e., slightly larger than the
      earth's magnetic field) will produce Zeeman splittings of
      approximately 1.4 MHz in paramagnetic molecules.<br>
      <br>
      Weaker magnetic fields will produce narrower splittings, at lower
      frequencies. Stronger magnetic fields will produce wider
      splittings, at higher frequencies. In these first order<br>
      Zeeman effects, there is usually only splitting, with no shifting
      of the original or center frequency, as was present with Zeeman
      effects on atoms.<br>
      <br>
      In many paramagnetic molecules there are also second-order effects
      where the<br>
      Zeeman splitting is proportional to the square of the magnetic
      field strength. In these cases, the splitting is much smaller and
      of much lower frequencies. In addition to splitting, the original
      or center frequencies shift as they do in atoms, proportional to
      the magnetic field strength.<br>
      <br>
      Sometimes the direction of the magnetic field in relation to the
      orientation of the molecule makes a difference. For instance, x
      frequencies are associated with a magnetic field parallel to an
      exciting electromagnetic field, while a frequencies are found when
      it is perpendicular. Both and a frequencies are present with a
      circularly polarized electromagnetic field. Typical Zeeman
      splitting patterns for a paramagnetic molecule in two different
      transitions are shown in Figure 68a and 68b. The frequencies are
      seen when AM = 0, and are above the long horizontal line. The o
      frequencies are seen when AM 1, and are below the long horizontal
      line. If a paramagnetic molecule was placed in a weak magnetic
      field, circularly polarized light would excite both sets of
      frequencies in the molecule. Thus, it is possible to control which
      set of frequencies are excited in a molecule by controlling its
      orientation with respect to the magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      * When the magnetic field strength is intermediate, the
      interaction between the paramagnetic molecule's magnetic moments
      and the externally applied magnetic field produces Zeeman effects
      equivalent to other frequencies and energies in the molecule. For
      instance, the Zeeman spitting may be near a rotational frequency
      and disturb the end-overend rotational motion of the molecule. The
      Zeeman splitting and energy may be particular or large enough to
      uncouple the molecule's spin from its molecular axis.<br>
      <br>
      If the magnetic field is very strong, the nuclear magnetic moment
      spin will uncouple from the molecular angular momentum. In this
      case, the Zeeman effects overwhelm the hyperfine structure, and
      are of much higher energies at much higher frequencies. In spectra
      of molecules exposed to strong magnetic fields, hyperfine
      splitting appears as a small perturbation of the Zeeman splitting.<br>
      <br>
      Next, consider Zeeman effects in so called"ordinary molecules"or
      diamagnetic molecules. Most molecules are of the diamagnetic
      variety, hence the designation"ordinary".<br>
      <br>
      This includes, of course, most organic molecules found in biologic
      organisms. Diamagnetic molecules have rotational magnetic moments
      from rotation of the positively charged nucleus, and this magnetic
      moment of the nucleus is only about 1/1000 of that from the
      paramagnetic molecules. This means that the energy from Zeeman
      splitting in diamagnetic molecules is much smaller than the energy
      from Zeeman splitting in paramagnetic molecules. The equation for
      the Zeeman energy in diamagnetic molecules is: Hz =-(gjJ = glI).
      Ho where J is the molecular rotational angular momentum, I is the
      nuclear-spin angular momentum, gj is the rotational g factor, and
      gi is the nuclear-spin g factor. This Zeeman energy is much less,
      and of much lower frequency, than the paramagnetic Zeeman energy.
      In terms of frequency, it falls in the hertz and kilohertz regions
      of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, consider the implications of Zeeman splitting for
      catalyst and chemical reactions and for spectral chemistry. A weak
      magnetic field will produce hertz and kilohertz Zeeman splitting
      in atoms and second order effects in paramagnetic molecules.
      Virtually any kind of magnetic field will produce hertz and
      kilohertz Zeeman splitting in diamagnetic molecules. All these
      atoms and molecules will then become sensitive to radio and very
      low frequency (VLF) electromagnetic waves. The atoms and molecules
      will absorb the radio or VLF energy and become stimulated to a
      greater or lesser degree. This could be used to add spectral
      energy to, for instance, a particular molecule or intermediate in
      a chemical reaction system. For instance, for hydrogen and oxygen
      gases turning into water over a platinum catalyst, the hydrogen
      atom radical is important for maintaining the reaction. In the
      earth's weak magnetic field, Zeeman splitting for hydrogen is
      around 30 KHz. Thus, the hydrogen atoms in the reaction system,
      could be energized by applying to them a Zeeman splitting
      frequency for hydrogen (e. g., 30 KHz). Energizing the hydrogen
      atoms in the reaction system will duplicate the mechanisms of
      action of platinum, and catalyze the reaction. If the reaction was
      moved into outer space, away from the earth's weak magnetic field,
      hydrogen would no longer have a 30 KHz Zeeman splitting frequency,
      and the 30 KHz would no longer as effectively catalyze the
      reaction.<br>
      <br>
      The vast majority of materials on this planet, by virtue of
      existing within the earth's weak magnetic field, will exhibit
      Zeeman splitting in the hertz and kilohertz regions. This applies
      to biologies and organics as well as inorganic or inanimate
      materials. Humans are composed of a wide variety of atoms,
      diamagnetic molecules, and second order effect paramagnetic
      molecules. These atoms and molecules all exist in the earth's weak
      magnetic field. These atoms and molecules in humans all have
      Zeeman splitting in the hertz and kilohertz regions, because they
      are in the earth's magnetic field. Biochemical and biocatalytic
      process in humans are thus sensitive to hertz and kilohertz
      electromagnetic radiation, by virtue of the fact that they are in
      the earth's weak magnetic field. As long as humans continue to
      exist on this planet, they will be subject to spectral energy
      catalyst effects from hertz and kilohertz EM waves because of the
      Zeeman effect from the planet's magnetic field. This has
      significant implications for low frequency communications, as well
      as chemical and biochemical reactions, diagnostics, and treatment
      of diseases.<br>
      <br>
      A strong magnetic field will produce splitting greater than the
      hyperfine frequencies, in the microwave and infrared regions of
      the EM spectrum in atoms and paramagnetic molecules. In the
      hydrogen/oxygen reaction, a strong field could be added to the
      reaction system and transmit MHz and/or GHz frequencies into the
      reaction to energize the hydroxy radical and hydrogen reaction
      intermediates. If physical platinum was used to catalyze the
      reaction, the application of a particular magnetic field strength
      could result in both the platinum and the reaction intermediate
      spectra having frequencies that were split and shifted in such a
      way that even more frequencies matched than without the magnetic
      field. In this way, Zeeman splitting can be used to improve the
      effectiveness of a physical catalyst, by copying its mechanism of
      action (i. e., more frequencies could be caused to match and thus
      more energy could transfer).<br>
      <br>
      A moderate magnetic field will produce Zeeman splitting in atoms
      and paramagnetic molecules at frequencies on par with the
      hyperfine and rotational splitting frequencies. This means that a
      reaction system can be energized without even adding
      electromagnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, by placing the reaction system in a moderate magnetic
      field that produces Zeeman splitting equal to the hyperfine or
      rotational splitting, increased reaction would occur. For
      instance, by using a magnetic field that causes hyperfine or
      rotational splitting in hydrogen and oxygen gas, that matches the
      Zeeman splitting in hydrogen atom or hydroxy radicals, the
      hydrogen or hydroxy intermediate would be energized and would
      proceed through the reaction cascade to produce water. By using
      the appropriately tuned moderate magnetic field, the magnetic
      field could be used to turn the reactants into catalysts for their
      own reaction, without the addition of physical catalyst platinum
      or the spectral catalyst of platinum. Although the magnetic field
      would simply be copying the mechanism of action of platinum, the
      reaction would have the appearance of being catalyzed solely by an
      applied magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, consider the direction of the magnetic field in relation
      to the orientation of the molecule. When the magnetic field is
      parallel to an exciting electromagnetic field, frequencies are
      produced. When the magnetic field is perpendicular to an exciting
      electromagnetic field, a frequencies are found. Assume that there
      is an industrial chemical reaction system that uses the same (or
      similar) starting reactants, but the goal is to be able to produce
      different products at will. By using magnetic fields combined with
      spectral energy or physical catalysts, the reaction can be guided
      to one set of products or another. For the first set of products,
      the electromagnetic excitation is oriented parallel to the
      magnetic field, producing one set of 7r *equencies, which leads to
      a first set of products. To achieve a different product, the
      direction of the magnetic field is changed so that it is
      perpendicular to the exciting electromagnetic field. This produces
      a different set of a frequencies, and a different reaction pathway
      is energized, thus producing a different set of products. Thus,
      according to the present invention, magnetic field effects, Zeeman
      splitting, splitting and spectral energy catalysts can be used to
      fine tune the specificity of many reaction systems.<br>
      <br>
      In summary, by understanding the underlying spectral mechanism to
      chemical reactions, magnetic fields can be used as yet another
      tool to catalyze and modify those chemical reactions by modifying
      the spectral characteristics of at least one participant and/or at
      least one component in the reaction system.<b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>REACTOR VESSEL SIZE, SHAPE AND COMPOSITION</b><br>
      An important consideration in the use of spectral chemistry is the
      reactor vessel size, shape and composition. The reactor vessel
      size and shape can affect the vessel's NOF to various wave
      energies (e. g., EM, acoustic, electrical current, etc). This in
      turn may affect reaction system dynamics. For instance, a
      particularly small bench-top reactor vessel may have an EM NOF of
      1,420 MHz related to a 25 cm dimension. When a reaction with an
      atomic hydrogen intermediate is performed in the small bench-top
      reactor, the reaction proceeds quickly, due in part to the fact
      that the reactor vessel and the hydrogen hyperfine splitting
      frequencies match (1,420 MHz). This allows the reactor vessel and
      hydrogen intermediates to resonate, thus transferring energy to
      the intermediate and promoting the reaction pathway.<br>
      <br>
      When the reaction is scaled up for large industrial production,
      the reaction would occur in a much larger reactor vessel with an
      EM NOF of, for example, 100 MHz. Because the reactor vessel is no
      longer resonating with the hydrogen intermediate, the reaction
      proceeds at a slower rate. This deficiency in the larger reactor
      vessel can be compensated for, by, for example, supplementing the
      reaction with 1,420 MHz radiation, thereby restoring the faster
      reaction rate.<br>
      <br>
      Likewise, reactor vessel composition may play a similar role in
      reaction system dynamics. For example, a stainless steel bench-top
      reactor vessel may produce vibrational frequencies which resonate
      with vibrational frequencies of a reactant, thus, for example,
      promoting disassociation of a reactant into reactive
      intermediates. When the reaction is scaled up for industrial
      production, it may be placed into, for example, a ceramic-lined
      metal reactor vessel. The new reactor vessel typically will not
      produce the reactant vibrational frequency, and the reaction will
      proceed at a slower rate. Once again, this deficiency in the new
      reactor vessel, caused by its different composition, can be
      compensated for either by returning the reaction to a stainless
      steel vessel, or by supplementing, for example, the vibrational
      frequency of the reactant into the ceramic-lined vessel.<br>
      <br>
      It should now be understood that all the aspects of spectral
      chemistry previously discussed (resonance, targeting, poisons,
      promoters, supporters, electric and magnetic-fields both
      endogenous and exogenous to reaction system components, etc.)
      apply to the reactor vessel, as well as to, for example, any
      participant placed inside it. The reactor vessel may be comprised
      of matter (e. g., stainless steel, plastic, glass, and/or ceramic,
      etc.) or it may be comprised of a field or energy (e. g., magnetic
      bottle, light trapping, etc.) A reactor vessel, by possessing
      inherent properties such as frequencies, waves, and/or fields, may
      interact with other components in the reaction system and/or at
      least one participant. Likewise, holding vessels, conduits, etc.,
      some of which may interact with the reaction system, but in which
      the reaction does not actually take place, may interact with one
      or more components in the reaction system and may potentially
      affect them, either positively or negatively.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, when reference is made to the reactor vessel, it
      should be understood that all portions associated therewith may
      also be involved in desirable reactions.<br>

      </b><b>EXAMPLES</b><br>
      The invention will be more clearly perceived and better understood
      from the following specific examples.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b>REPLACING A PHYSICAL CATALYST WITH A SPECTRAL CATALYST</b><b>
        IN A GAS PHASE REACTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b>2H2 + 02 platinum catalyst 2H20</b><br>
      Water can be produced by the method of exposing H2 and 02 to a
      physical platinum (Pt) catalyst but there is always the
      possibility of producing a potentially dangerous explosive risk.
      This experiment replaced the physical platinum catalyst with a
      spectral catalyst comprising the spectral pattern of the physical
      platinum catalyst, which resonates with and transfers energy to
      the hydrogen and hydroxy intermediates.<br>
      <br>
      To demonstrate that oxygen and hydrogen can combine to form water
      utilizing a spectral catalyst, electrolysis of water was performed
      to provide stoichiometric amounts of oxygen and hydrogen starting
      gases. A triple neck flask was fitted with two (2) rubber stoppers
      on the outside necks, each fitted with platinum electrodes encased
      in glass for a four (4) inch length. The flask was filled with
      distilled water and a pinch of salt so that only the glass-encased
      portion of the electrode was exposed to air, and the unencased
      portion of the electrode was completely under water. The central
      neck was connected via a rubber stopper to vacuum tubing, which
      led to a Drierite column to remove any water from the produced
      gases.<br>
      <br>
      After vacuum removal of all gases in the system (to about 700 mm
      Hg), electrolysis was conducted using a 12 V power source attached
      to the two electrodes. Electrolysis was commenced with the
      subsequent production of hydrogen and oxygen gases in
      stoichiometric amounts. The gases passed through the Drierite
      column, through vacuum tubing connected to positive and negative
      pressure gauges and into a sealed 1,000 ml, round quartz flask. A
      strip of filter paper, which contained dried cobalt, had been
      placed in the bottom of the sealed flask. Initially the cobalt
      paper was blue, indicating the absence of water in the flask. A
      similar cobalt test strip exposed to the ambient air was also
      blue.<br>
      <br>
      The traditional physical platinum catalyst was replaced by
      spectral catalyst platinum emissions from a Fisher Scientific
      Hollow Cathode Platinum Lamp which was positioned approximately 2
      cm from the flask. This allowed the oxygen and hydrogen gases in
      the round quartz flask to be irradiated with emissions from the
      spectral catalyst. A Cathodeon Hollow Cathode Lamp Supply C610 was
      used to power the Pt lamp at 80% maximum current (12 mAmps). The
      reaction flask was cooled using dry ice in a Styrofoam container
      positioned directly beneath the round quartz flask, offsetting any
      effects of heat from the Pt lamp. The Pt lamp was turned on and
      within two days of irradiation, a noticeable pink color was
      evident on the cobalt paper strip indicating the presence of water
      in the round quartz flask. The cobalt test strip exposed to
      ambient air in the lab remained blue. Over the next four to five
      days, the pink colored area on the cobalt strip became brighter
      and larger. Upon discontinuation of the Pt emission, H20 diffused
      out of the cobalt strip and was taken up by the Drierite column.
      Over the next four to five days, the pink coloration of the cobalt
      strip in the quartz flask faded. The cobalt strip exposed to the
      ambient air remained blue.<br>

      </b><b>REPLACING A PHYSICAL CATALYST WITH A SPECTRAL CATALYST</b><b>
        IN A LIQUID PHASE REACTION H202 platinum catalyst Hz + 02</b><b><br>
      </b>The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is an extremely slow
      reaction in the absence of catalysts. Accordingly, an experiment
      was performed which showed that the physical catalyst, finely
      divided platinum, could be replaced with the spectral catalyst
      having the spectral pattern of platinum. Hydrogen peroxide, 3%,
      filled two (2) nippled quartz tubes.<br>
      <br>
      (the nippled quartz tubes consisted of a lower portion 17 mm
      internal diameter and 150 mm in length, narrowing over a 10 mm
      length to an upper capillary portion being 2.0 mm internal
      diameter and 140 mm in length and were made from PhotoVac Laser
      quartz tubing). Both quartz tubes were inverted in 50 ml beaker
      reservoirs filled with (3%) hydrogen peroxide to 40 ml and were
      shielded from incident light (cardboard cylinders covered with
      aluminum foil). One of the light shielded tubes was used as a
      control. The other shielded tube was exposed to a Fisher
      Scientific Hollow Cathode Lamp for platinum (Pt) using a Cathodeon<br>
      <br>
      Hollow Cathode Lamp Supply C610, at 80% maximum current (12 mA).
      The experiment was performed several times with an exposure time
      ranging from 24-96 hours. The shielded tubes were monitored for
      increases in temperature (there was none) to assure that any
      reaction was not due to thermal effects. In a typical experiment
      the nippled tubes were prepared with hydrogen peroxide (3%) as
      described above herein. Both tubes were shielded from light, and
      the Pt tube was exposed to platinum spectral emissions, as
      described above, for about 24 hours. Gas production in the control
      tube A measured about four (4) mm in length in the capillary (i.
      e., about2. 5 mm3), wwhile gas in the Pt (tube B) measured about
      50 mm (i. e., about 157 mm3). The platinum spectral catalyst thus
      increased the reaction rate about 12.5 times.<br>
      <br>
      The tubes were then switched and tube A was exposed to the
      platinum spectral catalyst, for about 24 hours, while tube B
      served as the control. Gas production in the control (tube B)
      measured about 2 mm in length in the capillary (i. e., about 6
      mm3) while gas in the<br>
      Pt tube (tube A) measured about 36 mm (i. e., about 113 mm3),
      yielding about a 19 fold difference in reaction rate.<br>
      <br>
      As a negative control, to confirm that any lamp would not cause
      the same result, the experiment was repeated with a sodium lamp at
      6 mA (80% of the maximum current). Na in a traditional reaction
      would be a reactant with water releasing hydrogen gas, not a
      catalyst of hydrogen peroxide breakdown. The control tube measured
      gas to be about 4 mm in length (i. e., about 12 mm3) in the
      capillary portion, while the Na tube gas measured to be about 1 mm
      in length (i. e., about 3 mm3). This indicated that while spectral
      emissions can substitute for catalysts, they cannot yet substitute
      for reactants. Also, it indicated that the simple effect of using
      a hollow cathode tube emitting heat and energy into the hydrogen
      peroxide was not the cause of the gas bubble formation, but
      instead, the spectral pattern of Pt replacing the physical
      catalyst caused the reaction.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLE 3</b><b><br>
      </b><b>REPLACING A PHYSICAL CATALYST WITH A SPECTRAL CATALYST</b><b>
        IN A SOLID PHASE REACTION</b><b><br>
      </b>It is well known that certain micro-organisms have a toxic
      reaction to silver Ag. It is now understood through this
      invention, that high intensity spectral frequencies produced in
      the silver electronic spectrum match with ultraviolet frequencies
      that are lethal to bacteria (by creation of free radicals and by
      causing bacterial DNA damage) but are harmless to mammalian cells.
      Thus, it was theorized that the known medicinal and anti-microbial
      uses of silver are due to a spectral catalyst effect. In this
      regard, an experiment was conducted which showed that the spectral
      catalyst emitting the spectrum of silver demonstrated a toxic or
      inhibitory effect on micro-organisms.<br>
      <br>
      Bacterial cultures were placed onto standard growth medium in two
      petri dishes (one control and one Ag) using standard plating
      techniques covering the entire dish. Each dish was placed at the
      bottom of a light shielding cylindrical chamber. A light shielding
      foilcovered, cardboard disc with a patterned slit was placed over
      each culture plate. A Fisher<br>
      Scientific Hollow Cathode Lamp for Silver (Ag) was inserted
      through the top of the Ag exposure chamber so that only the
      spectral emission pattern from the silver lamp was irradiating the
      bacteria on the Ag culture plate (i. e., through the patterned
      slit). A Cathodeon<br>
      Hollow Cathode Lamp Supply C610 was used to power the Ag lamp at
      80% maximum current (3.6 mA). The control plate was not exposed to
      emissions of an Ag lamp, and ambient light was blocked. Both
      control and Ag plates were maintained at room temperature (e. g.,
      about 70-74 F) during the silver spectral emission exposure time,
      which ranged from about 12-24 hours in the various experiments.
      Afterwards, both plates were incubated using standard techniques
      (37 C, aerobic Forma Scientific Model 3157, Water-Jacketed
      Incubator) for about 24 hours.<br>
      <br>
      The following bacteria (obtained from the Microbiology Laboratory
      at People's<br>
      Hospital in Mansfield, Ohio, US), were studied for effects of the
      Ag lamp spectral emissions: 1. E. coli ;<br>
      2. Strep. pneumoniae ;<br>
      3. Staph. aureus ; and<br>
      4. Salmonella typhi.<br>

      This group included both Gram+ and Gram~ species, as well as cocci
      and rods.<br>
      <br>
      Results were as follows:<br>
      1. Controls-all controls showed full growth covering the culture
      plates;<br>
      2. The Ag plates -areas unexposed to the Ag spectral emission

        COMPARING RESULTS TO PHYSICAL CATALYST RESULTS IN A BIOLOGIC</b><b>
        PREPARATION</b><b><br>
      </b>To further demonstrate that certain susceptible organisms
      which have a toxic reaction to silver would have a similar
      reaction to the spectral catalyst emitting the spectrum of silver,
      cultures were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
      (ATCC) which included<br>
      Escherichia coli #25922, and Klebsiella pneumonia, subsp
      Pneumoniae, # 13883. Control and Ag plate cultures were performed
      as described above. After incubation, plates were examined using a
      binocular microscope. The E. coli exhibited moderate resistance to
      the bactericidal effects of the spectral silver emission, while
      the Klebsiella exhibited moderate sensitivity. All controls
      exhibited full growth.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, an experiment was performed which demonstrated a
      similar result using the physical silver catalyst as was obtained
      with the Ag spectral catalyst. Sterile test discs were soaked in
      an 80 ppm, colloidal silver solution. The same two (2) organisms
      were again plated, as described above. Colloidal silver test discs
      were placed on each Ag plate, while the control plates had none.
      The plates were incubated as described above and examined under
      the binocular microscope. The collodial silver E. coli exhibited

      <b>EXAMPLE 5</b><b><br>
      </b><b>AUGMENTING A PHYSICAL CATALYST WITH A SPECTRAL CATALYST</b><b><br>
      </b>To demonstrate that oxygen and hydrogen can combine to form
      water utilizing a spectral catalyst to augment a physical
      catalyst, electrolysis of water was performed to provide the
      necessary oxygen and hydrogen starting gases, as in Example 1.<br>
      <br>
      Two quartz flasks (A and B) were connected separately after the
      Drierite column, each with its own set of vacuum and pressure
      gauges. Platinum powder (31 mg) was placed in each flask. The
      flasks were filled with electrolytically produced stoichiometric
      amounts of<br>
      H2 and 02 to 120 mm Hg. The flasks were separated by a stopcock
      from the electrolysis system and from each other. The pressure in
      each flask was recorded over time as the reaction proceeded over
      the physical platinum catalyst. The reaction combines three (3)
      moles of gases, (i. e., two (2) moles H2 and one (1) mole 02), to
      produce two (2) moles H2O.<br>
      <br>
      This decrease in molarity, and hence progress of the reaction, can
      be monitored by a decrease in pressure"P"which is proportional,
      via the ideal gas law, (PV = nRT), to molarity"n". A baseline rate
      of reaction was thus obtained. Additionally, the test was repeated
      filling each flask with H2 and 02 to 220 mm Hg. Catalysis of the
      reaction by only the physical catalyst yielded two baseline
      reaction curves which were in good agreement between flasks A and
      B, and for both the 110 mm and 220 mm Hg tests.<br>
      <br>
      Next, the traditional physical platinum catalyst in flask A was
      augmented with spectral catalyst platinum emissions from two (2)
      parallel Fisher Scientific Hollow Cathode<br>
      Platinum Lamps, as in Example 1, which were positioned
      approximately two (2) cm from flask A. The test was repeated as
      described above, separating the two (2) flasks from each other and
      monitoring the rate of the reaction via the pressure decrease in
      each. Flask B served as a control flask. In flask A, the oxygen
      and hydrogen gases, as well as the physical platinum catalyst,
      were directly irradiated with emissions from the Pt lamp spectral
      catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      Rate of reaction in the control flask B, was in good agreement
      with previous baseline rates. Rate of reaction in flask"A",
      wherein physical platinum catalyst was augmented with the platinum
      spectral pattern, exhibited an overall mean increase of 60%, with
      a maximal increase of 70% over the baseline and flask B.<br>
      <br>

        ALPHA ROTATION-VIBRATION CONSTANT</b><b><br>
      </b>Water was electrolyzed to produce stoichiometric amounts of
      hydrogen and oxygen gases as described above herein. Additionally,
      a dry ice cooled stainless steel coil was placed immediately after
      the Drierite column. After vacuum removal of all gases in the
      system, electrolysis was accomplished using a 12 V power source
      attached to the two electrodes, resulting in a production of
      hydrogen and oxygen gases. After passing through the Drierite
      column, the hydrogen and oxygen gases passed through vacuum tubing
      connected to positive and negative pressure gauges, through the
      dry ice cooled stainless steel coil and then to a 1,000 ml round,
      quartz flask. A strip of filter paper impregnated with dry (blue)
      cobalt was in the bottom of the quartz flask, as an indicator of
      the presence or absence of water.<br>
      <br>
      The entire system was vacuum evacuated to a pressure of about 700
      mm Hg below atmospheric pressure. Electrolysis was performed,
      producing hydrogen and oxygen gases in stoichiometric amounts, to
      result in a pressure of about 220 mm Hg above atmospheric
      pressure. The center of the quartz flask, now containing hydrogen
      and oxygen gases was irradiated for approximately 12 hours with
      continuous microwave electromagnetic radiation emitted from a
      Hewlett Packard microwave spectroscopy system which included an HP
      83350B Sweep Oscillator, an HP 8510B Network Analyzer, and an HP
      8513A Reflection<br>
      Transmission Test Set. The frequency used was 21.4 GHz, which
      corresponds to a fine splitting constant, the alpha
      rotation-vibration constant, of the hydroxy intermediate, and is
      thus a harmonic resonant heterodyne for the hydroxy radical. The
      cobalt strip changed strongly in color to pink which indicated the
      presence of water in the quartz flask, whose creation was
      catalyzed by a harmonic resonant heterodyne frequency for the
      hydroxy radical.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLE 7</b><b><br>
      </b><b>REPLACING A PHYSICAL CATALYST WITH A HYPERFINE SPLITTING
        FREQUENCY</b><b><br>
      </b>An experimental dark room was prepared, in which there is no
      ambient light, and which can be totally darkened. A shielded,
      ground room (Ace Shielded Room, Ace,<br>
      Philadelphia, PA, US, Model A6H3-16; 8 feet wide, 17 feet long,
      and 8 feet high copper mesh) was installed inside the dark room.<br>
      <br>
      Hydrogen peroxide (3%) was placed in nippled quartz tubes, which
      were then inverted in beakers filled with (3%) hydrogen peroxide,
      as described in greater detail herein.<br>
      <br>
      The tubes were allowed to rest for about 18 hours in the dark
      room, covered with nonmetallic light blocking hoods (so that the
      room could be entered without exposing the tubes to light).
      Baseline measurements of gases in the nippled tubes were then
      performed.<br>
      <br>
      Three nippled RF tubes were placed on a wooden grid table in the
      shielded room, in the center of grids 4,54, and 127; corresponding
      to distances of about 107 cm, 187 cm, and 312 cm respectively,
      from a frequency-emitting antenna (copper tubing 15 mm diameter,
      4.7 m octagonal circumference, with the center frequency at
      approximately 6.5 MHz. A 25 watt, 17 MHz signal was sent to the
      antenna. This frequency corresponds to a hyperfine splitting
      frequency of the hydrogen atom, which is a transient in the
      dissociation of hydrogen peroxide. The antenna was pulsed
      continuously by a BK Precision RF Signal Generator<br>
      Model 2005A, and amplified by an Amplifier Research amplifier,
      Model 25A-100. A control tube was placed on a wooden cart
      immediately adjacent to the shielded room, in the dark room. All
      tubes were covered with non-metallic light blocking hoods.<br>
      <br>
      After about 18 hours, gas production from dissociation of hydrogen
      peroxide and resultant oxygen formation in the nippled tubes was
      measured. The RF tube closest to the antenna produced 11 mm length
      gas in the capillary (34 mm3), the tube intermediate to the
      antenna produced a 5 mm length (10 mm3) gas, and the RF tube
      farthest from the antenna produced no gas. The control tube
      produced 1 mm gas. Thus, it can be concluded that the RF hyperfine
      splitting frequency for hydrogen increased the reaction rate
      approximately five (5) to ten (10) times.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 8</b><b><br>
      </b><b>REPLACING A PHYSICAL CATALYST WITH A MAGNETIC FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b>Hydrogen peroxide (15%) was placed in nippled quartz tubes,
      which were then inverted in beakers filled with (15%) hydrogen
      peroxide, as described above. The tubes were allowed to rest for
      four (4) hours on a wooden table in a shielded cage, in a dark
      room.<br>
      <br>
      Baseline measurements of gases in the nippled tubes were then
      performed.<br>
      <br>
      Remaining in the shielded cage, in the dark room, two (2) control
      tubes were left on a wooden table as controls. Two (2) magnetic
      field tubes were placed on the center platform of an ETS Helmholtz
      single axis coil, Model 6402,1.06 gauss/Ampere, pulsed at about 83
      Hz by a BK Precision 20 MHz Sweep/Function Generator, Model 4040.
      The voltage output of the function generator was adjusted to
      produce an alternating magnetic field of about 19.5 milliGauss on
      the center platform of the Helmholtz Coil, as measured by a
      Holaday Model HI-3627, three (3) axis ELF magnetic field meter and
      probe. Hydrogen atoms, which are a transient in the dissociation
      of hydrogen peroxide, exhibit nuclear magnetic resonance via<br>
      Zeeman splitting at this applied frequency and applied magnetic
      field strength. Thus, frequency of the alternating magnetic field
      was resonant with the hydrogen transients.<br>
      <br>
      After about 18 hours, gas production from dissociation of hydrogen
      peroxide and resultant oxygen formation in the nippled tubes was
      measured. The control tubes averaged about 180 mm gas formation
      (540mm3) while the tubes exposed to the alternating magnetic field
      produced about 810 mm gas (2,430 mm3), resulting in an increase in
      the reaction rate of approximately four (4) times.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 9</b><b><br>
      </b><b>NEGATIVELY CATALYZING A REACTION WITH AN ELECTRIC FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b>Hydrogen peroxide (15%) was placed in four (4) nippled quartz
      tubes which were inverted in hydrogen peroxide (15%) filled
      beakers, as described in greater detail above herein. The tubes
      were placed on a wooden table, in a shielded room, in a dark room.
      After four (4) hours, baseline measurements were taken of the gas
      in the capillary portion of the tubes.<br>
      <br>
      An Amplifier Research self-contained electromagnetic mode cell
      ("TEM") Model<br>
      TC1510A had been placed in the shielded, darkened room. A sine
      wave signal of about 133<br>
      MHz was provided to the TEM cell by a BK Precision RF Signal
      Generator, Model 2005A, and an Amplifier Research amplifier, Model
      25A100. Output levels on the signal generator and amplifier wave
      adjusted to produce an electric field (E-field) of about five (5)
      V/m in the center of the TEM cell, as measured with a Holaday
      Industries electric field probe, Model HI- 4433GRE, placed in the
      center of the lower chamber.<br>
      <br>
      Two of the hydrogen peroxide filled tubes were placed in the
      center of the upper chamber of the TEM cell, about 35 cm from the
      wall of the shielded room. The other two (2) tubes served as
      controls and were placed on a wooden table, also about 35 cm from
      the same wall of the shielded, dark room, and removed from the
      immediate vicinity of the TEM cell, so that there was no ambient
      electric field, as confirmed by E-field probe measurements.<br>
      <br>
      The 133 MHz alternating sine wave signal delivered to the TEM cell
      was well above the typical line width frequency at room
      temperature (e. g., about 100 KHz) and was theorized to be
      resonant with an n=20 Rydberg state of the hydrogen atom as
      derived from A E = c E314 where E is the change in energy in cm'\
      c is 7.51 +/-0.02 for the hydrogen state n = 20 and E is the
      electric field intensity in (Kv/cm) 2.<br>
      <br>
      After about five (5) hours of exposure to the electric field, the
      mean gas production in the tubes subjected to the E-field was
      about 17.5 mm, while mean gas production in the control tubes was
      about 58 mm.<br>
      <br>
      While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory or
      explanation, it is believed that the alternating electric field
      resonated with an upper energy level in the hydrogen atoms,
      producing a negative Stark effect, and thereby negatively
      catalyzing the reaction.<br>

      </b><b>AUGMENTATION OF A PHYSICAL CATALYST BY IRRADIATING
        REACTANTS/TRANSIENTS WITH A SPECTRAL CATALYST</b><b><br>
      </b>Hydrogen and oxygen gases were produced in stoichiometric
      amounts by electrolysis, as previously described in greater detail
      above herein. A stainless steel coil cooled in dry ice was placed
      immediately after the Drierite column. Positive and negative
      pressure gauges were connected after the coil, and then a 1,000 ml
      round quartz flask was sequentially connected with a second set of
      pressure gauges.<br>
      <br>
      At the beginning of each experimental run, the entire system was
      vacuum evacuated to a pressure of about minus 650 mm Hg. The
      system was sealed for about 15 minutes to confirm the maintenance
      of the generated vacuum and integrity of the connections.<br>
      <br>
      Electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen and oxygen gases was
      performed, as described previously.<br>
      <br>
      Initially, about 10 mg of finely divided platinum was placed into
      the round quartz flask. Reactant gases were allowed to react over
      the platinum and the reaction rate was monitored by increasing the
      rate of pressure drop over time, as previously described. The
      starting pressure was approximately in the mid-90's mm Hg positive
      pressure, and the ending pressure was approximately in the low
      30's over the amount of time that measurements were taken. Two (2)
      control runs were performed, with reaction rates of about 0.47 mm
      Hg/minute and about 0.48 mm Hg/minute.<br>
      <br>
      For the third run, a single platinum lamp was applied, as
      previously described, except that the operating current was
      reduced to about eight (8) mA and the lamp was positioned through
      the center of the flask to irradiate only the reactant/transient
      gases, and not the physical platinum catalyst. The reaction rate
      was determined, as described above, and was found to be about 0.63
      mm Hg/minute, an increase of 34%.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b>APPARENT POISONING OF A REACTION BY THE SPECTRAL PATTERN</b><b><br>
      </b><b>OF A PHYSICAL POISON</b><b><br>
      </b>The conversion of hydrogen and oxygen gases to water, over a
      stepped platinum physical catalyst, is known to be poisoned by
      gold. Addition of gold to this platinum catalyzed reaction reduces
      reaction rates by about 95%. The gold blocks only about one sixth
      of the platinum binding sites, which according to prior art, would
      need to be blocked to poison the physical catalyst to this degree.
      Thus, it was theorized that a spectral interaction of the physical
      gold with the physical platinum and/or reaction system could also
      be responsible for the poisoning effects of gold on the reaction.
      It was further theorized that addition of the gold spectral
      pattern to the reaction catalyzed by physical platinum could also
      poison the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      Hydrogen and oxygen gases were produced by electrolysis, as
      described above in greater detail. Finely directed platinum, about
      15 mg, was added to the round quartz flask.<br>
      <br>
      Starting pressures were about in the 90's mm Hg positive pressure,
      and ending pressures were about in the 20's mm Hg over the amount
      of time that measurements were taken.<br>
      <br>
      Reaction rates were determined as previously described. The first
      control run revealed a reaction rate of about 0.81 mm Hg/minute.<br>
      <br>
      In the second run, a Fisher Hollow Cathode Gold lamp was applied,
      as previously described, at an operating frequency of about eight
      (8) mA, (80% maximum current), through about the center of the
      round flask. The reaction rate increased to about 0.87 mm
      Hg/minute.<br>
      <br>
      A third run was then performed on the same reaction flask and
      physical platinum that had been in the flask exposed to the gold
      spectral pattern. The reaction rate decreased to about 0.75 mm
      Hg/minute.<br>

      </b><b> DISCLOSURES OF INTEREST</b><br>
      <br>
      Recent studies involving the interaction of electromagnetic
      radiation and matter have shown that radiation scattering
      phenomena are sometimes enhanced in the vicinity of rough
      surfaces. Exemplary enhanced phenomena include "Enhanced Raman
      Scattering" (ERS) observed when the scattering molecules are in
      the vicinity of surfaces with appropriate material and physical
      characteristics (J. E. Rowe, C. V. Shank, D. A. Zweiner and C. A.
      Murray, Physical Review Letters, 44, 1770 (1980); and D. A. Weitz,
      T. J. Gramila, A. Z. Genack and J. I. Gersten, Physical Review
      Letters, 45, 355 (1980)). Various theories are being advanced to
      explain this and other similarly enhanced scattering processes. As
      a result of such theoretical work, it has recently become apparent
      that these phenomena are associated with increased electromagnetic
      field intensities in the vicinity of certain surfaces due to
      resonance, image, and shape (or corona) effects.<br>
      <br>
      Shape effects associated with enhanced processes are similar to
      those observed in the vicinity of pointed metals and referred to
      as "corona" or "lightening rod" phenomena. Classical
      electromagnetic theory indicates that in the vicinity of sharply
      pointed materials, especially metals, electromagnetic field
      intensities increase dramatically. Consequently, interactions
      between matter and electromagnetic radiation which are dependent
      on electromagnetic field intensities will be enhanced in the
      regions surrounding such pointed bodies, due to increased field
      values in these regions.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the electromagnetic field in the vicinity of certain
      materials will have increased values as a result of resonances in
      the dielectric polarizability of the material (J. I. Gerstein and
      A. Nitzan, Journal of Chemical Physics, 73, 3023 (1980); and J. I.
      Gersten, Journal of Chemical Physics, 72, 5779 (1980)). Such
      polarizability resonances are often referred to as plasmon or
      polariton modes and can be localized in small dielectric
      particles, or extended over a dielectric surface. The probability
      of exciting such resonances in dielectric materials by irradiation
      with an electromagnetic field depends on the dielectric properties
      of the material and its environment, and on the material's
      morphological nature (i.e., degree and character of the surface
      roughness). Excitation of such surface plasmon or polariton modes
      lead to increased electromagnetic field intensities near the
      surfaces of such materials. Absorption or scattering of
      electromagnetic radiation by atoms or molecules depends on the
      electromagnetic field intensity, and hence will be enhanced near
      field enhancing materials. (An equivalent heuristic model
      considers a particle or a surface protrusion as a very efficient
      energy absorber which may transfer some energy to nearby atoms or
      molecules thereby enhancing the excitation of, or scattering by,
      the atoms or molecules.)<br>
      <br>
      Field enhancement due to the image effect is associated with the
      field due to the image charge distribution as discussed in the
      prior art.<br>
      <br>
      It is of interest to compare these enhanced field phenomena with
      focusing effects such as, for example, those due to simple
      dielectric lenses and concave mirrors. Clearly, light passing
      through an appropriate lens will be focused to a limited region,
      and in that region the electromagnetic field associated with the
      light will be intensified. However, such focusing effects are
      limited by the wavelength of the light, and the photons associated
      with the field cannot be confined to a region with characteristic
      dimension smaller than the wavelength of the light. Hence, while
      regions of intense optical power may be formed by focusing
      coherent radiation, such as that obtained from lasers, the effect
      is fundamentally limited by the wavelength of the light. However,
      the enhancement phenomena described above do not have such
      limitations, and regions of field enhancement smaller than that
      encountered using lenses and concave mirrors may be obtained.
      Furthermore, electromagnetic radiation which has already been
      optically focused with lenses may be further enhanced using the
      resonance, image, or shape phenomena, thereby obtaining extremely
      small regions of extremely high intensity fields.<br>
      <br>
      In the opposite spatial limit, lens optics is extremely cumbersome
      if large areas of high field intensities are desired. (Clearly,
      extremely large lenses which are impractical or impossible to
      fabricate could be used to focus light and obtain relatively large
      areas of increased field intensities. However, such techniques are
      highly impractical.) Resonance, image and corona phenomena, on the
      other hand, may be used in the vicinity of microscopic protrusions
      or particles distributed over large areas to obtain extended
      regions of substantially increased field intensities. The effect
      is similar to focusing light to a large number of points using a
      large number of lenses.<br>

      In order to understand the invention described in this
      specification, it is important to distinguish prior art surface
      chemistry, photochemistry, and surface photochemistry. These prior
      areas of study involve chemical interactions induced or effected
      by the interaction of molecules with light and/or with surfaces,
      but do not involve enhanced fields due to the resonance, image and
      corona phenomena described above.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention involves the use of induced electromagnetic field
      enhancement in improved chemical processing. Shape, image, and
      resonant polarizability phenomena are used to obtain regions of
      increased field intensities, where atomic and/or molecular
      interactions are advantageously affected to yield improved or
      increased chemical processing.<br>
      <br>
      According to the invention, irradiating, with electromagnetic
      radiation comprising a given wavelength, an appropriate body of
      characteristic dimension between about 5 .ANG. and about the given
      wavelength, results in enhancement of the electromagnetic field in
      the vicinity of the body. Placing atoms or molecules, capable of
      undergoing a photochemical reaction when exposed to radiation of
      the given wavelength, into the region of enhanced field adjacent
      to but spaced apart from the body results typically in an increase
      of the reaction rate over that observed absent the field
      enhancement. Exemplary reactions that can often be advantageously
      affected by this technique are photocatalysis, surface
      modification, image formation, isotope separation, heterogeneous
      or homogeneous chemical synthesis, and chemical purification via
      selective reaction of one component or isomer in a mixture.<br>

      </b><b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>A. Field Enhancement</b><br>
      <br>
      It is known that the electromagnetic field in the region of a
      pointed body near the point, or in the region of a microscopic
      body with appropriate dielectric properties, may be significantly
      increased. The latter dielectric effect stems from the fact that
      the field in the vicinity of an appropriate dielectric body may be
      viewed as the sum of two components--the background or incident
      field, present without the body, and the field induced by the
      polarized dielectric body (J. I. Gersten and A. Nitzan, Journal of
      Chemical Physics, 73, 3023 (1980); and J. I. Gersten, Journal of
      Chemical Physics, 72, 5779 (1980)). Since the two fields must be
      added to obtain the resultant net field in the vicinity of the
      dielectric body, a resonance in the induced field will result in
      large field intensities in the vicinity of the dielectric body. It
      should be noted that the induced field may have a sign opposite to
      that of the incident field, and in such situations field
      intensities lower than that of the incident field may result, if
      the induced field has values approximately equal to that of the
      incident field. The invention makes use of enhanced field
      intensities due to resonance, image or shape phenomena to
      stimulate or catalyze appropriate chemical processes. Regions of
      reduced field intensities may also be used advantageously in
      chemical processing, and fall within the term "enhanced" as used
      here, and within the scope of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>B. Alternative Methods of Field Enhancement</b><br>
      <br>
      Creation of fields with enhanced intensity by other techniques may
      be found in the literature. Lenses and concave mirrors, for
      example, may be used to focus light to limited regions of space
      thereby obtaining enhanced fields. However, such focusing effects
      are inherently limited by the wavelength of the light, and even
      laser light cannot be focused to spatial regions of dimension less
      than the wavelength of the light. On the other hand, and as
      previously discussed, it is impractical to obtain extended regions
      of enhanced field intensities using lens optics. The resonance,
      image and shape phenomena discussed in this application, however,
      may involve field enhancement over regions smaller (i.e., with
      higher resolution) or larger (similar to the use of many lenses)
      than that possible using lens optics.<br>
      <br>
      <b>C. The Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention resides in the realization that electromagnetic
      field intensities enhanced by resonance, image, or shape effects
      may be used to obtain improved chemical processing. Any chemical
      process affected by the presence of an electromagnetic field may
      be improved using this technique. Such processes include chemistry
      involving reactants generated or activated by photochemical
      processes, or chemistry with reaction rates affected by the
      presence of electromagnetic fields. Reactants may be generated in
      the course of photochemical processes by (1) exciting molecules,
      by direct excitation or energy transfer, to states for which
      chemical processes may be more likely, (2) ionizing or
      dissociating species yielding desired products, or products which
      then partake in chemical processes, or (3) exciting states which
      then decay to other states that actively participate in ensuing
      chemical reactions. These three processes may be generically
      characterized by absorption of one or more photons followed by
      subsequent chemical reaction. The enhanced field may also
      advantageously affect reaction rates by changing reactant
      properties without absorption of photons.<br>
      <br>
      <b>D. Details of Field Enhancement</b><br>
      <br>
      When specific types of bodies are irradiated with electromagnetic
      radiation appropriate field enhancement will result. Such field
      enhancement may advantageously affect chemical processes among
      reactants which are located within the enhanced field. Bodies
      capable of appropriately enhancing fields will generally have
      characteristic dimensions of between 5 Angstroms and the
      wavelength of the irradiating field. Irradiating electromagnetic
      fields will have wavelengths between 0.05 and 60 microns, or
      alternatively between 0.2 and 20 microns.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, in order for the field to be enhanced by appropriate
      dielectric resonance phenomena, the body must have a
      polarizability resonance in the spectral vicinity of the
      wavelength of the irradiating electromagnetic field. In spherical
      bodies, this resonance occurs at wavelengths for which the real
      part of the relative dielectric function will be approximately
      -2.+-.1, or -2.+-..5, and the imaginary part of the dielectric
      constant will be less than one. (In this specification the term
      relative dielectric function .epsilon.(.omega.) stands for the
      expression .epsilon..sub.p (.omega.)/.epsilon..sub.m (.omega.),
      where .epsilon..sub.p is the dielectric function of the field
      enhancing particle, and .epsilon..sub.m is the dielectric function
      of the surrounding medium. The angular frequency of the radiation
      is symbolized by .omega..)<br>
      <br>
      While it has been indicated that the field enhancing bodies will
      generally have characteristic dimensions of between 5 Angstroms
      and the wavelength of the irradiating field, it should be
      understood that the bodies need not be spherical. The field
      enhancing bodies may just as well be irregularly shaped with the
      required characteristic dimensions. While the particular shape of
      the irregularly shaped field enhancing body may shift the
      effective wavelength of any dielectric resonance, the basic field
      enhancement phenomena will, nevertheless, effectively occur.<br>
      <br>
      A simple schematic representation of an embodiment of the
      invention is shown in FIG. 1. In this figure, 11 represents
      appropriate electromagnetic radiation irradiating the field
      enhancing particle, 12 and reactants, 13. The field in the
      vicinity of the particle is increased and chemical processes
      involving one or more reactants, 13, are thereby enhanced.<br>
      <br>
      Clearly, most, if not all, applications of this invention will
      involve more than one field enhancing particle. For example, as
      shown in FIG. 2, the invention may be practiced with a multitude
      of field enhancing bodies, 12, perhaps suspended in a liquid,
      solid or a gas comprising reactant species, 13, which are
      appropriately irradiated with electromagnetic radiation 11.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 3, the field enhancing particles may be deposited
      or formed on a surface, 14. Irradiation in this case need not be
      at the angle shown, but may be at any orientation set to maximize
      desirable processing parameters. A particular embodiment of FIG. 3
      involves a solid body whose surface is appropriately rough thereby
      effectively simulating an aggregation of field enhancing
      particles. The rough surface may be grown, deposited or formed by
      any appropriate process (for the example of roughened
      electrochemical electrodes, see R. P. Van Dyne in Chemical and
      Biological Applications of Lasers, edited by C. B. Moore, Vol. 4
      (Academic, N.Y., 1978)). Molecules on or adjacent to the rough
      surface may partake in enhanced chemical processes as a result of
      the enhanced field.<br>
      <br>
      While the field enhancement associated with the corona effect is
      wavelength independent, the field enhancement associated with the
      resonance phenomenon is wavelength as well as shape dependent. The
      wavelength dependence associated with the resonance field
      enhancement may shift depending upon the number density and shapes
      of the field enhancing particles and the material composition of
      the medium surrounding the field enhancing body. The specification
      of the resonance condition for ensembles of enhancing bodies may
      be determined by theories readily available in the literature (M.
      Moscovitz, Journal of Chemical Physics, 69, 4159 (1978); and C. G.
      Granquist and O. Hunderi, Physical Review B, 16, 3513 (1977)).<br>
      <br>
      While the material composition of the field enhancing body may
      fall within a broad category of materials for which enhanced
      fields result, the following may assist the practitioner in
      initial selection of appropriate field enhancing materials.<br>
      <br>
      The shape dependent lightening rod effect will be strongest with
      most, if not all, metals. In this connection, the term metal
      implies that the absolute value of the dielectric coefficient at
      the radiation frequency is much larger than one.<br>
      <br>
      Resonant field enhancement will occur in the vicinity of
      appropriately shaped materials of the following composition. In
      the UV and visible, up to wavelengths of about 7500 Angstroms,
      metals which can support surface plasmons such as silver, gold,
      copper, etc., may be used. In addition, dielectric solids, such as
      cadmium sulphide, anthracene, or most solid organic dyes having
      internal electronic excited states at specific wavelengths may be
      used.<br>
      <br>
      In the infrared wavelength range, i.e., for wavelengths greater
      than about 7500 Angstroms, semiconductors, with either n or p
      doping sufficient to give free carrier plasmon resonances at the
      desired wavelength, may be used. Such semiconductors include
      silicon, germanium, indium antimonide, gallium arsenide, etc.
      Doped ionic semiconductors exhibiting interacting lattice
      vibration and phasmon resonances, such as doped silicon carbide,
      may also be used. Dielectrics with ionic optical lattice
      vibrations yielding resonances at specific wavelengths, such as
      silicon carbide in the vicinity of 10.6 microns, magnesium oxide
      in the vicinity of 16 microns, and aluminum oxide at a number of
      infrared wavelengths, may be used. Small bandgap semiconductors
      with polarizability resonances near the optical absorption edge,
      such as gallium aluminum arsenide in the vicinity of 1.3 microns,
      may also be used.<br>
      <br>
      The field enhancing body does not have to be compositionally
      homogeneous. The body may be a solid phase solution of two
      materials or may be made of inclusions of one material inside
      another. The appropriateness of the material composition of the
      body is determined by the existence of resonance conditions in the
      effective or net dielectric function of the final composite
      material.<br>
      <br>
      The field enhancing body may in itself have an internal structure
      designed either to produce a resonance at the specified wavelength
      or, as described below, to prevent reactant molecules from
      reaching certain volumes of space. For example, the body could be
      approximately spherical with an inner core and an outer surface
      layer of different materials.<br>
      <br>
      <b>E. Details of Enhanced Chemistry</b><br>
      <br>
      While enhanced electromagnetic fields have recently been used to
      enhance phenomena such as light scattering, field enhancement has
      not been used to improve or enhance chemical processing. The
      failure to apply field enhancement to chemical processing may be
      attributed partly to the fact that the body which is the source of
      field enhancement, may also provide a channel for energy damping
      or deexcitation of molecules excited in the enhanced field. The
      time dependence of such damping is critical if chemical processes,
      which are also time dependent, are to be advantageously enhanced.
      For example, applicants have found that in the vicinity close to
      the field enhancing particle (i.e., within 10 Angstroms) the
      energy transfer from the excited molecule to the field enhancing
      particle is usually so rapid that chemistry is only minimally
      enhanced. However, in regions removed from the field enhancing
      particle, the "damping" energy transfer from excited molecule to
      field enhancing particle usually decreases rapidly, while the
      field enhancing phenomenon still remains significant.
      Consequently, in regions somewhat removed (e.g., more than 0.1
      particle radii, or greater than 0.5, 3, 10 or 25 Angstroms in
      appropriate cases) from the field enhancing particle, chemical
      processing may be significantly enhanced without deleterious
      interferences due to damping phenomena. In accordance with this
      realization, this invention may be advantageously practiced using
      field enhancing particles which are coated with a layer of a
      neutral material so as to increase the likelihood that molecules
      which will partake in subsequent chemistry do not approach the
      field enhancing particles any closer than the optimum spacing
      required for enhanced chemistry.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the optimum spacing which plays a significant role
      in enhanced chemistry, other linewidth and wavelength overlap
      considerations may also play a significant role in the efficiency
      of energy transfer from the field enhancing particle to the
      reactant molecule. For example, the nonresonant nature of Raman
      scattering implies that overlap between the molecular resonance
      and the particle polarizability resonance is not critical for
      enhancement. However, in enhanced chemical reactions where
      on-resonance excitation of molecules is of significance, one must
      consider not only the absolute magnitude of the field enhancing
      phenomena, but also the wavelength behavior of the field
      enhancement. Efficiency of induced chemical processing will be
      maximized when the molecule absorption and the radiation
      wavelength are in near resonance (e.g., within 4 percent of each
      other in some cases). However, for cost effectiveness, it may be
      more advantageous to work with a system in which the magnitude of
      field enhancement is less dramatic, but the wavelength range over
      which the enhancement occurs is broad enough to overlap with the
      lineshape of the absorbing molecule. Alternatively, a molecule may
      be chosen, in large part, for lineshape characteristics which will
      overlap with those of the field enhancing particle. In such
      off-resonance embodiments, consideration must be given to the
      constructive or destructive interference of the induced field with
      the initial field, in determining whether to operate above or
      below resonance. (A more detailed discussion of the relevant
      mathematical consideration appears in section G below.)<br>
      <br>
      Advantageous use may also be made of intramolecular decay
      processes of excited molecules in order to maximize chemical
      processing when the field is enhanced via wavelength dependent
      polarizability resonances. If the excited state from which
      reaction occurs can be produced by internal relaxation from some
      higher lying state within the molecule, it may be advantageous to
      choose a radiation wavelength and particle resonance which are in
      resonance with absorption into this higher lying state. Enhanced
      absorption into the higher state will be followed by relaxation
      into the reactive state. The competing transfer of energy from the
      excited molecule (in the reactive state) to the enhancing
      particle, which is dependent on the dielectric properties of the
      particle and, in particular, is largest for .omega. satisfying
      .epsilon.(.omega.)=-1 (if the molecule to particle distance is
      much smaller than the particle characteristic size) will be less
      than that which would have occurred if enhanced absorption has
      occurred directly to the reacting state.<br>
      <br>
      While there may be many plasmon modes associated with the field
      enhancing particle, only the dipole modes are effective in
      enhancing absorption by the molecule for dimensional values of the
      field enhancing particle much less than the wavelength of light.
      Dimensional values of the field enhancing particle which are on
      the order of magnitude of the exciting light wavelength will
      result in higher order modes becoming more effective in
      transferring energy, and may be advantageously used in this
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>F. Specific Suggested Embodiments</b><br>
      <br>
      Many specific embodiments of this invention may be divided broadly
      into three categories, (a) photocatalysis of chemical reactions,
      (b) surface modification of solids and (c) lithographic or
      photographic image formation.<br>
      <br>
      In exemplary embodiments of (a) or (b) the enhancing bodies are
      distributed either over a surface or throughout a gaseous or
      liquid medium. The desired photochemical reaction is accelerated
      in the regions of enhanced field. The absorbing molecule may
      fragment, ionize, or tautomerize, react with another nearby
      molecule, or diffuse to the surface of either the enhancing body
      or another nearby body and undergo surface reaction.<br>
      <br>
      In embodiments involving rough surface configurations the
      enhancing bodies may be distributed over a substrate of another
      material. In this case, it is possible that excited molecules
      produced in the enhanced field region actually react with the
      substrate material, and may thus modify the substrate surface.<br>
      <br>
      The purpose of the desired photochemistry may include either
      heterogeneous or homogeneous chemical synthesis, isotope
      separation via selective reaction of one isotope, chemical
      purification via selective reaction of one component or isomer in
      a mixture, and surface modification (e.g., activation,
      passivation, corrosion protection, controlled roughening, etc.).
      The field enhancing bodies may be irradiated with either
      monochromatic light, to be absorbed only by a desired species, or
      by polychromatic light (e.g., sunlight or radiation from
      incandescent sources). In the latter case, advantageous use may be
      made of the wavelength specific nature of plasmon resonances to
      enhance only one component of the polychromatic light. So, for
      example, isotope separation may be achieved by wavelength specific
      photochemical activation of only one isotope in a mixture of two
      or more isotopic species even when polychromatic light is used.
      The photochemical processes to be enhanced may have rates
      proportional to either the first or higher powers of the
      electromagnetic field intensity. Examples of higher order
      processes include two or more photon absorption leading to
      unimolecular reaction (e.g., fragmentation, ionization, or
      isomerization), or bimolecular reaction. The rates of higher order
      processes will be enhanced more than lower order processes since
      these processes depend on higher powers of the enhanced field.
      Enhancement of such higher order processes may make possible
      photochemical applications that would be impracticably slow
      without the practice of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      In lithographic or photographic applications a desired image is
      produced by photochemical means on a surface or in a thin material
      layer on a surface (e.g., the resist). In such cases, the
      enhancing bodies may be distributed on the surface or throughout
      the thin resist layer.<br>
      <br>
      Two separate techniques for image formation may be considered. In
      the first technique the enhancing bodies are uniformly distributed
      and an optical image is projected onto the surface using an
      external optical system. The enhanced photochemistry of image
      formation associated with this invention yields an increased
      sensitivity or photographic speed. Photochemical image formation
      using two or more photon absorption can be envisioned in view of
      this invention. In the second image formation configuration, the
      image to be formed is contained in a prearranged nonuniform
      distribution of enhancing particles on a surface. The
      photochemical image is formed when appropriate radiation is
      uniformly distributed across the surface. This second method has a
      distinct advantage in that image resolution is not limited by
      wavelength, as in a conventional optical photoresist and in the
      first technique described above, but is rather determined by the
      size and precision of location of enhancing particles on the
      surface. Resolutions limited only by the size of the field
      enhancing particles may, as discussed above, be as small as
      .about.10 Angstroms.<br>
      <br>
      <b>G. General Mathematical Description</b><br>
      <br>
      While the above discussion has been in nonmathematical terms, the
      more sophisticated practitioner in the art may benefit from the
      following more detailed description of field enhancement via a
      single sphere.<br>
      <br>
      Consider a molecule at distance d from the surface of a material
      sphere of radius a. The molecule is modeled as a polarizable
      absorbing point dipole with characteristic frequency
      .omega..sub.l. Both a and d are much smaller than the field
      wavelength .lambda., and we additionally assume d&lt;&lt;a. Sphere
      excitation is characterized by multipole plasmon modes of
      frequency .omega..sub.l and damping rates .lambda..sub.l,
      .epsilon.(.omega..sub.l +i.lambda..sub.l)=-(l+1)/l, (l=1,2,3, . .
      . ). .epsilon. is the ratio between the dielectric functions of
      the sphere and of the surrounding medium. The radiation field
      principally interacts with the dipolar l=1 mode, which we
      approximate as a Drude oscillator with polarizability parameters
      taken from experimental .epsilon.(.omega.) data. All the sphere
      multipoles are involved in accepting energy from the excited
      moleule.<br>
      <br>
      The dynamical behavior is described by an oscillator representing
      the molecule coupled to a triply degenerate oscillator
      representing the dipolar (l=1; m=0, .+-.1) sphere modes. The
      coupling is due to the dipole-dipole interaction, decreasing as
      (a+d).sup.-3. In addition, the molecule decays with a rate given
      by a free molecule term, and a surface induced term which arises
      from the molecular interaction with all l&gt;1 modes. To a good
      approximation this can be calculated using the plane image dipole
      field. The molecular polarizability is calculated from
      experimental radiative lifetime data. Our model differs from that
      used to discuss intermolecular energy transfer in that (a) the
      sphere oscillator is triply degenerate and its polarizability is
      macroscopically large, and (b) the presence of a macroscopic body
      increases the nonradiative decay rate of the molecule. We now
      discuss two examples illustrating different types of enhanced
      photochemical processes.<br>
      <br>
      I.sub.2 photodissociation near 4500 Angstroms is a 1-photon
      process with a short (.about.10.sup.-14 sec) excited state
      lifetime. We have simulated the continuous I.sub.2 absorption by a
      broad Lorentzian resonance. FIG. 4 shows the steady-state I.sub.2
      dipole excitation lineshape for several values of distance d near
      an Ag sphere. The sphere dipolar resonance occurs near 3540
      Angstroms. The lineshape in FIG. 4 directly gives the excitation
      spectrum for I atom production in view of the short I.sub.2
      lifetime. There are two apparent effects leading to enhanced
      photochemistry, (a) the integrated intensity of the 4500 Angstroms
      absorption increases as d decreases due to enhanced local field at
      this wavelength, and (b) there is a new photodissociation maximum
      at the sphere wavelength 3540 Angstroms, resulting from sphere
      absorption followed by energy transfer to I.sub.2.<br>
      <br>
      We have also modeled the IR multiphoton dissociation of a molecule
      near an n-type InSb sphere doped to give a free carrier plasmon
      resonance nearly coinciding with a CO.sub.2 laser line. We could
      alternately employ a dielectric material such as SiC with an ionic
      optical phonon dipolar resonance. FIG. 5 shows the energy of this
      molecule when irradiated by a CO.sub.2 laser at 10.4.mu..
      Enhancement ratios of 10.sup.2 -10.sup.3 in pumping rate may be
      obtained. Such enhancement may occur within a few picoseconds of
      initiation of irradiation. The molecule is modeled as a damped
      harmonic oscillator with parameters corresponding to the
      0.fwdarw.1.nu..sub.3 transition of SF.sub.6 (965 cm.sup.-1), and
      the doping in InSb was set to provide a dipole sphere resonance at
      967 cm.sup.-1. The incident intensity corresponds to a pulse power
      of 2.times.10.sup.8 Watt. It is seen from FIG. 5 that the highest
      rate of energy accumulation by the molecule occurs at relatively
      large (.about.20 Angstroms) distances. This is due to the sharp
      dependence (.about.d.sup.-3) of the molecular damping, in contrast
      to the mild dependence (.about.(d+a).sup.-3) of the field
      enhancement, on the molecule-surface distance. However, even at
      d=150 Angstroms the effective absorption cross-section is enhanced
      considerably. Occurrence of enhanced processes so soon after
      initial irradiation shows that enhanced photochemical processes
      may compete successfully with rapid dissipative processes.<br>

      <b>ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      (1) Irradiating, with electromagnetic radiation of approximately
      3540 .ANG. wavelength, Ag spheres of appropriate size (i.e.,
      diameter within the above disclosed range, namely, between about 5
      .ANG. and the radiation wavelength) produces a high dissociation
      rate in I.sub.2 molecules located about 5 .ANG. from the sphere
      surface, and a somewhat lower rate for I.sub.2 molecules about 50
      .ANG. from the surface. In the absence of the field enhancing Ag
      spheres the dissociation rate is essentially zero, as shown by
      FIG. 4.<br>
      <br>
      (2) Irradiating, with pulsed CO.sub.2 laser radiation (10.4 .mu.m,
      2.multidot.10.sup.8 W pulse power), InSb spheres of appropriate
      size (i.e., with diameter within the above disclosed range,
      namely, between about 5 .ANG. and the radiation wavelength) doped
      n-type to yield a dipole sphere resonance at 967 cm.sup.-1 (10.34
      .mu.m), results in increased molecular absorption in SF.sub.6
      molecules located between about 5 .ANG. and about 150 .ANG. from
      the surface. For instance, 4 psec after commencement of the
      irradiation, molecules located 5, 20, 50, and 150 .ANG. from the
      surface on average will have accumulated the energy corresponding
      to 11, 16, 11, and 4 quanta of radiation, respectively, whereas
      molecules located 2 .ANG. from the surface will have accumulated
      only 0.25 quanta, and free molecules (i.e., those not adjacent to
      a field-enhancing sphere) only 0.2 quanta, as shown by FIG. 5.<br>

      </b><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a method for making high energy
      hydrocarbon products using chemical reactions that are induced by
      excitation energy derived from a low power plasma. Also disclosed
      herein is a method for cracking hydrocarbon materials using a
      low-power plasma and a catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      A plasma containing ionized gases can be created by accelerating
      randomly occurring free electrons in an electric field until they
      attain sufficient energy to cause ionization of some of the gas
      molecules. Electrons formed in this ionization are in turn
      accelerated and produce further ionization. This progressive
      effect causes extensive breakdown of the gas accompanied by a
      rising level of electric current, and establishment of a
      discharge. This condition is often referred to as a discharge
      plasma. When sufficient energy has been applied, a steady state
      may be attained. At steady state there is an equilibrium between
      the rate of ion formation and the rate of recombination of the
      ions.<br>
      <br>
      The electrical conductivity associated with discharge plasmas is
      caused by the drift of electrons in the electric field. Protons
      are also present in the plasma, but do not have a significant
      effect on the electric field because of their low drift velocity.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to ionization, radical formation also occurs in a
      discharge plasma containing molecules consisting of two or more
      atoms. Radical formation is most often caused by the removal of
      one or more atoms from a molecule.<br>
      <br>
      Plasma chemistry is the study of reactions of the species found in
      plasmas, i.e., atoms, free radicals, ions and electrons. The
      principles of plasma chemistry have been applied in such diverse
      areas as: chemical vapor deposition; substrate oxidation and
      anodization (such as formation of magnetic recording tape); and
      high temperature, high energy, plasma conversion of methane to
      acetylene (e.g. the Dupont arc acetylene process).<br>
      <br>
      High energy hydrocarbon feedstocks such as ethylene and acetylene
      are vital to the petrochemical industry. However, these feedstocks
      are not found naturally in great abundance. One of the most
      prevalent hydrocarbon sources is natural gas. Natural gas contains
      over 90% methane, thermodynamically the most stable hydrocarbon.
      The energy needed to break one of the four C-H bonds of methane is
      about 415 kJ/mol.<br>
      <br>
      Conversion of methane to other hydrocarbons to provide useful
      feedstocks is desirable, yet difficult due to the highly
      endothermic nature of the requisite conversion reaction.
      Typically, such conversion reactions have relied on high
      temperature reaction conditions. However, high temperature
      reactions are hard to control, and under such conditions it is
      difficult to prevent formation of unwanted by-products.<br>
      <br>
      Industrial scale hydrocarbon cracking processes using plasma
      technology require extensive amounts of power in the form of
      electricity. For example, the Dupont acetylene process mentioned
      above, uses a plasma jet with a temperature of over 4000 K. This
      high temperature plasma jet is created by passing an electric
      current through a gaseous medium. The large amounts of electricity
      needed to create a high temperature plasma jet, and the poor
      selectivity (i.e., controllability) of the reaction and reaction
      products using such high temperature processes provide an
      incentive for the development of lower temperature reactions.<br>
      <br>
      Other thermal techniques that have been employed to "crack"
      methane to form useful feedstocks include low and high frequency
      electrode and electrodeless discharge, triboelectric discharge,
      and laser irradiation. However, there are problems associated with
      each of these techniques, which make them unsuitable or
      impractical for large scale application. Electrical discharge
      results in coating of reactant on the electrode; triboelectric
      discharge involves potentially dangerous pressure changes, and is
      difficult to scale up. Laser irradiation is expensive and
      potentially corrosive to the reaction chamber.<br>
      <br>
      Another technique which has been used in the search for an
      efficient cracking process for methane is microwave discharge.
      Microwave plasmas are created in the same manner as high
      temperature plasmas, although different microwave frequencies and
      less electric power is required to establish a plasma.<br>
      <br>
      Several investigators have explored the use of plasmas in chemical
      reactions. McCarthy, J. Chem. Phys., 22:1360 (1954), obtained an
      energy yield of approximately 3600 kJ for each mole of C.sub.2
      hydrocarbon produced using microwave discharge. McCarthy employed
      a pulsed microwave source at an output power level of 1500 watts.<br>
      <br>
      One example of a relatively high efficiency reaction, not
      involving a plasma, is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,574,038 to
      Wan, issued Mar. 4, 1986. Wan discloses a microwave-induced
      catalytic hydrocracking process for the selective conversion of
      methane to ethylene and hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      The method disclosed by Wan involves exposing methane and a
      microwave-absorbing catalyst to microwave energy, with pulsed
      microwave energy sufficient to convert the methane to ethylene and
      hydrogen. According to Wan, in order for the reaction to proceed
      with viable speed and selectivity, it is important that the
      catalyst be capable of attaining temperatures of 1400.degree. to
      1600.degree. F.<br>
      <br>
      In one example, Wan placed a Ni-Fe (85-15%) powder catalyst (0.1
      g) in a reaction cell. The catalyst was pretreated with a stream
      of hydrogen and high power microwave radiation to remove oxide
      from the metal powder surface. Methane was then introduced to the
      reaction cell at a pressure of one atmosphere of methane. Wan
      applied a microwave energy source of 2.4 GHz at 100 watt incident
      power level to the gas stream. The microwave generator was
      operated to provide 5 second "on-time" pulses for a cumulative
      duration of 20 seconds irradiation with off-time rests of 20-60
      seconds. By this technique, Wan obtained yields of 51.3% ethylene,
      26.7% hydrogen and 21.8% methane. With other catalysts Wan
      obtained ethylene at 16% yield (Ni catalyst) and 14.6% (Co
      catalyst).<br>
      <br>
      A major disadvantage of the Wan process, and other high power
      cracking processes, is that a heavy coke residue is deposited on
      the walls of the reactor and/or on the catalyst that is employed
      to accelerate the reaction. To maintain the reactor in operation
      the microwave induced reaction must frequently be discontinued and
      the residue removed. Hence, the reactor is frequently out of
      service. In Wan for example, the reactor is scrubbed with hydrogen
      gas to remove oxides which have contaminated the catalyst. In
      addition, the Wan process does not use a plasma, and the process
      entails pulsing the microwave power on and off. As a result, the
      Wan process is relatively inefficient. The catalyst must be
      scrubbed periodically, requiring a hydrogen stream and additional
      energy. In addition, the cracking reaction is stopped while the
      catalyst is scrubbed. Therefore, the Wan method does not offer
      continuous production of a desired reaction product.<br>
      <br>
      By virtue of its widespread availability and low cost, methane is
      a desirable raw material for use in producing high energy
      hydrocarbon feedstocks. In addition to simple high energy
      hydrocarbon feedstocks such as ethylene, acetylene, propane,
      propylene, butane and butene, it is also desirable to produce
      oxygenated hydrocarbon feedstocks such as formaldehyde and
      methanol from methane. Thermal, non-plasma techniques can be used
      to oxidize methane at high temperatures (e.g.,
      300.degree.-700.degree. C.). However, this technique affords
      relatively low selectivity in terms of creating chemical bonds,
      and rupturing existing bonds in the raw starting material. Various
      catalysts such as metal oxides, non-metal oxides and mixed oxides
      have been used in these reactions. These catalysts include: MgO,
      Li-doped MgO, La.sub.2 O.sub.3, and mixtures of NaCl and
      MnO.sub.2. The yields observed with these catalysts range from
      about 0.1% to 30%.<br>
      <br>
      It has been shown that discharge plasma processes involving
      methane gas as a reactant can produce radicals of H, CH.sub.3,
      CH.sub.2, and CH in the gas phase. When oxygen alone is used as
      the reactant, several radical species are obtained, including O,
      O.sub.2.sup.+ and others. Previous attempts to create a plasma
      from a mixture of hydrocarbons and oxygen using a glow discharge
      arrangement, resulted in the formation of completely oxidized
      hydrocarbon, i.e, CO.sub.2. Water and polymer deposits are also
      formed on the walls of the reactor. Nonetheless, oxygen-rich
      plasmas have been used commercially in adhesion processes and for
      selectively activating aromatic species.<br>
      <br>
      Although microwave radiation has been used to crack methane, large
      quantities of power have conventionally been required to
      accomplish this objective, and substantial heat is evolved during
      the cracking process. Thus, the cost of electricity used to create
      the microwave radiation is a major factor in the low cost
      efficiency of feedstocks produced according to conventional
      microwave radiation plasma methods. In addition, the use of high
      power microwave radiation can rapidly foul catalysts used in the
      cracking process, resulting in additional loss of efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      It is an object of the present invention to provide an efficient,
      selective and economical process for cracking small chain, low
      energy hydrocarbons in order to create high energy hydrocarbons
      useful as industrial feedstocks.<br>
      <br>
      It is an additional object of the present invention to provide an
      efficient, selective and economical process for cracking small
      chain, low energy hydrocarbons in the presence of oxygen in order
      to create high energy oxygenated hydrocarbons useful as industrial
      feedstocks.<br>
      <br>
      A still further object of the present invention is to provide a
      system for use in producing substituted and unsubstituted high
      energy hydrocarbons from low energy hydrocarbons.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention is directed to a method for cracking a
      hydrocarbon material. The method includes introducing a stream
      including a hydrocarbon fluid and optionally a carrier fluid into
      a reaction zone. A microwave discharge plasma is continuously
      maintained within the reaction zone, and in the presence of the
      hydrocarbon fluid and the optional carrier fluid. Reaction
      products of the microwave discharge are collected downstream of
      the reaction zone.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      It has now been discovered that extremely low power microwave
      energy levels can be used in a continuous process for the
      conversion of short chain hydrocarbons to useful feedstocks. The
      low energy microwave radiation maintains a plasma of a primary
      reaction material such as methane gas alone or a gas stream of a
      mixture of the primary reactant and another reactant such as
      oxygen within a reaction zone. The present process is capable of
      converting almost 100% of the primary reactant to a high energy
      hydrocarbon. This is particularly surprising because the
      conversion is accomplished by using 25 to 1000 times less energy
      than prior art microwave processes.<br>
      <br>
      While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory of
      operation, it is believed that the conversion system of the
      present invention requires substantially less energy because
      almost all of the low power microwave energy emitted into the
      reaction zone is utilized to selectively break the bonds of the
      hydrocarbon reactant. For example, if methane is used as the
      reactant, almost all of the energy is used to break the C-H bonds
      of the methane molecule, and to activate (by exciting or breaking)
      bonds of the carrier fluid molecules. <br>
      <br>
      <b>The Process</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIG. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the process of the
        present invention.</b><br>
      <br>
      According to a preferred process of the present invention, a
      hydrocarbon fluid reactant 2 to be cracked is provided. The
      hydrocarbon is mixed with a carrier fluid 4. The carrier primarily
      serves to dilute the hydrocarbon fluid, and may be either inert or
      reactive. The hydrocarbon fluid mixed with the carrier may then be
      heated, cooled, photolyzed or preirradiated at 6. The hydrocarbon
      fluid and carrier is then introduced at a predetermined flow rate
      through an inlet orifice 7 to a reactor 8 having a reaction zone
      9, at a predetermined flow rate.<br>
      <br>
      The reactor may be either a separate vessel or simply a segment of
      a quartz tube in which the cross-sectional area has been expanded
      (e.g., using glass blowing techniques) to provide an enlarged
      volume. A source of microwave energy 10 is then applied
      (irradiated into) the reactor zone and in presence of the
      hydrocarbon and carrier gas that are being admitted into the
      reaction zone. The frequency and power of the microwave energy are
      adjusted to the point at which a microwave discharge plasma can be
      maintained, hydrocarbon bonds of the primary reactant may be
      broken, but polymerization of the hydrocarbon or its decomposition
      products or radicals does not occur.<br>
      <br>
      After the microwave energy has been applied to the reaction zone
      containing the hydrocarbon and carrier, a microwave discharge
      plasma is initiated within the reaction zone. The plasma can be
      initiated by introducing a spark into the system.<br>
      <br>
      After passing through the reaction zone containing the microwave
      discharge plasma, the hydrocarbon fluid is conducted through an
      outlet 11 in the reactor and is allowed to contact a catalyst 12
      placed immediately downstream of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      After contacting the catalyst, reaction products formed by passage
      of the hydrocarbon and carrier through the microwave discharge
      plasma and catalyst, are collected downstream of the catalyst 12.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PRIMARY HYDROCARBON REACTANT</b><br>
      <br>
      The hydrocarbon (primary) reactant used in the present process,
      may be any hydrocarbon having between 1 and 6 carbons. The
      hydrocarbon may be straight or branched chain; saturated or
      unsaturated; and may have optionally have a functional group.
      Representative examples include, methane, ethane, propane,
      n-butane, pentane, hexane, iso-butane, ethylene, propene, and
      mono-or di-butene, or mixtures thereof, such as natural gas. Among
      the hydrocarbons having functional groups the following are
      representative: haloalkanes; alcohols; ethers; thiols; alkenes;
      alkynes; aldehydes; ketones; carboxylic acids; anhydrides; esters;
      amides; nitriles; and amines.<br>
      <br>
      Ideally, the hydrocarbon should be selected from those fully
      saturated hydrocarbons having between 1 and 4 carbons, i.e.,
      methane, ethane, propane, iso-propane, iso-butane or n-butane.
      Methane is especially preferred as the primary reactant for use in
      the invention by virtue of its ready availability and low cost.
      These hydrocarbons are desirable as starting materials because
      they are all gaseous at standard temperature and pressure. It is
      important that the hydrocarbon be introduced to the reactor in the
      gas phase.<br>
      <br>
      Other hydrocarbon materials may also be employed as primary
      reactants in the process of the invention, provided they are
      heated or subjected to reduced pressure before being introduced to
      the reactor, to ensure that only gas phase hydrocarbons are
      introduced to the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CARRIER</b><br>
      <br>
      It is important, although not essential, to admix a carrier fluid
      with the hydrocarbon, before the hydrocarbon enters the reactor.
      The carrier should also enter the reactor in the gas phase. The
      properties of the carrier may affect the reaction conditions in
      the reactor. For some reactions, it may be desirable to employ an
      inert carrier gas to serve primarily as a diluent for the
      hydrocarbon and to provide alternate pathways for reaction by
      promoting collisions between gas phase species. Inert carrier
      gases that are useful in the present invention include noble gases
      such as helium, neon, krypton, xenon and argon.<br>
      <br>
      It has been surprisingly discovered that oxygen, hydrogen and
      nitrogen may also be employed as carrier gases for a hydrocarbon,
      both for reactions where the carrier is to serve primarily as a
      diluent, and for reactions in which it is desired that the carrier
      react with the hydrocarbon to form, e.g., oxygenated hydrocarbons,
      such as formaldehyde. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it
      is believed that oxygen may serve to prevent coke formation, and
      may also scrub coke already formed on reactor walls or on catalyst
      surfaces by forming carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide from the
      carbon of the coke. For these reasons, oxygen is the preferred
      carrier gas. Nitrogen and hydrogen may operate in a similar manner
      and are also considered as being among the preferred diluent
      gases.<br>
      <br>
      If desired, noble gas carrier species can be activated to create
      excited noble gas species upstream from the plasma zone. The high
      energy species are then introduced to the plasma at energy states
      higher than the ground state to generate radicals requiring high
      amounts of energy. The noble species can be activated upstream of
      the plasma zone using the emissions from ultraviolet photolamps,
      laser or plasma radiation, to excite the gas, prior to
      introduction of the excited gas species into the plasma zone of
      the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FLUID CONDITIONS</b><br>
      <br>
      Before introduction of the primary hydrocarbon reactant and
      optional carrier fluids to the reactor, it may be desirable to
      alter their physical characteristics. As set forth above, it is
      important that both fluids be introduced into the reactor in the
      gaseous phase. Liquids can be vaporized to the gas phase by
      heating to the vaporization temperature or by lowering the ambient
      pressure sufficiently to cause vaporization of the liquid. Thus,
      the process of the present invention, can include the steps of
      heating or cooling the fluid starting materials to convert them to
      gaseous form or changing the pressure of the gases introduced to
      the reactor. It is preferred that the pressure of the gases be
      between about 3 and 760 torr.<br>
      <br>
      It is highly desirable to thoroughly mix the carrier and
      hydrocarbon fluids prior to introduction of the fluids to the
      reactor. Admixture of the carrier and hydrocarbon fluids can be
      accomplished by having separate supply tubing lines for the
      hydrocarbon and carrier fluids meet at a "Y-tube", wherein the
      fluids are mixed and continue to flow in a single supply line
      towards the reactor inlet 7.<br>
      <br>
      Another important variable in the reactor conditions is the flow
      rate at which the hydrocarbon and carrier gas are admitted into
      the reaction zone of the reactor. Because the mixture of
      hydrocarbon and carrier gas serves as fuel for the microwave
      discharge plasma, it is important to optimize the flow rate of
      these gases into the reactor to ensure that the plasma is
      maintained as efficiently as possible. For a cylindrical reactor
      of 12 mm outside diameter, served by a microwave power supply of
      0.1 to 100 watts emitted at 2.45 GHz, suitable flow rates range
      from 0.1 to 1000 mL/min. Preferred flow rates range from 20 to 500
      mL/min.<br>
      <br>
      It is possible to calculate the relative rates of reaction for the
      cracking process of the present invention, in order to optimize
      the microwave power and other variables of the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      Assuming a power of 60 watts supplied by the microwave generator,
      the volume of the microwave plasma generated is 1.508 cc. Thus,
      the power density is 60 watts/1.508 cc, or 39.79 watts/cc.<br>
      <br>
      The following table is constructed based on data assembled from
      Examples 28-45.<br>

      <br>
      It is observed that as the pressure increases, (more CH.sub.4
      reactant) the reaction rate remains relatively constant. It may
      then be inferred that the specific type of reactor is not an
      important variable, because the reaction rate doesn't depend on
      the instantaneous CH.sub.4 concentration during passage through
      the plasma. Thus, whether a "plug flow" or "piston flow" reactor
      arrangement is used, where concentration of reactant varies with
      flow, or a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) is used, where
      the concentration remains constant throughout the reactor, the
      shape of the reactor does not matter. Therefore, the critical
      factor to be considered is efficiency of transfer of microwave
      energy to the reactants. This efficiency may be quantified in
      terms of power density of the reactor. Power density is dependant
      upon microwave power and flow rate. In turn, flow rate is
      dependent upon the pressure and dimensions of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      <b>REACTOR</b><br>
      <br>
      The reactor employed in operating the microwave discharge process
      is an enclosed chamber or container having an inlet orifice and an
      outlet orifice. The reactor must be constructed of materials that
      are capable of containing a microwave discharge plasma, and the
      reactor walls must allow the passage of microwave energy to the
      interior of the reactor. The reactor should be airtight. Means for
      providing high voltage spark ignition within the reactor must be
      provided. The spark is used to initiate the plasma within the
      reactor and the spark supply device must be positioned to
      introduce a charge to the reaction zone of the reaction. The
      volume and shape of the reactor can be chosen to optimize reaction
      conditions for particular reactions. In one embodiment, the
      preferred reactor is constructed of tubular quartz. The laboratory
      scale reactor employed in Examples 2-45 herein has an outside
      diameter of 12 mm. However, larger size reactors may be
      constructed using the same materials. In one preferred embodiment,
      valves are provided for controlling the admission to, and exhaust
      from the reactor of the gaseous reactants and decomposition
      products.<br>
      <br>
      <b>MICROWAVE SOURCE</b><br>
      <br>
      Any suitable device capable of generating microwave energy may be
      employed in practicing the cracking process of the invention. It
      is preferred that the generator emit microwaves at a frequency in
      the 2.45 GHz range and at a variable output power level of between
      about 0.1 and 100 watts, i.e., the microwave generator can be
      adjusted to an output power level of between about 0.1 and 100
      watts. In one preferred embodiment, an output power level of 40
      watts is employed. In general, the output power of the microwave
      generator is adjusted to provide the most efficient level of
      cracking, i.e., maximum production of decomposition reactants, at
      the lowest level of energy consumption. Care must also be taken to
      provide sufficient microwave energy to break the hydrocarbon bonds
      in the primary reactant, while avoiding polymerization of the
      decomposition products of the plasma discharge reaction.
      Generators emitting microwaves at other power levels and/or
      frequencies may be used, depending on reaction conditions. To
      focus the microwave energy on the interior of the reactor, a wave
      guide is employed.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the quartz reactor is placed in close proximity to a
      Raytheon microwave 1/4 wave Evenson-type cavity. The Evenson 1/4
      wave cavity directs the microwave energy emitted from the
      generator by guiding the energy to encircle the quartz reactor.
      The Evenson cavity is adjustable such that the microwave energy
      can be introduced locally to the plasma, and thereby used to
      control the volume of the plasma.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CATALYSTS</b><br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention, it is possible to crack or
      activate hydrocarbons such as methane, for example, by breaking
      C-H bonds using the microwave plasma without a catalyst. However,
      the ability to control the reaction and produce specific desired
      end products is generally low in the absence of a catalyst. In
      other words, the selectivity associated with the reaction is
      usually low unless a catalyst is provided. Selection of an
      appropriate catalyst is essential, if high selectivity of the end
      product and good control of the reaction is to be obtained.
      However, as shown below, careful selection of reactants and
      reaction conditions can also result in high selectivity of end
      product.<br>
      <br>
      The catalyst should be positioned downstream of the reaction zone.
      If the catalyst is placed within the plasma reaction zone there is
      a significant danger that the surface of the catalyst may become
      prematurely coked. It has been found that the best results are
      obtained by locating the catalyst just outside the zone in which
      the microwave plasma is created. The catalyst can be placed within
      the tubing carrying gases from the reactor outlet. Alternatively,
      and preferably, the catalyst may be placed within a U-tube
      downstream of the reactor outlet.<br>
      <br>
      Selection of the catalyst is dependent somewhat on reactants and
      reaction conditions. Generally, a metal or metal oxide material is
      employed as the catalyst. If methane is used as the reactant gas,
      the catalyst must be a hydrogen acceptor if high selectivity
      towards ethane or ethylene is to be attained. For the production
      of olefins, it is necessary to use a catalyst that can adsorb
      hydrogen, such that unsaturated species will result. Typically,
      dehydrogenation catalysts such as nickel are used for this
      purpose.<br>
      <br>
      Platinum catalysts are strong oxidizing catalysts. Large amounts
      of CO.sub.2 are formed when Pt is used as a catalyst with the
      process of the present invention. At the same time, relatively
      large amounts of HCHO are formed. Conversely, nickel catalysts
      tend to minimize the formation of highly oxidized species and
      favor methanol production instead. Representative examples of
      catalysts which can be used in the present invention include:
      nickel, platinum, iron, nickel/iron, nickel/silica,
      nickel/yttrium, nickel/alumina, platinum/alumina, manganese oxide,
      manganese trioxide and molybdenum trioxide.<br>
      <br>
      To be useful in the present invention, a catalyst should be
      resistant to coking under low power microwave reaction conditions,
      and should also be thermally and photochemically stable. Thermal
      stability refers to the ability of the catalyst to withstand the
      operating temperatures of the hydrocarbon cracking reactions
      carried out using the low power microwave energy conditions of the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      In general, to be useful as a catalyst element in the instant
      process, a composition must withstand continuous long term
      exposure to temperatures up to about 500.degree. C. Long term
      exposure refers to the intended duration of operation of the
      reactor vessel of the invention. It is contemplated that in
      commercial operation the microwave cracking process of the
      invention may be conducted continuously for several days, or more
      before the process is halted for cleaning the reaction vessel. The
      catalyst element of the invention should be non-volatile under
      operating conditions. A high catalyst surface area is desirable. A
      high surface area can be attained by providing the catalyst in a
      suitable shape or size, e.g. in finely divided powder form. In an
      alternative arrangement, the catalyst can take the form of a fine
      mesh screen or a sintered disc. In addition, the catalyst array
      may be disposed on one or more silica supports that are positioned
      in the reactant stream.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b> TRAP</b><br>
      <br>
      Downstream of the catalyst, volatile reaction products may be
      collected or impurities removed according to methods known to the
      art. One such method includes providing a cold trap 14 of liquid
      nitrogen or dry ice. A liquid nitrogen trap operates by providing
      a reservoir of liquid nitrogen and the gaseous phase cracking
      reaction products are bubbled into the liquid nitrogen. The
      reaction products are liquified or solidified by the liquid
      nitrogen, trapping them within the liquid nitrogen. A vacuum
      source 16 is provided downstream of the trap.<br>
      <br>
      The various parameters of the reaction process, such as
      temperature of the reactant gas, configuration of the reactor, the
      type of carrier gas, power level of the microwave energy source,
      pressure of the system, and type and physical configuration of the
      catalyst can be adjusted to selectively alter the compounds
      produced by the present process.<br>
      <br>
      The present process makes it possible to achieve high selectivity,
      i.e., control over the end products created. Deleterious coking,
      associated with high power reactions, does not occur.
      Consequently, the process may be operated almost continuously,
      thereby avoiding the frequent, periodic removal of coke and other
      deposits from the reactor and catalyst, that are drawbacks of
      prior art processes.<br>
      <br>
      An essential feature of the present invention is the maintenance
      of a microwave discharge plasma using very low energy levels. As
      used herein, a low energy plasma is one that is created using a
      microwave power source radiating at a frequency of 2.45 GHz at an
      emitted (radiated) power level of up to 100 watts.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, it has been surprisingly discovered that a plasma formed of
      a primary reactant such as methane or a methane/oxygen plasma may
      be maintained using a microwave power source having a frequency of
      2.45 GHz and an emitted power level of between 0.01 and 100 watts
      under standard experimental conditions.<br>
      <br>
      A microwave plasma includes ions and electrons, neither of which
      may be evenly distributed depending on various factors, such as
      the type of cavity or the reactant. Thus, the plasma is not
      generally in thermodynamic equilibrium but, rather consists of a
      gradient of ions and electrons. In the present process, it is
      desirable to promote reaction conditions that favor the creation
      of radicals of the hydrocarbon reactant that can readily combine
      with other radicals that are present in the plasma zone or on the
      surface of the catalyst, in order to form new compounds that may
      be useful, e.g. as feedstocks in the manufacture of plastics. The
      present process is also useful in producing molecular hydrogen.
      Ionization of the desired hydrocarbon feedstock products is to be
      avoided because this may lead to concomitant cracking reactions,
      and the formation of polymerization and carbonaceous products of
      lower commercial value. Ionization and cracking processes occur in
      plasma reactions under high energy conditions which, therefore,
      are to be avoided. Thus, the input power to the microwave source
      should be optimized, usually at low power/energy consumption, to
      promote coupling reactions and to avoid cracking and ionization
      reactions.<br>
      <br>
      The power density required to maintain the plasma is dependent on
      reactor dimensions, composition and flow rate of the gas stream
      and the gas stream pressure. Other factors which will influence
      power density include the presence or absence of a catalyst; the
      composition of the reactor; additives to the fuel stream; and
      temperature.<br>
      <br>
      It has been determined experimentally, by the present inventors,
      that the low microwave power emissions found to be useful in the
      present process are sufficient to maintain a discharge plasma
      within a gas confined in a tubular quartz reactor having an
      outside diameter of 12 mm, and encircled by an Evenson quarter
      wave cavity to focus the microwave energy on the plasma, at
      reactant flow rates of less than 1000 mL/min, and internal
      pressures (within the reactor) of between 3 and 760 torr.<br>
      <br>
      The energy requirements for the conversion of methane have been
      experimentally determined by the present inventors. Based on the
      data of Example 35, the following reaction is seen:<br>
      <br>
      This reaction is balanced. The coefficients were determined from
      the data obtained from Examples 28-45.<br>
      <br>
      The enthalpy of reaction (.DELTA.H ) for this reaction is 21.166
      kcal/mol of CH.sub.4. The positive value means that this is an
      endothermic reaction which requires an input of heat to proceed.<br>
      <br>
      From the enthalpy of reaction the actual energy in watts required
      for the reaction may be calculated:<br>
      <br>
      For a 50 cc/min flow rate, at 60 watts supplied by the generator
      and a molar volume of 22.4 L/mol: (50 cc/min)/(60 sec/min
      (22,400cc/mol)=3.72.times.10.sup.-5 mol/sec and (21.166 kcal.mol
      CH.sub.4).times.4.184 J/cal=8.856.times.104 J/mol then multiplying
      both together (8.856.times.104 J/mol).times.3.72.times.10.sup.-5
      mol/sec=3.294 J/sec and 3.294 J/sec=3.294 watts.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, of the 60 watts supplied by the generator, only 3.294 watts
      (based on the experimental mass balance) are needed to drive the
      reaction. Two conclusion may be drawn from this information.
      First, the reactor design is not very efficient, (3.294/60=5.5%),
      and second, the reaction is a low power process.<br>
      <br>
      The flow rate, power and pressure of the reactor arrangement
      directly influence product selectivity. Selectivity may be
      explained by describing the sequence of H atom abstraction
      reactions which take place:<br>
      <br>
      and<br>
      <br>
      Reactions (1), (2) and (5) are desirable reactions for the
      production of ethane or ethylene from methane and in relation to
      the data set forth in the Examples must be low energy processes
      because they occur predominantly at low power levels in the
      microwave plasma. The selectivity in the present processes is
      optimized because reactions (3), (4), (6) and (7) have largely
      been minimized. These undesirable reactions can be minimized by
      either decreasing power, increasing the flow rate or by using a
      carrier. Examples exhibiting good selectivity by adjustment of the
      variables mentioned above, include those which employ a high flow
      rate (e.g., 500 ml/min) (Examples 30, 39-41, 43 and 44). In these
      Examples no acetylene (C.sub.2 H.sub.2) was formed, suggesting
      that CH fragments are not formed when the flow rate is high.<br>
      <br>
      It may be theorized that radical recombination must be the
      predominant method of product formation:<br>
      <br>
      By preventing formation of CH, prevention of acetylene formation
      is also achieved.<br>
      <br>
      The generalizations above appear to be accurate for the feeds used
      in the present Examples, methane and ethane. C-C bond breaking is
      not a concern for methane and was not observed for ethane. The
      data of the present Examples suggest the following microwave
      plasma reactions for ethane and ethylene:<br>
      <br>
      The experimental data appears to show that reaction (12) requires
      more energy than reaction (11) and it may be implied that a
      methane feed may result in acetylene formation if the initial
      product--ethylene resides within the plasma for too long. This may
      account for the observation that an increased flow rate eliminates
      the production of acetylene. Thus, it appears desirable to remove
      produced ethylene from the plasma zone as quickly as possible.<br>
      <br>
      It is well known that the relative energies of the radical species
      produced in reactions 1-12 can be influenced by the type of plasma
      (e.g., microwave, electrical discharge, glow discharge, etc.), and
      the type of carrier. The data obtained according to the present
      invention, suggest now that the power level of the plasma is also
      important in influencing relative energies of radical species.<br>
      <br>
      To increase selectivity of desired products and decrease
      production of undesirable compounds, several factors must be
      optimized. These factors include: pressure, power, flow rate, and
      optionally carrier.<br>
      <br>
      For carbon chain compounds such as butane (C.sub.4 H.sub.10) C-C
      bond breaking is a concern because as the carbon chain length
      increases it becomes easier to break a C-C bond. One could
      anticipate the following reaction schemes:<br>
      <br>
      To increase selectivity of ethylene one would attempt to maximize
      the conversion of reaction (14) and minimize all of the others
      which favor final formation of acetylene, C.sub.2 H.sub.2.<br>
      <br>
      The discharge plasma can be initiated in a reaction zone using a
      spark from a Telsa coil or a static gun, or any other similar
      spark generating device. Maintenance of the plasma is easier if a
      carrier gas is introduced to the reactant gas stream.<br>
      <br>
      A series of experiments was conducted to demonstrate the optimized
      efficiency levels and reaction selectivity conditions that may be
      attained with the low energy microwave reaction process of this
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      EXAMPLE 1<br>
      <br>
      Preferred Laboratory Reactor System Arrangement<br>
      <br>
      A quartz reactor of 12 mm outside diameter was placed in close
      proximity (about 3 mm downstream) to a Raytheon microwave 1/4 wave
      Evenson-type cavity, which was coupled to a 2.45 GHz microwave
      generator operating between 0.1 and 100 watts emitted power. The
      generator was adjusted to emit between 40 and 80 watts. The
      Evenson 1/4 wave cavity was used to direct the microwave energy by
      encircling the quartz reactor, thereby creating a reaction zone.
      The Evenson cavity is adjustable such that the microwave energy
      can be focused on the plasma.<br>
      <br>
      Copper tubing of 1/8 " inside diameter fitted with brass and
      stainless steel vacuum fittings were used to supply the reactant
      gases and carrier gases to two arms of a 9 mm quartz, 120.degree.
      Y-tube. 1/8 " Swagelok fittings were used to join the copper lines
      to the Y-tube. The gases mix within the Y-tube and pass through
      the third arm, to be directed into the 12 mm quartz reactor.
      Immediately downstream (about 2-5 mm) of the reaction zone was
      located a quartz U-tube. In some experiments, the U-tube contained
      a solid catalyst. The catalyst was provided in finely divided
      form, of about 50 m.sup.2 /g in particle surface area.<br>
      <br>
      Downstream of the U-tube, 3/8 " quartz tubing was used to direct
      flow into a liquid nitrogen trap. Vacuum was applied to the
      downstream side of the trap.<br>
      <br>
      The supply lines were equipped with flow meters and regulators, to
      regulate both the proportions of the reactant gas and carrier gas,
      and the flow rate.<br>
      <br>
      A high voltage spark generator (Tesla coil) was used to initiate
      the plasma. As the spark impinges the quartz wall of the reactor,
      charges build up on the outside of the wall and charged particles
      flow through the quartz, and establish a charge on the inside
      surface of the quartz. The surface of the inside of the quartz
      tube then acts as an electrode, such that the gaseous species in
      the plasma ionize and are excited to excited state configurations.<br>
      <br>
      The feed gases were scrubbed with zeolite molecular sieves to
      adsorb water before introduction to the reactor apparatus. Methane
      and inert gases were purified by passing the gas stream through a
      liquid nitrogen trap... <br>
