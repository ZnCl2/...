      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the book "The Inner
          Earth" by Doreal, he mentioned that there are 144 separate and
          distinct types of magnetic current. The Ancients called this
          sub-Pranic or sub-aetheric, which can be used for superhuman
          powers and levitation or for control of the mind.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The following is a
          description of how we make a machine to allow anyone to work
          with each of the individual magnetic currents.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the book "Vital Force" by
          Baron Charles von Reichenbach, he shows the chart of these
          forces:</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Take a metal disk and put
          the N or S pole of a magnet in the center. Then place the disk
          horizontally. Use a compass to line up the dark blue at 90
          degrees and red at 270; then you can map out the rest of the
          lines.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If you can see magnetic
          auras then you will not need a compass.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Fig. 2 shows how to make a
          very powerful magnetic spectrum device. The 44-inch diameter
          disk is made of 10:0:8 soft annealed steel approximately 3/16
          inch thick. Between them are placed 16 to 28 ceramic magnets
          approximately 2 inches in diameter, with a hole in the center
          and magnetized with the poles across the faces. The blue pole
          is placed under the top disk and the red pole is placed down
          on the bottom disk. The top and bottom 2 to 4 magnets are
          placed so their poles repel, but when put on top of the metal
          disk they will still attract to the metal disk so as to
          compress the field out away from the center to the edges of
          the disk. A brass or copper tube is forced through the holes
          in the magnets to align them and give them support. A plastic
          stand or motor is used under the bottom plate.</font> </p>

          on one of the disks to draw off the color to work with it. The
          width of the triangle helps to draw off more or less of the
          colors nearby. The triangle is connected to a copper and iron
          wire to draw off the energy you want to work with. The cone on
          the other end increases the efficiency. An iron rod can be
          placed at the edge just between the top and bottom so you can
          draw color from the bottom and top plate at the same time.</font>

          with further separation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A jar placed between the
          disks can be used to charge water or seeds in water. 2 to 4
          hours are needed for good results. If the disk is turned
          slowly by motor or hand (every 10 minutes by hand), all the
          colors will fill the water. Seeds treated for 1 hour or longer
          showed up to 5 times as much root growth as compared to
          untreated. The disk is turned every 15 minutes.&nbsp; When you
          use the red or blue pole of a magnet you still have the
          complete rainbow in each color. Now as with color therapy you
          have each color at your command and it is already in its aura
          form which makes it more effective and potent than the aura
          which is attached to color.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On the back of most old TV
          picture tubes is a gray ferrite collar over copper wire.
          Remove them and place 2 or more over the copper tubing on the
          top disk. With three of these ferrite collars the odic field
          coming from the area between the two iron disks will be
          extended 10 to 100 times.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Our guess is that the field
          of energy may be equal to a 16-layer Reich accumulator, but it
          is of Od (cf. von Reichenbach) rather than Orgone.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Orgone moves west to east;
          Od moves south to north.&nbsp; They cross each other. We think
          that Orgone’s physical counterpart is electricity, and Od’s
          physical counterpart is magnetism.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When a person sits in an
          orgone accumulator his body generates a larger aura. When that
          person puts his hands near the odic disk the orgone aura
          collapses and a new aura appears that seems different from the
          orgone aura. Carbon seems to be able to break orgone into its
          different colors. Reich found red and blue energy under the
          microscope, and between red and blue is a rainbow. Now that
          you have electricity and magnetism (orgone and odic) the sky
          is the limit. Go after it!</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In looking for grid crossing
          points or vortexes on your own property you will find both
          centrifugal and centripetal vortices or whirlpools of energy.
          Centrifugal vortices move from the center out or explode. They
          can be clockwise or counter-clockwise. Counter-clockwise will
          add to a centrifugal vortex’s dominating destructive force
          effects, while a clockwise motion to a centrifugal energy will
          subtract from the destructive effects of that force.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Centripetal vortices move
          from the outside inward, or implosion. They also can be
          clockwise or counter-clockwise. Now clockwise energy will add
          to a centripetal vortex, increasing its constructive force,
          while a counter-clockwise motion to a centripetal energy
          vortex will subtract from the constructive effects of these

          forms a vortex tube can be even more important then its rotary
          direction. The element that formed radium (c-c) will not be
          the same as the element that formed the element oxygen,
          clockwise. If you are going to work with vortex energies or
          grid points which are vortex energy, you should keep a
          positive outlook and work with love in all you do.</font> </p>

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I’m sure you’ve noticed some
          foggy days that seemed healthy and alive but others that
          appeared toxic and lifeless. It became apparent that the same
          condition occurred in my laboratory experiments on bion
          growth, there were many days when I worked with silica gels
          used in the research of bions and their growth later into
          insects. Eventually I noticed that these particular gels
          resembled the same phenomenon of toxic DOR (Deadly Orgone)
          whereby solutions with materials in suspension, such as clay,
          fell to the bottom and other substances floated upwards
          instead. This is depicted in the moving nature of orgone-like
          foggy days. This beautiful orgone experience is seen when fog
          rises from a swamp at night or when rolling in from a south
          sea island. In DOR contrast, a smog-filled room that is highly
          positive (negative ions far outnumbered by positive) has a
          DOR-type stagnant air. This will clear up, however, when
          negative ions are reintroduced. I am not, however, saying that
          negative ions are orgone energy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This same situation occurs
          outdoors when the air is charged very positively. Normally,
          fog doesn’t lift easily. This is because the ionosphere is
          charged with 400,000 positive volts, whereas the earth’s
          ground surface tends to be negative, pulling the positively
          charged fog downward. This same situation fits other DOR type
          problems. Since these lighter, more mobile negatively charged
          particles are no longer present, the heavier and more
          condensed positively charged particles now repel each other in
          a manner similar to the particles in the silica gel solution
          in water, mentioned previously. If I were to pour water on a
          colloid, the water would tend to move the whole gel. Just like
          this gel phenomenon, DOR type fogs refuse to move, even when a
          breeze or wind comes along. It is as though the fog particles
          form an expanded colloid like sponge for many miles. Under
          these circumstances, it’s easy to see why the air prefers to
          pass through the sponge instead of struggling to impel it to
          move. Try to visualize the for as a 3-dimensional screen with
          the corners of its cube having positive ions (or DOR
          particles) and the smaller air particles passing through the
          screen but not affecting its movement.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As stated earlier, you can
          experience orgone energy when encountering fog rising from a
          swamp both early in the morning and late at night when it
          comes gently rolling off the ocean. It occurs in the strongly
          charged negative ions of the misty sprays from cool mountain
          waterfalls. These particular ions are attracted to the
          ionosphere (which is highly positive) and they’re lifted
          upward. The negatively charged earth repels this type of
          orgone fog, causing it to turn into levitational clouds.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This same situation happens
          when a negative ion generator is used to clear up a
          smoke-filled room. My research does not indicate that orgone
          energy is related to negative ions but rather that orgone
          presence does seem to cause the air to become negatively
          charged.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Reich himself described fogs
          that would not move even in the presence of a wind or breeze
          and referred to them as DOR type fogs.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Some of my previous
          background involved working as a polymer chemist at Reichbold
          Chemical Co. along with experience as a plating chemist at
          Continental Dye Casting Co and automotive head chemist at EZY
          Products. This particular background helped me to formulate
          the above theories.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Perhaps other scientists as
          well as lay people can now use this information to advance
          their understanding of orgone energy. In the past 20 years, I
          have personally taken readings of the ion content of the air
          and used negative ion generators to simulate different
          effects. These instruments can be very useful in studying both
          orgone and DOR effects on air.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Remember that negative ion
          generators are not orgone generators. Negative ion generators
          will collect all the dirt from a room and deposit it on the
          walls nearby, actually bonding it to the paint. Further months
          of usage will also collect DOR dirt, radioactive fallout dust,
          and other toxic chemicals, confining it to a small area,
          becoming too dangerous to be near eventually. Negative ion
          generators produce ORANUR effects. ORANUR is the acronym used
          to designate Orgone Nuclear Reaction.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There are ways to generate
          beneficial ions which may prove to be more closely related to
          orgone energy and thus safer. Refer to British Patent #
          1,266,227. If the electricity from a 5000 and 10,000 V AC
          generator is stored between capacitor plates without producing
          any electrical breakdown in the dielectric materials between
          the plates (and if there is no electrical discharge in the
          air), then a small bluish glow will be observed when there is
          a small air gap between the plates. When this happens, the air
          coming through the plates acts like highly charged orgone
          energy. Tests run on the above patented device , with air
          recirculating for over one hour through the device, removed
          88% of the CO2. This air also caused rapid healing in highly
          infected mice.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In a book called "When Stars
          Look Down", George Van Tassel describes a device that will
          double the size of normal vegetables. It is supposed to charge
          the ground. You weld a 4 foot cross on top of a 21 foot pole
          with needles pointed up 2 inches apart at the top. Wires are
          then buried in the ground 18 inches deep. He sates that the
          device works by unbalancing the charges between the earth and
          the air while nature tries to counter balance. It creates an
          electric flux in the mast and wires. The current in the wire
          produces a magnetic field around it and brings about a gentle
          magnetic vortex perpendicular to the ground. This in turn
          creates accelerated electric activity in the plants and roots
          which are in the vertical zone of electric flux. Each
          vegetable then becomes a miniature atomic accelerator and thus
          increases its growth and current flow.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The aura around the plant
          was usually blue while the wire and need showed red. This is
          not visibly discernable but rather as light observed by the
          inner eye.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Several months alter an idea
          came to me to utilize them around the cloudbuster with each
          pin connected to the ground. The whole thing nw made sense. I
          saw a blue haze around the cloudbuster, not unlike the haze of
          blue I saw around the plants with the loops that discharged
          over the charged soil. I was encouraged to think that the
          points were removing the DOR in acting as a main discharge. If
          the needles were drawing red energy from the earth and the
          cloudbuster blue energy from the sky, then this device might
          prevent a person from being harmed while standing next to a
          cloudbuster.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Crystals help to attract
          orgone energy as well as eradicate some of the more harmful
          types of energies. To test your crystal’s true alignment and
          effectiveness, obtain a 5-ft galvanized conduit tubing and
          coat it with three layers of shellac. Align the tube N and S
          and place the apex of the crystal 1/8 inch away from the S end
          of the tube.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Don’t obstruct the tube’s
          opening. If the crystal is smaller than the opening, insert it
          halfway into the tube. A mild prickly sensation of cold should
          be felt at the N end of the tube, like a breeze. Reverse the
          crystal now and note a very weak medical DOR buster effect at
          the N end of the tube. It feels like energy is being drawn
          from your body...</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Before attempting to use the
          following information you shouldread "The Orgone Accumulator
          Handbook" by James DeMeo as well as CORE (Vol VI, #1-4, July
          1954) by Dr Wilhelm Reich.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">You might have asked
          yourself just what is a chemical ether generator. It is
          actually nothing more than an orgone accumulator initially
          discovered by Dr Wilhelm Reich. There are four basic types of
          accumulators: box, cone, blanket, or cylinder. Their common
          basis is that they are always constructed with a metallic
          inside with the outer layer of organic material. The two
          layers together are referred to as only one accumulator layer.
          We have personally constructed functioning models with as many
          as 33 layers. After 30-33 layers they start to work
          differently. Refer to Figure 1.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 1 ~</font></b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="4a.jpg" height="359" width="510"></p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There are two ways that
          accumulators can be used. Most commonly, specimens such as
          plants or animals are placed directly inside it. In this case,
          the box or blanket type is utilized but cylinder shapes also
          have been used. Another way is to take the enrgy directly out
          of the accumulator and send it to the specimen itself. This
          latter method is employed in construction of the chemical
          ether generator. A typical approach in its construction is to
          make a 5-20 layer orgone accumulator, making a small hole
          through all the layers. A small flexible tube can then be
          inserted directly inside, thereby drawing out the orgone
          energy from the multiplayer box. This tube is then aimed right
          at the specimen. Most of the time a metal cone is connected to
          the outside end of the metal tube. Both tube and cone should
          be coated with a good flexible organic insulator to prevent
          orgone energy from escaping from the sides. This particular
          coating then creates a long, one-layer cylinder-type Orgone
          ACCUmulator (oraccu). Refer to Fig. 2.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 2 / Figure 3 ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="4b.jpg" height="341" width="424"></p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In "The Cancer Biopathy", Dr
          Reich describes his research showing that higher temperatures
          of 0.2 to 0.5 degrees occurred inside his accumulators versus
          the room temperature. These particular accumulators were
          tested inside a building. Similarly, accumulators put directly
          on the ground showed temperature increases of +2 to +5 C. On
          summer days with a strong sun, temperature differences of +20
          were not uncommon. The important concept to understand is that
          the effect is 5-50 times greater in an outdoor accumulator
          placed into the ground versus one indoors. At this point, try
          to imagine a hollow tube connected to the top of this
          underground accumulator with a cone placed open-ended at the
          tube’s end so it’s not blocked. An open ended galvanized steel
          funnel will work well. Insulate both tube and cone, as
          previously described. Instead of directing orgone energy to a
          specimen, aim it directly upward to the sky. Refer to Fig. 3.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If you were to construct the
          10-ply oraccu as described in DeMeo’s book, burying it in the
          ground and pointing its funnel to the sky, the results may not
          be as promising since most of the energy is meant to stay
          within the box. To get the energy up to cloud level, its tube
          would have to be 10-100 ft long to add enough orgone to the
          sky to make it useful for increasing the probability of rain.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another problem with an
          underground oraccu is the need to make them waterproof, for
          the stainless steel wool will rust, and if the organic
          material gets wet, the oraccu will cease to function
          altogether. Fiberglass seems to be the least affected by
          humidity.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The construction of the
          chemical ether generator is pictured in Fig. 4. We soldered
          three 6" diameter steel furnace pipes to create a total length
          of 66". A 6" copper half-sphere (bowl) then was
          brazed/soldered to one end of the tube. See Fig. 4A. Next, we
          applied 10 coats of shellac over the entire outside of both
          the tube and bowl. A coating of ¼-1/2" beeswax was then
          applied to the sphere only and 24" up the sides of the tube.
          See Fig. 4B.</font> </p>

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After drying, we added six
          more layers of oraccu layers to the beeswax area only. The
          first layer was fine steel wool (Figs. 4C and 5). It was
          secured with polypropylene tape. Next we wrapped ¼” of
          fiberglass and secured this with polypropylene tape. At this
          stage, if so desired, you can apply a thin layer of unrefined
          melted beeswax. Now the entire tube is coated with paint to
          prevent weathering and protect it from rain. An application of
          titanium oxide enamel paint is recommended.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 4C / Fig. 5</font></b>
      </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="4d.jpg" height="303" width="433"></p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Next, dig a hole in the
          ground deep enough to accommodate the end of the tube and the
          following materials. Pour a layer of 3" of white quartz sand
          followed by four layers of galvanized steel screen (1/8"
          mesh). Then a 20" piece of silk cloth is placed on the top.
          The tube rests on this base and the coated portion sits just
          above the soil line. The diameter of the hole is 24" so that a
          galvanized steel cylinder will just fit into the hole. It has
          a protective lid of pine wood with a hole in the center to
          allow it to fit over the tube. The lid is 28" wide. Both sides
          are coated with 3 layers of a mixture of shellac and beeswax
          containing 5% Calcium Silicate, 10% micronized silica, and 85%
          beeswax. The side of the steel cylinder that contacts the lid
          is coated with two layers of shellac. The rest of the cylinder
          is not coated and should be kept clean. The top of the lid is
          coated with three layers of shellac followed by three layers
          of titanium oxide paint (peanut oil base).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Before setting the device
          into the ground, place a steel cap over the end. Never remove
          it until just before using the device; use a wooden pole about
          10 ft long. For safety it is recommended to stay at least 20
          ft away.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This device is capable of
          giving the sky enough orgone to affect a 3-mile radius within
          hours of its operation. Coupled with use of the new breed of
          cloudbusters we can remove the DOR and restore the earth and
          sky to health.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Note that to make the
          beeswax mixture stronger and more balanced, the following may
          be added: 0.2 grams of Biodynamic Formula #501 and 0.01 grams
          of diamond dust. Up to 22 grams of micronized silica has been
          tried with good results to further accumulate orgone.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There are some important
          concepts to understand when working with these energies. For
          instance, Nature does not just plant a forest, allowing it to
          grow to full size in a few weeks and then suddenly remove it.
          Likewise, people should not point cloudbusters at the sky to
          draw out energy and then remove it in less than two weeks.
          Cloubusters cannot be used in such a manner without
          throwing&nbsp; Nature out of balance.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Never point this chemical
          ether generator toward a storm because this can dam up the
          orgone and cause very violent weather, even creating a "tidal
          wave" action somewhere else in the sky. The safest way is to
          point it vertically straight upward. When the total system is
          in operation, the energy field should look like Picture #2 and
          #4 as well as the effect created when lightning approaches the
          generator similar to the diagrams in Fig. 8, 9, and 10 (termed
          Lightning # 1,2,3, and 4). On the first day of successful
          operation one will feel as though an ocean breeze has just
          come in to cool the land. If you have moved too fast and
          overdone it, you will feels as if you are underwater. Sounds
          will also be very intense. These signs indicate that your
          generator is too powerful; fewer layers should be used in the
          construction of the oraccu...</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There are devices available
          which can be used when working with the different energies
          described. You should build a Vitic, which we have used when
          becoming overcharged with both orgone and DOR. A cold shower
          also is recommended, followed by use of an Eeman screen and
          the Vitic; it is the most effective way we have found to
          reduce the chance of harm from excess orgone, oranur, or DOR.
          Information on the construction of Eeman screens and the Vitic
          are available from Borderland Research.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A firm reminder: When
          working with orgone remember that it is as dangerous as very
          high voltage electricity. Even an expert can be injured or
          killed by this force, even when doing everything correctly.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I have decided to make this
          information available only because no other qualified person
          made it available to a planet which needs it so badly. Another
          reason is that there are people using 1-ft diameter metal
          drain pipes up to 100 ft long and trying to make rain, as well
          as other types of devices which could harm people. Many of
          these people have no idea of what they are doing and are
          causing more harm than good (such as pointing the device in
          the wrong direction at the wrong time, which can actually
          create drought conditions).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Even our system has the
          potential of removing too much orgone energy from the soil and
          adding too much DOR to the immediate area, so it’s wise to be
          careful.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At this time we are trying
          to make an even more advanced type of cloudbuster containing
          small glass tubes of sea salt and baking soda encircling the
          middle portion of it, to be used with a more standard
          cloudbuster to draw the DOR out and slow the Oranur process by
          directly combining with DOR to produce and replenish fresh
          orgone for the planet. We have not yet fully succeeded. We do
          feel, however, that people should read "Born to be Magnetic"
          (Vol. 1 and 2) by Frances Nixon. I believe that these people
          have found a way to protect areas from Oranur with the use of
          sea salt and baking soda (sodium bicarbonate). You could try
          saturated solutions as well as dry powders in your
          experiments. Try placing one-inch (or smaller) diameter tubes
          (2-3 ft long) in running water or buckets of water which
          should be replaced daily to assist in the removal of DOR and
          Oranur.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">My hope is that by making
          this information available to the public that it will help to
          alleviate further destruction of our planet and perhaps save
          lives.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since this research was
          started in 1972 and has been done only in our area, there is
          no guarantee that anything published here will work as stated
          since the energies were different and higher then...</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Some General Rules for Using
          Cloudbusters with Needles Attached: This information will be
          helpful for all ether energy-controlling devices. If you want
          to make rain, you have to take energy from the West, then move
          toward the North and stop at NorthEast to cool and condense
          the water. A cloudbuster&nbsp; in the drawing mode (they do
          not always draw) moving from West to East in a North direction
          will tend to make rain. Many other things have to be taken
          into account, but I am only trying to help you use the ancient
          chart of Fire, Air, Water and Earth:</font> </p>
