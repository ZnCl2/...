      </b><br>
      While academia has been spurning the topic, hundreds, if not
      thousands of hobbyists and independent investigators worldwide are
      working on various electrolysis-like projects which put out more
      energy than was required to run the electrolysis unit. These
      pursuits go by various names such as "Brown's gas" and "water fuel
      cells"; and have various heroes, such as the late Stanley Meyer,
      and more recently, John Kanzius, who is "burning" salt water using
      radio frequencies. A number of commercial interests are involved
      in the research and development of the various approaches as well.<br>
      <br>
      The famous 19th century scientist, Michael Faraday, defined a
      limit of output energy possible in any standard electrolysis
      scenario. It is well known in thermodynamics that it takes more
      energy to dissociate water into hydrogen and oxygen than can be
      returned when the hydrogen is burned.<br>
      <br>
      But these rogue experimenters of today are reporting output from
      their set-ups that exceed Faraday's limit many times over,
      claiming 7x, 10x, or even more, producing as much as one liter of
      gas per hour using just 1/2 Watt of electricity. The factors that
      seem to contribute to these effects include using a large number
      of stainless plates close together, the plates roughed to
      facilitate releasing the bubbles, driving the cell using square
      wave, pulsed DC at Kilohertz frequencies, and constantly modifying
      the frequency to optimize gas production.<br>
      <br>
      Moray King, who has published three seminal books on zero point
      energy, recently put forth a scientific model in which he suggests
      that the excess energy being observed in these unusual
      electrolysis set-ups comes from zero point energy, by producing
      charged water gas clusters, which somehow achieve a
      self-organizing criticality that coherently activates and absorbs
      zero point energy.<br>
      <br>
      The experimental set-ups are typically rather simple, which is
      leading to a proliferation of the number of people reproducing and
      working to improve the effect and its consistency to the point
      where it can be used to serve as a practical, primary energy
      source -- an energy generator that could operate anywhere there is
      water. Zero point energy is everywhere in the universe; it is the
      foundation of the fabric of space. Other groups, such as Xogen
      Technologies, are using these processes to purify water. These
      energy sources could actually produce culinary water as a by
      product.<br>
      <br>
      The day of water power, via zero point energy, is arriving.

      Moray gives solid arguments for the case that by getting very
      small fog particles of water/HHO gas, you increase the incidences
      of microscopic ball lightning events, which is where the Zero
      Point Energy shows up, so that excess / overunity energy is
      produced. Mechanical vibration and a powerful spark plug augment
      this effect.<br>

          Self-Running, Open Source Project</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Moray B. King proposes a design that could take advantage of the
      purported electrolysis overunity systems that apparently harvest
      energy from some yet-to-be identified power source -- possibly
      Zero Point Energy. His scheme creates a self-running system with a
      mechanism of extracting the excess energy for practical use.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There are numerous claims by inventors and investigators that the
      “water fuel" projects can generate excessive power well beyond the
      input power taken from the battery used to drive the system. Many
      inventors have generously shared information on the web so that
      others can replicate the “water fuel" electrolyzer thus launching
      many open source projects.<br>
      <br>
      Standard scientific opinion is that water could not be a fuel
      because it takes more energy to dissociate the water into hydrogen
      and oxygen than can be returned when the hydrogen is burned. A
      hypothesis for explaining excess energy production is that the
      pulsing electrolyzer produces charged water gas clusters, which
      activate and coherently capture zero-point energy into the
      cluster, thus raising the water’s energy state [1]. Such a
      hypothesis is considered speculative, and only an experiment could
      prove that excessive energy is being produced.<br>
      <br>
      The best demonstration would be a self-running system where a
      battery is used to kick-start the apparatus, and then it is
      removed. If the system continues to run itself indefinitely on
      just water (preferably re-circulated water from the exhaust), the
      proof of a new energy source would be dramatically demonstrated.<br>
      <br>
      The goal of the self-running, open source project is to create
      massive, world-wide replication of this bench top demonstration so
      that the humanity recognizes and accepts a new energy source.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Reference:</b><br>
      <br>
      M.B. King, “Water Dissociation Using Zero-Point Energy", Power
      Point presentation that overviews the field and contains numerous
      web links<br>
      <br>
      <b>Closed Loop System</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The closed loop demonstration system can be made with mostly
      off-the-shelf components. Only the electrolyzer is custom made,
      and its details are well discussed on the web.<br>
      <br>
      The electrolyzer produces the water gas and hydrogen/oxygen
      mixture, which fuels a small motor. The motor drives an electrical
      generator whose output is rectified onto a storage capacitor.
      Power from the storage capacitor is directed to a switching
      regulator and a DC port for tapping excess power if produced. The
      switching regulator maintains a constant voltage on its internal
      capacitor, which provides a constant DC power supply for the solid
      state, pulse driver circuit. An auxiliary frequency shifter,
      control circuit is used to alter the pulse driver frequency to
      maximize water gas production. (The control circuit itself needs
      little power.)<br>
      <br>
      For the kick start, a battery is connected to the DC port to
      charge the storage capacitor. Once the system is running, the
      battery is removed. If the water gas electrolyzer does indeed
      produce excessive energy, then such a closed loop system would run
      indefinitely and might even yield output energy that could be
      tapped from the DC port to power a small load. <br>

      Nov 12, 2013 - Interview with Moray B. King. Moray has been
      working as a professional electrical and systems engineer for over
      30 years. During that time, in parallel, he has done extensive
      independent research into the standard physics literature
      concerning both the zero point field and self-organizing systems.
      He has also conducted extensive research into the patents and
      experiments of inventors who have reported anomalous energy gains
      over the decades. He is considered one of the leading authorities
      on the subject of zero point energy, and has written two books on
      the topic titled: Tapping the Zero Point Energy, and Quest for
      Zero Point Energy. Most recently Moray gave a presentation titled

      Interview with Engineer and New Energy Pioneer Moray B. King. The
      first portion of the interview features focused discussion on John
      Wheeler’s model of the quantum vacuum and how topological vortex
      structures are permitted to self-organize out of a turbulent,
      orthogonal electromagnetic flux.<br>
      <br>
      During the middle part of the interview Moray further elucidates
      how this flux might be coherently abstracted into our dimension to
      do work. He outlines the discoveries of Yull Brown (Brown’s Gas
      Torch), Ken Shoulders (Plasmatic Exotic Vacuum Objects) and Mark
      LeClair (Crystalline Water Cluster Jets), and goes on to explain
      why their experiments demonstrate substantive evidence for Zero
      Point Energy (ZPE) extraction.<br>
      <br>
      Toward the tail-end of our dialogue Moray ventures into the arena
      of LENR-Cold Fusion theory. He visualizes a scenario where
      cracking in the crystalline lattice creates an environment where
      micron-scale ball lightning (aka self-organized ZPE plasmoid) is
      being generated and released. Micron-sized ball lightning has been
      demonstrated to be highly energetic and capable of transmuting
      elements during laboratory studies in at least three countries.
      Also worth considering is that amplified ZPE interactions are
      known to occur within reflective Nano-domains during Cavity-QED
      experiments. While the ZPE explanation for LENR still remains
      undefined and speculative in certain important respects, further
      investigation of ZPE fluctuations in Nano-cavities may provide us
      with better understanding of what goes on within the Nuclear
      Active Environment (NAE) to produce the Pons-Fleischmann Excess
      Heat Effect.<br>
      <br>
      In closing we spend some time focusing on the philosophical side
      of the Breakthrough Energy Movement and what will be required for
      a paradigm shift to occur.<br>

      Combining the theories of the zero-point energy with the theories
      of system self-organization offer opportunities to coherently
      harvest zero-point energy (ZPE). The energy typically couples into
      matter-ZPE or plasma-ZPE conglomerates. Examples include
      plasmoids, Shoulders electrum validum (EV) or exotic vacuum
      objects (EVO), inert gas clusters of the Papp engine, and most
      recently LeClairs water crystal formed from reentrant jets
      launched from collapsing, torus shaped cavitation bubbles. Here
      the energy could be trapped in micron-sized rings of linear water
      to become the primary energy source for Browns gas. Large scale,
      force-free (Beltrami) vortices of plasma might manifest a
      macroscopic ZPE coherence. <br>

      We’re honored to have Mr. King deliver our opening presentation
      this year. He is one of the most well-known experts in the “Free
      Energy” field and has been a champion for the cause for many
      years. He has authored multiple books on zero-point energy and is
      a keynote speaker at many energy conferences around the country.<br>
      <br>
      His books include Tapping the Zero Point Energy, Quest for Zero
      Point Energy and The Energy Machine of T. Henry Moray.<br>
      <br>
      At the 2016 Energy Science &amp; Technology Conference, he will be
      presenting: FROM NANOBUBBLES TO BALL LIGHTNING: AN OVERVIEW OF NEW
      ENERGY POSSIBILITIES (90 min)<br>
      <br>
      Here is a description of his presentation – Both the standard
      scientific community and esoteric researchers recognize that the
      fabric of pure empty space is not a void, but rather an energetic
      substrate known by various names: aether, prana, chi, zero-point
      energy (ZPE), vacuum fluctuations, etc. There is controversy over
      the notion whether it can be tapped as an energy source. Within
      standard physics, the leading experts in zero-point energy theory
      admit that it is an open question which can only be resolved by
      experiment.<br>
      <br>
      Numerous plasma experiments have been performed that manifest
      energy anomalies especially under the conditions of abrupt plasma
      discharge. High speed photography has captured evidence that the
      anomalies are associated with ball lightning formation. Ken
      Shoulders dedicated his career to studying a microscopic form of
      ball lightning that he name “electrum validum” (EV) and later
      “exotic vacuum object” (EVO) when he became convinced that their
      excess energy was sourced from the zero-point vacuum energy. Their
      structure is a circulating vortex ring of plasma ions and
      electrons, known as a “plasmoid.” Shoulders observed that an EVO
      could self-accelerate to about a tenth of the speed of light, a
      phenomena he called “self-propulsion.”<br>
      <br>
      Creating an EVO circulating vortex ring of plasma requires that
      the plasma discharge form around a micron size, spherical blob of
      liquid metal. The discharge causes the blob to dimple into a torus
      form, creating the vortex ring all at once. A liquid metal blob is
      not the only spherical “template” that could guide EVO formation,
      a small water bubble or droplet could do likewise if it were
      stable enough to withstand the plasma discharge and dimple instead
      of flying apart.<br>
      <br>
      The recent revolution in nanobubble technology has proved that
      nanometer scaled bubbles in water are surprisingly stable.
      Researchers in Japan appear to be leading the discoveries with
      most projects focused on making nanobubbles of oxygen in water for
      health benefits as well as environment reclamation. Laser
      backscatter and tracking techniques are used to measure the size
      and longevity of the bubbles. Most projects use cavitating pumps
      and vortex action to produce the bubbles, but some inventors have
      developed carbon ceramic nozzles to produce them much more
      cheaply.<br>
      <br>
      Ryushin Omasa has invented a water electrolyzer that makes
      hydrogen nanobubbles by cavitating the electrolysis water with
      vibrating blades. The hydrogen is cocooned in the bubbles, and
      they naturally rise out of the electrolyzer. The nanobubble gas
      can run an internal combustion engine with surprising power
      manifested. Simple hydrogen combustion does not explain the excess
      energy. However, if the nanobubbles converted into nanoscopic ball
      lightning from the spark plug plasma, their self-acceleration
      would propel the piston with anomalously large force. Here, a
      simple new energy possibility arises for inventors: In the
      combustion chamber, just convert water mist containing abundant
      nanobubbles of any gas (even air) into nanometer ball lightning
      via a high voltage, capacitor discharge spark. The result gives
      the illusion that water is a “fuel” driving the engine when in
      actuality it is the nanoscopic ball lightning cohering the
      zero-point energy.<br>

      This is a proposed experiment to create ball lightning based on
      the helical torus model(1,2), a plasmoid form which Bostick(3)
      observed in a vacuum. The following scheme resembles the
      conditions under which a thunderstorm produces ball lightning.<br>
      <br>
      A Tesla coil(4) creates a discharge through a vortex of water
      vapor. The coils are wound such that their magnetic field causes
      the discharge to spiral in the same direction as the vortex.<br>
      <br>
      The cathode construction is most important. It must eject a large
      number of electrons simultaneously so that the plasma's quantum
      electrodynamical exchange forces(5) induce a coherence in the
      zero-point energy(6). The toroidal plasmoid sustains this
      coherence in what may be regarded as a macroscopic condition(3).
      The synchronous electron emission may be achieved by biasing a
      semiconductor material that forms exciation(7) or electron
      traps(8) (e.g. ZnS, CdS, FeS). When electrically pulsed, the
      electrons should be ejected from the cathode surface in a manner
      similar to internal field emission across a p-n junction(9). This
      synchronous discharge coheres the zero-point energy.<br>
      <br>
      If ball lightning is produced, the plasmoid will persist for
      seconds after the electrical discharge, and it may even leave the
