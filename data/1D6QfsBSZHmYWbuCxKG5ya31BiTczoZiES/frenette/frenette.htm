        <p><b><font size="+1">"Fueless Furnace" Uses Friction to Heat
              Average Size Home for "50 Cents a Day"</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Eugene Frenette pours hydraulic oil into his prototype
        "fuelless furnace". The oil, combined with the spinning action
        of two cylinders, supposedly creates friction which in turn,
        produces the heat. </p>
      <p>"Defies a basic Law of physics --- a complete hoax," say
        skeptics. Prototype shown below has been used to provide
        supplemental heat in Fernette's 12-room house. </p>
      <p>How about this --- a fuelless furnace that uses friction
        instead of fuel to heat an average size home "for only $15 to
        $16 a month". What's more, it reportedly will sell for less than
        half the cost of a conventional oil or gasfurnace. Sound too
        good to be true? </p>
      <p>"You bet" say some observers, who claim the whole thing's a
        hoax --- that it defies a basic law of physics. But others,
        including a host of small manufacturers and distributors, have
        jumped at the chance to get in on the ground floor of a
        "breakthrough" development they feel can help solve the energy
        crisis. They have invested in franchises and hope to be taking
        orders for Eugene Frenette's fuelless furnace early next year. </p>
      <p>It all started during the winter of 1977-78. It was costing
        Frenette, father of 12 children --- 10 of whom are still at home
        --- a whopping $230 a month to buy fuel oil to heat his huge,
        old uninsulated 12 room "Pillsbury mansion" in Londonderry, New
        Hampshire. He launched a crash program to perfect his invention
        - a simple but unorthodox 'fuelless' furnace which he maintains
        will be able to heat an average size home for only 50 cents a
        day and which he feels can be retailed "for $600 to $800." </p>
      <p>Frenette installed his prototype friction heater in a
        10-year-old washing machine. It's made up of two cylinders
        spinning in opposite directions. There is a clearance of 1/8 in.
        between the two cylinders which are lubricated by a quart of
        light motor oil. Spinning action of the cylinders and resulting
        friction produces the heat, according to Frenette. </p>
      <p>He claims franchised models will be odorless. They don't
        require any chimney since no fuel is burned and there is no
        flame, soot or odor and are as quiet as a refrigerator. All
        models will plug into a regular 110 volt outlet and will occupy
        no more space than a washing machine or dryer. </p>
      <p>Estimated operating cost to heat an average size, well
        insulated home with a 200,000 btu friction "centric" heater is
        right at $15 a month (for electricity to operate the motor). </p>
      <p>One of the first successful prototypes was built in August by
        Max Johnston, owner of Johnston's Metal Specialties in Creston,
        Iowa. "I'll admit I was skeptical at first. Sounded like a hoax
        to me," says Max who was hired by the owner of the "Frenette
        Furnace" franchises for Alaska and Kentucky to build a
        prototype. </p>
      <p>Following basic design specs supplied by Frenette, Johnston
        built a prototype which, in his words, "made a believer out of a
        lot of skeptics around here. including me." It cost about $800
        to build, including about 40 hours of labor. Now that we've
        built one, we could build another in a lot less time. We
        estimated its output at between 100,000 and 150,000 btu's. </p>
      <p>The friction stove produced no odor, made no more noise than
        you would get with a furnace motor, and we had no vibration or
        other problems with the rotating circular drums which create the
        friction heat." Max told FARM SHOW. </p>
      <p>According to Larry Nickerson, Frenette's son-in-law, all
        franchises except Washington. D.C. and Hawaii, have been sold.
        Some individuals bought up 3 or 4 states. Cost of a state
        franchise, based on population, was $2,500 cash, plus an
        additional down payment payable on availability of the first
        approved stoves, and a remaining balance spread out over 20
        years. </p>
      <p>The Iowa franchise for example, was priced at $145,000.&nbsp;
        Of that, $2,500 was payable immediately to hold the franchise,
        with $36,250 payable upon availability of Frenette-approved
        stoves for sale.&nbsp; The balance ($108,720), plus interest is
        payable over 20 years in monthly installments. </p>
      <p>"I bought two states and others from this area bought up many
        of the other states franchises during the short time they were
        available." Harold Schweiss, of Sherburn, Minn., told FARM SHOW.
        Schweiss has hired a firm to produce a working model which was
        completed and ready for testing just as this issue went to
        press. </p>
      <p>"Frenette came up with the idea but doesn't have manufacturing
        or marketing expertise," explains Schweiss. "Individual
        franchise holders are taking the patented ides to local
        manufacturers to get a working model. These models, subject to
        Frenette's approval will then be produced and sold when they've
        met the usual battery of tests. </p>
      <p>Eventually, the best features of these prototypes will be
        combined into production models which will be essentially the
        same but produced by a number of different manufacturers,"
        Schweiss explains. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">December 1998 Kinetic Furnace Test:
              Previously Reported Results Retracted</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>By Jed Rothwell &amp; Ed Wall</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>We first reported on the Kinetic Furnace, invented by Eugene
        Perkins and Ralph Pope, in Issue # 19. The device had, at that
        time, been tested by several independent engineering
        laboratories and services. The Kinetic Furnace is, as the name
        implies, a device for heating and forcing airflow. Heat is
        generated by means of a rotor that flings water from the hub to
        the rim of its chamber, through some precisely dimensioned
        nozzles. This "stirring" action is driven by a 6 HP electric
        motor. The heated water is driven out of the rotor chamber into
        a radiator and out an output duct. </p>
      <p>In April 1998, Eugene Mallove and Jed Rothwell assessed the
        furnace for themselves at the inventors’ facility in Cumming GA,
        where they observed the apparent production of excess heat. </p>
      <p>Furhter testing was carried out by Mallove and Ed Wall, June
        through September of 1998, in Bow NH at NERL (New Energy
        Research Laboratory), but no significant excess heat was
        observed during that period. Another machine was shipped from
        Georgia, but it too showed no excess. Finally, Pope loaded a
        third unit into a van and drove it to New Hampshire himself. He
        helped install and test it, but this third test also failed.
        Different sources of water were tested, the operating
        temperature and the rotation speed of the motor were varied
        slightly, but no significant excess energy was observed. In IE
        #22 we reported on this briefly, expressing continued hope that
        the machine would produce excess heat. We reported a COP
        (Coefficient of Performance) of 115% (155% excess heat) This
        level of excess heat is difficult to establish with certainty
        using airflow calorimetry. A 200 or 300% excess could be
        detected with confidence, but 15 to 20% could be the result of
        subtle errors. </p>
      <p>Pope returned to Georgia, discouraged. It was clear that we had
        hit a dead end, and that if the machine does work, there must be
        something different about the way it was being operated or the
        water or some other material in Georgia. We decided that the
        only way we would ever get to the bottom of this mystery would
        be to conduct extensive tests on site in Georgia, using our
        instruments and Pope’s in parallel. The machine is large enough
        to allow several temperature probes and ammeters to be attached
        simultaneously, unlike the small hand-held cold fusion cells,
        which often only have room for one set of instruments. </p>
      <p>In November 198, Pope reported that he was now achieving a COP
        as high as 180% with the machine he had brought to Bow, which
        had been reconditioned and reassembled with a new rotor and
        pipes. Rothwell conducted a half-day of testing of this machine
        in the Cummings GA machine shop location, using the same
        instruments and techniques Rothwell and Mallove used in April.
        Most of this 180% turned out to be an artifact of Pope’s
        anemometer, which suffered from a power supply probem caused by
        worn out rechargeable batteries. The measured air speed was too
        low. The high excess heat results reported by Pope in previous
        issues of this magazine were also probably caused by this error.
        Ralph Pope does not agree with this assessment and believes that
        the air speed was measured correctly. The blower power did not
        change and so it is highly unlikely that the airspeed fell.
        While the large excess was clearly wrong, apparent 46% excess
        heat was seen, which was in line with what we observed in April.
        We were encouraged by this preliminary result, yet puzzled and
        wary by our inability to replicate it in New Hampshire. We
        decided to press ahead with full-scale tests in Georgia. Ed Wall
        went to Georgia bringing several tools and precision
        instruments, listed on page 27. </p>
      <p>In the series of tests from December 4-9, 1998, Wall, Rothwell,
        and Pope tested the Kinetic Furnace extensively, using higher
        quality instruments and more sophisticated techniques than Pope
        had ever used. Unfortunately, no significant excess heat was
        observed. Based on the December results, we believe our initial
        assessment in April was incorrect, and there was never any
        significant excess heat in the tests we performed in Georgia or
        New Hampshire. We believe we have discovered the source of the
        error which caused the artificial heat in Georgia. The error was
        in technique rather than instruments or formula. In the December
        tests we used an improved technique, a computer, an HP 34970A
        Data Acquisition System, and an array of 11 K-Type, 20 gauge
        wire thermocouples (four on the inlet and seven on the outlet
        side). The thermocouples were calibrated carefully through the
        temperature range of interest and compared to NIST traceable
        mercury thermometers. By performing this calibration, we learned
        that the thermocouples read about 0.5° F less than the
        calibration thermometer over the temperature range of interest.
        At the same time we used the computerized instruments, we
        repeated the tests using the same relatively crude, hand-held
        instruments --- ammeters and thermometers employed in November.
        In this second test with hand-held electronic, alcohol and
        mercury thermometers, we measured no excess heat, thus
        confirming the computer thermocouple readings. </p>
      <p>The biggest problem with the April and November tests in
        Georgia was the lack of a calibration heater This was not an
        error or an oversight --- we did not have the time to install
        one during these preliminary, one-day tests. The tests in Bow NH
        were conducted over two months, and they employed a calibration
        heater to avoid dependence on air speed measurements and
        formula-based calculations. With a calibration heater, results
        from the electric heater were compared with those measured with
        the Kinetic Furnace. Even of the air speed, electric power, or
        duct cross-section measurement is inaccurate, the comparative
        results should show an excess, if one exists. </p>
      <p>The first day and a half of testing in Georgia were devoted to
        installation and testing of the thermocouples and the
        calibration heater, which was run at three power levels, up to
        3.25 kW. At the end of the second day we turned on the Kinetic
        Furnace, which also consumes about 3 kW electric power. All
        tests were done with the heater in place, whether it was active
        or not, to maintain consistent air flow patterns. He Kinetic
        Furnace testing protocol calls for the machine to be run with
        the cooling fan turned off until the internal water temperature
        rises to at least 160°&nbsp; F. Then the blower is turned on,
        and internal temperature drops rapidly at first. Stored up heat
        in the rotor and water are removed. In 20 to 30 minutes the
        rotor and outlet temperatures stabilize. Twenty minutes into the
        first Kinetic Furnace test, the initial burst of saved up heat
        was exhausted, and the temperature fell to about the same level
        seen with the calibration heaters at 3 kW. It was obvious that
        the furnace was producing no excess heat. </p>
      <p>In our first test it was apparent that the Kinetic Furnace was
        producing no excess heat. This left two possibilities, which we
        investigated over the next 5 days: </p>
      <p>1. That the previous results were an artifact. <br>
        2. That the machine previously produced excess heat, but it was
        not producing it on December 4. </p>
      <p>To check for possibility #1, an artifact, we began by repeating
        the tests with the thermometers, hand-held ammeters, and other
        instruments used in the previous tests. We placed the
        thermometers in the same locations as the computerized
        thermocouple arrays. The hand held instruments were used at the
        same time as the computerized equipment, during both calibration
        heater runs and live Kinetic Furnace runs. The hand held
        instruments showed the same 9 or 10°&nbsp; F delta T as the
        computerized thermocouples, which indicates no excess heat. We
        then moved the thermometers to a location roughly as far away
        from the Kinetic Furnace as Rothwell selected in November and we
        observed a 13 or 14 degrees F delta T. To assess possibility #2,
        we tried changing the rotor, the water, the air flow speed and
        other parameters, which we hypothesized might have a controlling
        effect on an excess heat phenomenon. </p>
      <p>A hypothesis discussed by Horace Heffner in the Vortex Internet
        forum came to mind. Heffner thought that a warm stream of air
        might be moving from the outlet duct 15 feet back to the inlet.
        Although that seemed unlikely, we looked for a stream of air by
        placing the anemometer next to the outlet duct, at a spot 50 cm
        back from the end of the duct, toward the Kinetic Furnace. We
        moved the impeller around, searching for a stream of warm air,
        checking the left side of the duct, the right side, the top and
        bottom. The anemometer is quite sensitive to small streams of
        moving air. The impeller did not spin, so we conclude there was
        no discrete stream of air going from the outlet duct back toward
        the Kinetic Furnace. However, the hypothesis stuck in mind, so
        we did a more careful examination on the air surrounding the
        Kinetic Furnace and duct on all sides. We now believe there is
        an area of circulated air around the machine that is warm in
        comparison with air in the greater volume of the room. This was
        more apparent during tests on Sunday when the machine shop was
        deserted and the air in the rest of the building was quiescent.
        The machine shop is a 5000 sq. ft. steel frame building with the
        ceiling 14 ft high at the eaves. Outside of this envelope of
        warm air around the machine, at locations 20 and 30 ft away, the
        ambient air temperature was roughly 13° cooler than the Kinetic
        Furnace outlet, and roughly 3 degrees cooler than the air
        surrounding the inlet. Thus, the actual delta T temperature
        between the inlet and outlet was 9 or 10° , indicating no excess
        heat. </p>
      <p>In April and November, we measured the inlet temperature at a
        spot too far from the Kinetic Furnace, outside the cloud of warm
        air. This spot was picked because Ralph Pope cautioned us not to
        place the sensors too close to the furnace where they would pick
        up heat radiating from the rotor and other hot machinery.
        However, this was incorrect. There was little significant
        radiant heat; most of the heat near the machine was convective,
        and it went away during the test. In the first round of tests in
        December, four inlet thermocouples and three thermometers were
        placed in various locations around the inlet. The closest ones
        were about 6 inches away from the rotor and calibration heater.
        The farthest ones were 35 inches away from the inlet and
        reasonably well-shielded from radiant heat, yet they were only
        0.9° F cooler after the fan was turned on. The difference would
        have to be 4° F if the excess heat was as high as it appeared to
        be in November, so radiative effects were not large enough to
        nullify the apparent excess heat. During the warm up phase of
        the experiment, before the fan was turned on, the difference
        between the inlet thermocouples and thermometers was 2 to 3° .
        Evidently this was convective heat, because when the fan was
        turned on and the air pulled past the thermocouples and rotor
        this temperature difference largely disappeared. </p>
      <p>The confusion about the inlet temperature underscored a serious
        weakness in our test setup that continued even after the first
        round of December tests. We were still not doing the calorimetry
        the way a heating and air conditioning (HVAC) engineer tests a
        furnace. The HVAC engineer places the inlet temperature sensor
        in a single point source. In our tests we did not know precisely
        where the inlet air originated because we did not have a
        concentrated point source. When we realized this, we constructed
        an inlet duct. The inlet was initially about 20" x 6" located 6"
        below the bottom of the furnace, in a source of cool air. We
        believe there is no heat path from the Kinetic Furnace rotor or
        the calibration heater back to the thermocouples. In runs with
        the calibration heater, the heat balance computed according to
        the formula came out close to unity, with a COP between 96 and
        106%. This inlet duct draws warm air from the cloud surrounding
        the Kinetic Furnace and its environs, but that makes no
        difference. </p>
      <p>After installing the inlet duct and making other improvements,
        we tested intensively for three days. Pope altered the pump
        several times, changing out the rotor and water, but these
        changes had no effect, just as they had had no effect in Bow.
        Based on these tests and the exhaustive testing in Bow, we
        conclude that the three machines we have tested never produced
        excess heat. It is possible that a Kinetic Furnace produced
        excess heat in earlier tests at Pope’s facilities with the Air
        Techniques engineer, or in tests at Dunn Laboratories, Inc., and
        elsewhere. Pope reports that during these tests, the outlet duct
        was always passed through a plywood barrier in a window and
        vented outside, so the error we observed in December could not
        have occurred. </p>
      <p>Rotor heat up rates were similar to those measured in Bow, and
        rotor steady state temperatures were nowhere near those reported
        by Pope (140-150°&nbsp; F). Such high temperatures would be
        difficult to explain, except as apparent and strong excess heat,
        but they could not be confirmed. This steady-state rotor chamber
        temperature remains a key unresolved issue. If there are
        conditions during which this temperature is higher than what we
        have seen, then it is possible that Pope and Perkins saw better
        results. Attempts were made to increase the rotor temperature by
        restricting the intake plenum cross-section area. The rotor
        temperature was raised ~ 10° F by this method, but this
        introduced another factor. The air moved much faster in the
        intake than the exhaust, so it was cooled by the Bernoulli
        effect. This was seen during calibration when the blower alone
        was run for an extended period. The COP came out slightly
        over-unity for the blower alone because we did not take into
        account the Bernoulli equations. The actual COP must obviously
        be under unity for the blower. </p>
      <p><b>Why It Took So Long ~</b> </p>
      <p>He reader might wonder why it took 9 weeks to confirm the
        conservation of energy. Our test results in New Hampshire showed
        no significant excess heat at any time, and the first test of
        the Kinetic Furnace in Georgia conclusively proved there was no
        excess heat. On the face of it this is a simple, straightforward
        measurement very similar to those conducted by HVAC engineers
        every day, so you would think that an experienced engineer would
        get it right the first time with ease. Indeed, Mallove and Wall
        did get it right the first time. They spent the next 9 weeks
        making sure. The installation in Bow included an inlet duct, so
        the apparent excess cannot be caused by the same problem we
        fixed in Cumming. However, it was clear that the calibration
        heater was also producing noisy, nominally over-unity results,
        putting 15% within the range of error. </p>
      <p>The apparent correlation of rotor RPM to slightly over-unity
        COP turned out to be unconfirmed by a large number of other
        tests. </p>
      <p>Another reason it took so long to resolve this issue is that
        people think slowly and research takes time. Consider the
        electric generator and motor. Oersted discovered that electric
        currents produce magnetic effects in 1820. This triggered
        intense research by Henry, Faraday, Fresnel and other leading
        scientists. It took Faraday roughly 10 years to prove the
        converse: that magnets induce electric fields. Faraday devised
        the first crude electric generator in 1831, and it was a while
        after that before anyone realized that generators can also be
        used as motors. </p>
      <p><b>Difficulties ~</b> </p>
      <p>Like most experiments, this was a running battle with
        recalcitrant equipment, fatigue and inadvertent carelessness.
        Here are some of the things that went wrong. </p>
      <p>At first we measured the power into the resistance heater
        incorrectly, because of the complicated network of two
        transformers and the autotransformer (variable voltage
        transformer). </p>
      <p>The power meter interface to the computer failed to work,
        perhaps because of software conflicts with the HP 34970A, so we
        were unable to download instantaneous power graphs. We depended
        on the computed power average and total energy. Power input was
        very steady so this was not a significant problem. In the
        previous visit with Mallove, power graphs downloaded
        successfully and showed steady-state operation. </p>
      <p>The computer interface to the anemometer also failed to
        function correctly. The air speed changed every time we altered
        the configuration, and twice we deliberately slowed down the
        blower by rewiring to increase heat retention in the rotor
        housing. We thought this might promote excess heat generation.
        Because we could not record data automatically from the
        anemometer to the computer, each time we changed the wind speed
        we had to go through a laborious 20-minute process to manually
        record the data. It was measured in FPM (ft/min.) with the
        DTA4000 electronic anemometer. The anemometer was mounted on a
        camera tripod. The impeller was positioned at 9 points on a 3x3
        array, with points equidistant 3 inches apart. The impeller was
        placed at a grid point and left to stabilize for one minute.
        Eight readings were taken at 15-second intervals. The average
        value and standard deviation was computed. </p>
      <p>After the inlet duct was completed, 4 thermocouples were
        installed in various locations within it. Wide variations and
        fluctuations in temperature were noted. Apparently, eddy
        currents produced warm spots within the box. All thermocouples
        were moved to spots exposed to the incoming rush of air, and the
        temperatures all registered the same. However, they were
        probably all registering a fraction of a degree cooler than they
        would have in the same air motionless because of the Bernoulli
        effect. This fraction of a degree difference might be mistakenly
        interpreted as excess heat. </p>
      <p>The volume of air flowing through the duct every minute is
        computed by multiplying the speed of the air, in feet per minute
        (FPM), by the size of the duct in square feet, to give cubic
        feet per minute (CFM). However, the cross-section of this duct
        was irregular. One side was slightly longer than the others and
        the corners were not right angles. We straightened out the
        corners somewhat with steel angle brackets. We traced the exact
        inside dimensions of the duct onto a piece of plexiglass, copied
        that onto graph paper, and determined surface area, which was
        130.7 inches (91% of one sq. ft.). When this correction factor
        was applied to the formula, the calibration runs and Kinetic
        Furnace runs agreed to an uncanny extent. The numbers were so
        close at one point that we worried we were making a mistake. </p>
      <p>A section of Rothwells’ November report describes a typical
        instrument malfunction: </p>
      <p>"At minute 75, I placed the DTA4000 near the stool to measure
        ambient temperature with the built-in thermometer. At minute
        105, I discovered that the milling machine nearby interfered
        with electronics in the control box. When I lifted the control
        box, the temperature display changed from 71.6° to 71.1° F. I
        put it down again and it changed back to 71.6° , repeatedly. I
        moved it a meter away and it dropped to 71.1°&nbsp; and remained
        stable. <br>
        The red alcohol thermometer registered 71°, and the Acu-rite
        registered 68.9°&nbsp; and 68.5° . I moved the stool two meters
        further inside the building, to a location where all the
        instruments indicated the air was slightly colder, and all
        reached the same spread of values they showed before the run:
        70.7 on the DTA4000, and 70° , 68.7° , and 68°&nbsp; on the
        others. In the new location the anemometer moved with a slight
        draft of 70 FPM. The air was moving toward the Kinetic Furnace".
      </p>
      <p>This illustrates the importance of using instruments based on
        different physical principles. We ues mercury thermometers as
        well as electronic thermometers because mercury thermometers
        cannot be affected by the electric fields generated by a milling
        machine. </p>
      <p><b>How Heat Was Measured ~</b> </p>
      <p>We measured heat from the Kinetic Furnace by two methods.
        First, we simply compared the control run to the Kinetic Furnace
        run at the same power level. When the control run temperature
        went up 9.5° , the Kinetic Furnace went up 9.5° . When the flow
        air was restricted then the control run went up 19° ; the
        Kinetic Furnace also went up 19° . Second, we applied the HVAC
        formula to compute the actual heat flow. The formula is: </p>
      <p>Delta T x 1.08 x FPM (air speed measured in feet per minute by
        anemometer) x Duct opening as a fraction of one square foot =
        BTU heat output. </p>
      <p>Here are two typical Kinetic Furnace runs: </p>
      <p><i>December 5, Run 3</i> </p>
      <p>Input power 3.40 kW = 11,604 BTU/hr. Output power: 10.9°&nbsp;
        F x 1.08 x 1171 FPM x 0.91 sq. ft. = 12,509 BTU/hr.; COP = 108%.
      </p>
      <p>This indicates no excess within the margin of error. In other
        words, some of the resistance heater control run are also over
        100%, and the standard deviation of the anemometer readings was
        46 FPM, so this result was between 106 and 110% Overall heat
        recovery from the system was excellent, so you would expect the
        COP to be in the range of 90 to 100%. </p>
      <p><i>December 5, Run 4</i> </p>
      <p>Input power 3.39 kW = 11,570 BTU/hr Output power: 10.1°&nbsp; F
        x 1.08 x 1171 FPM x 0.91 sq. ft. = 11,581 BTU/hr; COP = 100%. </p>
      <p>Here is a calibration run with the resistance heater and a
        different airflow: </p>
      <p><i>December 8, Run 4</i> </p>
      <p>Input power = 3.34 kW = 11,399 BTU/hr Output power: 19.0°&nbsp;
        F x 1.08 x 1022 x 0.55 sq. ft. = 11,534 BTU/hr.; COP = 101%. </p>
      <p>Future work, if time and resources allow, will be with water
        flow calorimetry, which is easier and more precise. Air as a
        calorimetric fluid is difficult to work with because it is
        turbulent, compressible, does not mix well, is difficult to
        meter, and requires a huge duct. The flow of air through the
        duct varies from one spot to another, and it varies over time.
        The anemometer impeller is not large enough to cover the entire
        duct, so t is used to sample the flow at many points. Flowmeters
        and temperature sensors immersed in a stream of water also test
        a small sample of the flow at one point. However, a stream of
        water can be diverted into a graduated cylinder to test flow,
        and the fluid in the cylinder can be stirred to be sure the
        probes correctly register the average temperature. You cannot
        divert the entire stream of air into a container. </p>
      <p>Once factors like the size of the duct cross-section were
        determined with reasonable accuracy, the results from the
        calibration and Kinetic Furnace runs at different power levels
        began to line up with unexpected accuracy. For example, in the
        first set of tests they all showed COP of 96% within 1%. Later,
        at another air speed, they lined up between 97 and 99%. </p>
      <p><b>Instruments &amp; Equipment ~</b> </p>
      <p>Although the test procedure is simple in principle, we took
        great care to be sure we were getting the correct answer. One
        method of doing this is to use redundant instruments based on
        different physical principles. For example, to measure
        temperature one can rely upon high precision thermocouples with
        confidence. In this case we only need to measure temperature to
        within 2 to 4° F. A cheap thermometer will work adequately for
        this purpose. We did in fact use some discount store
        thermometers, and one grade-school science class thermometer. We
        also used 16 K-type thermocouples, 6 mercury thermometers of
        various ranges, two bimetallic dial thermometers, a hand-held,
        high-precision, high-temperature dual thermocouple (HP-52), and
        a red alcohol thermometer. </p>
      <p>The HP-34970A thermocouple differences, as received, were less
        than 0.1 degree. The other instruments did not agree so
        precisely, varying as much as 3 F. In one test of ambient
        temperature, which was most accurate, the thermocouples settled
        at 73.9° , 72.3° , 72.7° , and 72.0° ; the mercury thermometer,
        which was the most accurate, settled at 72.3° ; and the red
        alcohol which is marked in 2-degree increments, indicated 74° F.
        In a test of the outlet duct temperature, the thermocouples and
        thermometers registered 82.4° , 82.9° , and the red alcohol
        thermometer which had a consistent 2° bias at all temperatures,
        registered 84° F. At that moment the HP-34970A thermocouples
        registered: 82.6° , 82.7° , 82.8° , 83.0° , 83.1° , and
        83.0°&nbsp; degrees. This 0.5° spread of value was real:
        temperatures within the air stream did vary. The thermocouples
        agreed more closely when calibrated in stirred water or left in
        calm, ambient air. </p>
      <p>Even though the cheaper thermometers did have pronounced
        biases, each agreed with itself. That is to say, when we moved a
        mercury thermometer, a thermistor, and the red alcohol
        thermometer from the inlet to the outlet, they all rose 9.5°,
        even though they started at different values. The cheaper
        thermometers were inaccurate, but precise. "Inaccurate" means
        the starting point in the temperature scale --- the absolute
        temperature was correct. Precise means the temperature rose the
        same extent as the NAST traceable thermometers. </p>
      <p>Equipment used in this test included: <br>
        HP 34970A Data Acquisition system <br>
        11 K-type, 20-gauge thermocouples <br>
        Toshiba laptop computer interfaced to the HP 34970A <br>
        A Compaq portable computer to take notes and compute preliminary
        results with a spreadsheet. <br>

        and a Micronta clamp-on inductive analog ammeter and voltmeter.
        These instruments do not detect power factor and they tend to
        overestimate electric power. However, in the second set of tests
        in December, the results they showed were close to the power

      <p><b>Was It Worth It?</b> </p>
      <p>We wrote above, "the actual COP must obviously be under unity
        for the blower". A cynic might say that the actual COP of a
        water mixer must also obviously be under unity, our tests were
        in vain, and we made a gargantuan effort to prove the
        conservation of energy and the fixed ratio of work and heat.
        This ratio was established in the 1840s by J.P. Joule. He used a
        falling weight to drive a paddle that stirred water and raise
        the water temperature. It sounds similar to the Kinetic Furnace
        --- it sounds as if we were trying to overturn an observation
        established 150 years ago and confirmed countless times every
        day by scientists and HVAC engineers everywhere. But, there is
        an important difference between Joule’s experiments, stirred
        water, and ours. The stirrer in the Kinetic Furnace rotates much
        more quickly than Joule’s, so quickly that it almost certainly
        creates cavitation. Similar cavitation on the smaller scale have
        apparently produced excess heat and nuclear effects. The nuclear
        claim is controversial, but widely accepted. Much of the
        investigation into apparent nuclear effects caused by cavitation
        is being performed in the mainstream by conventional scientists,
        and approved of by the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Scientific
          American</i>, and <i>Popular Science</i> (e.g., <i>P.S.</i>,
        December 1999). The Kinetic Furnace and Griggs Hydrosonic Pump
        probably perform cavitation on a scale thousands of times larger
        than any of the experimental sonoluminescence devices. We must
        say "probably" because we have no direct proof that cavitation
        is occurring, because we cannot see inside the steel chamber.
        Perhaps the Kinetic Furnace was previously cavitating and
        producing excess heat, but it later stopped. </p>
      <p>It would be absurd to question the validity of Joule’s
        experiments. Cavitation has been carefully studied since it
        began damaging marine propellers about 150 years ago. But, as
        far as we know, cavitation and heat together have not been
        carefully researched. People have felt no need to study heat
        evolved from cavitation, because no one suspected the heat might
        be unusual. Science works a little like a national park.
        Thousands of people cluster around the main attraction and the
        visitors’ center. Hundreds hike down the nearby well-worn paths,
        measuring heat and cavitation. But the moment you step off the
        path into the woods, you leave the crowds behind. In a national
        park it is unlikely that you will stumble into an unexpected
        rock formation or a hill that has never been climbed, but in a
        quiet spot you might find a fossil or a new species of insect.
        The unexplored avenues of science are infinitely larger than the
        physical paths on earth. The lesson of cold fusion, the Marinov
        motor, and other strange phenomena described in this magazine is
        that you can reach the unexplored wilderness of science in a few
        minutes with simple tools. </p>
      <p><b>Previous Tests &amp; Recent Work By Pope &amp; Perkins ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Kinetic Furnace reportedly produced large excess heat in
        other tests over the years at Dunn Laboratories, Inc. (1982,
        1983), Pittsburgh Testing Laboratory (1984, 1986), Automated
        Test Labs (1986), and elsewhere. What happened during those
        tests? Were the professional laboratories incorrect? We do not
        know. In the papers provided to us by Pope, the tests are not
        described in enough detail to judge with finality. It seems
        unlikely that professionals in these laboratories made the same
        kinds of mistakes we did initially, before we installed the
        inlet duct. After all, their business is to determine the COP of
        furnaces. However, they never pursued development of the Kinetic
        Furnace. That is inexplicable behavior. Other companies in the
        US that tested over-unity cold fusion devices have been quite
        enthusiastic. Heating and air conditioning companies have often
        contacted out magazine and asked whether any practical device is
        available. They seem anxious to proceed with development, and
        totally unconcerned about the fact that the scientific
        establishment does not believe these devices exist. This is
        speculation, but perhaps after Dunn Labs and the others wrote
        the reports provided to us by Pope, they realized that they
        might have made a mistake of some sort. The HVAC engineer in
        Atlanta who performed the tests on the Kinetic Furnace many
        years ago stood by his work, but he explained that it was a
        preliminary test. </p>
      <p>It is possible that for the past few years, Pope and the late
        Eugene Perkins were performing invalid tests, and their results
        may have been meaningless. They never employed a resistance
        heater or an inlet duct, so they never would have caught the
        errors we discovered. They did not keep adequate records by our
        standards, they had no computerized data collection, and they
        did not organize their tests in a methodical, step-by-step
        fashion. To their credit, they did the best they could at the
        time under difficult circumstances. </p>
      <p>Their open and cooperative attitude, and their willingness to
        honestly face the facts is extremely laudable. Many inventors of
        exotic technology will refuse to allow their machines to be
        tested in the first place, and even when you find an error with
        a machine, most will refuse to listen or believe it. Ralph Pope
        debated the issue with us at first, and he demanded rigorous
        proof that the inlet temperature was not affected by radiant
        heat. This forced us to devise a good test to prove our point,
        with the inlet turned 90° downward and the thermocouples
        shielded from the furnace above. Pope accepts our conclusion
        that the present set of experiments show no excess heat, but he
        believes that previous experiments were successful. He intends
        to continue testing if he can, and we will do so as time allows.
      </p>
      <p>These results must be seen in the light of the James Griggs
        HydroSonic Pump excess heat claims in a superficially similar
        device. Mallove and Rothwell made measurements on the Griggs
        machine in early 1994. The Griggs results may support the idea
        that cavitation excess energy is real but highly variable, for
        reasons not yet understood. </p>
      <p>HydroSonic Pumps have not yet been replicated widely. However,
        Griggs used much better instruments and techniques than
        Pope-Perkins, and he uses water flow calorimetry, which is
        easier and more reliable. We have a HydroSonic Pump, and we
        intend to press ahead with our plans to test it at NERL when we
        have the time and resources in 1999. </p>
      <p>Should anyone be devoting weeks and thousands of dollars
        testing this sort of claim? Mainstream science says no. We think
        it is worth doing. We are disappointed, and we have no immediate
        plans to continue testing the Kinetic Furnace at this time, but
        we do not consider these last few months a waste of time. The
        instruments have been quite useful with other projects and the
        skills and techniques for air flow calorimetry may prove
        valuable. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract --- </b>A furnace or space heater is operable at
        low cost by a small electric motor which rotates an elongated
        cylindrical drum on a vertical axis, within an elongated
        cylindrical casing at a clearance of about one eighth of an inch
        in the annular chamber formed therebetween. A supply of light
        lubricant normally occupies the lower portion of the annular
        chamber but rises to fill the chamber during rotation of the
        drum. The casing is enclosed in a housing, having a fan chamber
        containing an electric motor and fan or blower. The motor shaft
        may rotate both the fan and the drum. </p>
      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>It has heretofore been proposed in U.S. Pat. # 1,650,612 to
        Deniston of Nov. 29, 1927 to rotate a stack of discs relative to
        a coaxial stack of fixed discs on a horizontal axis within a
        casing to generate frictional heat in hot water flowing through
        the lower portion of the casing. In this heating device a supply
        of oil is contained in the upper portion of the casing to
        lubricate the discs and to float on the water at a predetermined
        level. </p>
      <p>In U.S. Pat. # 3,333,771 to Graham of Aug. 1, 1967, a pair of
        vaned rotors are each enclosed within a chamber of a casing, and
        mounted to rotate in a vertical plane on a horizontal axis as
        depicted in FIG. 7 thereof. As in the Deniston patent water
        flows through the device and is heated by friction. </p>
      <p>In U.S. Pat. # 4,004,553 to Stenstrom of Jan. 25, 1977 a single
        disc like rotor is revolved on a horizontal axis in a vertical
        plane, within a casing to heat water passing through the device.
      </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>Unlike the above mentioned patents wherein thin discs or vanes,
        in single or stack configuration, comprise the rotor, in this
        invention an elongated, cylindrical smooth surfaced, inner drum
        is the rotor. The drum is rotated in a horizontal plane on a
        vertical axis within an elongated cylindrical, smooth surfaced
        casing, or outer drum, to form an annular sealed, liquid,
        chamber therebetween having a clearance of about one eighth of
        an inch. A quart of relatively light oil is captive in the
        annular chamber and at rest occupies only the bottom thereof.
        However upon rotation of the drum, by an electric motor of about
        one horse power, the oil rises to fill the chamber due to the
        pumping action of the drum. </p>
      <p>Thus friction heat is generated not by two metal, or other,
        surfaces contacting each other, but by the contact of the
        opposing surfaces with the oil which not only lubricates but
        generates heat. </p>
      <p>A portable space heater is formed by enclosing the casing and
        drum in the lower chamber of a housing and drawing ambient air
        inwardly and around the heated outer surface of the casing for
        fan discharge back into the ambient atmosphere by a large
        diameter, eight bladed fan driven by the drum motor, or
        preferably by a separate motor. For use as a furnace an air
        blower and separate electric motor blow ambient air around the
        casing for discharge into a heating system. </p>

      <p>DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </p>
      <p>FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate one embodiment of the friction heat
        heater 20 of the invention which includes an upstanding, hollow,
        cylindrical housing 21 formed of imperforate sheet metal 22 and
        having legs 23 for supporting it on a floor 24 of a building.
        The space heater 20 is portable and in the portable embodiment
        illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2 the housing 21 is of predetermined
        diameter of about twelve inches and of predetermined height of
        about thirty-two inches. </p>
      <p>Fixed within housing 21 by suitable brackets 25 and 26 is a
        hollow cylindrical casing, or outer drum, 27 which is of
        predetermined diameter less than the diameter of the housing,
        such as ten inches, and is formed of aluminum sheeting 28 for
        efficient transfer of heat. The cylindrical side wall 29, top
        wall 31 and bottom wall 32 of casing 27 are imperforate to form
        a sealed enclosure except for the filler tube 33, which is
        closed by a removable threaded cap 34. </p>
      <p>The casing 27 divides housing 21 into the lower air heating
        chamber 35, which it occupies and an upper fan chamber 36, there
        being an annular air chamber 37 formed between the cylindrical
        side wall 29 of the casing and the coaxial, concentric
        cylindrical side wall 38 of the housing 21. </p>
      <p>Air inlet means 39 is provided in the lower portion of the
        housing 21 in the form of spaced apertures 41 extending around
        the cylindrical side wall 38 and air outlet means 42 is provided
        in the top 43 of the housing in the form of apertures 44. The
        annular air chamber 37 connects the air inlet means to the air
        outlet means of the fan chamber 36. </p>
      <p>A reversible electric motor 45 is mounted in the fan chamber 36
        with an eight bladed fan 46 fast on one end 47 of the motor
        shaft 48, each blade being of about 25°&nbsp; pitch and the
        motor being about one horse power for rotating the shaft 48 at
        between 1800-3600 R.P.M. </p>
      <p>The other end 49 of motor shaft 48 extends into the air heating
        chamber 35 to rotate the hollow, cylindrical drum 51 which is
        supported in suitable bearings 52 for rotating around the
        central, vertical axis of the casing 27 and housing 21. </p>
      <p>The inner drum 51 is sealed and hollow and includes the top
        wall 53, bottom wall 54 and cylindrical side wall 55, the walls
        being of stainless steel. The exterior cylindrical surface 56 of
        the cylindrical side wall 55 is smooth as is the interior,
        cylindrical surface 57 of the aluminum of the cylindrical side
        wall 29 of casing 27 and the surfaces 56 and 57 are at about one
        eight inch clearance from each other to form a narrow, annular
        liquid receptacle 58 therebetween. </p>
      <p>It should be noted that the annular liquid receptacle 58 is not
        a passage through which liquid to be heated is continually
        flowed, as in the above mentioned prior art patents. Instead it
        is a sealed chamber and is provided with a supply of liquid
        lubricant 59 such as a quart of No. 10 oil which normally rests
        in the horizontal space, or shallow liquid receptacle 61 between
        the bottom wall 54 of the drum 51 and the bottom wall 32 of the
        casing 27. </p>
      <p>It has been found that the best results are obtained when the
        lubricant 59 is Quaker State F-L-M-A-T Fluid, Ford Motor Company
        Qualifications No. 2P-670306 M 2633F. Unlike prior patents, no
        water is in contact with the oil. </p>
      <p>The motor 45 is connected to a thermostat 62, of any well known
        type by cord 63 and to a source of electricity by male plug 64
        so that it is energized under the control of ambient temperature
        by the signals of the thermostat. </p>
      <p>In operation the motor 45 drives the drum 51 at a substantial
        speed, which causes the oil 59 to rise up into the annular liqud
        receptacle 58 to substantially fill the same. The heat of
        friction between the inner drum 51 and outer drum, or casing 27
        is transferred by the oil while it prevents wear on the surfaces
        56 and 57 so that the exterior aluminum surface 65 of the fixed
        outer drum 27 becomes heated. Meanwhile the large diameter,
        multibladed fan 46 is drawing ambient air through the air inlet
        means 39, thence up through the annular air chamber 37 and past
        the elongated heated surface 65 for discharge through the air
        outlet means 42 back into the room. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 3, it is preferable to provide a separate
        electric motor 70, usually about 1/8 H.P. and driving an air
        blower 71, these being mounted in a lower air chamber 72 for
        driving ambient air upwardly in an annular flow path in chamber
        37 from the air inlet means 73 to the air outlet means 74. Air
        outlet means is the intake duct 75 of a hot air heating system
        76 so that the heater 20 becomes a furnace rather than a space
        heater, the separate electric motor 70 enables the thermostat 62
        to initiate rotation of the drum until a predetermined
        temperature is reached in the aluminum outer drum 27, whereupon
        the thermostat automatically de-energizes the drum motor 45
        while continuing to rotate the separate fan, or flower motor
        such as 70, to furnish hot air to the room or heating system 76
        until the casing 27 cools to a predetermined temperature. </p>

      <p>A heater for heating a liquid including a housing defining a

        chamber surface, a rotor body rotatably journalled in the
        heating chamber with a cylindrical peripheral surface thereon
        concentrically of the chamber surface so as to define an annular
        space between the chamber surface and the peripheral surface on
        the rotor body, drive means for effecting relative rotation
        between the rotor body and the housing, and pump means for
        circulating the liquid through the annular space so that the
        rotation of the rotor body heats the liquid passing through the
        annular space. </p>
      <p><b>Description<i> ~</i></b> </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>This invention relates generally to liquid heaters and more
        particularly to a liquid heater which heats liquid by shearing
        the liquid. </p>
      <p>Various attempts have been made in the past to mechanically
        heat liquids. One type of such mechanical heating device heats
        the liquid by shearing the liquid between rotary and stationary
        blades in a chamber. A device of this type is illustrated in
        U.S. Pat. No. 2,683,448. This type of heating device creates a
        high degree of turbulence in the liquid passing through the
        device to be heated and consumes a large amount of power in
        driving the rotary blades in the chamber. As a result, the
        heating efficiency of this type of device is relatively low. </p>
      <p>In another type of these prior art devices, the heat to heat
        the liquid is generated by the frictional contact between
        rotating and non-rotating members. Examples of this type of
        heating device are illustrated in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,625,929;
        3,164,147; and 3,402,702. The problems with this type of heating
        device are that a large amount of power is consumed in
        generating the frictional heat, and excessive wear is
        encountered between the surfaces of frictional contact with each
        other within the heating unit. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>These and other problems and disadvantages associated with the
        prior art are overcome by the invention disclosed herein by
        providing a heating unit which uses a cylindrical rotor rotating
        in a cylindrical heating chamber so that the flow of liquid in
        the chamber is laminar rather than turbulent and with the rotor
        and chamber not being in contact with each other so that
        frictional losses within the heating unit are minimized. It has
        been found that sufficient liquid shear is generated by the
        rotating rotor in the heating chamber so that the liquid is
        heated, yet the power consumption associated therewith is
        minimized so that the heating efficiency of the unit is
        maximized. </p>
      <p>The apparatus of the invention includes a heating unit which
        may be incorporated in a heating system adapted to heat air in a
        prescribed space such as a building or residence. The heating
        unit includes a housing which defines an elongate heating
        chamber therein with a cylindrical chamber surface. A rotor body
        is rotatably mounted in the heating chamber and defines a
        cylindrical peripheral surface thereon concentric with respect
        to the cylindrical chamber surface. The peripheral surface on
        the rotor has an outside diameter a prescribed amount smaller
        than the inside diameter of the chamber so as to define an
        annular space between the rotor body and the chamber through
        which the liquid to be heated is passed. Drive means is provided
        for effecting relative rotation between the rotor and the
        housing and pump means is provided for circulating the liquid
        through the annular space between the rotor and the chamber as
        the rotor is rotated so that the liquid is heated due to the
        shear of the liquid in the annular space between the rotor body
        and the chamber. In the embodiment of the invention shown, the
        pump impeller for circulating the liquid through the chamber is
        mounted on the rotor so that the drive means simultaneously
        rotates the pump impeller and the rotor. </p>
      <p>When the heating unit is incorporated in a heating system, the
        liquid heated by the heating unit is passed through an
        air-to-liquid heat exchanger through which the air to be heated
        is also passed so that the air is heated as it passes through
        the heat exchanger. The operation of the heating unit is
        controlled so as to maintain the temperature of the air exiting
        the heat exchanger within a prescribed temperature range while
        the operation of the fan circulating the air through the heat
        exchanger is controlled in response to the temperature of the
        air in the conditioned space so as to maintain the temperature
        of the air in the conditioned space within a prescribed
        temperature range. </p>
      <p>These and other features and advantages of the invention will
        become more apparent upon consideration of the following
        description and accompanying drawings wherein like characters of
        reference designate corresponding parts throughout the several
        views and in which: </p>

      <p>These figures and the following detailed description disclose
        specific embodiments of the invention; however, it it to be
        understood that the inventive concept is not limited thereto
        since it may be incorporated in other forms. </p>
      <p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 1, it will be seen that the invention is
        embodied in a heating system 10 used to heat air in a space to
        be conditioned such as a building or residence. The heating
        system 10 includes generally a heating unit 11 connected to a
        liquid-to-air heat exchanger 12. The liquid-to-air heat
        exchanger 12 is housed in an appropriate duct system 14 adapted
        to supply air from the space to be conditioned to the heat
        exchanger 12 and to deliver air from the heat exchanger 12 back
        to the space to be conditioned. A fan 15 is provided in the duct
        system 14 for forcing the air from the space to be conditioned
        through the duct system 14 and the heat exchanger 12. The
        heating unit 11 is also illustrated housed in the duct system 14
        although it is understood that it may be located remotely
        thereof. </p>
      <p>The duct system 14 defines a heat exchanger chamber 16 therein
        in which the liquid-to-air heat exchanger 12 is mounted with an
        intake plenum 18 connected to the space to be conditioned by an
        appropriate return duct 19 so that the air from the space to be
        conditioned is supplied to the heat exchanger chamber 16 through
        the intake plenum 18. The air passing from the intake plenum 18
        through the heat exchanger 12 in the chamber 16 passes out
        through a supply plenum 20 connected to the space to be
        conditioned by the supply duct 21 to supply the heated air back
        to the space to be conditioned. The fan 15 is located in the
        heat exchanger chamber 16 so that the fan 15 forces the air from
        the intake plenum 18 through the heat exchanger 12 in the
        chamber 16 and out through the supply plenum 20. It will be
        noted that the heat exchanger 12 extends completely across the
        chamber 16 so that all of the air passing from the intake plenum
        18 to the supply plenum 20 must pass through the heat exchanger
        12. </p>
      <p>The operation of the fan 15 is controlled by thermostatic
        switch 22 which is located in the space to be conditioned so
        that when the temperature of the air in the space to be
        conditioned drops below a prescribed value, the switch 22
        operates fan 15 to circulate air from the space to be
        conditioned through the heat exchanger 12 until the air in the
        space to be conditioned has been raised to a higher prescribed
        value. Such thermostatic switches 22 are conventional and need
        not be described in detail. As will become more apparent, the
        operation of the heating unit 11 is controlled by a thermostatic
        switch 24 located at the air exit side of the heat exchanger 12
        as will become more apparent. The thermostatic switch 24 serves
        to activate the heating unit 11 when the air exiting the heat
        exchanger 12 drops to a prescribed lower temperature to heat a
        liquid and supply the liquid to heat exchanger 12 until the
        temperature of the air exiting the heat exchanger 12 has been
        raised to a prescribed higher temperature. </p>
      <p>The heating unit 11 is illustrated mounted in the heat
        exchanger chamber 16 under the heat exchanger 12 and includes a
        liquid heater 25 driven by drive motor 26. In the particular
        embodiment shown, the drive motor 26 is connected to the liquid
        heater 25 through a bell and pulley arrangement 28. It is to be
        understood, however, that the drive motor 26 may be directly
        connected to the liquid heater 25. </p>
      <p>As best seen in FIGS. 2-4, the liquid heater 25 includes a
        housing 30 in which is rotatably mounted a rotor assembly 31.
        The housing 30 is fixedly mounted in the heat exchanger chamber
        16 while the rotor assembly 31 is rotated by the drive motor 26.
      </p>
      <p>The housing 30 includes a cylindrical side wall 32 closed at
        opposite ends by end plates 34. Each of the end plates 34
        defines a cylindrical projection 35 thereon which fits within
        the cylindrical side wall 32 and is provided with an annular
        groove 36 therearound which receives an O-ring 38 therein to
        seal the end plate 34 to the inside of the side wall 32. The end
        plates 34 are held in position by tie bolts 39 so that the
        closed chamber is defined by the side wall 32 and end plates 34.
        This chamber is divided into a heating chamber 40 and a pumping
        chamber 41 by a divider assembly 42. The divider assembly 42
        includes an annular spacer wall 44 having an outside diameter so
        that it will snugly fit within the side walls 32 adjacent one of
        the end plates 34 so that spacer wall 44 projects a prescribed
        distance away from the end plate 34. The projecting end of the
        spacer wall 44 is closed by a circular end plate 45 so that the
        pumping chamber 41 is defined between the end plate 45, spacer
        wall 44, and the end plate 34 against which the spacer wall 44
        abuts. The heating chamber 40 is thus defined between the end
        plate 45, the end plate 34 opposite that against which the
        divider assembly 42 abuts and the housing side wall 32. The
        heating chamber 40 has a diameter d.sub.1 defined by the inside
        surface 48 of the side wall 32 and a length L.sub.1 defined
        between the end plate 34 and the end plate 45. The side wall 32
        defines an inlet opening 49 therethrough to the chamber 40
        adjacent that end plate 34 opposite the divider assembly 42
        while the spacer wall 44 and side wall 32 define a common outlet
        opening 50 therethrough which communicates with the pumping
        chamber 41. The circular end plate 45 on the divider assembly 42
        defines a transfer opening 51 therethrough about the central
        axis A.sub.1 of the chambers 40 and 41 of diameter d.sub.2 so
        that the heating chamber 40 communicates with the pumping
        chamber 41 as will become more apparent. </p>
      <p>The rotor assembly 31 includes a support shaft 55 which mounts
        a rotor body 56 thereon at one position along the length of the
        shaft 55 and a pump impeller 58 at another position along the
        support shaft 55. The rotor assembly 31 is mounted in the
        housing 30 so that the support shaft extends coaxially of the
        axis A.sub.1 with the rotor body 56 located in the heating
        chamber 40 while the pump impeller 58 is located in the pumping
        chamber 41. The support shaft 55 extends through the transfer
        opening 51 through the end plate 45 in clearance therewith so
        that liquid can pass from the heating chamber 40 into the
        pumping chamber 41 and extends out through the end plates 34
        through appropriate openings therein. The shaft 55 is rotatably
        journalled in bearings 59 mounted on each of the end plates 34
        and held in position by retainers 60 on the outside of the end
        plates 34. A seal 61 is provided around shaft 55 immediately
        inboard of each of the bearings 59 to prevent liquid from
        passing out of the housing 30 around the shaft 55 at the end
        plates 34. The shaft 55 is provided with a drive projection 62
        which extends out of the housing 30 through one of the retainers
        60 so that the belt and pulley arrangement 28 can be connected
        thereto to rotate the support shaft 55. </p>
      <p>The rotor body 56 is hollow and includes a pair of spaced apart
        washer-shaped end plates 64 which are fixedly attached to that
        portion of the support shaft 55 within the heating chamber 40
        with one of the end plates 64 spaced inwardly of the end plate
        34 and the other end plate 64 being spaced inwardly of the end
        plate 45. The end plates 64 are connected by an annular rotor
        side wall 65 which extends therebetween with the side wall 65
        being fixedly attached to the end plates 64 and the end plates
        64 being fixedly attached to the support shaft 55 so that the
        rotor body 56 rotates with the support shaft 55. The rotor side
        wall 65 defines a peripheral surface 66 thereon which is
        cylindrical and located concentrically of the central axis
        A.sub.1 of the heating chamber 40. The surface 66 has a diameter
        d.sub.3 which is a prescribed amount less than the inside
        diameter of the surface 48 so that surfaces 66 and 48 defines an
        annular space 68 therebetween of a radial distance d.sub.4. The
        surface 66 has a length L.sub.2 shorter than the length of the
        heating chamber 40. </p>
      <p>The pump impeller 58 is fixedly attached to that portion of the
        support shaft 55 within the pumping chamber 41 and includes a
        disk portion 70 oriented perpendicular to the axis A.sub.1 with
        an outside diameter slightly smaller than the inside diameter of
        the spacer wall 44 so that the pump impeller 58 is freely
        rotatable with shaft 55 in the pumping chamber 41. The pump
        impeller 58 also includes an attachment portion 71 used to
        attach the pump impeller 58 to the support shaft 55 through an
        appropriate key arrangement. The disk portion 70 defines a
        centrally located counterbore 72 therein which opens onto that
        side of the disk portion 70 facing the circular end plate 45.
        The counterbore 72 has a diameter larger than that of the
        support shaft 55 to define an annular cavity in the disk portion
        70 around the shaft 55. The disk portion 70 further defines a
        plurality of radially extending passages 74 therein which open
        at their inboard ends into the counterbore 72 and open at their
        outboard ends into the outer periphery of the disk portion 70.
        The pump impeller 58 is attached to the support shaft 55 so that
        the passages 70 are aligned with the outlet opening 50 as they
        rotate within the pumping chamber 41. It will be seen that the
        diameter of the transfer opening 51 and the diameter of the
        counterbore 72 are such that liquid can freely pass from the
        heating chamber 40 through the transfer opening 51 and into the
        counterbore 72 so that the liquid will be forced outwardly along
        the passages 74 as the pump impeller 58 is rotated with the
        support shaft 55. As will become more apparent, this serves to
        force the liquid out of the housing 30 through the outlet
        opening 50. The outlet opening 50 is connected to one side of
        the heat exchanger through a supply pipe 75 while the inlet
        opening 49 to the housing 30 is connected to the other side of
        the heat exchanger through the return pipe 76. </p>
      <p>In operation, it will be seen that the heating chamber 40 and
        the pumping chamber 41 as well as the passage through the heat
        exchanger and the pipe 75 and 76 are filled with a liquid to be
        heated such as water. When the drive motor 26 rotates the rotor
        assembly 31, this causes the rotor body 56 to be rotated in the
        heating chamber 40 while the pump impeller 58 is rotated in the
        pumping chamber 41. The pump impeller 58 pumps the liquid
        through the liquid heater 25 to the heat exchanger 12 and then
        back to the liquid heater 25 so that the heating chamber 40 and
        pumping chamber 41 remain filled with liquid at all times. As
        the rotor body 56 is rotated via the drive motor 26, the liquid
        at the cylindrical peripheral surface 66 on the rotor body 56
        tries to move with the rotor body 56 while the liquid at the
        inside surface 48 on side wall 32 tries to remain stationary.
        This establishes a velocity gradient in the liquid across the
        annular space 68 between the rotor body 56 and the inside
        surface 48 of the side wall 32 to establish shear forces within
        this liquid. These shear forces cause the liquid to be heated.
        The velocity profile across the annular space 68 is such that
        the liquid in the annular space 68 remains in the laminar flow
        region so as to minimize the power consumption of the liquid
        heater 25. Thus, it will be seen that the liquid in the annular
        space 68 is being moved longitudinally of the annular space 68
        by the pump impeller 58 while the liquid is moving
        circumferentially about the space 68 by the rotor body 56. This
        heats the liquid in the annular space 68 as it flows therealong
        and then flows out of the heating chamber 40 into the pumping
        chamber 41 where the pump impeller 58 pumps the liquid through
        the heat exchanger 12 so that the heat from the liquid can be
        transferred to the air passing through the heat exchanger 12. </p>
      <p>It has been found that the temperature to which the liquid can
        be heated in the annular space 68 is dependent on the relative
        velocity of the cylindrical peripheral surface 66 with respect
        to the inside surface 48 on the side wall 32. When water is used
        as the liquid, rotating surface 66 at a velocity of about 1150
        feet per minute heats the water to a temperature of about 140°
        F., rotating surface 66 at a velocity of about 1800 feet per
        minute heats the water to about 165° F., and rotating surface 66
        at a velocity of about 2550 feet per minute heats the water to a
        temperature of about 210° F. Thus, it will be seen that the
        temperature to which the water can be heated can be adjusted by
        adjusting the rotational speed of the rotor body 56 to adjust
        the velocity of the peripheral surface 66 on the rotor body 56.
      </p>
      <p>The radial distance d.sub.4 of the annual space 68 affects the
        volume of liquid that will be heated by the rotating rotor body
        56 at any one time. Distances of 0.06-1.0 inch for the distances
        d.sub.4 have been found practical to reasonably heat the liquid
        passing through the annular space 68. A distance d.sub.4 of
        about 0.75 inch has been found preferable to heat the liquid at
        a flow rate of about two gallons per minute. </p>
      <p>The heating rate capacity of the liquid heater 25 is also
        dependent on the velocity of the cylindrical peripheral surface
        66 on the rotor body 56. When water was used as the liquid to be
        heated, a velocity of about 1800 feet per minute generated about
        19,000 BTU per hour whereas rotating the surface 66 at a
        velocity of about 2550 feet per minute generated about 25,500
        BTU per hour. The volume of liquid in the liquid heater 25 and
        the system of the heat exchanger 12 and the liquid heater 25
        should be such that the air passing through the heat exchanger
        12 at a prescribed volumetric rate can be heated over the
        desired temperature differential. It is found that liquid heater
        25 holding about one gallon of liquid with the system holding
        about three gallons of liquid is sufficient to heat air passing
        through the heat exchanger 12 at a volumetric rate of about 300
        cfm about 40°-80° F. with a temperature differential in the
        liquid passing through the heat exchanger 12 of about 15°-20° F.
      </p>
      <p>In the system illustrated, the diameter d.sub.1 is about 5.5
        inches, the diameter d.sub.3 is about 4 inches, and the length
        L.sub.2 of the surface 66 is about 6 inches. The drive motor 26
        operates from a 115 volt power source and draws about 5.5 amps
        to rotate the rotor assembly 31 at about 2400 rpm to move the
        peripheral surface 66 on the rotor body 56 at a velocity of
        about 2550 feet per minute. Thus, the drive motor 26 has a power
        consumption of about 0.6 kilowatt per hour to produce a heating
        output of about 25,500 BTU per hour. In the above system, the
        fan 15 was operated to force air through the heat exchanger 12
        at a flow rate of about 300 cfm. With the rotor assembly 31
        rotating at about 2400 rpm, the air passing through the heat
        exchanger 12 was heated from a temperature of about 60.degree.
        F. to a temperature of 100°-145° F. while the water temperature
        supplied to the heat exchanger 12 from the liquid heater 25 was
        at a temperature of about 210° F. and the temperature of the
        water returned to the liquid heater 25 from the heat exchanger
        12 is at a temperature of about 185° F. At this rotational
        speed, the pump impeller 58 was pumping the water at a flow rate
        of about 2 gpm with a pressure differential of about 0.5 psi
        across the impeller 58. The thermostatic switch 22 in the space
        to be conditioned was set to maintain the temperature of the air
        in the space at about 71° F. while the thermostatic switch 24
        was set to start operation of the liquid heater 25 when the
        temperature of the air exiting the heat exchanger 12 dropped to
        about 100° F. and to stop operation of the liquid heater 25 when
        the temperature of the air exiting the heat exchanger 12 reached
        about 140° F. Typically, the operating cycle for the fan 15 was
        about 10-12 minutes with the liquid heater 25 being operated for
        about two cycles of 1-2 minutes each during each operating cycle
        of the fan.</p>

      <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The invention provides a new and useful liquid heater and a
        heating system utilizing the heater to provide liquid at higher
        temperatures than may normally be provided by the pertinent type
        of liquid heater. </p>
      <p>The liquid heater provided by the invention is disclosed in
        FIG. 1 and comprises a housing chamber defined by a cylindrical
        wall 2 and end walls 4, 6 through which there extends axially a
        shaft 8 on which there are mounted in spaced relation two
        cylindrical rotors 10, 12. Between the two rotors there are two
        parallel, axially spaced annular walls 22, 24 defining on either
        side the spaced rotor chambers 26, 28 and between them a
        compartment 30 within which there is mounted on the shaft a
        centrifugal type pump 32. The inner edges of the annular walls
        22, 24 define a central opening 34 providing communication
        between the two rotor chambers and the pump chamber. The rotor
        chambers have, respectively, inlet ports 36, 38 and the pump
        chamber has outlet port 40. Any suitable means may be provided
        for rotating the shaft, the rotors and the pump. </p>
      <p>The heating system provided by the invention utilizing the
        described double rotor and single pump liquid heating apparatus
        comprises a heat exchanger 50 comprising a screen and an
        elongated tubing through which liquid from the heater is passed,
        and which may be conventional in structure and operation or
        which may be modified as described and claimed in my co-pending
        application for U.S. patent Ser. No. 311,074 filed Oct. 13, 1981
        for Heating Device, now abandoned. In the system according to
        the present invention the port 40 of the pump chamber 30 is
        connected by tubing 52 to the inlet port 53 of the tubing which
        forms part of the heat exchanger, and the ports 36, 38 of the
        rotor chambers 26, 28 are connected, respectively, by tubes 54,
        56 to the fixed part 58 of a switching valve 60. A tube 62 leads
        from this valve to the outlet port 64 of the heat exchanger
        tubing, and the valve comprises a movable member 70 having two
        passages 72, 74 through it. Suitable means, such as that
        illustrated, may be provided for moving the valve part 70 to
        alternate positions, in one of which the outlet port 64 of the
        heat exchanger tubing is connected to rotor chamber 26 through
        tube 62, valve passage 72 and tube 54, and in the other of which
        the outlet port of the heat exchanger is connected to rotor
        chamber 28 through tube 62, valve passage 74 and tube 56. </p>
      <p>In the use and operation of the described system the shaft is
        rotated to rotate the two rotors and the pump and the switching
        valve is operated in the manner described to cause each of the
        rotor chambers to be alternately connected into the heating
        system while the other rotor chamber is disconnected from the
        remainder of the heating system. In this latter condition the
        liquid in the disconnected rotor chamber will be superheated
        because the rotor operates without release of the liquid in its
        chamber to the rest of the system. Upon further operation of the
        valve the closed rotor chamber will be connected into the system
        and will deliver superheated liquid to the heat exchanger. At
        the same time as this occurs, the other rotor chamber will be
        closed at the switching valve to cause superheated liquid to be
        produced within it which will be delivered to the heat exchanger
        when the valve is again shifted.</p>

      <p><b>Abstract --- </b>A heating system is provided in which a
        rotor is rotated within a body of liquid within a chamber to
        heat the liquid by friction, and the liquid is conveyed to a
        heat exchanger and then returned to the liquid heater. The rotor
        chamber of the liquid heater is surrounded by a jacket chamber
        to which cooled liquid passes from the heat exchanger and in
        which it is heated by convection from the rotor chamber and from
        which it passes to the rotor chamber. </p>
      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>A heating system which may be portable or installed, for
        example in a residence or other building, utilizes as the source
        of heat a liquid heater comprising a chamber filled with a
        liquid in which a body is rotated to create friction in the
        liquid, which is then supplied to a heat exchanger external to
        the liquid heater through a circulation system. Direct
        introduction of the cooled liquid from the heat exchanger causes
        a thermal impact on the liquid with reduction in efficiency of
        the system, and this thermal impact is reduced by supplying the
        cooled liquid from the heat exchanger to a jacket surrounding
        the liquid heater before introduction of the liquid into the
        heating chamber of the liquid heater. </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>While liquid heaters per ses of the described type have been
        described in many patents and in the literature, no heating
        system, whether protable or installed, utilizing such a liquid
        heater as the source of heat has been developed or used. Among
        the many reasons for this is the observed fact that the cooled
        liquid returned from the heat exchanger to the liquid heater
        produces a thermal impact on the liquid in the heater reducing
        the heating effect on the liquid within the heater and therefore
        the overall efficiency of the system. The object of the
        invention has therefore been to provide means for reducing the
        thermal impact and therefore increasing the efficiency of the
        system, and this is accomplished by the invention. </p>

      <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The preferred embodiment of the heating system provided by the
        invention comprises a liquid heating unit A, a heat exchanger B,
        and tubing C which provides a system for circulating heated
        liquid from the liquid heating unit to the heat exchanger, where
        it loses heat, and back to the liquid heating unit for
        re-heating. </p>
      <p>The basic liquid heating unit A comprises a housing 2 formed by
        a cylindrical wall 6 having a horixontal axis, and end walls 8,
        10. These walls bound a rotor chamber within which there is
        mounted a shaft 12 a rotor 14 having a cylindrical surface 16
        and, if desired, end walls 18, 20. The rotor surface is
        concentric with the cylindrical housing wall 6 and is spaced
        inwardly from it, leaving an annular space 22 within the housing
        and surrounding the rotor. </p>
      <p>The shaft 12 is rotatably mounted in the end walls of the
        housing and extends outside the rotor chamber through a sealed
        bearing 24 in end wall 10 into a pump chamber 30 where a
        centrifugal type pump 32 is mounted on the shaft. Means are
        provided for rotating the shaft, the rotor and the pump and may
        take the form of a pulley and belt 34 which are connected to be
        driven by a motor (not shown). </p>
      <p>The heat exchanger B is of conventional construction and
        comprises a screen through which a tube extends which, in
        accordance with known practice, is formed into a plurality of
        parallel sections connected by bends to provide a continuous
        conduit within the screen to which heated liquid is supplied
        from the liquid heater A and from which cooled liquid flows to
        the liquid heater. </p>
      <p>Means are provided by the invention for pre-heating the cooled
        liquid flowing from the heat exchanger before it is introduced
        into the rotor chamber of the liquid heater, and such means
        comprise, first, an annular jacket chamber 40 which surrounds
        the rotor chamber 22 and is bounded on the outside by a
        cylindrical outer wall 42 and internally by the annular wall 6
        of the rotor chamber. The radial width of the jacket chamber may
        be selected to provide a total volume of the system (rotor
        chamber, pump chamber, heat exchanger tubing and connecting
        tubing) adequate to produce sufficient liquid heated to a
        designed temperature to provide the BTUs required by the system.
      </p>
      <p>In accordance with the invention the parts of the system are
        interconnected to produce a flow of liquid to cause the desired
        pre-heating of the liquid output of the heat exchanger. To
        provide this flow the upper part of the jacket chamber is
        connected at 50 to the tube 52 which is connected to the outlet
        end of the tubing of the heat exchanger, while the lower part of
        the jacket chamber is connected at 54 to the inlet end of the
        heat exchanger tubing through tube 56, pump chamber 30 and tube
        58, which connects to the inlet of the heat exchanger tubing.
        The inlet and outlet connections 50, 54 between the jacket
        chamber and the heat exchanger are located at opposite axial
        ends of that chamber. </p>
      <p>Internally of the apparatus the lower part of the jacket
        chamber communicates with the lower part of the rotor chamber
        through port 60 which is below the inlet opening 50 to the
        jacket chamber, and the upper part of the rotor chamber
        communicates with the upper part of the jacket chamber through
        port 62 which is above the outlet port 54 of the jacket chamber.
      </p>
      <p>In the operation of the system cooled liquid flows from the
        heat exchanger through tube 52 and enters the jacket chamber 40
        at port 50. Within the jacket chamber it flows downwardly in
        oppositely directed streams, as shown at 70, 72 in FIG. 2, to
        the lower part of the jacket chamber where it enters the rotor
        chamber through port 60. Within the rotor chamber the liquid
        flows upwardly in oppositely directed streams 74, 76 and is
        mixed with heated liquid being produced in the rotor chamber.
        The mixed heated liquid passes from the rotor chamber to the
        jacket chamber through port 62 which is above jacket chamber
        outlet port 54. Within the jacket chamber the heated liquid
        moves in oppositely and downwardly directed streams 78, 80 to
        the outlet port 54, from which it passes through tube 56, pump
        chamber 30 and tube 58 to the inlet port of the heat exchanger
        tubing. </p>
      <p>The return flow of cooled liquid from the heat exchanger picks
        up heat in its passage through the jacket chamber by convection
        through the rotor chamber wall 6 and therefore enters the rotor
        chamber at a higher temperature than would be the case if the
        liquid stream flowing from the heat exchanger entered the rotor
        chamber directly, thus increasing the efficiency of the system.
      </p>
      <p>The provision of the jacket chamber or its equivalent also
        permits the total volume of the system to be increased, this
        often being desirable or necessary to accomodate the heating
        unit to a particular installation.</p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>A heating system, which may be portable or installed in a
        residential or other type of building, has as its source of heat
        a liquid heater in which a body is rotated within a closed
        chamber containing a liquid which, in turn, is supplied through
        tubing to a heat exchanger external to the source of heat, which
        is of the type in which heated fluid flows through a tube having
        a plurality of parallel linear sections connected by bends. The
        heated liquid is supplied by the source through a plurality of
        separate tubes leading to alternate bends of the heat exchanger
        tubing, and the other bends are connected through a plurality of
        other separate tubes to the inlet of the liquid heater, whereby
        heated liquid passes through only a part of the entire heat
        exchanger and thereby retains a greater part of its heat. </p>
      <p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </p>
      <p>The single FIGURE of the drawings is a view of the heating
        system provided by the invention. </p>

      </center>
      <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The preferred embodiment of the heating system provided by the
        invention is illustrated in the drawings and comprises a liquid
        heating unit A, a heat exchanger B, and tubing C, which provides
        a circulating system for carrying heated liquid from the liquid
        heating unit to the heat exchanger, where it loses heat, and
        back to the heating unit for re-heating. </p>
      <p>The liquid heating unit A comprises a housing 2 having an
        internal chamber which is bounded by cylindrical surface 4,
        having diameter d1 and end walls 6, 8. A partition 10 divides
        the chamber into a rotor chamber 12 and a pump chamber 14, and
        has a central opening 16 of diameter d2. A shaft 18 is rotatably
        mounted in the end walls and extends concentrically through the
        rotor chamber and the pump chamber and passes through the
        opening in the partition. Means are provided for rotating the
        shaft and may take the form of a pulley 20 carried by the shaft
        outside the housing and connected to be driven by a motor (not
        shown) and belt 22. The pump chamber has an outlet port 24 and
        the rotor chamber has an inlet port 26 to which are connected
        parts of the circulating tube system C. </p>
      <p>Within the rotor chamber there is mounted on shaft 18 a rotor
        body 30 having a cylindrical surface 32 of diameter d3 and end
        walls 34, 36. The rotor surface 32 is concentric with the
        cylindrical housing surface 4 and spaced inwardly from it by
        radial distance d4, leaving an annular space 38 within the
        housing and surrounding the rotor. The end walls 34, 36 of the
        rotor are parallel to, and spaced inwardly from, the housing end
        wall 6 and partition 10 and are spaced inwardly from them by
        distances d5 and d6, respectively. </p>
      <p>An impeller-type pump 40 is mounted on shaft 18 within the pump
        chamber and has radial hollow vanes 42 surrounding a central hub
        44 having an inlet recess 46 which faces the central opening in
        partition 10. </p>
      <p>The heat exchanger B is of conventional structure and comprises
        a screen 50 supporting a tube 52 which in accordance with known
        practice is formed into a plurality of parallel sections 54
        connected by bends 56 to provide in conventional practice, a
        continuous conduit within the screen for the passage of heated
        liquid. </p>
      <p>The invention provides means for reducing dissipation of heat
        from the liquid in the heat exchanger. In distinction to the
        conventional heat exchanger in which the liquid passes through
        the entire exchanger tubing all liquid delivered to the tubing
        of the heat exchanger in accordance with the invention passes
        through only a small part of the entire tubing of the exchanger,
        thereby reducing dissipation of heat from the liquid and
        returning the heated liquid to the heating unit at a higher
        temperature than if, as under conventional practice, the liquid
        passed through the entire tubing of the heat exhanger. </p>
      <p>The means for providing this result at the heat exchanger
        comprises a plurality of tubes 60 which branch outwardly from
        the tube 62 which connects the heat exchanger to the outlet
        passage 24 of the heating unit, and which are connected to
        alternate bends 56a of the complete heat exchanger tubing. In
        addition, the tube 64 which leads to the inlet passage 26 of the
        heating unit is connected through a plurality of branch tubes 66
        which are connected to the bends 66a of the heat exchange tubing
        between the bends 56a to which the inlet tubes are connected. </p>
      <p>Because of these connections of the inlet and outlet passages
        of the heater unit to the heat exchanger tubing heated liquid
        from the heater unit is within the heat exchanger for a shorter
        length of time than is the case in which the liquid passes
        through the entire heat exchanger tubing system, thereby
        returning to the heating unit liquid with a greater heat
        content. It will be understood that while, for the purpose of
        this description of the preferred embodiment of the invention,
        the inlet and outlet connections are made to alternate bends of
        the heat exchanger tubing the connections may be made to bends
        or parts of the tubing spaced more than alternately if it is
        desired to increase the heat loss by the liquid while in the
        heat exchanger. </p>
      <p>The incorporation into a heating system of the features of this
        invention results in the maintenance of a sufficiently high
        percentage of the heat content of the liquid to cause a
        "flywheel" effect which permits successful use of the liquid
        heater of the described type as the source of heat of a complete
        heating system.</p>

    <blockquote><b>Abstract --- </b>Liquid friction heating apparatus
      includes a pump rotor and an impeller rotor in a liquid reservoir.
      As the pump and impeller are rotated they impart frictional heat
      to the liquid. Further, the pump at all times delivers liquid to
      the inlet of the impeller which impells the liquid through
      restricted orifices to further heat the liquid. The pump
      positively prevents cavitation and ensures a constant flow through
      the orifices.
      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to apparatus for heating liquid and more
        particularly to apparatus for heating liquid by internal
        friction. </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>It is well known to heat liquid by internal friction either by
        rotating a body in a liquid reservoir as disclosed, for example,
        in my U.S. Pat. # 4,424,797 or by forcing liquid through
        restricted orifices as disclosed in the patent to Horne et al.
        U.S. Pat. # 4,344,567. Though rotating a body through liquid in
        a reservoir is effective to heat the liquid a problem of
        cavitation can arise where the rotor loses intimate contact with
        the liquid, and during such periods the heating process becomes
        highly inefficient. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The broad object of the invention is to vastly improve the
        efficiency of a friction heater for liquids by not only rotating
        a cylindrical heating rotor in the liquid, but also by
        constructing the rotor as a liquid impeller wherein a central
        cavity is provided in the rotor with fluid passages
        interconnecting the central cavity and the periphery of the
        rotor, the passages being so arranged relative to the rotational
        axis of the rotor that fluid is expelled with great centrifugal
        force through the passages, each passage having adjacent its
        outlet end a restricted orifice. As the liquid is expelled
        through the orifices, it is heated due to the frictional
        constriction of the liquid by the orifices. In addition, the
        liquid in the reservoir has a measure of heat imparted thereto
        by the frictional engagement of the liquid with all of the
        external surfaces of the rotor. To further increase the
        efficiency of the heater and in accordance with the invention I
        provide pump means which delivers pressurized liquid from the
        reservoir directly to the central cavity whereby cavitation in
        the cavity is entirely eliminated and liquid is forced through
        the restricted orifices not only by centrifugal force but also
        by the pressure on the liquid delivered by the pump to the
        cavity. Though any of a variety of pump means would fall within
        the purview of the invention, desirably the pump is a rotor
        generally similar to the described heating rotor but
        substantially reversed whereby as the pump rotor rotates it
        scoops liquid into the fluid passages, which are arranged
        relative to the axis of rotation that the liquid flows inwardly
        to a central cavity which is directly connected by conduit means
        to the central cavity of the heating rotor. The advantage of
        providing a rotary pump of the type described is that it, too,
        as it rotates imparts heat to the liquid wherever the latter is
        in frictional contact with the pump rotor. </p>

      <p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>Referring now to the drawings the numeral 10 designates an
        impeller constructed in accordance with the invention. The
        impeller 10 is disposed within a closed housing 12 defining a
        reservoir containing a suitable heat transfer liquid. The
        housing 12 has an outlet port 14 and an inlet port 15 connected
        to the inlet and outlet, respectively, of a suitable heat
        utilization device (not shown) such as a heat exchanger. </p>
      <p>The impeller 10 comprises a cylindrical rotor 16 having a
        peripheral surface 18 and a central inlet cavity 20. Fluid
        passages 22 lead from the inlet cavity to the peripheral surface
        18 of the rotor, the passages 22 being arranged relative to the
        axis of rotation of the rotor 16 that upon rotation thereof in a
        predetermined direction, as indicated by the arrow 24, liquid is
        impelled by centrifugal force to flow from the inlet cavity 20,
        through the passages 22 outwardly of the rotor. Restricted
        orifices 26 are provided in the fluid passages, preferably at
        their outer extremities where the velocity of the liquid is at a
        maximum, to cause the liquid to become heated as it is impelled
        through the orifices. The orifice 26 may be provided in inserts
        28 and if there is danger of erosion of the rotor, should it be
        of a light metal such as aluminum, there may be provided
        additional inserts at the inner ends of the passages 22 or, for
        that matter, throughout the lengths of the passages, any and all
        inserts being made of a substance, such as steel, having a
        predetermined hardness capable of resisting erosion. </p>
      <p>Means, such as the shaft 28 and drive pulley 30, are provided
        for rotating the impeller rotor 16 and, in accordance with the
        invention pump means, broadly designated by the numeral 30,
        delivers liquid from the housing 12 directly to the inlet cavity
        20 of the impeller rotor 16 at all times while the latter is
        rotated in the predetermined direction 24. As is
        apparent,thecavity 20 and the peripheral surface 18 are co-axial
        and a conduit 32 is co-axial with the inlet cavity 20, the pump
        means 30 being disposed to induce pressurized axial liquid flow
        through the conduit 32 into the cavity 20. </p>
      <p>As shown, the shaft 28 extends into the housing 12 in
        cantilever fashion with the inlet port 15 being axially aligned
        with the shaft. This is the arrangement of a prototype.
        Obviously, the shaft could extend to a bearing in the left hand
        wall of the housing 12 as viewed in FIG. 1 and the inlet port
        could be located elsewhere in that wall. Regardless, the pump
        means 30 is shown secured to the shaft 28 with the pump means
        having inlet means, hereafter described in detail, open to the
        liquid in the housing 12 and an outlet connected to the fluid
        conduit 32. </p>
      <p>The pump means 30 comprises a rotor 32 which may be
        substantially similar to the impeller rotor 16 though reversed.
        The pump rotor has a peripheral surface 34, a central outlet
        cavity 36 and fluid passages 37 leading from the peripheral
        surface to the outlet cavity and arranged relative to the axis
        of rotation of the rotor that upon rotation thereof in the same
        predetermined direction 24, fluid is forced to flow from the
        periphery of the rotor into the outlet cavity 36. In order to
        positively induce flow into the passages 37 the ends thereof are
        provided with suitable scoops 38 as seen in FIG. 2. The fluid
        conduit means 32 comprises a cylindrical member rigidly
        connected to the respective pump and impeller rotors 32, 16 for
        rotation therewith in axial alignment with the outlet and inlet
        cavities 36, 20. </p>
      <p>The operation of the apparatus should be clear from the
        foregoing description. The pump and impeller are driven in a
        closed system, and as the two rotors rotate, they heat liquid in
        frictional contact with their exposed surfaces. In addition, the
        pump delivers liquid under pressure to the inlet cavity of the
        impeller from which the liquid is impelled through the passages
        22 having restricted orifices 28 therein where the liquid is
        further heated. Due to the pumping action of the pump which
        positively delivers liquid under pressure to the inlet cavity of
        the impeller rotor 16, it is impossible for the inlet cavity to
        cavitate and thus liquid is at all times subjected to heating
        effects with substantially no loss in efficiency as can occur
        where a rotor is simply rotated in a body of liquid. The
        combined pumping action of the pump 30 and impeller 10 is highly
        adequate to ensure radial flow through the outlet port 14, and
        the device being served, such as a heat exchanger, and back to
        the inlet port 15. </p>
      <p>It will be apparent that the invention is susceptible of a
        variety of modifications and changes without, however departing
        from the scope and spirit of the appended claims.</p>

      <p>A problem associated with rotating a rotor in a bath of liquid
        is that there can be a cavitation problem wherein the liquid
        periodically separates at the interface between the rotor and
        liquid. Further, where the heated liquid must be transported to
        a heat utilization device, such as a heat exchanger separate
        pump means must usually be provided. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The object of the present invention is to provide an impeller
        comprising a rotor rotatable in a reservoir of liquid to heat
        the same through frictional shear of liquid at the interface
        between the rotor and the liquid. The rotor has a peripheral
        surface and a central outlet cavity which has an opening on one
        side of the rotor while its other side is closed. Fluid passages
        extend from the peripheral surface of the rotor to the outlet
        cavity and the passages are arranged relative to the axis of
        rotation of the rotor that upon rotation thereof in a
        predetermined direction liquid is forced to flow from the
        peripheral surface into the outlet cavity. Restricted orifices
        are positioned in the passages to cause the liquid flowing
        therethrough to be further heated. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention is to provide the combination
        of an impeller of the foregoing nature and a closed housing
        defining a liquid reservoir and in which the impeller is
        rotatably mounted, the housing having an inlet port in radial
        alignment with the impeller rotor and an outlet port in axial
        alignment with the opening in the side of the outlet cavity
        whereby the rotor, by its outer surface and the restricted
        orifices not only serves as a liquid heater but it also serves
        as a pump to circulate the heated liquid through the outlet port
        and a heat utilization device, such as a heat exchanger, and
        back to the inlet port. </p>

      <p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>Referring now to the drawings, the numeral 10 defines the
        impeller of the invention which is adapted to be disposed within
        a closed housing 12 defining a reservoir containing a heat
        transfer liquid. The impeller 10 comprises a rotor 14 having a
        peripheral surface 16 and a central outlet cavity 18 having an
        axial opening on one side while being closed on the other. Fluid
        passages 20 lead from the peripheral surface 16 of the rotor
        into the cavity 18, the passages 20 being arranged relative to
        the axis of rotation of the rotor that upon rotation thereof in
        a predetermined direction, as indicated by the arrow 22, liquid
        is forced to flow from the periphery of the rotor into the
        outlet cavity 18. Restricted orifices 24 are provided in each
        fluid passage proximate the outlet cavity 18 to cause liquid to
        be heated as it flows through the passages into the outlet
        cavity. </p>
      <p>Though it is within the purview of the invention for the
        passages to define various longitudinal paths for liquid flow,
        desirably the passages are straight, as shown, and equiangularly
        spaced about the axis of rotation of the rotor, the longitudinal
        axis of the respective passages sloping relative to the axis of
        rotation in the same direction as the predetermined direction of
        rotation as indicated by arrow 22. </p>
      <p>The entrances of the passages 20 at the peripheral surface 16
        of the rotor are provided with scoops 25 which extend beyond the
        peripheral surface 16 and face in the same direction as the
        predetermined direction of rotation. </p>
      <p>In its position of use the impeller 10 is mounted in the
        housing 12 on a shaft 26 which extends through a wall of the
        housing and may be driven in the predetermined direction 22 by
        any convenient power source represented generally by the pully
        28. The housing 12 has an inlet port 30 connected to the outlet
        of a heat utilization device 32, such as a heat exchanger, and
        leading into the housing in substantially radial alignment with
        the rotor. The housing 12 also has an outlet port 28 in
        substantial axial alignment with the outlet opening of the
        outlet cavity and leading to the inlet of the heat utilization
        device. </p>
      <p>Desirably the rotor body of the impeller is made of a
        light-weight substance such as aluminum or even plastic.
        However, such substances are subject to erosion as the rotor is
        driven at a high rate of rotational speed through the liquid. To
        counter this problem, the scoops 25 and the restricted orifices
        24 are formed on or in inserts 30, 32, respectively, having a
        hardness to resist such erosion. Means are provided, such as
        screw threads (not shown) or an interference fit for rigidly
        connecting the inserts to the rotor proximate the inlets and
        outlets, respectively, of the passages. </p>
      <p>In use, the described impeller of the invention has been found
        to heat the liquid to a high level in a short period of time
        with a high degree of efficiency and with no interruption in
        flow due to cavitation.</p>
