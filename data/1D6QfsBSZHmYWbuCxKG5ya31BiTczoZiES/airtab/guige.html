      <b>Airtabs</b> are small, efficient air flow streamliners that are
      the first practical solution for reducing drag at the back of
      large vehicles and the tractor/trailer gap. <br>
      <br>
      Airtabs are designed to work on trucks, trailers, straight trucks,
      cargo vans, RVs and Buses. Any big box going down the road at
      highway speeds. Drivers report dramatic handling improvements,
      better visibility behind in rain, fewer gear changes and less
      driver fatigue. <br>
      <br>
      Airtabs keep the rear of your vehicle clean because there is no
      longer a vacuum pulling in dirt and grime - your tail lights
      remain clear longer. <br>
      <br>
      Our customers are seeing fuel savings of between 2 to 4% annually.
      Airtabs meet vehicle width regulations. (4.76” long, by 3.25”
      wide, and stick out only 1") <br>
      <br>
      Airtabs are quick and easy to fit. 3 per lineal foot, down the
      sides and across the top at the back of the vehicle. Airtabs work
      in concert with existing air management kits. <br>
      <br>
      The Airtab shape has been tested in test track, wind tunnel and
      over-the-road evaluations.<br>
      <br>

      The Airtab shape is based on the National Advisory Committee on
      Aeronautics (NACA) submerged air inlet duct. (see Figure 1) The
      NACA Duct has been successfully used on aircraft fuselages and
      racing vehicles for decades. The impetus for the creation of the
      NACA duct came from the need to pull attached airflow into
      required spaces for various reasons (cooling, air conditioning,
      tank pressurization etc.) without using a high profile drag ram
      air scoop. Need for this innovative inlet duct became more urgent
      as aircraft and vehicle speeds increased.<br>

      <br>
      The Airtab adopted the same shape as a NACA Duct but is
      three-dimensional and protrudes into the airflow. Aeroserve
      Technologies modified and streamlined the shape to perform at its
      optimum within typical highway speeds ranges. Airtabs are all
      about free stream, near wake airflow modification and have nothing
      whatever to do with boundary layer modification, wing stall
      issues, road vehicle to aircraft wing size ratios or any other
      classical aerodynamic application of traditional vane style vortex
      generators used to enhance wing performance in the lower speed
      regimes. Airtabs™come from the aviation world, but they are
      neither used nor needed in that world. Modern aircraft fuselages
      are highly streamlined and travel far too fast for a protruding
      Airtab® to be of use...<br>

          <b>DRAG REDUCTION DEVICE FOR TRANSPORT VEHICLES</b><br>
        </div>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
        <div align="left"> Inventor: GUIGE JACQUES / DAVIDSON RON<br>
          <br>
          A drag reducing device for use on transport vehicles includes
          a delta wing having variable height and irregularly spaced
          undulations on an upper surface of each side of the wing. A
          length of each side of the delta wing is different than the
          length of the other wing side thereof.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          <b> </b><b>[0003] 1. Field of the Invention</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0004] The invention relates generally to the field of drag
          reducing devices used with transport vehicles. More
          particularly the invention relates to specialized shapes for
          such devices that have greater efficiency in drag reduction.<br>
          <br>
          <b>[0005] 2. Background Art</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          [0006] It is well understood in the art of physics of fluid
          flow control over surfaces that an adverse pressure gradient
          exists when low static and high static pressure regions
          interact. As a fluid boundary layer flows across a flow
          control surface there tends to be a blocking boundary formed
          which can block the flow and even reverse the motion of fluid
          flow locally. This may in turn separate the fluid with a
          resulting rise in drag. It is again well understood in the art
          that generating stream-wise vortices, generally using
          so-called vortex generators, can create conditions of mixing
          which may prevent a separation of the flow. There are many
          types of vortex generators primarily embodied as devices with
          vanes that protrude above the boundary layer, such as
          described by Stephens in U.S. Pat. No. 2,800,291. <br>
          <br>
          Limitations of the device described in the '291 patent include
          that the boundary is regulated with increased conditions of
          drag. Other approaches have been discussed in Kluethe, U.S.
          Pat. Nos. 3,578,264 and 3,741,285 primarily exhibiting
          internal boundary vortices when a fluid encounters and is made
          to flow over a concave surface; in effect forcing the boundary
          layer between adjacent wings to transfer a vortex into the
          boundary layer and cause mixing. The results of such devices
          while of academic merit have inefficiencies due to out of
          scale issues leading to excess drag.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] Wheeler, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,455,045 describes in detail
          that a strong vortex is formed along the leading edges of
          delta wings at high angles of attack. In the disclosed device
          in the '045 patent, submerged channels are molded to have a
          nominally triangular plan form shape permanently formed onto a
          flow surface. The channels as described in the '045 patent
          have sharp upper edges for effective vortex formation,
          divergent sidewalls essentially normal to the flow-control
          surface, and floor contours arranged to immediately conduct
          the stream-wise vortices below the level of the local flow
          control surface. Basically, the principles described in the
          '045 patent are that placing a series of submerged channels to
          be nested together in a properly overlapping manner creates a
          stream-wise cascade, thereby reducing the drag and at the same
          time controlling the boundary flow.<br>
          <br>
          [0008] There exists a need for improved drag reducing devices
          for use on long transport vehicles.<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>

          an upper surface of each side of the wing. A length of each
          side of the delta wing is different than the length of the
          other wing side thereof.<br>

          <b> </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          <b> </b>[0019] The present invention augments the
          effectiveness of vortex generator drag reducing devices known
          in the art by including a plurality of random sized, but
          critically varying vortices to be steadily generated
          downstream of the device. This function is performed by
          substituting the sharp, smooth, linear leading edges on delta
          wings or submerged channel wall edges as described in the
          Wheeler '045 patent referred to in the Background section
          herein with randomly undulating leading structural edge
          members having irregularly spaced, multi-wavelength in depth,
          cascading forms on the forward edge of a delta wing. The
          overall lengths of the leading edges may be different from
          each other, and in practice are elongated by several meters to
          allow for continuous stream-wise varying sized vortices to
          effectively be maintained even when in adverse changing
          pressure gradients such as observed under windy conditions.
          Using the delta wing edge design of the invention, drag is
          reduced under varying conditions of pressure such as observed
          when wind gusts occur across long, streamlined transport
          trucks and trains. With vortex generator drag reducing devices
          known in the art prior to the present invention, the resulting
          flow of air as moved by these prior art add on devices cannot
          fill the massive wake behind a moving linear vehicle body.
          This typically results in very minor benefits in terms of the
          energy saved when using such drag reduction vortex generating
          devices. In the present invention the randomized, undulating
          morphology of the delta wings and their individual uneven
          length, enable an order of magnitude increase in the linear
          lengths of the sides of the delta wings for certain
          applications. That is, a drag reduction device according to
          the invention may be made in sizes having wing lengths as
          large as the meter scale, whereas prior art drag reduction
          devices using the delta wing shape are generally limited to
          centimetre scale sizes. The increase in possible useful size
          of a drag reduction device according to the invention can
          substantially boost the movement of air flow, with more
          effective infilling of the wake with continuous regeneration
          of vortices as previously formed eddies dissipate. A drag
          reduction device according to the invention may provide
          effective drag reduction on larger transport vehicles than is
          possible using prior art configurations. As an example of a
          typical embodiment of the invention in larger sizes, drag
          reducing devices may be placed as a linear array of delta
          wings along the sides of a train roof and/or along the sides
          of a railroad car (FIGS. 5 and 6). As another example of an
          embodiment, smaller versions of the delta wings according to
          the invention may be used on the air deflector wing and/or on
          the sides of a tractor in a tractor trailer truck combination.<br>
          <br>
          [0020] The present invention provides a structure for a drag
          reducing device which augments the reduction of energy as
          would be required by such slender vehicles as trains and long
          transport trucks as they move air by providing a novel means
          of effectively redistributing flow in the areas of adverse
          pressure gradients as caused by air flow and windy conditions.
          The present invention results in measurable reduction of
          energy requirements which directly translate into reduced fuel
          consumption for very linear long and large moving platforms.
          In addition, as a result of placing the invention on the roofs
          of transport truck trailers, an increased level of control
          would be noted when travelling in high winds, greatly reducing
          the events of tipping.<br>
          <br>
          [0021] Referring to FIG. 1A, a first example of a drag
          reducing device according to the invention is shown in oblique
          view. The drag reducing device 10 is generally shaped as a
          delta wing or “wishbone’ having a first side 14 and a second
          side 16 with respect to a center of the drag reducing device
          10. A surface of the drag reducing device 10 may have a
          relatively high angle of attack with respect to the direction
          of motion of the vehicle to which the device 10 is placed on
          the roof thereof. An example angle of attack may be up to
          about sixty degrees. The leading edge of each side 14, 16
          includes randomly variable height, depth and spacing
          undulations 12. The length of each side 14, 16 may be
          different than the length of the other side 16, 14 of the drag
          reducing device 10.<br>
          <br>
          [0022] Another example of a drag reducing device according to
          the invention is shown in<br>
          <br>
          [0023] FIG. 1B. The example in FIG. 1B may include all the
          same features as the example shown in FIG. 1A, only with
          different values of the parameters described with reference to
          FIG. 1A. A possible result of making a drag reducing device as
          explained above is that the device 10 may generate random size
          and spacing, counter rotating vortices in the space behind the
          device 10.<br>
          <br>
          [0024] FIG. 2 shows a simulation of air flow across the
          surface of a prior art delta wing drag reduction device 10A.
          The air flow 40 can be observed generating a single, large
          vortex in the air flow behind the drag reduction device 40.
          Such vortex can result in decreased drag reduction, that is,
          increased drag.<br>
          <br>
          [0025] FIG. 3 shows a simulation of air flow across the
          surface of a delta wing drag reduction device according to the
          present invention. Air flow 42 over the drag reduction device
          10 can be observed as distinctly lacking the single, large
          vortex in the air flow behind the drag reduction device 10,
          rather, smaller, spaced apart counter rotating vortices are
          generated, further reducing resistance to air flow as
          contrasted with the device shown in FIG. 2. The foregoing
          simulations included capturing at the resultant fluid motion
          through simulated smoke lines over typical smooth edge (FIG.
          2) and randomized undulating edges (FIG. 3) computed by
          solving the Navier-Stokes equations at high definition.<br>
          <br>
          [0026] FIG. 2A shows a simulation of air flow over the surface
          of a drag reduction device 10 according to the invention.
          Micro eddies in the air flow can be observed above the upper
          surface of the drag reduction device 10. A direct comparison
          of the air flow over a prior art drag reduction device 10A and
          a drag reduction device according to the invention is shown in
          FIG. 3A. It can be observed in the figure that the air flow
          over the prior art drag reduction device 10A lacks the micro
          eddies of the air flow over the drag reduction device 10 of
          the invention.<br>
          <br>
          [0027] FIG. 4 shows an example installation of drag reducing
          devices 10 on an air deflector wing 20 and the side 22 of a
          tractor 30 of a tractor trailer combination truck. Similar
          mounting may be used in other types of transport vehicles.<br>
          <br>
          [0028] FIGS. 5 and 6 show, respectively, line arrays as
          described above, of drag reduction devices 10 according to the
          invention disposed on the top (FIG. 5) and one side (FIG. 6)
          of a railroad car 40. The railroad car 40 can be any or all
          cars in a train including the locomotive(s). The side view in
          FIG. 6 is applicable to both sides of any railroad car 40.
          Direction of motion of the railroad car 40 is indicated by the
          arrow at the bottom of FIG. 6.<br>
          <br>
          [0029] A drag reduction device according to the invention may
          reduce air flow caused drag on transport vehicles, resulting
          in improved efficiency of operation and reduced fuel
          consumption.<br>
