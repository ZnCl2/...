      <br>
      with respect..<br>
      <br>
      A few pertinent questions with answers from the data sets:<br>
      <br>
      will schools just shut down to prevent the spread?<br>
      <br>
      Yes, sporadically, and AFTER the schools are [emptied by parents].<br>
      <br>
      will parents just keep their kids home and hence the school's in
      essence shut down ?<br>
      <br>
      Yes and data shows that this action causes all kinds of social
      discord and disruption. Markets, as well as JustInTime delivery
      system for goods is impacted by parents holding children back from
      schools. As this gets more pronounced in [winter/northern
      hemisphere] there are [fuel shortages] and [electrical shut downs]
      as well as [bitter cold weather] that also affect the situation.
      Data does show that [ebola transmission (paths)] are [disrupted]
      by the [parental freak out].<br>
      <br>
      do the schools (state officials and locals) use propaganda to keep
      everyone in place?<br>
      <br>
      Data indicates that [officialdom] tries the [we've got your safety
      assured] approach and that it does not even last a [week]. Actual
      fist fights breaking out at [news conferences] over [reassurances]
      that are [disputed].<br>
      <br>
      how early (or late) in the fall/winter do you see a shutdown
      occurring ?<br>
      <br>
      Data shows [multiple isolation events] that involve [schools] by
      [October 20, 2014].<br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      could there be a federal shutdown???<br>
      <br>
      Yes, but due to [abandonment] and [employees self isolating]
      rather than by any acts of [officialdom] (until later when
      officialdom acknowledges the reality of the situation).<br>
      <br>
      These sets are cross linked over to the [desolation] of the
      [hospitals] and the [health care system] by the disease, and the
      [abandonment] of the [emergency room protocol] by [officialdom] as
      a [necessary response] to the [rising infection rates].
      Linguistics say this will come to be known as the [die-in-place
      Executive Order]. These data sets are also cross linked to both
      the [flight from fear] (freeways crammed as people flee the
      [intense outbreaks]), as well as the [no travel (restrictions on
      movement) 'orders'] by [officialdom] which are [ignored] and lead
      to [law enforcement desertions]. <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Current trends information:<br>
      terra context updates:<br>
      <br>
      Headlines can be misleading. Earth's gravity has changed, but not
      due to ice melts, rather due to the expansion of the earth. Data
      is data, and interpretation is not. Sometimes the twain don't
      meet. Antarctic ice melt. (10/5/2014)<br>
      <br>
      markets context updates:<br>
      Ack!<br>
      <br>
      Data shows [tension] across [conus (AK feels safe)] by January due
      to [ebola fears]. Data also shows [decline] and [praying] are the
      dominant memes across Markets entity through October. Now we
      (probably) know what the [2/two black mondays] are about....ebola
      and ebola fears. (10/3/2014)<br>
      <br>
      ST data shows transglobal transport shutdown by March due to
      [ebola fears]. Data shows that [business (globally)] come to
      [face] a [situation] at once both [troublesome] and [ludicrous].
      Further details point to [absurd regulations] that [stitch up] the
      [business man/woman] and yet, are [full of holes]. (10/3/2014)<br>
      <br>
      IM data shows the [markets] reach a state of [splintering] and
      [peeling] by March 2015. The [splintering] is supported by
      [currencies] and [transcontinental trade]. The [peeling] set has
      details going to the idea that [financial centers] are [peeled
      away (by circumstances)] (fail), until only the [bare core]
      remains, again, by Spring, 2015. (10/3/2014)<br>
      <br>
      IM data shows Bitcoin to be [rising] against [all currencies] in
      [mid october] as the [currency crash] and [no contact (payments
      (ebola fears))] memes become more visible. (10/8/2014)<br>
      <br>
      IM data shows [infrastructure impacts] from [ebolafears] as
      [teachers/staff] are [abandoning schools/jobs] by [october 20,
      2014] leading to [schools shuttered], and [parents freaking and
      agitated (beyond reason)]. Along with [churches], and [college
      sports events], the [schools] and [bus lines] will be the first
      [standing infrastructure] to be [affected by ebolafears].
      (10/8/2014)<br>
      <br>
      IM data showing that a [gold delivery (of size)] is [cancelled] in
      [November 2014] due to [ebola fears] having [stopped workers] and
      the [local area] being under a [travel restriction]. This is in a
      large [city (in the north east)]. The data describes very [empty
      street] and [confrontations] between [few police] and [crowds/mobs
      (partying/looting (in masks))]. (10/8/2014)<br>
      <br>
      IM data shows [governments] will be [activating military] to
      [patrol streets] in [ebola towns], but that [desertion] will
      [deplete readiness ratios] and [commanders] will be [told 'not
      possible'] by [subordinates] in meetings that will be [leaked] to
      the [social media]. Large changes in [collective social behavior]
      in [ebola towns] will be [visible] by [January 2015]. Data shows
      [weeping appeals] for [participation] from [frustrated
      [politicians]. (10/8/2014)<br>
      <br>
      IM data shows [worst ever 'season'] for [real estate sales]. Not
      only [economy/financial woes], but soon [ebola fears] to [cancel
      'open houses'] as well as [close real estate offices] when [2/two
      sales people (from same firm)] are [quarantined due to ebola
      fears]. Major [impact] on [west coast USA], [british columbia,
      CA], and [london,UK] as [ebola fears] escalate due to [symptomatic
      house hunting]. (10/8/2014)<br>

      Winter [sales] of [home exercise equipment] indicated by ST data
      to [rise] as [self-isolation] develops amid the [new social

      set about [cleaning up Africa (of communicable diseases)]. This
      [continental clean up] effort is described as starting in [March

      <p>What about EU fleets (air)? IM data shows that the global air
        fleets are hugely impacted by mid November. The LT data has us
        still working on problems with air travel (more than ebola)
        through 2018. </p>
      <p>EU air fleets will encounter a [storm] of [conflicting
        regulations] that are described as producing [chaos] at
        airports. The [chaos] sub set has data details about [planes]
        being [impounded] by [local officialdom]. Part of the data sets
        show at least [3/three] instances in EU where [planes] are [left
        on runways with CORPSES] in them. In one instance, the [plane]
        is [broken into] by [unknown parties] in an [attempt
        (successful)] to [retreive something (unknown)] that is [very
        valuable]. That instance is described as [causing (the runway) ]
        to be [flamed]. </p>
      <p>Further data sets show that [ships] of all kinds will be
        [seized]. These [seizures] will include [military], and [cruise]
        ships as well as [cargo transport vessels]. Additional data
        points to [several (very large) cruise ships] being [detained
        (for over 2 months)] as the [passengers] are [disease checked].
        This causes serious [health problems] for the whole port as
        [food supplies] become [strained] and [passengers riot] and
        [passengers (attempt)] to [jump ship]. There are some smaller
        sets (still growing) about [officialdom] in [southern Europe
        (italy?)] who will [order shootings] at [swimming passengers]. </p>
      <p>The data sets also show that a large cruise ship will be
        [docking] in a [southern USA port] where the [passengers] will
        be informed that they have been [exposed (positive tests on
        worker?)] and will have to be [quarantined in place]. This ends
        up being a horror as the [incarceration] has [food poisoning],
        and [rampaging dysentary], and [flu] and other [health issues]
        and [no doctors] willing to [risk] going there. Further, a
        number of [deaths] on the ship are put down to [ebola] rightly
        or wrongly, and a [panic] ensues (in early days) that leads to
        [fights] and [battles] with [shore side police cordon]. </p>
      <p>Other data sets go to the idea of a [shit embargo] wherein
        [ports (air and ships)] will [refuse] to have [potentially
        contaminated waste] off-loaded in their facilities. As may be
        expected, not a good policy. </p>
      <p>USA military bases globally will be [panic stricken] as their
        [funding] and [supplies] are [cut off] due to [chaos] in
        [pentagon/WA DC] as [gov't employees] are [curtailed] or
        [quarantined]. Further, many of the European bases will be
        [embargoed] by their local 'host' countries due to [ebola
        victims] being [resident] at facilities on base. This further
        aggravates a bad situation over early 2015. </p>
      <p>Expect the [churches] to be [impacted] by the end of October.
        [Revenues] fall with [nearly zero attendance]. Also [colleges]
        and [universities] will begin to [experience] the [ebola Rush]
        by mid November as [ebola] goes to [college]. </p>
      <p>Sports [games] at all levels [collapse] in [attendance] by [mid

          on tree that only grows in Far North Queensland</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>by Jessica van Vonderen</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      8 Oct 2014<br>
      <br>
      Scientists have been surprised by the rapid cancer-fighting
      properties of a berry found only in Far North Queensland.<br>
      <br>
      An eight-year study led by Dr Glen Boyle, from the QIMR Berghofer
      medical research institute in Brisbane, found a compound in the
      berry could kill head and neck tumours as well as melanomas.<br>
      <br>
      An experimental drug derived from the berry, EBC-46, has so far
      been used on 300 animals, including cats, dogs and horses.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Boyle said in 75 per cent of cases, the tumour disappeared and
      had not come back.<br>
      <br>
      "There's a compound in the seed - it's a very, very complicated
      process to purify this compound and why it's there in the first
      place, we don't know," he said.<br>
      <br>
      "The compound works by three ways essentially: it kills the tumour
      cells directly, it cuts off the blood supply and it also activates
      the body's own immune system to clean up the mess that's left
      behind."<br>
      <br>
      There were no side effects, but what amazed scientists most was
      how fast it worked: the drug took effect within five minutes and
      tumours disappeared within days.<br>

      <br>
      "The surprising thing for us and the thing that we don't see very
      often is the speed with which this occurs," Dr Boyle said.<br>
      <br>
      "Usually when you treat a tumour it takes several weeks for it to
      resolve, but this is very, very rapid.<br>
      <br>
      "There's a purpling of the area, of the tumour itself, and you see
      that within five minutes and you come back the next day and the
      tumour's black and you come back a few days later and the tumour's
      fallen off."<br>
      <br>
      The berry grows on the blushwood tree, which only grows in pockets
      of Far North Queensland.<br>
      <br>
      "The tree is very, very picky on where it will grow," Dr Boyle
      said.<br>
      <br>
      "It's only on the Atherton Tablelands at the moment and they're
      trying to expand that to different places of course because it'd
      be nice to be able to grow it on a farm somewhere.<br>

      <br>
      Dr Boyle said the findings of the pre-clinical trials suggested
      the drug could be effective in human patients.<br>
      <br>
      But Dr Boyle warned the drug could only be used for tumours that
      can be accessed by direct injection and was not effective against
      metastatic cancers.<br>
      <br>
      He said it would be an additional treatment option, rather than a
      replacement for chemotherapy or surgery.<br>
      <br>
      "Elderly patients for example who just can't go through another
      round of chemo or can't go through another general anaesthetic for
      example, this could be used to treat those sorts of tumours and
      hopefully improve quality of life for people," he said.<br>

          per cent of cases uncovered by Melbourne researchers</b><br>

      </div>
      <br>
      1 Oct 2014<br>
      <br>
      Australian scientists have discovered a set of drugs that stop the
      growth of bowel cancers in about 80 to 90 per cent of cases.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Toby Phesse, from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of
      Medical Research in Melbourne, said new forms of treatment for
      this type of cancer are in high demand.<br>
      <br>
      "About 4,000 people are going to die of [bowel] cancer every year
      in Australia, and so we're really crying out for new therapies to
      try and target this disease," Dr Phesse said.<br>
      <br>
      "And our lab is specifically looking for targeted strategies to
      try and work out which signalling pathways or which genes could be
      targeted to try and prevent this cancer."<br>
      <br>
      Dr Phesse said the team of researchers found a particular kind of
      drug called JAK inhibitors that can be used to target colon
      cancers.<br>
      <br>
      "This particular pathway is regulated in many types of cancer,
      including colon cancer, and we found that 80 per cent of colon
      cancers have got a certain mutation in the weak pathway," he said.<br>
      <br>
      "However, this pathway is also required for the normal cells of
      the intestine and so if you try and target that pathway directly,
      you pose a severe threat of actually affecting the normal cells of
      the intestine.<br>
      <br>
      "So we wanted to try a different strategy and try and target a
      parallel pathway and that is what brought us to the JAK pathway.<br>
      <br>
      "And we found that with the JAK inhibitors these tumours, 80 per
      cent of them, they were exquisitely sensitive to JAK inhibitors."<br>
      <br>
      We just have to bring the story out now that these drugs actually
      can be used in colon cancer.<br>
      <br>
      The drugs work in two ways: by stopping cell growth and, in
      pre-chemical models, preventing the development of new tumours.<br>
      <br>
      "So this will be important for people who have got a familial
      condition in which they develop multiple intestinal tumours," Dr
      Phesse said.<br>
      <br>
      "It's very exciting and it really opens the window now to use
      these drugs."<br>
      <br>
      With JAK inhibitors already approved for use in other diseases, Dr
      Phesse expects the up-take of this new bowel cancer treatment to
      be quick.<br>
      <br>
      "The great thing is that they are already existing in the clinic
      and they're being used to treat disorders such as psoriasis,
      arthritis, minor fibrosis," he said.<br>
      <br>
      "So we don't have to spend the many years and the resources ... to
      develop a new drug.<br>
      <br>
      "They're there in the clinic and we just have to bring the story
      out now that these drugs actually can be used in colon cancer."<br>

      painting titled "Jacob's Dream" from the Renaissance<br>
      <br>
      Roger Ekrich noticed many old books, including Chaucer's "The
      Canterbury Tales", referenced two periods of sleep being the norm
      in their era.<br>
      <br>
      Via Dreamland: Adventures in the Strange Science of Sleep:<br>
      <br>
      ...Ekirch somehow rediscovered a fact of life that was once as
      common as eating breakfast. Every night, people fell asleep not
      long after the sun went down and stayed that way until sometime
      after midnight. This was the first sleep that kept popping up in
      the old tales. Once a person woke up, he or she would stay that
      way for an hour or so before going back to sleep until morning—the
      so-called second sleep. The time between the two bouts of sleep
      was a natural and expected part of the night and, depending on
      your needs, was spent praying, reading, contemplating your dreams,
      urinating, or having sex. The last one was perhaps the most
      popular.<br>
      <br>
      So researchers did a study. When subjects had no exposure to
      artifical light they reverted to this 2 stage type of sleeping:<br>
      <br>
      Soon, the subjects began to stir a little after midnight, lie
      awake in bed for an hour or so, and then fall back asleep again.
      It was the same sort of segmented sleep that Ekirch found in the
      historical records. While sequestered from artificial light,
      subjects were shedding the sleep habits they had formed over a
      lifetime.<br>
      <br>
      Was this fragmented sleep bad? Far from it. Bloodwork showed that
      the time between the two sleeping periods was incredibly relaxing
      and blissful:<br>
      <br>
      The results showed that the hour humans once spent awake in the
      middle of the night was probably the most relaxing block of time
      in their lives. Chemically, the body was in a state equivalent to
      what you might feel after spending a day at a spa... Numerous
      other studies have shown that splitting sleep into two roughly
      equal halves is something that our bodies will do if we give them
      a chance. In places of the world where there isn’t artificial
      light— and all the things that go with it, like computers, movies,
      and bad reality TV shows— people still sleep this way.<br>
      <br>
      So why don't we sleep like this? Lightbulbs.<br>
      <br>
      Electric light at night disrupts your circadian clock, the name
      given to the natural rhythms that the human body developed over
      time. When you see enough bright light at night, your brain
      interprets this as sunlight because it doesn’t know any better...
      your body reacts to bright light the same way it does to sunshine,
      sending out signals to try to keep itself awake and delay the
      nightly maintenance of cleanup and rebuilding of cells that it
      does while you are asleep. Too much artificial light can stop the
      body from releasing melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate
      sleep.<br>
      <br>
      And as I've posted before, all this artificial light may be
      responsible for some of our more modern health issues:<br>
      <br>
      Circadian rhythms—which you will learn much more about in a later
      chapter—are thought to control as many as 15 percent of our genes.
      When those genes don’t function as they should because of the
      by-products of artificial light, the effects are a rogue’s gallery
      of health disorders. Studies have linked depression,
      cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and even cancer to
      overexposure to light at night. Researchers know this, in part,
      from studying nurses who have spent years working the graveyard
      shift. One study of 120,000 nurses found that those who worked
      night shifts were the most likely to develop breast cancer.<br>

            made you do it)</b></big><br>
        <br>

      <br>
      The vast majority of people think we have free will and are the
      authors of our own life stories. But if neuroscientists were one
      day able to predict our every action based on brain scans, would
      people abandon this belief in droves? A new study concludes that
      such knowledge would not by itself be enough to shake our
      confidence in our own volition.<br>
      <br>
      Many neuroscientists, such as the late Francis Crick, have argued
      that our sense of free will is no more than the behaviour of a
      vast assembly of nerve cells. This is tied to the idea of
      determinism, which has it that every effect is preceded by a
      cause, with cause and effect connected by physical laws. This is
      why the behaviour of physical systems can be predicted – even the
      brain, in principle.<br>
      <br>
      As author Sam Harris puts it: "If determinism is true, the future
      is set – and this includes all our future states of mind and our
      subsequent behaviour."<br>
      <br>
      If people lost their belief in their own free will, that would
      have important consequences for how we think about moral
      responsibility, and even how we behave. For example, numerous
      studies have shown that when people are led to reject free will
      they are more likely to cheat, and are also less bothered about
      punishing other wrongdoers.<br>
      All an illusion?<br>
      <br>
      For those who argue that what we know about neuroscience is
      incompatible with free will, predicting what our brain is about to
      do should reveal the illusory nature of free will, and lead people
      to reject it. Experimental philosopher Eddy Nahmias at Georgia
      State University in Atlanta dubs this view "willusionism". He
      recently set out to test it.<br>
      <br>
      Nahmias and colleagues borrowed an idea from Harris, and gave 278
      people a story describing a future neuroimaging technology that
      allows perfect prediction of decisions based on a person's neural
      activity, recorded in a special skull cap. In this future world, a
      woman called Jill is fitted with a skull cap for a month, which
      allows scientists to predict everything she'll decide and do with
      100 per cent accuracy, including how she'll vote in upcoming
      elections. To some, the fact that Jill is totally predictable –
      like the trajectory of balls bouncing around a pool table – is
      clearly incompatible with her having free will in the first place.<br>
      <br>
      The team found that 92 per cent of participants said that Jill
      voted of her own free will, contrary to the expectation of the
      willusionists.<br>
      Mind control<br>
      <br>
      In another version of story, the scientists didn't merely predict
      which way Jill would vote – they also manipulated her choice via
      the skull cap. With that scenario, most participants said that
      Jill did not vote of her own free will.<br>
      <br>
      To find out why prediction didn't impact beliefs about free will
      but manipulation did, the researchers posed a series of questions
      about why Jill behaved as she did in the different scenarios, and
      whether she remained responsible for her behaviour.<br>
      <br>
      They found that even when Jill's behaviour could be predicted,
      people still thought she acted on her own reasons, and remained
      responsible for them. When she was manipulated, she acted on
      someone else's reasons and the responsibility was no longer her
      own.<br>
      <br>
      For Nahmias, this suggests that, when it comes to free will,
      people are "theory-lite", which renders the fact that our
      behaviour is generated by the brain, whose actions can predicted
      like the weather, largely irrelevant. "People don't have detailed
      metaphysical views about what underlies free will," says Nahmias.
      "What people care about is that their own conscious reasoning
      makes a difference to their behaviour – and nothing in
      neuroscience suggests it doesn't."<br>
      <br>
      "This paper breaks new ground," says Joshua Knobe, a philosopher
      at Yale University who has also studied people's thinking about
      free will. Knobe says there's a widespread concern that the more
      we learn about the brain and the roots of behaviour, the less room
      there is for free will and moral responsibility. "But this study
      suggests that whatever it is that we find threatening to free
      will, it isn't neuroscience."<br>

      In electronics, changing the path of electrons and manipulating
      how they flow is as easy as applying a magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      Not so for light. "We don't have such a thing for light," said
      Michal Lipson, professor of electrical and computer engineering.
      "For the majority of materials, there is no such thing as
      something I can turn on, and apply this magic field to change the
      path of light."<br>
      <br>
      Until now. Lipson, a leader in the emerging field of silicon
      photonics – sending light through waveguides instead of currents
      through wires – and colleagues have shown that an equivalent field
      for light does exist. Experiments led by graduate student Lawrence
      Tzuang, in collaboration with Paulo Nussenzveig of University of
      Sao Paulo and Kejie Fang and Shanhui Fan from Stanford University,
      are described in a recent issue of Nature Photonics.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="defyingphysi.jpg"
          height="223" width="460"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      This effective magnetic field has to do with the light's phase,
      which is a measure of a particular point in a light wave's cycle,
      quantified as an angle in degrees.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers demonstrated the existence of this field with an
      experimental interferometer, a micron-scale device with two
      modulators that send light waves back and forth between them.<br>
      <br>
      When a light wave travels under normal conditions, its phase is
      proportional to how far it traveled, but it is unaffected by what
      path it has taken. Just like a magnetic field causes a current to
      switch direction, the researchers showed that by modulating the
      light with their device, they could make the phase of the light
      change not only as a function of distance traveled, but also by
      the shape of its path.<br>
      <br>
      An array of such modulators would be powerful enough to create a
      field for light that is equivalent to the magnetic field for
      electrons; phases of light could be controlled arbitrarily by each
      of the modulators. This means that the phase of transmitted light
      could depend on the path it has taken from point A to point B,
      Lipson explained.<br>
      <br>
      "That puts us very close to what electrons do in a magnetic field;
      they experience exactly that in a magnetic field: The phase
      accumulated in their trajectory depends on the exact path they
      have taken," Lipson added.<br>
      <br>
      Lipson and colleagues dream of controlling light at the smallest
      scales and in the most fundamental ways, using optics instead of
      wires on circuits to revolutionize electronics. Reaching this goal
      depends on the ability to propagate and control light in
      nontraditional ways, of which the Nature Photonics work is an
      example.<br>
      <br>
      "One could in principle make fabrics of similar devices that would
      imprint phase and control the path of light in ways you couldn't
      conceive before," Lipson said.<br>

      COLUMBIA, Mo. – From cell phones to cars and flashlights,
      batteries play an important role in everyday life. Scientists and
      technology companies constantly are seeking ways to improve
      battery life and efficiency. Now, for the first time using a
      water-based solution, researchers at the University of Missouri
      have created a long-lasting and more efficient nuclear battery
      that could be used for many applications such as a reliable energy
      source in automobiles and also in complicated applications such as
      space flight.<br>
      <br>
      “Betavoltaics, a battery technology that generates power from
      radiation, has been studied as an energy source since the 1950s,”
      said Jae W. Kwon, an associate professor of electrical and
      computer engineering and nuclear engineering in the College of
      Engineering at MU. “Controlled nuclear technologies are not
      inherently dangerous. We already have many commercial uses of
      nuclear technologies in our lives including fire detectors in
      bedrooms and emergency exit signs in buildings.”<br>
      <br>
      The battery uses a radioactive isotope called strontium-90 that
      boosts electrochemcial energy in a water-based solution. A
      nanostructured titanium dioxide electrode (the common element
      found in sunscreens and UV blockers) with a platinum coating
      collects and effectively converts energy into electrons.<br>
      <br>
      “Water acts as a buffer and surface plasmons created in the device
      turned out to be very useful in increasing its efficiency,” Kwon
      said. “The ionic solution is not easily frozen at very low
      temperatures and could work in a wide variety of applications
      including car batteries and, if packaged properly, perhaps
      spacecraft.”<br>
      <br>
      The research, “Plasmon-assisted radiolytic energy conversion in
      aqueous solutions,” was conducted by Kwon’s research group at MU,
      and was published in Nature.<br>

      The field of conventional energy conversion using radioisotopes
      has almost exclusively focused on solid-state materials. Herein,
      we demonstrate that liquids can be an excellent media for
      effective energy conversion from radioisotopes. We also show that
      free radicals in liquid, which are continuously generated by beta
      radiation, can be utilized for electrical energy generation. Under
      beta radiation, surface plasmon obtained by the metallic
      nanoporous structures on TiO2 enhanced the radiolytic conversion
      via the efficient energy transfer between plasmons and free
      radicals. This work introduces a new route for the development of
      next-generation power sources.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Particles emitted from radioisotopes can be used to convert the
      radiant energy into electricity. Radioisotope energy conversion
      for power generation has been intensively studied to develop power
      sources for wide range of applications, from energizing cardiac
      pacemakers in human body1 to challenging outer planet missions2.
      As compared to various indirect conversion methods, which collect
      electricity from the secondary energy forms of heat or light
      generated by radiation3, 4, direct conversion methods produce
      electric power straight from energetic particles5, 6. Beta
      particles can produce electron-hole pairs in semiconductors via
      their loss of kinetic energy and can contribute to the generation
      of electric power6. Although potential applicability of
      radioisotopes in portable power sources that do not require
      recharging seems very attractive7, it has been reported that only
      a small portion of the entire radiation energy can be converted
      into electrical energy5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Moreover, most
      betavoltaic cells suffer from serious radiation damage to the
      lattice structures of semiconductors and subsequent performance
      degradation due to the high kinetic energy of the beta
      particles11. Alternatively, to minimise lattice damage in
      semiconductors, wide band gap materials are typically used.
      However, radiation-resistive materials, such as SiC and GaN, still
      show very low energy conversion efficiencies12, 13. Little
      improvement has been made even after vigorous research on various
      improvement methods utilizing porous structures14, inverted
      pyramidal cavities15, and three dimensional silicon pillar
      structures15 to increase rectifying junction areas. Although, thus
      far, there is no method for completely avoiding radiation damage
      to semiconductors, the use of a liquid-phase semiconductor
      material has been introduced as a possible means to overcome the
      radiation damage and structural defect problem16. One major
      benefit of utilising a liquid-phase material is the well-known
      ability to efficiently absorb the kinetic energy of beta
      particles17.<br>
      <br>
      Since the advent of nuclear power, liquids have been intensively
      studied for use as a radiation-shielding material. Large amounts
      of radiation energy can be absorbed by water. When radiation
      energy is absorbed by an aqueous solution, free radicals (e.g.,
      eaq-, ·OH, H·, HO2·) can be produced through radiolytic
      interactions18, 19, 20. These free radicals are known to affect
      the generation of molecular by-products, such as H2O2 and H221,
      22, 23, 24. However, counterintuitively, the generation of
      electricity from a solution containing an ample amount of absorbed
      radiation energy has not yet been vigorously studied. Here, we
      demonstrate a new method for the generation of electricity using a
      device that separates the radiolytic current from the free
      radicals by splitting the water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Design and operating principle of Pt/nanoporous TiO2 radiolytic
        cell</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Our water splitter is composed of a nanoporous semiconductor
      coated with a thin Pt film to produce a specially designed
      metal-semiconductor junction (Fig. 1a). As a suitable
      semiconductor material for water decomposition, we used a very
      stable and common large band gap oxide material, TiO2, because the
      use of large band gap oxide materials as a semiconducting catalyst
      can improve the radiolysis yield25, 26, 27. Nanoporous TiO2 was
      formed by anodising and subsequently thermally oxidising a thin Ti
      film. The large surface area of the porous structure can provide
      more chemical reaction sites than a planar surface. To form a
      stable Schottky contact at the semiconductor/metal interface, a
      thin Pt film was uniformly deposited using a radio frequency (RF)
      sputtering system. As shown in the band diagram of the junctions
      in Fig. 1b, a Schottky barrier of 0.45 eV is formed because the
      Fermi energy (EF) of TiO2, an n-type semiconducting oxide, is 5.2
      eV28, 29 while that of Pt is 5.65 eV30 with respect to the vacuum
      level. To experimentally confirm the Schottky barrier height
      between Pt and TiO2, we performed XPS analysis and measured the
      Schottky barrier height of 0.6 eV between Pt and Pt/TiO2 layers.
      When high-energy beta radiation passes through Pt and nanoporous
      TiO2, electron-hole pairs are produced inside the nanoporous TiO2.
      In particular, the holes generated in TiO2 move toward the
      Pt/liquid interface and then react with redox couples of water
      molecules, while the electrons are transported through the
      nanoporous TiO2 to the other electric contact due to the built-in
      potential at the Pt/electrolyte interface. In general, TiO2 is
      resistant to corrosion, but the additional layer of Pt can further
      protect the TiO2 layer under the harsh conditions of high pH
      values that are needed for water splitting. In addition, the
      porosity of the TiO2 leads to myriad nanoholes in the Pt film,
      which create localised surface plasmons that act as harmonic
      oscillators in response to an oscillating external electric field.
      Since the first report31 of the generation of surface plasmons on
      rough metal surfaces by electron illumination in 1977, many
      studies have examined various metal structures32, 33, 34, 35.
      Surface plasmons excited on the Pt surface can produce
      electron–hole pairs, with the excited electrons transiently
      occupying normally empty states in the Pt conduction band above
      the Fermi energy level. Most of the excited electrons are
      sufficiently energetic to enter the conduction band of TiO2.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast to photocatalytic cells, high-energy beta radiation in
      our device can produce free radicals in water through the loss of
      kinetic energy. In a meta-stable state, the free radicals are
      recombined into water molecules or trapped in water molecules36,
      37, 38. Thus, the free radicals produced by the radiation can be
      converted into electricity by a plasmon-assisted, wide band gap
      oxide semiconducting material using a water splitting technique at
      room temperature.<br>
      Structural properties of radiolytic electrode<br>
      <br>
      Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and X-ray diffraction
      (XRD) data for the nanoporous TiO2 are shown in Fig. 2. The
      cross-sectional SEM image shows the existence of nanopores 100 nm
      in diameter and 1 µm deep with a spacing of 100 nm (Fig. 2a).
      Figure 2b shows a top-viewed SEM image of a 50-nm-thick Pt film
      coated surface of nanoporous TiO2. After Pt deposition on
      nanoporous TiO2 film, the size of Pt nanoholes turns out to be
      approximately 10 ~ 20 nm (Fig. 2b, inset). The density of holes is
      3 ~ 5 × 109 cm-2. As shown by the XRD data in Fig. 2c, after the
      as-deposited Ti was anodised for 5 min, the intensity of the Ti
      (002) peak decreased compared to that of the Ti (001) peak,
      indicating the presence of vertically arranged uniform nanopores
      along the &lt;002&gt; direction of the Ti. After the anodised Ti
      was thermally oxidised at 450°C for 2 hours, the (001) and (002)
      peaks of Ti disappeared, and a new peak (37.24°) corresponding to
      the rutile crystalline structure appeared, indicating that TiO2
      has a band gap of 3.2 eV39...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Discussion</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Electrons and holes that migrate to the surface of metal
      electrodes can reduce and oxidize the reactants adsorbed on the
      metal surfaces, respectively. The reduction (Red) and oxidation
      (Ox) reactions can produce the reduction current and oxidation
      current as shown in the J-V measurement data in Fig. 3c. The
      oxidation current density (lower red curve) is less than reduction
      current (upper red curve) at 0 V under irradiation, meaning that
      the reaction Red ? Ox + ne- is dominant on Pt/nanoporous TiO2 and
      available electrons are provided continuously, whereas the current
      density data (upper and lower black lines) of unirradiated devices
      seem not much different. When the strongly localised electric
      field oscillates across the Pt surface, as illustrated in Figs.
      5c–h, the displacement of the electron density in the Pt surface
      by the electric field oscillation generates a Coulombic attraction
      force that can interact with environmental molecular ions, meaning
      that the eaq- and ·OH ions surrounded by water molecules can
      escape and attach to the Pt surface via localised surface
      plasmons. However, when the localised surface plasmon energy is
      less than the energy barrier of eaq- and ·OH, they cannot
      coherently oscillate or escape from their meta-stable state. With
      respect to the vacuum level, the work functions of eaq- and ·OH
      were calculated to be 1.6 eV and 7.2 eV, respectively, at pH 0.
      From the FDTD simulations, we obtained surface plasmon energy of
      4.23 eV, which is 1.42 eV from the vacuum level and is higher than
      the energy level of eaq-, enabling electrons to escape from their
      meta-stable state and the escaped electrons to generate surface
      plasmons on the metal surface56, 57. In addition, the presence of
      excited electrons indicates that excited holes with the same
      amount of energy (10.64 eV with respect to the vacuum level)
      exist. These excited holes can interact with ·OH on the surface of
      Pt. The same phenomenon is responsible for Förster resonant energy
      transfer (FRET), in which an excited donor transfers energy to an
      acceptor group through a non-radiative process58. In fact, the
      Schottky junction of Pt/TiO2 creates a space-charge region in the
      n-type TiO2 layer because the electrons diffuse from the TiO2 side
      to the Pt side whereas the holes move in the reverse direction. In
      the equilibrium state, an equal amount of electrons in Pt is
      trapped at the Pt/TiO2 interface and builds up an internal
      electric field (0.45 eV) from the TiO2 side toward the Pt side,
      preventing further movement of carriers. When surface plasmons are
      generated on Pt surface by beta radiation, electrons in Pt are
      pushed towards TiO2 by the electric field created from surface
      plasmons, which is higher than the internal electric field, and
      holes move simultaneously towards the Pt/water surface interface.
      Accumulated holes can attract donors like negatively charged ions
      or radicals. Thus, the strong electric field enhancement can
      significantly increase the number of accumulated holes at the
      Pt/water interface and create a large internal potential
      difference. With the energy higher than the potential barrier (0.2
      ~ 0.5 eV) of surrounding water molecules, solvated electrons
      (eaq-) can be attracted toward the Pt surface rapidly in water.
      Moreover, surface plasmons have a resonance frequency of a few
      hundred of GHz in visible wavelength. This means that strong
      Coulombic attraction force oscillates very fast to attract eaq- in
      water. When the distance between the TiO2 and Pt counter electrode
      is 5 cm, the electric field is approximately 0.09 V/cm and the
      speed of electrons in water reaches 1.6256 × 10-4 cm/s. If eaq- in
      water is 1 mm away from TiO2, it can move to the TiO2 surface in
      603 s and most solvated electrons will not arrive quickly at the
      TiO2 electrode. Thus, as shown in Fig. S2, a slowly saturated
      curve of open circuit voltage is observed on TiO2 electrode under
      beta radiation, while the Pt/TiO2 electrode has a very fast
      saturated curve. The electric field of the TiO2 electrode is much
      weaker than that of the Pt/TiO2 electrode producing the surface
      plasmon effect, and the difference in electric field intensity may
      affect the collection of eaq- in water. Once eaq- is arrived at
      the electrode surface, eaq- is injected without any energy loss
      because the electrochemical energy is higher than the conduction
      band edge (-0.1 ~ -0.2 VNHE) of TiO2.<br>
      <br>
      In principle, photovoltaic devices, such as dye-sensitised solar
      cells and photochemical cells, use the similar mechanism, but
      sunlight produces very few free radicals because it is composed of
      photon energies that lie primarily in the visible range (380
      nm–780 nm). Differently, beta radiation can produce many free
      radicals through the loss of kinetic energy in water. Then, the
      generation of localised surface plasmons on the Pt surface by beta
      radiation can enhance the chemical reactions involving free
      radicals produced by beta radiation in water. The reflection peak
      of Pt/nanoporous TiO2 at 5.04 eV, and the similarity between the
      simulated emission spectra and measured reflection spectrum show
      that the surface plasmon resonance occurs at higher energy than
      the band gap energy of TiO2, indicating resonant energy transfer
      between TiO2 and surface plasmons59, 60, 61. Because the increased
      population of hot electrons generated by surface plasmons
      decreases the thickness of the Pt/TiO2 junction and increases its
      junction electric field62, 63, the narrow junction enables
      carriers obtained from free radicals to efficiently move toward
      the contact metals without carrier relaxation in the thin film. We
      confirmed that significantly more power from the device with the
      plasmonic Pt layer was produced than that from the device without
      the plasmonic Pt layer. As shown in Fig. S12, increased surface
      plasmon energy can effectively transport hot carriers generated on
      a Pt surface. Therefore, we can conclude that the high power
      density obtained from our radiolytic cell may be attributed to the
      conversion of continuously generated free radicals with large
      electrochemical energy into electricity by the surface plasmon
      energy generated at the Pt surface. This finding reveals new
      mechanisms for power generation in radiolytic chemical cells. Our
      unique approach further paves the way for producing chemical cells
      with higher power density...<br>

      </div>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      </b>In research carried out into identical twins, many series of
      tests have clearly proved that siblings of this type can
      communicate with each other in ways that simply cannot be
      explained by classical physics. Identical twins have identical
      hereditary factors, which obviously considerably increases
      telepathic skills. In outside laboratory tests too, cases have
      become known in which twins who did not even know about each
      other, because they were separated in orphanages, have started to
      communicate and then found each other. Particularly in situations
      where one of the twins is in mortal danger, the telepathic
      potential rises dramatically.<br>
      <br>
      We meet telepathy in everyday life too, albeit in a slightly
      weakened form: one of the strongest types in the connection
      between mother and child. Mothers have an 'aerial' for their
      child; they can wake up, for example, even if they are sleeping
      deeply if their child is suddenly ill in the night. And they can
      still do this even if the spatial distance is so great that the
      fact cannot be explained by acoustic phenomena. "This elemental
      connection between mother and child has now been medically
      recorded and designated. Frederic Vester says: "A mother's love
      can be remote-controlled." This is an ancient behavioural pattern
      from nature. This simultaneity, which has not yet been explained,
      is certainly part of the broad area of communication via morphic
      resonance." Also, if we think of someone we love, we sometimes
      know when we hear the telephone, that it is going to be this
      person ringing. We suppress this because we think it's impossible,
      but every one of us has had some kind of similar experience.*<br>

      <b>White noise -- The interface to the consciousness</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The diode that generates white noise can be visualized as the
      television or radio quartz valves used earlier. The noise is
      called "white" because it appears on a black screen as flickering
      white dots, rather like what you see on a TV screen after the end
      of transmission time. The noise of the QUANTEC diode itself can be
      compared to a radio that is not tuned into any station: it
      alternates between deep rumbling, high whistles and then
      medium-frequency hissing, completely at random and with no
      recognizable pattern.<br>
      <br>
      However, when this noise is connected with the consciousness, it
      changes. These changes can be processed and interpreted by a
      computer. QUANTEC uses this interaction with the consciousness by
      working with white noise to search its databases for relevant
      entries (e.g. affirmations, acupuncture, Bach blossoms,
      homeopathy, colors, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      The diode as interface between consciousness and machine has been
      studied for over thirty years - with unambiguous results.
      Countless series of tests on people and animals have proved that
      diodes with white noise can be used as an interface between
      different types of consciousness and computers. The Frenchman René
      Peoc'h, in his experiments in the sleep laboratory, was even able
      to prove that this takes place without any waking consciousness.
      As part of the global awareness project, the collective
      consciousness of all people on our planet is being studied.<br>

      <blockquote>"In Russia, live like Russians. Any minority, from
        anywhere, if it wants to live in Russia, to work and eat in
        Russia, it should speak Russian, and should respect the Russian
        laws. If they prefer Sharia Law, and live the life of Muslim’s
        then we advise them to go to those places where that’s the state
        law.<br>
        <br>
        "Russia does not need Muslim minorities. Minorities need Russia,
        and we will not grant them special privileges, or try to change
        our laws to fit their desires, no matter how loud they yell
        ‘discrimination’. We will not tolerate disrespect of our Russian
        culture. We better learn from the suicides of America, England,
        Holland and France, if we are to survive as a nation. The
        Muslims are taking over those countries and they will not take
        over Russia. The Russian customs and traditions are not
        compatible with the lack of culture or the primitive ways of
        Sharia Law and Muslims.<br>
        <br>
        "When this honorable legislative body thinks of creating new

        first, observing that the Muslims Minorities Are Not Russians."<br>
