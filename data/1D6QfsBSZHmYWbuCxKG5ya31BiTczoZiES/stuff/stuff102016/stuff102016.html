              treated by heating with ammonia water to liberate the
              sulfides from ganque. The dissolved and suspended sulfides
              are decanted and the ganque is treated again with ammonium
              hydroxide, decanted, and washed. The ammonium
              solution-suspensions are combined in a reflux apparatus
              with magnetic stirring. Nitric acid is added to form a

              to form a clear solution.<br>

              The mixture is heated to a gentle reflux with magnetic
              stirring until the sulfides are decomposed and a white
              precipitate of oxides has formed. Continue heating for
              several hours to ensure complete reaction.<br>

              The reaction mixture is decanted or filtered, washed, and
              dried to yield arsenic trioxide and pentoxide. The
              trioxide is separated from the pentoxide by sublimation.
              The crude mixture can be converted completely to arsenic
              pentoxide by further treatment with nitric acid.<br>

          Second Law of Thermodynamics</b><br>
        <b><br>
          by Louise Lerner</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      For more than a century and a half of physics, the Second Law of
      Thermodynamics, which states that entropy always increases, has
      been as close to inviolable as any law we know. In this universe,
      chaos reigns supreme.<br>
      <br>
      But researchers with the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's)
      Argonne National Laboratory announced recently that they may have
      discovered a little loophole in this famous maxim.<br>
      <br>
      Their research, published in Scientific Reports, lays out a
      possible avenue to a situation where the Second Law is violated on
      the microscopic level.<br>
      <br>
      The Second Law is underpinned by what is called the H-theorem,
      which says that if you open a door between two rooms, one hot and
      one cold, they will eventually settle into lukewarm equilibrium;
      the hot room will never end up hotter.<br>
      <br>
      But even in the twentieth century, as our knowledge of quantum
      mechanics advanced, we didn't fully understand the fundamental
      physical origins of the H-theorem.<br>
      <br>
      Recent advancements in a field called quantum information theory
      offered a mathematical construction in which entropy increases.<br>
      <br>
      "What we did was formulate how these beautiful abstract
      mathematical theories could be connected to our crude reality,"
      said Valerii Vinokur, an Argonne Distinguished Fellow and
      corresponding author on the study.<br>
      <br>
      The scientists took quantum information theory, which is based on
      abstract mathematical systems, and applied it to condensed matter
      physics, a well-explored field with many known laws and
      experiments.<br>
      <br>
      "This allowed us to formulate the quantum H-theorem as it related
      to things that could be physically observed," said Ivan Sadovskyy,
      a joint appointee with Argonne's Materials Science Division and
      the Computation Institute and another author on the paper. "It
      establishes a connection between well-documented quantum physics
      processes and the theoretical quantum channels that make up
      quantum information theory."<br>
      <br>
      The work predicts certain conditions under which the H-theorem
      might be violated and entropy — in the short term — might actually
      decrease.<br>
      <br>
      As far back as 1867, physicist James Clerk Maxwell described a
      hypothetical way to violate the Second Law: if a small theoretical
      being sat at the door between the hot and cold rooms and only let
      through particles traveling at a certain speed. This theoretical
      imp is called "Maxwell's demon."<br>
      <br>
      "Although the violation is only on the local scale, the
      implications are far-reaching," Vinokur said. "This provides us a
      platform for the practical realization of a quantum Maxwell's
      demon, which could make possible a local quantum perpetual motion
      machine."<br>
      <br>
      For example, he said, the principle could be designed into a
      "refrigerator" which could be cooled remotely — that is, the
      energy expended to cool it could take place anywhere.<br>
      <br>
      The authors are planning to work closely with a team of
      experimentalists to design a proof-of-concept system, they said.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Remarkable progress of quantum information theory (QIT) allowed to
      formulate mathematical theorems for conditions that
      data-transmitting or data-processing occurs with a non-negative
      entropy gain. However, relation of these results formulated in
      terms of entropy gain in quantum channels to temporal evolution of
      real physical systems is not thoroughly understood. Here we build
      on the mathematical formalism provided by QIT to formulate the
      quantum H-theorem in terms of physical observables. We discuss the
      manifestation of the second law of thermodynamics in quantum
      physics and uncover special situations where the second law can be
      violated. We further demonstrate that the typical evolution of
      energy-isolated quantum systems occurs with non-diminishing
      entropy.<br>

          Scientist.</b><br>

      <b>IT HAS UNCANNY FORCE</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Harnessing of Earth's Elements Now in Bounds of&nbsp; Possibility.
      An invention that will revolutionize the world! This is the claim
      of a young, almost unknown, Italian scientist, Professor L. V.
      Rota, who claims to have discovered the secret of telluric
      currents. "My invention," states the professor, "can cause
      battleships, submarines, aeroplanes and guns to crumble to dust at
      any moment that any government gives the order to move them.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Speed up Travel.</b><br>
      <br>
      It can be harnessed up for the service of man and can immensely
      speed up travel, transport and communication, whether by land,
      water or air. It can cheapen-*very sort of manufacture and enhance
      every domestic and social immunity. "For instance, a cargo of
      mails or goods could be sent across the Atlantic through the upper
      air, without a human being aboard the craft, at a speed of ten to
      400 miles an hour. The vessel would rise vertically the prescribed
      height, travel horizontally in a predetermined direction and drop
      gently and punctually upon its destination.<br>
      <br>
      <b>"Travel Any Distance."</b><br>
      <br>
      "Wireless messages, dispatched from no costly or elaborate
      stations, would travel to any distance free from all danger of
      dissipation or confusion and with absolute privacy as between
      sender and receiver. "The nature of all mineral and oil deposits
      in any part of the world and their depth and volume will be
      accurately determined without so much as sinking a shaft.
      "Currents rushing through the air will provide the householder
      with cheaper, safer and more brilliant lighting than he has ever
      ventured to desire. "A new power for every Industry will first
      make coal, steam, oil and electricity more efficient and afterward
      will dispense with them altogether. "When our company Is formed?
      within eighteen months ? we will give spectacular demonstrations
      that all these things?and more?can be accomplished."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Currents Long Suspected.</b><br>
      <br>
      The existence of these currents, which emanate from the earth
      (hence their name) have been suspected by other scientists. Lord
      Kelvin before his death declared their reality. Professor Rota
      claims to be the first to discover and record them. They may also
      be described as "molecular force," and they must not be confused,
      says the professor, with Ampere's thermo-electric currents or with
      Foucault currents. It is the study of these telluric currents, in
      their nature, intensity and direction, that is believed to open up
      such possibilities of tremendous Importance for the future of
      humanity. Professor Rota has recently given a preliminary
      demonstration at Marseilles. With a cigar-shaped apparatus,
      seventeen feet long, thirty Inches In diameter and weighing 200
      pounds, he convinced a number of press correspondents that this
      apparatus could remain suspended motionless In the air for
      twenty-four hours, carrying a considerable weight, and be
      propelled or stopped without the use of any mechanical motor.<br>

            Accidentally Convert CO2 Into Ethanol</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Scientists at the US Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National
      Laboratory (ORNL) have developed a technology that turns carbon
      dioxide into ethanol, according to a study published in the
      Chemistry Select journal in September. <br>
      <br>
      The discovery was made during an electrochemical process of
      reversing combustion, using copper and carbon nanospikes. The
      scientists were attempting to turn carbon dioxide, a waste
      byproduct of burning fossil fuels, into an organic element, when
      they realized that the first step of the experiment did the entire
      job. <br>
      <br>
      "We discovered somewhat by accident that this material worked,"
      said ORNL's Adam Rondinone, lead author of the study. "We were
      trying to study the first step of a proposed reaction when we
      realized that the catalyst was doing the entire reaction on its
      own." <br>
      <br>
      Voltage was applied to a carbon, copper and nitrogen catalyst, to
      induce a chemical reaction of reversing the combustion process.
      The yield of ethanol obtained by the solution of carbon dioxide in
      water appeared to be about 63 percent. The researchers now suggest
      that there is a possibility that the process could "go straight
      from carbon dioxide to ethanol with a single catalyst." <br>
      <br>
      "By using common materials, but arranging them with
      nanotechnology, we figured out how to limit the side reactions and
      end up with the one thing that we want," Rondinone said. <br>
      <br>
      The scientists hope that the process could be used in other
      applications. <br>
      <br>
      "A process like this would allow you to consume extra electricity
      when it's available to make and store as ethanol," Rondinone said.
      "This could help to balance a grid supplied by intermittent
      renewable sources," according to the ORNL website.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Though carbon dioxide is a waste product of combustion, it can
      also be a potential feedstock for the production of fine and
      commodity organic chemicals provided that an efficient means to
      convert it to useful organic synthons can be developed. Herein we
      report a common element, nanostructured catalyst for the direct
      electrochemical conversion of CO2 to ethanol with high Faradaic
      efficiency (63 % at −1.2 V vs RHE) and high selectivity (84 %)
      that operates in water and at ambient temperature and pressure.
      Lacking noble metals or other rare or expensive materials, the
      catalyst is comprised of Cu nanoparticles on a highly textured,
      N-doped carbon nanospike film. Electrochemical analysis and
      density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest a preliminary
      mechanism in which active sites on the Cu nanoparticles and the
      carbon nanospikes work in tandem to control the electrochemical
      reduction of carbon monoxide dimer to alcohol.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Introduction</b><br>
      <br>
      Closing the carbon cycle by utilizing CO2 as a feedstock for
      currently used commodities, in order to displace a fossil
      feedstock, is an appropriate intermediate step towards a
      carbon-free future. Direct electrochemical conversion of CO2 to
      useful products has been under investigation for a few decades.
      Metal-based catalysts, such as copper,[1] platinum,[2] iron,[3]
      tin,[4] silver,[5] and gold,[6] along with carbons such as g-C3N4
      [7] have been the primary focus for CO2 reduction, with some very
      high Faradaic efficiencies for methane conversion. Copper is
      arguably the best-known metal catalyst for electrochemical CO2
      reduction,[8] capable of electrochemically converting CO2 into
      more than 30 different products,[9] including carbon monoxide
      (CO), formic acid (HCOOH), methane (CH4) and ethylene (C2H4) or
      ethane (C2H6), but efficiency and selectivity for any product
      heavier than methane are far too low for practical use.[10]
      Competing reactions limit the yield of any one liquid product to
      single-digit percentages.[8]<br>
      <br>
      Polycrystalline Cu foil produces a mixture of compounds in
      CO2-saturated aqueous solutions that are dominated either by H2 at
      low overpotential, or by CO and HCOO− at high overpotential, or by
      hydrocarbons and multi-carbon oxygenates at the most extreme
      potentials.[9, 11] Theoretical studies predict that
      graphene-supported Cu nanoparticles would enhance catalytic
      activity due to the strong Cu - graphene interaction via defect
      sites,[12] which would stabilize the intermediates from CO2
      reduction and improve selectivity towards hydrocarbon products as
      methane and methanol at lowered overpotential. Early studies
      revealed that the electrode surface was dominated by adsorbed CO
      during the CO2 reduction and that CO acted as intermediate in the
      production of hydrocarbons.[13] Cu produces hydrocarbons and
      multi-carbon oxygenates when supplied with CO in the absence of
      CO2, but very negative potentials are still required to promote CO
      reduction over H2 evolution. Large overpotentials preclude
      energetically efficient electrolysis and favor hydrocarbons over
      liquid oxygenates. Recently, high selectivity of CO
      electroreduction to oxygenates, with ethanol as the major product,
      was achieved by oxide-derived Cu, in which the surface
      intermediates were stabilized by the grain boundaries.[14]<br>
      <br>
      We previously reported on a highly textured nitrogen-doped,
      few-layer graphene electrode that presents with a surface of
      intense folds and spikes, which we termed carbon nanospikes or
      CNS. The CNS structure is disordered due to the high nitrogen
      content which prevents well-ordered stacking. In the current
      report, a carbon nanospike (CNS) electrode with electronucleated
      Cu nanoparticles (Cu/CNS) is shown to have much higher selectivity
      for CO2 electroreduction than H2 evolution, with a subsequent high
      Faradaic efficiency to produce ethanol. We believe this is
      achieved both from the high intrinsic CO2 reduction activity of Cu
      and from the synergistic interaction between Cu and neighboring
      CNS, which controls reduction to alcohol. The major CO2 reduction
      product is ethanol, which corresponds to a 12 e− reduction with
      H2O as the H+ source, where E0 is the equilibrium potential. By
      comparing Cu/CNS to control electrodes comprised of 1) Cu on
      glassy carbon and 2) bare CNS, we demonstrate that CO2 reduction
      activity is not a simple consequence of either Cu or CNS. While
      the reaction mechanism is not yet elucidated, we hypothesize an
      interaction between adjacent catalytic sites on the Cu and CNS,
      facilitated by the nanostructured morphology of the catalyst that
      prevents complete electrochemical reduction to ethylene or ethane,
      resulting in a high yield of ethanol.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results and discussion</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The bare CNS electrode (Supporting Information Figure S1) was
      characterized in our previous study as a dense nanotextured carbon
      film terminated by randomly oriented nanospikes approximately
      50–80 nm in length, where each nanospike consists of layers of
      puckered carbon ending in a ∼2 nm wide curled tip.[15] The film is
      grown by a relatively simple direct-current plasma-enhanced
      chemical vapor deposition reaction using acetylene and ammonia as
      reagents...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusion</b><br>
      <br>
      We report an electrocatalyst which operates at room temperature
      and in water for the electroreduction of dissolved CO2 with high
      selectivity for ethanol. The overpotential (which might be lowered
      with the proper electrolyte, and by separating the hydrogen
      production to another catalyst) probably precludes economic
      viability for this catalyst, but the high selectivity for a
      12-electron reaction suggests that nanostructured surfaces with
      multiple reactive sites in close proximity can yield novel
      reaction mechanisms. This suggests that the synergistic effect
      from interactions between Cu and CNS presents a novel strategy for
      designing highly selective electrocatalysts. While the entire
      reaction mechanism has not yet been elucidated, further details
      would be revealed from conversion of potential intermediates
      (e. g. CO, formic acid and acetaldehyde) in future work.<br>

      Plastic bottles contain hormone-disrupting chemicals that can
      cause cancer, diabetes, ADHD and autism, scientists claimed in a
      report on Tuesday.<br>
      <br>
      Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) interfere with the body's
      hormonal system, affecting development and leaving the body open
      to a staggering range of diseases.<br>
      <br>
      But they are found in thousands of everyday products, ranging from
      plastic and metal food containers, to detergents, flame
      retardants, toys and cosmetics.<br>
      <br>
      These chemicals are responsible for scores of illnesses - costing
      the US an eye-watering $340 billion in health-related costs each
      year, a bombshell report by NYU Langone said.<br>
      <br>
      The most common EDC-related illness is neurological - including
      attention-ADHD, autism and loss of IQ. <br>
      <br>
      The invisible but dangerous chemicals also boosted obesity,
      diabetes, some cancers, male infertility and a painful condition
      known as endometriosis, the abnormal growth of tissue outside the
      uterus. <br>
      <br>
      <b>WHAT ARE THESE CHEMICALS?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      So-called endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are found in
      thousands of everyday products, ranging from plastic and metal
      food containers, to detergents, flame retardants, toys and
      cosmetics.<br>
      <br>
      This term covers a number of chemicals.<br>
      <br>
      One is called PBDEs, which are commonly found in flame retardants.
      <br>
      <br>
      Bisphenol A in polycarbonate plastic is used for hard reusable
      bottles and food containers. Phthalates are used for disposable
      water bottles.<br>
      <br>
      <b>WHAT DO THEY DO? </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invisible chemical cause neurological and behavioral disorders
      like autism and ADHD.<br>
      <br>
      They also affect IQ.<br>
      <br>
      And they manipulate hormones in a way that can cause cancer,
      diabetes, male infertility, and endometriosis.<br>
      <br>
      <b>HOW DO WE KNOW THEIR COST? </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To put a figure on the impact of EDCs, the researchers reviewed
      blood and urine samples from the National Health and Nutrition
      Examination Survey.<br>
      <br>
      The survey has gathered data since 2009 on major disease risk
      factors from 5,000 volunteers.<br>
      <br>
      Computer models were then used to project how much each of 15
      diseases or conditions was attributable to chemical exposure, and
      the estimated health costs for each one. <br>
      <br>
      They concluded ECD-related illnesses cost the US $340 billion each
      year.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BUT THE CRITICS SAY...</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The report has come under fierce criticism from the American
      Chemical Society, which slammed the findings as baseless and
      sensationalist.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      In a statement released shortly after the report's publication,
      the ACS said the authors have 'cherry-picked' studies to come to a
      conclusion. <br>
      <br>
      The study's authors defending their work, and argued costs and
      benefits of regulating plastic should be openly debated.<br>
      <br>
      In a country where plastic is rife, these illnesses are not as
      rare as we may think, according to lead author Dr Leonardo
      Trasande. <br>
      <br>
      The new study by NYU Langone claims the economic impact of the
      chemicals leaves a huge, two per cent dent in the US' gross
      domestic product (GDP) each year.<br>
      <br>
      'Our research adds to the growing evidence on the tremendous
      economic as well as human health costs of endocrine-disrupting
      chemicals,' Dr Trasande, an associate professor at NYU Langone in
      New York City, said.<br>
      <br>
      'This has the potential to develop into a much larger health and
      economic issue if no policy action is taken,' he told AFP.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Trasande places emphasis on bisphenol A in polycarbonate
      plastic (used for hard reusable bottles and food containers) and
      phthalates (used for disposable water bottles). <br>
      <br>
      Some of the chemicals highlighted in the report, including
      phthalates used in bottles, are banned in the European Union - and
      would therefore not be on sale in Britain. <br>
      <br>
      MailOnline is attempting to find out whether some of the toxins
      may still be in UK plastic products. But a similar study last year
      estimated that the chemicals cost the EU health systems $271
      billion. <br>
      <br>
      The chemicals affect the body's endocrine tissues, which produce
      essential hormones that help regulate energy levels, reproduction,
      growth, development, as well as our response to stress and injury.<br>
      <br>
      Mimicking naturally occurring hormones such as estrogen and
      androgen, EDCs lock on to receptors within a human cell and block
      the body's own hormones from binding with it. <br>
      <br>
      Recent research has raised red flags showing that 'environmental
      contaminants can disrupt the endocrine system leading to
      adverse-health consequences,' according to the US Environmental
      Protection Agency.<br>
      <br>
      In the US, the biggest chemical culprit by far among the thousands
      of manmade molecules suspected of interfering with human hormones
      are so-called PBDEs, found in flame retardants.<br>
      <br>
      Bisphenol A, used to line tin food cans, along with phthalates in
      plastic food containers and many cosmetics, were also held to be
      responsible for upward of $50 billion worth of health damages.<br>
      <br>
      A similar study concluded last year that health-related costs of
      EDCs in the European Union were some $271 billion, about 1.28
      percent of GPD.<br>
      <br>
      Crucially, the main drivers of disease and disability were
      different on either side of the Atlantic, Trasande said.<br>
      <br>
      'US costs are higher mainly because of the widespread use in
      furniture of brominated flame retardants,' which were banned in
      the EU in 2008, he explained.<br>
      <br>
      The blood level of these chemicals in the average American would
      be in the top five percent of Europeans today.<br>
      <br>
      By contrast, the health costs associated with pesticides in food
      were 10 times higher in the EU than in the United States, where
      more stringent regulations were put in place to protect pregnant
      women and children.<br>
      <br>
      To put a figure on the impact of EDCs, the researchers reviewed
      blood and urine samples from the National Health and Nutrition
      Examination Survey, which has gathered data since 2009 on major
      disease risk factors from 5,000 volunteers.<br>
      <br>
      Computer models were then used to project how much each of 15
      diseases or conditions was attributable to chemical exposure, and
      the estimated health costs for each one. <br>
      <br>
      The study was published in The Lancet Diabetes &amp;
      Endocrinology, a medical journal. <br>
      <br>
      Flame retardants and pesticides in particular are known to affect
      the developing brain and can lead to loss of IQ.<br>
      <br>
      'Each IQ point lost corresponds to approximately two per cent in
      lost productivity,' Trasande said.<br>
      <br>
      The report has come under fierce criticism from the American
      Chemical Society, which slammed the findings as baseless and
      sensationalist.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      In a statement released shortly after the report's publication,
      the ACS said: <br>
      <br>
      'The paper’s conclusions are speculative at best and based on
      incomplete, inaccurate information about the relationship between
      chemicals and human health. <br>
      <br>
      'Further, the methods the authors used to generate the economic
      data have been widely criticized by economists, scientists and
      even the European Commission.<br>
      <br>
      'The only thing more troubling than the paper’s many flaws is that
      it does virtually nothing to advance the protection of public
      health. <br>
      <br>
      'The vast majority of studies cited by the authors do not show
      that exposure to specific chemicals causes health effects. <br>
      <br>
      'Rather, the authors have cherry-picked studies that show
      incomplete and inconsistent correlations between exposure to
      certain chemicals and specific health outcomes, many of which have
      been strongly disputed by independent scientists.'<br>
      <br>
      The costs and benefits of regulation should be openly debated, the
      authors argued, citing the decision in the 1970s to ban lead in
      paint, and then 20 years later in gasoline.<br>
      <br>
      Commenting in the same journal, Michele La Merrill, an expert in
      environmental toxicology at the University of California in Davis,
      said the new findings 'provide a lesson on the lasting economic
      effects of harmful chemicals.'<br>
      <br>
      They should 'inspire a policy shift to end the cat-and-mouse game
      currently employed the US government and industry.'<br>
      <br>
      The EU set broad criteria in June for identifying potentially
      harmful EDCs, but consumer and environmental groups said they fell
      far short of what is needed. <br>
      <br>
      In a statement to Daily Mail Online on Wednesday, Philip Law,
      director general of the British Plastics Federation, insisted
      European customers should not panic.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      'Consumer safety is of paramount importance to the plastics
      industry,' Law said.<br>
      <br>
      'UK companies ensure that they comply with strict standards set by
      the UK and the EU. <br>
      <br>
      'The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and European Food Standards
      Authority (EFSA) regulate the very limited use of specific
      chemicals alleged to be endocrine-disruptors used in the
      manufacturing of plastics through legislation such as REACH and
      Food Contact regulations. <br>
      <br>
      'The European Commission conducts risk assessment activities to
      ensure the continued safety of consumers; they have thoroughly
      examined the chemicals used in plastics manufacturing and found
      that consumers are not at risk.' <br>
      <br>
      Nick von Westenholz, CEO of the Crop Protection Association, said:
      'Everyday life is full of substances that interact with the
      endocrine system, coffee or milk for example. <br>
      <br>
      'What’s needed in this debate is to differentiate between a
      potential effect, and whether in the real world there is actually
      harm. <br>
      <br>
      'Public health is the most important consideration in the use of
      crop protection products and in the EU, pesticides are subject to
      arguably the most stringent approvals process in the world. <br>
      <br>
      'It currently takes ten years, requires an average of 200
      scientific studies and costs in excess of £150 million to bring a
      product to market, which ensures that pesticides are safe for
      human health and equip farmers to provide a healthy and affordable
      supply of food.' <br>

          color="#000000">It is tempting for us to think that our
          technological choices—whether we choose to live in a city, a
          suburb or out in the country; whether we want to drive a
          pick-up truck, a gasoline-electric hybrid or ride a bicycle;
          whether we take a train, drive long distances or fly—are
          determined by our tastes. We may flatter ourselves that we are
          in control, and that our choices are reflective of our
          enlightened, environmentally conscious values. This view rests
          on a foundation of circular reasoning: we behave in
          enlightened ways because we are enlightened, and we are
          enlightened because, to wit, we behave in enlightened ways. As
          to why what we consider enlightened is in fact enlightened
          rather than a question of possibly questionable personal
          taste—that is not to be discussed: de gustibus non est
          disputandum.<br>
          <br>
          But there is an alternative viewpoint, which seems more
          realistic in many ways, because it rests on a foundation of
          physical, technical specifics rather than fickle and arbitrary
          consumer preference, whim or taste. From this viewpoint, our
          technology and associated lifestyle choices are dictated by
          the technical requirements of their underlying technologies,
          both physical (the operation of the energy industry, the
          transportation industry, etc.) and political (the operation of
          political machines that segregate society by net worth and
          income, relegating wage-earners to a global disenfranchised
          underclass).<br>
          <br>
          A few years ago I found out that I needed to replace the
          diesel engine on my boat (the old one blew up definitively)
          and looked at a number of options, one of which was to replace
          it with an electric motor and a large bank of batteries. The
          electric option was touted as being quiet, non-polluting, and
          having just enough range to get in and out of the marina and
          to get back to dock if the wind died during a typical daysail.
          It turned out to be more than twice as expensive as a
          replacement diesel engine. As to what one might do to take
          such a boat any great distance (that involves many hours of
          motoring) the solution is to… add a diesel engine hooked up to
          a very large alternator, at triple the cost of just replacing
          the diesel. And so I just replaced the diesel.<br>
          <br>
          Diesel engines have a lot of positive qualities: they can run
          continuously for tens of thousands of hours; they can be
          rebuilt many times just by replacing the bearings, the
          cylinder sleeves, the piston rings and the valves; they are
          exceptionally reliable; the fuel they use is energy-dense. For
          these reasons, they are found throughout freight and
          construction industries and are used for small-scale power
          generation. They can be very large: the larger ships have
          engines that are as big as houses, with ladders welded to
          their cylinder walls, so that servicemen can climb down into
          them to service them after the cylinder head and the piston
          assembly are pulled out using an overhead shop crane. Small
          diesel engines make a lot less sense, and the silliest of them
          are the ones found on small yachts. There are many aspects of
          their design that make them silly, but there is also an
          overriding reason: they use the wrong fuel.<br>
          <br>
          You see, diesel is a precious commodity, used in the
          transportation industry (by trucks, locomotives and ships),
          and in construction equipment, with no alternative that is
          feasible. A cousin of diesel fuel is jet fuel—another
          petroleum distillate—that is used to power jet engines, again,
          with no alternative that is feasible. And then there is a fuel
          that is only really useful as a small engine fuel: gasoline,
          that is. Gasoline engines beyond a certain size become much
          more trouble than they are worth.<br>
          <br>
          Each barrel of crude oil can be distilled and refined into a
          certain amount of diesel and jet fuel, a certain amount of
          gasoline, some tar and some far less useful substances such as
          naphtha. The diesel is spoken for, because it literally moves
          the world; but if enough small engines cannot be found to burn
          all the gasoline that is produced, it becomes a waste product
          and has to be flared off at the oil refinery, at a loss.
          Indeed, prior to Henry Ford coming up with the brilliant plan
          to build cars cheap enough for his workers to afford, gasoline
          was dumped into rivers just to get rid of it, because while
          everyone burned kerosene (a distillate, like jet fuel and
          diesel) in lamps, cars remained playthings of the rich, and
          there simply wasn’t a market for any great quantities of
          gasoline.<br>
          <br>
          Therefore, it became very important to find ways to sell
          gasoline, by finding enough uses for it, no matter how
          superfluous they happened to be. And although some people
          think that the private automobile is a symbol of luxury and
          freedom and feel the thrill of the open road, the reason they
          think that is because these ideas were implanted in their
          heads by the people who were tasked with finding a market for
          gasoline. Alongside cars, great effort was put into marketing
          all sorts of other small engines: for lawn mowers, jet skis,
          motorcycles, ATVs, boat outboard motors… The only
          semi-industrial use of gasoline is in chainsaws, small
          generators and air compressors, service and delivery vehicles,
          and outboard engines.<br>
          <br>
          And so people were sold on the idea of driving their own car,
          whether they needed to or not, and spending lots of time stuck
          in traffic—all so that they would pay for gasoline. By causing
          all that excess traffic congestion, they also created the need
          to widen roads and highways, generating demand for another
          borderline useless petroleum product: road tar. And since
          there was a problem with cramming all these cars into cities
          (where cars are generally not needed if the cities are laid
          out using proper urban design, with sufficient numbers of
          tram, light rail and subway lines, etc.) the solution was to
          move everybody out to the suburbs. And so the reason half of
          the US population now lives in suburbia and drives has nothing
          to do with their needs, and everything to do with the need to
          sell them gasoline.<br>
          <br>
          Some people may react negatively to the idea that their
          suburban castle and their magic chariot are all just part of a
          plan to make them spend much of their life paying for the
          right to dispose of toxic waste in unsafe ways. Rest assured,
          their preprogrammed negative reaction is part of the plan.
          Every effort has been made to program people to think that
          this waste disposal job—carried out at one's own expense—is,
          in fact, something that should be considered a sign of
          success. The most efficient way to motivate a slave to perform
          is to convince him that he is free. To this end, driving is
          celebrated in music and film and portrayed as a way of life.
          Calling it what it is—being a slave to a machine—is bound to
          cause cognitive dissonance, all the more so because driving a
          lot destroys one's mind: in the immortal words of a character
          from the movie Repo Man, ”The more you drive, the less
          intelligent you become.” In this respect, most of the people
          living in the US are far past the point of no return, and it
          is pointless to attempt to impart to them any ideas that are
          discordant with the dead-end lifestyle into which they have
          been unconsciously coerced.<br>
          <br>
          Getting back to electric vehicles, such as what my boat would
          have ended up if I were gullible and made of money: they are
          obviously a defective idea. Their range is limited, they take
          longer to charge than it takes to fill a gas tank, and they
          use expensive and dangerous lithium-ion batteries that need
          periodic replacement. There is not enough lithium available to
          continue making batteries for laptops and smartphones (which
          periodically burst into flames), never mind providing for a
          giant expansion of battery-building to support lots of
          electric cars. Perhaps most importantly, they shrink the
          market for gasoline. So, what’s the reason behind the push?<br>
          <br>
          It certainly isn’t part of any particular effort to electrify
          transportation in general, because no electric solution exists
          for ships or planes, and electrifying rail freight is an
          impossibly expensive proposition. It certainly isn’t part of
          an effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions, because most of the
          ways electricity is currently generated is by burning coal and
          natural gas—and will be, while supplies last, because
          electricity is hard to store, and no matter how many solar
          arrays and wind farms are installed something will be needed
          to power the electric grid on overcast, windless days.<br>
          <br>
          No, the push for electric cars is motivated by a different
          sort of technology—political technology. You see, the oil age
          is drawing to a close. Last year the oil companies only
          discovered 1 barrel of oil for every 10 barrels they produced;
          at the turn of the century it was closer to 1 for every 4. At
          the same time, most of the easy-to-get-at oil has already been
          produced, and now it takes 1 barrel’s worth of energy to
          produce something like 10 barrels, whereas at the dawn of the
          age of oil it was closer to 1 for every 100 barrels. Such a
          low level of net energy production is turning out to be
          insufficient to maintain an industrial civilization, and as a
          result economic growth has largely stalled out. And although
          large investments in oil production have succeeded in keeping
          large volumes of oil flowing, for now, this is turning out to
          be an ineffective way to invest money, with many energy
          companies, once so profitable, now unable to pay the interest
          on their debt. And even though constant injections of free
          money are currently keeping developed economies from cratering
          into bankruptcy, it has been clear for some time that each
          additional dollar of debt produces significantly less than a
          dollar’s worth of economic growth. Growing debt within a
          growing economy can be very nice; but if the economy isn’t
          growing as fast, it’s fatal.<br>
          <br>
          As the oil age winds down, personal transportation, in the
          form of the automobile, is bound to once again become a
          plaything of the very rich. But then, when it comes to
          electric cars, it already is! And I don’t mean Tesla: the most
          commonly used electric vehicle worldwide is the golf cart. And
          who uses golf carts? Members of golf clubs; guests at resorts;
          residents of posh gated communities; employees at corporate
          and academic campuses… And what do all these people have in
          common? They are all members of the salaried elite; they are
          definitely not members of the wage-earning class. To them, the
          electric car offers a way of preserving a semblance of the
          status quo for themselves while setting themselves apart (in
          their own minds) from all of the gasoline-burning riffraff.
          Let the great unwashed in the flyover states, with their
          pickup trucks complete with gun racks, burn what’s left of the
          gasoline while overdosing on synthetic opiates while the
          salaried elites and individuals of high net worth, ensconced
          in their campuses and gated communities, will create a
          different future for themselves, replete with wind turbines,
          solar panels and electric cars (until they all get shot by all
          those they have disenfranchised). <br>

              I. The Illusion of the Axial Rotation of the Moon.<br>
              <br>
            </font></b></font></b><font color="#660000"><font
          color="#000000">It is well known since the discovery of
          Galileo that the moon, in travelling thru space, always turns
          the same face towards the earth. This is explained by stating
          that while passing once around its mother-planet the lunar
          globe performs just one revolution on its axis. The spinning
          motion of a heavenly body must necessarily undergo
          modifications in the course of time, being either retarded by
          resistances internal or external, or accelerated owing to
          shrinkage and other causes. An unalterable rotational velocity
          thru all phases of planetary evolution is manifestly
          impossible. What wonder, then, that at this very instant of
          its long existence our satellite should revolve exactly so,
          and not faster or slower. But many astronomers have accepted
          as a physical fact that such rotation takes place. It does
          not, but only appears so; it is an illusion, a most surprising
          one, too.<br>

      <font color="#660000"><font color="#000000"><i>It Is Well Known
            That the Moon, M., Always Turns the Same Face Toward the
            Earth, E, as the Black Arrows Indicate. The Parallel Rays
            From the Sun Illuminate the Moon In Its Successive Orbital
            Positions as the Unshaded Semi-circles Indicate. Bearing
            This in Mind, Do You Believe That the Moon Rotates on Its
            Own Axis?</i><i><br>
          </i><br>
          I will endeavor to make this clear by reference to Fig. 1, in
          which E represents the earth and M the moon. The movement thru
          space is such that the arrow, firmly attached to the latter,
          always occupies the position indicated with reference to the
          earth. If one imagines himself as looking down on the orbital
          plane and follows the motion he will become convinced that the
          moon does turn on its axis as it travels around. But in this
          very act the observer will have deceived himself. To make the
          delusion complete let him take a washer similarly marked and
          supporting it rotatably in the center, carry it around a
          stationary object, constantly keeping the arrow pointing
          towards the latter. Tho to his bodily vision the disk will
          revolve on its axis, such movement does not exist. He can
          dispel the illusion at once by holding the washer fixedly
          while going around. He will now readily see that the supposed
          axial rotation is only apparent, the impression being produced
          by successive changes of position in space.<br>

            of the Rotation of the Moon, M, Around the Earth, E; the
            Moon, In This Demonstration Hypothesis, Being Considered as
            Embedded In a Solid Mass, M,. If, As Commonly Believed, the
            Moon Rotates, This Would Be Equally True For a Portion of
            the Mass M?, and the Part Common to Both Bodies Would Turn
            Simultaneously In "Opposite" Directions.</i><br>
          <br>
          But more convincing proofs can be given that the moon does
          not, and cannot revolve on its axis. With this object in view
          attention is called to Fig. 2, in which both the satellite, M,
          and earth, E, are shown embedded in a solid mass, M1,
          (indicated by stippling) and supposed to rotate so as to
          impact to the moon its normal translatory velocity. Evidently,
          if the lunar globe could rotate as commonly believed, this
          would be equally true of any other portion of mass M1, as the
          sphere M2, shown in dotted lines, and then the part common to
          both bodies would have to turn simultaneously in opposite
          directions. This can be experimentally illustrated in the
          manner suggested by using instead of one, two overlapping
          rotatable washers, as may be conveniently represented by
          circles M and M2, and carrying them around a center as E, so
          that the plain and dotted arrows are always pointing towards
          the same center. No further argument is needed to demonstrate
          that the two gyrations cannot co-exist or even be pictured in
          the imagination and reconciled in a purely abstract sense.<br>
          <br>
          The truth is, the so-called “axial rotation” of the moon is a
          phenomenon deceptive alike to the eye and mind and devoid of
          physical meaning. It has nothing in common with real mass
          revolution characterized by effects positive and unmistakable.
          Volumes have been written on the subject and many erroneous
          arguments advanced in support of the notion. Thus, it is
          reasoned, that if the planet did not turn on its axis it would
          expose the whole surface to terrestrial view; as only one-half
          is visible, it must revolve. The first statement is true but
          the logic of the second is defective, for it admits of only
          one alternative. The conclusion is not justified as the same
          appearance can also be produced in another way. The moon does
          rotate, not on its own, but about an axis passing thru the
          center of the earth, the true and only one.<br>
          <br>
          The unfailing test of the spinning of a mass is, however, the
          existence of energy of motion. The moon is not possest of such
          vis viva. If it were the case then a revolving body as M1
          would contain mechanical energy other than that of which we
          have experimental evidence. Irrespective of this so exact a
          coincidence between the axial and orbital periods is, in
          itself, immensely improbable for this is not the permanent
          condition towards which the system is tending. Any axial
          rotation of a mass left to itself, retarded by forces external
          or internal, must cease. Even admitting its perfect control by
          tides the coincidence would still be miraculous. But when we
          remember that most of the satellites exhibit this peculiarity,
          the probability becomes infinitestimal.<br>
          <br>
          Three theories have been advanced for the origin of the moon.
          According to the oldest suggested by the great German
          philosopher Kant, and developed by Laplace in his monumental
          treatise “Mécanique Céleste,” the planets have been thrown off
          from larger central masses by centrifugal force. Nearly forty
          years ago Prof. George H. Darwin in a masterful essay on tidal
          friction furnished mathematical proofs, deemed unrefutable,
          that the moon had separated from the earth. Recently this
          established theory has been attacked by Prof. T. J. J. See in
          a remarkable work on the “Evolution of the Stellar Systems,”
          in which he propounds the view that centrifugal force was
          altogether inadequate to bring about the separation and that
          all planets, including the moon, have come from the depths of
          space and have been captured. Still a third hypothesis of
          unknown origin exists which has been examined and commented
          upon by Prof. W. H. Pickering in “Popular Astronomy of 1907,”
          and according to which the moon was torn from the earth when
          the later was partially solidified, this accounting for the
          continents which might not have been formed otherwise.<br>
          <br>
          Undoubtedly planets and satellites have originated in both
          ways and, in my opinion, it is not difficult to ascertain the
          character of their birth. The following conclusions can be
          safely drawn:<br>
          <br>
          1. A heavenly body thrown off from a larger one cannot rotate
          on its axis. The mass, rendered fluid by the combined action
          of heat and pressure, upon the reduction of the latter
          immediately stiffens, being at the same time deformed by
          gravitational pull. The shape becomes permanent upon cooling
          and solidification and the smaller mass continues to move
          about the larger one as tho it were rigidly connected to it
          except for pendular swings or librations due to varying
          orbital velocity. Such motion precludes the possibility of
          axial rotation in the strictly physical sense. The moon has
          never spun around as is well demonstrated by the fact that the
          most precise measurements have failed to show any measurable
          flattening in form.<br>
          <br>
          2. If a planetary body in its orbital movement turns the same
          side towards the central mass this is a positive proof that it
          has been separated from the latter and is a true satellite.<br>
          <br>
          3. A planet revolving on its axis in its passage around
          another cannot have been thrown off from the same but must
          have been captured.<br>

      <br>
      Clearly, the stage is set to blame Russia for a Trump victory.
      They are prepping the media who 99% endorse Hillary; the press
      conspiracy to feed propaganda to the American people is in full
      swing. Meanwhile, Obama continues to support the Sunni in the
      civil war with the intent to attack Russian forces in Syria. Our
      model still shows the largest turnout may take place here in 2016.
      This scares the blood, no matter how cold, right out of the veins
      of the career politicians. The American press is committing
      suicide and have succeeded in becoming indistinguishable from
      Pravda (“Truth”) of the old Soviet Union. Power corrupts
      everything, including the press.<br>
      <br>
      There are two scenarios running around behind the curtain. I
      reported the one that Obama would declare martial law, suspend the
      constitution and remain in the presidency declining to allow
      Hillary or Trump to take the throne, he would step aside and hand
      it to Joe Biden. Some counsel that is too extreme. Others are
      proposing that Obama still blame Russia, but then throw it to the
      Congress by means of the electoral college and that way keep it
      under the pretense of being constitutional. Any way you cut it,
      this does not look like they will allow Trump to take the White
      House regardless of the vote.<br>
      <br>
      United States Electoral College is the body that actually elects
      the President and Vice President of the United States every four
      years. The American people actually have no right to actually
      elect the president directly. Constitutionally, the states choose
      “electors”, who normally are pledged to vote for particular
      candidates. Hence, electors are apportioned to each of the 50
      states in addition to the District of Columbia. The number of
      electors is determined by population and thus is equal to that
      state’s number of members of Congress. The Twenty-third Amendment
      granted the District of Columbia the same number of electors as
      the least populous state which equal three. Consequently, there
      are 538 electors which corresponds to the 435 Representatives and
      100 Senators, plus the three additional electors from the District
      of Columbia. There are two exceptions where Maine and Nebraska do
      not vote on a “winner-take-all” basis. Maine and Nebraska use the
      “congressional district method” meaning there is one elector
      within each congressional district by popular vote.<br>
      <br>
      Here comes the loophole. There is NO constitutional or federal law
      that compels an elector to honor any “pledge” and that is a hole
      big enough to fly a fleet of 747 planes through. Therefore, if
      they bullshit the people enough with the media supporting them, we
      will see the Electoral College hand it to Hillary regardless of
      how the people vote. This would be in line with our model which
      forecast 2015.75 was the peak in government and it’s all downhill
      from there. The candidate who wins the absolute majority of
      electoral votes, or 270 today, becomes president. The Twelfth
      Amendment provides for what happens if the Electoral College fails
      to elect a president or vice president, which could come into play
      here in 2016. Under this situation, then the House of
      Representatives will select the president. On four occasions, most
      recently in the 2000 presidential election between Bush and Gore.
      There, Gore won the popular vote with 48.4% and Bush had 47.9%.
      The Electoral College was 271 for Bush and 266 for Gore.
      Therefore, the Electoral College system has in fact resulted in
      the election of a candidate who did not receive the most popular
      votes in the election.<br>
      <br>
      The election of a President who has not won in the popular vote
      also took place during the 1888 election. Grover Cleveland
      received 48.7% of the popular vote to Benjamin Harrison’s 47.9%.
      However, Harrison carried New York state and therefore outpolled
      Cleveland by 233 to 168 in the Electoral College. In the 1976
      election, Carter carried 23 states with 297 electoral votes, while
      Ford won 27 states and 240 electoral votes. It has long been
      argued that the election of any President who received less than a
      popular vote plurality is really unfair and should be
      unconstitutional.<br>
      <br>
      Only two Presidential elections (1800 and 1824) have been decided
      in the House. The election in 1876 after the civil war saw, South
      Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana submitted certificates of
      elections for both candidates. A bipartisan commission of
      Representatives, Senators, and Supreme Court Justices, reviewed
      the ballots. They awarded all three state’s electoral votes to
      Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio, who won the presidency by a single
      electoral vote.<br>
      <b><br>
        Our models are pointing to 2032 as the meltdown in the political
        system.</b> This will be 52 years from 1980, with prior targets
      being 1928, 1876, 1824, and 1772. The current target of 2016
      equates to 1964 and JFK’s assassination, 1912 and the defeat of
      the Progressive Party (Socialism), and 1860 with the Civil War.
      Each have been watershed events politically. It appears 2016 will
      live up to its target. Civil Unrest will rise significantly by
      rigging this year’s election.<b><br>

      <div align="center"><b>APPLE SEED CURES CANCER and it’s 10.000
          Times More Effective than Chemotherapy!</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      ....One of the known manufacturers of more powerful drugs in the
      world explained that after 20 laboratory tests developed since
      1970 the results showed that the extract of apple seed eliminates
      cancer cells from 12 different cancers including: prostate cancer,
      colon , breast, pancreatic and lung.<br>
      <br>
      The compounds of this seed proved 10 thousand times more effective
      in their action of retarding the growth of cancer cells compared
      to Adriamycin, a drug used to prevent chemotherapy multiplication
      of tumor cells.<br>
      <br>
      But there is still more surprising fact: the compounds of the
      apple seed, used as a therapeutic natural remedy against cancer,
      only act on cancer or abnormal cells without affecting those who
      are healthy, unlike chemotherapy which affects both types, which
      significantly impairs our health, impoverishing our immune system.<b><br>
        <br>
        Anticancer PROPERTIES OF Apple seed:<br>
        <br>
      </b>Like other seeds such as tangerine or plum, apple seed is rich
      in water-soluble vitamin, B17. This vitamin is composed of one
      molecule of benzaldehyde and other cyanide.<br>
      <br>
      It has discovered the power of this vitamin to counter cancer for
      its healing properties, which explains why this vitamin in the
      presence of water and the enzyme beta-glucosamidasa generates
      cyanide and benzaldehyde, which separately are highly toxic but
      working together they are able to amplify its anticarcinogenic
      potential up to 100 times.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that the enzyme beta-glucosamidase found in
      large proportions in cancer cells and in very low concentration in
      normal cells. For this reason it is that the compounds present in
      apple seed act on abnormal cells, creating a symbiosis between
      these toxic substances seed with the enzyme beta-glucosamidasa own
      diseased cells, resulting in the elimination of the latter,
      stopping their growth and spread, this process without affecting
      normal cells at all the rest of the body.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, normal cells contain an enzyme called rhodanese, is a
      mitochondrial enzyme whose scientific name is sulfurotransferasa
      thiosulfate. This enzyme detoxified cyanide, that is, it does not
      toxic to the body. However, cancer cells do not have rhodanese,
      thus are vulnerable to this cyanide in apple seed, which acts by
      killing.<br>
      How to eat the apple seed ?<br>
      <br>
      The apple seed has a bitter taste and a little acid will not like
      too sure, but compared to the terrible effects of chemotherapy is
      a much healthier and effective option. Mode consume depends on
      your creativity: you can eat the seeds while eating the apple,
      crush or grind or its content and sprinkle on salads, fruit
      smoothies, juices and other foods.<b><br>

      <div align="center"><b>By Roger Dobson for the Daily Mail</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Scientists have developed the first possible therapy for the
      most common cause of blindness in over-50s — dry age-related
      macular degeneration (AMD). <br>
      <br>
      The condition causes blind spots and blurry vision and can lead to
      sight loss.<br>
      <br>
      In a new study in Israel, patients are being given injections of
      special cells to replace those killed off in the condition; the
      hope is that this will stop the disease progressing.<br>
      <br>
      If the study is successful, larger trials which will make the
      treatment available for use will be starting later this year.<br>
      <br>
      AMD is estimated to affect more than half a million people in the
      UK. There are two forms, wet and dry. <br>
      <br>
      Both types occur when cells in the macula, the light-sensitive
      area at the back of the eye, become damaged, leading to
      deteriorating vision.<br>
      <br>
      Wet AMD develops when abnormal blood vessels form underneath the
      macula and cause swelling and bleeding, which very quickly results
      in irreparable damage. <br>
      <br>
      Untreated, it can cause blindness within three months. It is
      treated with injections of chemicals known as anti-vascular
      endothelial growth factor, which stop the development of these
      blood vessels.<br>
      <br>
      Dry AMD, which accounts for 90 per cent of cases, occurs when the
      cells of the macula become damaged by a build-up of deposits
      called drusen.<br>
      <br>
      Vision deteriorates gradually over many years but there is
      currently no treatment for it. <br>
      <br>
      The slow progression and complex mechanisms involved in dry AMD
      have meant it has been difficult to develop a treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Exactly how drusen deposits form is unclear, but they are thought
      to be waste products from neighbouring cells and tissues of the
      retina. <br>
      <br>
      This is a normal process in people without dry AMD too, but
      usually the deposits are cleared up by retinal pigment epithelial
      (RPE) cells found next to the macula.<br>
      <br>
      The theory is that in dry AMD, these retinal cells die off first,
      meaning the clear-up mechanism is slow or stops, resulting in
      excess deposits.<br>
      <br>
      The new approach, developed by Israeli company Cell Cure
      Neurosciences, is based on injections of RPE cells made in a lab.<br>
      <br>
      The cells are derived from donated embryos and are treated with
      chemicals to help them turn into adult RPE cells.<br>
      <br>
      The treatment involves injecting a solution which contains up to
      500,000 of these retinal cells into the back of the patient’s
      eyes, just underneath the retina.<br>
      <br>
      In a new trial at three hospitals across Israel, 15 patients with
      dry AMD will receive one injection — researchers will then monitor
      the progression of the disease for a year, using a battery of
      vision tests at set intervals.<br>
      <br>
      Studies in mice have shown that the injection treatment, called
      OpRegen, is safe and effective, and that it preserves vision and
      structure of the retina.<br>
      <br>
      When the cells were injected they formed a single-layer structure
      similar to the natural layer of cells, and survived for the
      lifetime of the mice, according to the journal Cell Stem Cell in
      2009.<br>
      <br>
      The proven ability of the injected cells to behave like this is
      critical to the success of the therapy in humans, the researchers
      said. <br>
      <b><br>
        <br>
        Scientists have found another possible target for future drugs
        to treat blinding diseases such as AMD and retinitis pigmentosa<br>
        <br>
      </b>In experiments on mice, researchers at Washington University
      in St Louis identified a molecule called NAD which is lowered in
      these conditions and leads to the death of photoreceptors.<br>
      <br>
      When mice were injected with a chemical that boosts levels of NAD,
      cell degeneration ceased and vision was restored, according to the
      journal Cell Reports.<b><br>

      <div align="center"><b>ANTI-AGEING PILL? Breakthrough as
          scientists discover how to slow down the ageing process –
          raising hopes of drug treatments</b><br>
        <br>
        <i>Researchers have identified a specific protein which they
          believe controls ageing</i><i><br>
        </i><br>
        <b>By Sara Kamouni</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The discovery of the protein, called carbonic anhydrase, could
      lead to the development of new medicines to slow the effects of
      ageing – or even halt the progression of debilitating conditions
      such as dementia.<br>
      <br>
      During the study, tests showed higher levels of carbonic anhydrase
      in the brain and muscle cells of older mice.<br>
      <br>
      Crucially, there was also larger amounts of it in young mice who
      already had some brain degeneration.<br>
      <br>
      After carrying out this assessment, researchers then fed carbon
      anhydrase to 1mm-long nematode worms – and found doing so reduced
      their life span.<br>
      <br>
      Now, work is continuing to identify chemical compounds, known as
      “inhibitors”, which could reduce levels of carbonic anhydrase in
      cells’ mitochondria – the “batteries” of the human body’s cells,
      which convert oxygen into energy.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Lisa Chakrabarti, who led the study with PhD student Amelia
      Pollard, said: “This could be a key to slowing down or reversing
      some of the signs of ageing.<br>
      <br>
      “What’s really exciting about this development is that we have
      been able to surmise that the function of this protein is playing
      a role in the ageing process within the cell.<br>
      <br>
      “On the face of it, it’s quite a simple study, and it’s strange
      it’s never been done before.<br>
      <br>
      “But these are the things we need to be looking at. Everybody gets
      old, but we don’t have to get crumbly with it.”<br>
      <br>
      She added: “We think that energy, and energetic processes, are
      really important for how you age.<br>
      <br>
      “This could potentially offer a significant new avenue in both
      tackling degenerative illnesses and the general effects of ageing
      on the body.”<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>For years, natural health experts have been extolling the
      ability of high doses of vitamin C to fight disease safely,
      effectively and naturally. Now, a case study from Puerto Rico – in
      which a woman infected with the Zika virus recovered practically
      overnight after being treated with vitamin C – provides strong new
      evidence for the claim.<br>
      <br>
      The Zika virus&nbsp; – which is related to yellow fever and West
      Nile viruses – is transmitted by the Aedes Aegypti mosquito. Some
      people infected with the Zika virus display no signs of the
      disease. If and when symptoms develop, they can include fever,
      headache, rash, joint pain, conjunctivitis and muscle pain.<br>
      <br>
      According to conventional ‘wisdom,’ there is no cure for the Zika
      virus – which usually resolves itself within two weeks. To
      alleviate symptoms, doctors often prescribe acetaminophen (which
      threatens the liver) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
      which offers plenty of negative side effects.<br>
      It’s official: High dose vitamin C stops Zika in its tracks within
      hours<br>
      <br>
      According to the case study, a 54-year-old woman who had suffered
      several recent mosquito bites presented at the Berdiel Clinic in
      Ponce, Puerto Rico with oral blisters, fever, a rash, a headache
      and reddened eyes – all classic Zika symptoms. When she tested
      positive for the virus, doctors from University of Puerto Rico
      administered escalating doses of vitamin C for three days, moving
      from 25 to 50 to 75 grams.<br>
      <br>
      Within 24 hours, the patient’s symptoms had improved dramatically,
      and were resolved completely by the third day. Noting that it
      ordinarily takes two weeks to recover from Zika, the team hailed
      vitamin C as “an efficient antioxidant” with “anti-viral
      activity,” and called for further study on vitamin C as a
      treatment for acute viral infections.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, conventional medicine is beginning to acknowledge vitamin
      C’s healing powers.&nbsp; You can read more about the entire case
      study here.<br>
      <b><br>
        The amazing disease-fighting abilities of vitamin C<br>
        <br>
      </b>Vitamin C is often referred to as “a nutrient for the immune
      system” – an apt label.&nbsp; Vitamin C enhances immune function
      by stimulating interferon production and increasing the number and
      aggressiveness of infection-fighting white blood cells – namely
      T-cells and natural killer cells, which are the sworn enemies of
      viruses and bacteria. It also helps to detoxify the viral products
      that cause pain and inflammation.<br>
      <br>
      A powerful anti-clotting agent, vitamin C also functions as an
      antihistamine. But its most important asset in fighting viruses
      may be the potency with which it scavenges reactive oxygen species
      – especially as recent research has highlighted the link between
      oxidative stress and infectious viral diseases.<br>
      <br>
      With recent growing concern about the Ebola and Zika viruses,
      isn’t it great to know that the cure could be a safe, natural,
      water-soluble vitamin?<br>
      <b><br>
        Strong case for high dose intravenous vitamin C<br>
        <br>
      </b>When vitamin C is given orally, much of it is absorbed in the
      gastrointestinal tract, with the excess being eliminated by the
      kidneys. The advantage of giving vitamin C intravenously is that
      it can then reach proper levels of plasma concentration. The
      doctors at Bardiel reported that amounts 30 to 70 times higher
      than those achieved by the oral route are necessary to activate
      vitamin C’s antiviral activity – which is what high dose IV
      vitamin C proponents have been saying all along.<br>
      <br>
      Thomas E. Levy, M.D., a leading proponent of high dose vitamin C
      therapy for a wide range of diseases, credits the late Dr.
      Frederick Klenner for his pioneering work with vitamin C in the
      1930s and 1940s. Dr. Klenner, who advocated giving at least 350 mg
      of vitamin C per kg of body weight – 25 to 30 grams for a typical
      adult – heralded vitamin C’s ability to successfully treat polio,
      influenza, multiple sclerosis, pneumonia and hepatitis.<br>
      <br>
      As early as 1949, Dr. Klenner was releasing his exciting findings
      about vitamin C at the Annual Session of the American Medical
      Association. But his good news fell on deaf ears, and his work
      received little notice.<b><br>
        <br>
        Protect your health with regular use of vitamin C<br>
      </b><br>
      Of course, the preventive doses recommended by Levy and Klenner
      far exceed the meager daily allowances advised by medical
      authorities – which are grossly insufficient, says Dr. Levy.&nbsp;
      The Institute of Medicine recommends a mere 90 mgs of vitamin C a
      day for men over 18, and 75 mg for women.&nbsp; According to Mayo
      Clinic, the recommended upper limit of vitamin C is a paltry 2,000
      mgs a day.<br>
      <br>
      No one, says Dr. Levy, should rely on these recommended daily
      dosages for vitamin C, which are good for little more than
      protecting against scurvy. Doses must be large enough – and taken
      often enough – for the vitamin to do its beneficial work of
      reducing oxidative stress.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Levy recommends a daily preventive dose of 6,000 to 12,000 mg
      (6 to 12 grams) a day for most healthy adults.<br>
      <br>
      For acute infections and chronic disease, Dr. Levy advises a
      “Multi-C Protocol” – which includes 1 to 5 grams per day of
      liposome-encapsulated vitamin C, sodium ascorbate daily up to or
      reaching bowel tolerance, 1 to 3 grams daily of ascorbyl
      palmitate, and intravenous vitamin C in the form of sodium
      ascorbate or buffered ascorbic acid, given in the amount of 25 to
      150 grams, depending on size and weight.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, you should consult with a trusted healthcare provider
      in order to tailor an exact regimen that’s right for you.<br>
      <b><br>
        Vitamin C success story: History repeats itself<br>
        <br>
      </b>Although the woman’s recovery from Zika is garnering current
      attention, her case is not unprecedented. In addition to the
      lifesaving vitamin C interventions engineered by Dr. Klenner in
      past decades, there is the case of a New Zealand man’s astonishing
      recovery from a near-fatal battle with swine flu – which was
      documented on New Zealand’s “60 Minutes” program.<br>
      <br>
      Dairy farmer Allan Smith developed swine flu, which progressed
      into “white-out” pneumonia – a particularly dangerous form in
      which lungs are so full of infected fluid they can’t be seen on an
      X-ray. He also developed hairy cell leukemia, after which he was
      placed in a medically induced coma.<br>
      <br>
      His condition continued to deteriorate, and doctors at Auckland
      Hospital were on the verge of removing him from life support when
      a family member convinced them to try high dose vitamin C. Within
      a day, Mr. Smith had improved.&nbsp; Within weeks, he had made a
      full recovery – with no sign of leukemia.<br>
      <br>
      (Of course, doctors at the hospital completely denied the role of
      vitamin C in Smith’s miraculous recovery. Instead, they credited
      their own decision to suddenly place him in a “prone” position.)<br>
      <br>
      Hopefully, researchers will follow through on the promise of the
      Berdiel team, and conventional medicine will begin to accept the
      truth about the astonishing potential of vitamin C to fight
      disease.<b><br>

      <br>
      Scientists have discovered a key cellular protein that controls
      the ageing process – a breakthrough that could lead to advances
      that slow down or even stop the ageing process.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers believe that the discovery of a protein called
      carbonic anhydrase could be the first step in developing medicines
      that slow the progression of neurodegenerative conditions such as
      Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.<br>
      <br>
      University of Nottingham scientists found larger amounts of the
      protein in the brain and muscle cells of older mice than in
      younger mice. However, young mice with prior mental degeneration
      also had higher amounts of the protein within their cells’
      mitochondria, known as the powerhouse responsible for converting
      oxygen into energy.<br>
      <br>
      To determine if the protein was detrimental, rather than a
      byproduct of the body’s efforts to protect itself against
      degeneration, researchers tested its effects on one millimeter
      long nematode worms.<br>
      <br>
      Feeding the worms carbonic acid was found to reduce their
      lifespan.<br>

        <b>PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF HAIR LOSS</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
        Inventor(s): SIMKIM GUILLERMO, et al.<br>
        <br>
      </b>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is used to stimulate and/or restore
      hair growth in areas of hair loss. Methods and compositions
      relating to PDT treatment for alopecia are disclosed. In light of
      PDT use to remove unwanted hair by inactivating or destroying hair
      follicles or destroying the tissue feeding the hair follicles,
      such methods and compositions relate to a surprising and
      unexpected discovery. PDT permits a means to treat conditions
      relating to hair loss such as androgenic alopecia, alopecia areata
      and drug-induced alopecia.<b><br>
        <br>
        FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
        <br>
      </b>This invention relates to the use of photodynamic therapy
      (PDT) and the use of PDT with appropriate photosensitizers to
      stimulate hair growth. In particular, the use of photosensitizers
      and PDT for treating conditions relating to hair loss, such as
      androgenetic alopecia and alopecia areata, is described. The
      present invention further relates to increases in proinflammatory
      cytokines induced by PDT, which stimulates hair growth, as well as
      to methods of determining the level of hair growth stimulation
      mediated by PDT.<b><br>
        <br>
        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
      </b><br>
      Alopecia is the general term referring to any disease or condition
      involving hair loss. There are several different types of hair
      loss, the most common being androgenetic alopecia (AGA; see
      Sawaya, M. E. Seminars in Cutaneous Medicine and Surgery
      17(4):276-283, 1998), alopecia areata (AA; see Fiedler &amp;
      Alaiti, Dermatologic Clinics 14(4): 733-738, 1996, as well as
      chemotherapy and drug-induced alopecia.<br>
      <br>
      Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is by far the most common type of
      alopecia. AGA is a patterned, progressive loss of an excessive
      amount of hair from the scalp. Significant AGA occurs in 50% of
      men by the age of fifty and 50% of women by the age of sixty. AGA
      is believed to be a result of both genetic predisposition and the
      presence of a sufficient level of circulating androgens. It is
      thought that the enzyme 5 alpha reductase present in dermal
      papilla cells converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT).
      DHT binds to androgen receptors, also localized in the dermal
      papilla cells, triggering changes in the hair follicle that result
      in (1) shortening of the anagen or growth phase of the hair cycle,
      (2) development of a latent phase in the hair cycle following
      shedding of the telogen hair, and (3) follicular miniaturization
      process that reduces the caliber of the anagen hairs produced. It
      is thought that differential expression of 5-alpha reductase
      and/or androgen receptors in various types of hair follicles
      accounts for patterned hair growth and loss.<br>
      <br>
      Currently approved treatments for AGA include minoxidil
      (Rogaine(TM)), an anti-hypertensive drug for which the mechanism
      of action in promoting hair growth is unknown. Minoxidil must be
      applied topically on a twice daily basis, and is therefore
      somewhat inconvenient to use. Studies have shown that 2% Minoxidil
      can provide an increase in the numbers of terminal hairs after
      4-12 months (De Villez et al, Journal of the American Academy of
      Dermatology, Vol. 16, No. 3, Part 2 (March 1987) 669-672).
      However, this benefit disappears over time or once the treatment
      is stopped. Another drug used in the treatment of AGA is
      finasteride (Propecia(TM)), a selective inhibitor of the type 2
      isoenzyme 5-alpha reductase. This treatment has marginal efficacy,
      requires daily oral administration and can have some
      anti-androgenic side effects such as alteration of libido. Hair
      transplants and scalp reduction are also performed on patients
      with hair loss associated with AGA. These procedures are too
      expensive or time consuming for many people. In addition, many
      people are put off by the surgical nature of the treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Alopecia areata (AA) has been reported to account for 2% of new
      outpatients in dermatology clinics (Fiedler &amp; Alaiti supra).
      AA is a nonscarring form of hair loss which occurs in humans and
      other species and is thought to be due to an inflammatory reaction
      caused by autoimmune response directed against the anagen stage
      hair follicle structure (McElwee et al. Pathobiology 66(2):
      90-107, 1998).<br>
      <br>
      A number of therapeutic modalities have been tested for the
      treatment of AA, with variable results ranging from no effect to
      partial or full hair regrowth. In some cases chronic maintenance
      treatment is required. Major drawbacks of these treatments are
      side effects, which can be local or systemic in nature. Fiedler
      &amp; Alaiti (supra) and Shapiro (Dermatological Clinics 11(1):
      35-46, 1993) have reviewed the various treatments available for
      AA, including steroids (topical, intralesional and systemic),
      minoxidil, anthralin, photochemotherapy, cyclosporin A and other
      agents, as well as combination treatments.<br>
      <br>
      Photochemotherapy therapy for AA using psoralen and high energy
      UVA (PUVA) treatment has met with very limited success and its
      effectiveness for AA is in doubt (Lebwohl, M. Lancet 349:222-223,
      1997). Side effects of PUVA treatment such as nausea, pigmentary
      changes, risk of skin cancer formation, and cataracts have been
      reported (Fiedler &amp; Alaiti, supra). Antioxidants have been
      used to ameliorate the side-effects of PUVA therapy (Ptapenko
      &amp; Kyagova, Membr. Cell Biol. 12(2): 269-278, 1998). The use of
      2% khellin, a compound with a chemical structure that resembles
      psoralen, and UVA for alopecia areata was found to be successful
      in 5 of the 10 patients tested (Orasa et al. Int. J. Dermatol.
      32(9): 690, 1993). Since khellin did not cause phototoxicity, the
      authors have suggested its use as an alternative to psoralen.<br>
      <br>
      Hematoporphyrin and high energy UVA has been used in a very
      limited study by Monfrcola et al. (Photodermatology 4:305-306,
      1987). Two patients were treated with topical hematoporphyrin
      (0.5%, HP) and UVA irradiation with three times a week for eight
      weeks. In the first week of treatment there was significant
      erythema and mild scaling followed by hyperpigmentation in the HP
      treated sites. Side effects included unpleasant reddish skin
      coloration for several hours and sometimes burning sensations
      during the irradiation phase. The authors point out that severe
      phototoxic reactions could occur with the use of HP concentrations
      greater than 1%. They also state that more work is needed before
      this approach can be subject to routine clinical use.<br>
      <br>
      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been utilized for the removal of
      unwanted hair in human subjects. Briefly the treatment involves a
      topical application of a photosensitizer on a selected area of the
      skin, a period for absorption of the photosensitizer, followed by
      a pulse or continuous irradiation or vibration of the area. The
      process involves inactivating or destroying the hair follicles or
      destroying the tissue feeding the hair follicles (see U.S. Pat.
      Nos. 5,669,916; 5,871,480; WO 97/32046).<br>
      <br>
      Photodynamic therapy is a minimally invasive two-step medical
      procedure that uses photoactivatable drugs called photosensitizers
      to treat a range of diseases. First, a photosensitizer is
      administered and, once it has permeated the target tissue, the
      photosensitizer is then activated by exposure to a dose of
      electromagnetic (usually light) radiation at a particular
      wavelength. Photodynamic therapies have been approved for a number
      of indications including the treatment of non-small cell lung
      cancer (Photofrin(TM)), age-related macular degeneration
      (Visudyne(TM)), actinic keratosis (Metvix(TM), Levulan(TM)), and
      basal cell carcinoma (Metvix(TM)).<br>
      <br>
      There continues to be a need for an effective, non-surgical
      procedure that results in a rapid increase in the number of
      terminal hairs but has minimal side effects.<b><br>
        <br>
        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
      </b><br>
      It has been discovered that photodynamic therapy (PDT) can
      stimulate hair growth and restore hair growth in areas of hair
      loss. The discovery includes the ability to use a variety of
      photosensitizers in PDT to treat hair growth reduction or hair
      loss. In light of the use of PDT to remove unwanted hair by
      inactivating or destroying hair follicles or destroying the tissue
      feeding the hair follicles, as discussed above, the instant
      invention relates to a surprising and unexpected discovery.<br>
      <br>
      The instant invention provides methods and compositions for
      treating lack of hair growth or a reduction or loss of existing
      hair by stimulating and/or restoring hair growth with PDT. Thus
      one aspect of the invention relates to methods for stimulating,
      inducing, restoring, reviving, renewing, replacing or otherwise
      activating hair growth in animals characterized by a lack of hair
      growth or a reduction in the amount of, or loss of, hair. In
      particular, the treatment methods of the invention comprise i)
      administering an effective and/or sufficient amount of
      photosensitizer resulting in an effective or desired degree of
      biodistribution; ii) irradiating at least a portion of the
      external surface of the animal with light including one or more
      wavelengths capable of activating said photosensitizer for a time
      period sufficient to activate the photosensitizer. The
      administrating and irradiating acts of (i) and (ii) may be
      repeated as necessary or desired to result in a desired level of
      hair growth.<br>
      <br>
      The desired therapeutic response of hair growth can also be
      accomplished by the irradiation of skin, which has been treated
      with an effective amount of a photosensitizer, with light
      including one or more wavelengths capable of activating said
      photosensitizer for a time period sufficient to activate the
      photosensitizer and result in a desired level of hair growth.
      Moreover, the methods of the invention may be practiced with any
      photosensitizer, which may be delivered systemically or locally.<br>
      <br>
      Thus in one application of the invention, the invention provide
      for the use of photodynamic therapy (PDT) to stimulate an increase
      in hair count numbers and restore hair growth in areas of hair
      loss. One embodiment of this application comprises:<br>
      <br>
      (a) administering an effective and/or sufficient amount of a
      photosensitizer to an area of a subject's skin where hair growth
      is desired; and<br>
      <br>
      (b) irradiating the area with electromagnetic energy containing a
      wavelength capable of activating, or appropriate to activate, said
      photosensitizer for a time period sufficient to activate the
      photosensitizer; and optionally<br>
      <br>
      (c) repeating (a) and (b)<br>
      <br>
      wherein there is an increase in hair count numbers in the treated
      area.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the increase in hair count is an increase in terminal
      hairs, which are long, pigmented hairs that are produced by
      follicles with sebaceous (oil) glands. They are found on the
      scalp, beard, armpits and pubic areas and are in contrast to
      vellus hairs, which are short hairs, often only a centimetre or
      two long, that contain little or no pigment. The follicles that
      produce vellus hairs do not have sebaceous and never produce any
      other kind of hairs. Terminal hairs also differ from Lanugo hair,
      which develops on an unborn baby. In people who have inherited a
      tendency to baldness terminal hairs may gradually become thinner
      and shorter until they look like vellus hairs. This may be due to
      the growth of terminal hairs being influenced by hormones (e.g.
      androgens) while vellus hairs are not so influenced.<br>
      <br>
      The progression of conditions such as AGA is for a gradual
      decrease in the number of terminal hairs over time. The terminal
      hairs may also gradually become thinner and shorter until they
      look like vellus hairs. It is surprising, therefore, that the
      current method can actually increase the number of hairs after 3
      months. In addition to treatment of hair loss, the method of the
      present invention may be used for the stimulation of hair growth
      in areas not recognized as experiencing hair loss. As used herein,
      the term "hair growth" refers to an increase in number of terminal
      hairs present. Terminal hair counts can be conducted in a number
      of ways as known in the art. A non-limiting example is where the
      terminal hair is counted by trained and validated technicians who
      perform a computer-assisted count on macrophotographs. In brief, a
      target area on the scalp is chosen, the hair clipped and the scalp
      permanently marked with a single dot tattoo in the center in order
      to facilitate the exact positioning at each subsequent photo
      session. The macrophotography is performed using a preset camera
      with a macro lens and a stand that provides a constant
      reproduction ratio and electronic flashes that reproducibly
      illuminate the area to photograph. The images are taken in
      triplicate, centering the camera using the tattoo and the color
      slide films are processed at a central facility. The quality of
      the images is assessed and large transparencies are made of the
      best images. The terminal hairs on the target circle of the
      transparencies are then counted by the trained technicians.<br>
      <br>
      In all embodiments of the invention, the disclosed PDT mediated
      methods may be repeated over time and preferably result in a 2% or
      more increase in the number of terminal hairs within 3 months.<br>
      <br>
      In another aspect, the invention is directed to formulations or
      compositions comprising photosensitizers for treating lack of hair
      growth or a reduction or loss of existing hair with the methods of
      the invention. These compositions comprise an effective amount of
      photosensitizer, optionally with a pharmaceutically acceptable
      carrier or excipient, and may also be used to prevent or inhibit
      the development of hair growth reduction or hair loss. The
      invention includes pharmaceutical compositions targeted to hair
      follicles, the surrounding tissue, or tissues which feed hair
      follicles. In particular, formulations comprising photosensitizers
      conjugated to agents, which specifically target or bind
      appropriate scalp or skin tissues, hair follicles, or tissues and
      cells surrounding said hair follicles, are preferred for use in
      the methods of the invention. Compositions comprising conjugated
      or unconjugated photosensitizers are optionally formulated with
      agents suitable or preferred for application to the scalp, or
      other skin where hair growth is desired. Examples of such agents
      include pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also provides for methods of using photosensitizer
      formulations and compositions in preparing an area of skin for PDT
      to increase the number of terminal hairs in said area, or to treat
      AGA, said methods comprising administering, preferably by topical
      administration, such formulations and compositions to said area.<br>
      <br>
      In one set of preferred embodiments, the invention is practiced
      with a photosensitizer that is photoactivated by light of a
      wavelength from about 400 to about 900 nm. In another set of
      preferred embodiments of the invention, the treatment methods and
      compositions comprise the use of a particularly potent group of
      photosensitizers known as green porphyrins, which are described in
      detail in Levy et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,171,749 issued 15 Dec.
      1992, which is incorporated herein by reference. The term "green
      porphyrins" refers to porphyrin derivatives obtained by reacting a
      porphyrin nucleus with an alkyne in a Diels-Alder type reaction to
      obtain a mono-hydrobenzoporphyrin. In particular, green porphyrin
      compounds such as benzoporphyrin derivative mono-acid (BPD-MA),
      EA6, and B3 may be used in the invention. Two preferred members of
      the green porphyrin family are verteporfin (comprising the 4
      enantiomers shown below) and QLT 0074.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, the methods of the invention preferably comprise
      irradiation with visible light containing a wavelength absorbed by
      Gp.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also provides methods of stimulating an increase in
      tissue levels of one or more growth factors or cytokines in cells
      present within skin tissue by the use of PDT. More particularly,
      the cytokines include, but are not limited to,
      interleukin-1-[alpha], interleukin-1-[beta], and
      granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Without
      being bound by theory, it is believed that PDT mediated increases
      in pro-inflammatory cytokines play a role in inducing hair,
      particularly terminal hair, growth as described herein. The
      invention also provides for the use of such increases in the
      treatment of other conditions.<br>
      <br>
      In another aspect, the invention provides for methods to determine
      the amount of increase in hair growth mediated by PDT. These
      methods may be practiced with any photosensitizer in various
      amounts or concentrations and with use of various irradiation
      regimens, including, but not limited to, those with variations in
      timing, radiation energy dose and/or rate, and wavelength of
      radiation. In one embodiment, such methods comprise<br>
      <br>
      (a) administering a photosensitizer to skin exhibiting hair growth
      reduction or hair loss;<br>
      <br>
      (b) irradiating said skin with electromagnetic energy containing a
      wavelength absorbed by said photosensitizer to activate it; and<br>
      <br>
      (c) measuring the increase in hair growth,<br>
      <br>
      wherein an increase in hair growth in comparison to skin that has
      not been treated with both a) and b) can be determined.
      Preferably, the photosensitizer is one which absorbs activating
      radiation in the range of about 400 nm to about 800 nm and is
      administered by topical application. Said measuring can be by any
      means known to the skilled person, including, but not limited to,
      counting the number of terminal hairs, measuring hair weight,
      measuring hair density, and/or measuring hair shaft diameter, most
      preferably by counting the number of terminal hairs. Preferably,
      the skin that has not been treated has not been treated with one
      of a) and b)...<b><br>

            How Global Freedom Would Die</b><br>
        </big><br>
        <b>by Isaac Davis</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>In a televised interview with ABC’s Mike Wallace in 1958,
      author of the seminal classic Brave New World, Aldous Huxley laid
      out his rather grim vision for the future of the human race in a
      prescient and timeless warning for us to wake up. After having
      lived through the bloodbaths of World War I and II and in the
      early stages of the nuclear cold war, he discussed the problems of
      freedom and survival in America, making a number of predictions
      more relevant today, nearly 60 years later, than ever before.<br>
      <br>
      Huxley, as introduced by Wallace:<br>
      <br>
      “A man haunted by a vision of hell on earth. A searing social
      critic, Mr. Huxley 27 years ago wrote Brave New World, a novel
      that predicted that someday the entire world would live under a
      frightful dictatorship. Today Mr. Huxley says that his fictional
      world of horror is probably just around the corner for all of us.”
      ~Mike Wallace<b><br>
        <br>
      </b>As the world now sleepwalks into a third world war which will
      certain bring about a nuclear holocaust, Huxley’s message is more
      important than ever because it serves as a reminder that a
      critically thinking individual is the truest and most formidable
      weapon against the destructive and psychopathic tendencies of
      tyrants.<br>
      <br>
      The following 6 predictions taken from this interview were
      exceptionally farsighted at the time, and are presented here as an
      amplification of Huxley’s imperative that we all must wake up to
      the truth of how power is misused in our world.<br>
      <br>
      <b>1.) Technology, Bureaucracy and Television Would be Used to
        Enslave Us<br>
        <br>
      </b>HUXLEY: As technology becomes more and more complicated, it
      becomes necessary to have more and more elaborate organizations,
      more hierarchical organizations, and incidentally the advance of
      technology is being accompanied by an advance in the science of
      organization.<br>
      <br>
      It’s now possible to make organizations on a larger scale than it
      was ever possible before, and so that you have more and more
      people living their lives out as subordinates in these
      hierarchical systems controlled by bureaucracy, either the
      bureaucracies of big businesses or the bureaucracies of big
      government.<br>
      <br>
      HUXLEY: Hitler used terror on the one kind, brute force on the one
      hand, but he also used a very efficient form of propaganda, which
      er…he was using every modern device at that time. He didn’t have
      TV., but he had the radio which he used to the fullest extent, and
      was able to impose his will on an immense mass of people. I mean,
      the Germans were a highly educated people.<br>
      <br>
      WALLACE: Well, we’re aware of all this, but how do we equate
      Hitler’s use of propaganda with the way that propaganda, if you
      will, is used let us say here in the United States. Are you
      suggesting that there is a parallel?<br>
      <br>
      HUXLEY: Needless to say it is not being used this way now, but,
      er…the point is, it seems to me, that there are methods at present
      available, methods superior in some respects to Hitler’s method,
      which could be used in a bad situation. I mean, what I feel very
      strongly is that we mustn’t be caught by surprise by our own
      advancing technology.<br>
      <br>
      This has happened again and again in history with technology’s
      advance and this changes social condition, and suddenly people
      have found themselves in a situation which they didn’t foresee and
      doing all sorts of things they really didn’t want to do.<br>
      <br>
      WALLACE: And well, what…what do you mean? Do you mean that we
      develop our television but we don’t know how to use it correctly,
      is that the point that you’re making?<br>
      <br>
      HUXLEY: Well, at the present the television, I think, is being
      used quite harmlessly; it’s being used, I think, I would feel,
      it’s being used too much to distract everybody all the time. But,
      I mean, imagine which must be the situation in all communist
      countries where the television, where it exists, is always saying
      the same things the whole time; it’s always driving along.<br>
      <br>
      It’s not creating a wide front of distraction it’s creating a
      one-pointed, er…drumming in of a single idea, all the time. It’s
      obviously an immensely powerful instrument.<br>
      <br>
      WALLACE: Uh-huh. So you’re talking about the potential misuse of
      the instrument.<br>
      <br>
      HUXLEY: Exactly. We have, of course…all technology is in itself
      moral and neutral. These are just powers which can either be used
      well or ill; it is the same thing with atomic energy, we can
      either use it to blow ourselves up or we can use it as a
      substitute for the coal and the oil which are running out.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2.) Advertising Will Bypass Rationality and Capture the Mind’s
        of Children<br>
        <br>
      </b>HUXLEY: …advertisement plays a very necessary role, but the
      danger it seems to me in a democracy is this…I mean what does a
      democracy depend on? A democracy depends on the individual voter
      making an intelligent and rational choice for what he regards as
      his enlightened self-interest, in any given circumstance.<br>
      <br>
      But what these people are doing, I mean what both, for their
      particular purposes, for selling goods and the dictatorial
      propagandists are for doing, is to try to bypass the rational side
      of man and to appeal directly to these unconscious forces below
      the surfaces so that you are, in a way, making nonsense of the
      whole democratic procedure, which is based on conscious choice on
      rational ground.<br>
      <br>
      WALLACE: Of course, well, maybe…I…you have just answered this next
      question because in your essay you write about television
      commercials, not just political commercials, but television
      commercials as such and how, as you put it, “Today’s children walk
      around singing beer commercials and toothpaste commercials.” And
      then you link this phenomenon in some way with the dangers of a
      dictatorship. Now, could you spell out the connection or, have…or
      do you feel you’ve done so sufficiently?<br>
      <br>
      HUXLEY: Well, I mean, here, this whole question of children, I
      think, is a terribly important one because children are quite
      clearly much more suggestible than the average grownup; and again,
      suppose that, er…that for one reason or another all the propaganda
      was in the hands of one or very few agencies, you would have an
      extraordinarily powerful force playing on these children, who
      after all are going to grow up and be adults quite soon. I do
      think that this is not an immediate threat, but it remains a
      possible threat, and…<br>
      <br>
      WALLACE: You said something to the effect in your essay that the
      children of Europe used to be called ‘cannon fodder’ and here in
      the United States they are ‘television and radio fodder.’<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;HUXLEY: Well, after all, you can read in the trade journals
      the most lyrical accounts of how necessary it is, to get hold of
      the children because then they will be loyal brand buyers later
      on. But I mean, again you just translate this into political
      terms, the dictator says they all will be ideology buyers when
      they are grownup.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.) The Rise of Dictatorship Based on Terrorism</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      HUXLEY: I think this kind of dictatorship of the future, I think
      will be very unlike the dictatorships which we’ve been familiar
      with in the immediate past. I mean, take another book prophesying
      the future, which was a very remarkable book, George Orwell’s
      “1984.”<br>
      <br>
      Well, this book was written at the height of the Stalinist regime,
      and just after the Hitler regime, and there he foresaw a
      dictatorship using entirely the methods of terror, the methods of
      physical violence. Now, I think what is going to happen in the
      future is that dictators will find, as the old saying goes, that
      you can do everything with bayonets except sit on them!<br>
      <br>
      <b>4.) The Pharmacological Revolution Will Make Us Love Slavery</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      HUXLEY: …this is the… the pharmacological revolution which is
      taking place, that we have now powerful mind-changing drugs which
      physiologically speaking are almost costless. I mean they are not
      like opium or like coca…cocaine, which do change the state of mind
      but leave terrible results physiologically and morally.<br>
      <br>
      If you want to preserve your power indefinitely, you have to get
      the consent of the ruled, and this they will do partly by drugs as
      I foresaw in “Brave New World,” partly by these new techniques of
      propaganda.<br>
      <br>
      They will do it by bypassing the sort of rational side of man and
      appealing to his subconscious and his deeper emotions, and his
      physiology even, and so, making him actually love his slavery.<br>
      <br>
      I mean, I think, this is the danger that actually people may be,
      in some ways, happy under the new regime, but that they will be
      happy in situations where they oughtn’t to be happy.<br>
      <br>
      We know, there is enough evidence now for us to be able, on the
      basis of this evidence and using certain amount of creative
      imagination, to foresee the kind of uses which could be made by
      people of bad will with these things and to attempt to forestall
      this…<br>
      <br>
      <b>5.) Political Candidates Would Become Merchandise Marketed by
        Professionals</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      WALLACE: You write in Enemies of Freedom, you write specifically
      about the United States. You say this, writing about American
      political campaigns you say, “All that is needed is money and a
      candidate who can be coached to look sincere; political principles
      and plans for specific action have come to lose most of their
      importance. The personality of the candidate, the way he is
      projected by the advertising experts, are the things that really
      matter.”<br>
      <b><br>
      </b>HUXLEY: Well, this is the…during the last campaign, there was
      a great deal of this kind of statement by the advertising managers
      of the campaign parties. This idea that the candidates had to be
      merchandised as though they were soap and toothpaste and that you
      had to depend entirely on the personality.<br>
      <br>
      I mean, personality is important, but there are certainly people
      with an extremely amiable personality, particularly on TV, who
      might not necessarily be very good in political…positions of
      political trust.<br>
      <br>
      WALLACE: Well, do you feel that men like Eisenhower, Stevenson,
      Nixon, with knowledge aforethought were trying to pull the wool
      over the eyes of the American public?<br>
      <br>
      HUXLEY: No, but they were being advised by powerful advertising
      agencies who were making campaigns of a quite different kind from
      what had been made before. and I think we shall see probably,
      er…all kinds of new devices coming into the picture. I mean, for
      example, this thing which got a good deal of publicity last
      autumn, subliminal projection.<br>
      <br>
      WALLACE: And we’ll be persuaded to vote for a candidate that we do
      not know that we are being persuaded to vote for.<br>
      <br>
      HUXLEY: Exactly, I mean this is the rather alarming picture that
      you’re being persuaded below the level of choice and reason.<br>
      <br>
      <b>6. ) Evil People Will Take Advantage of Technology and
        Government to Gain Power</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      WALLACE: The question, of course, that keeps coming back to my
      mind is this: obviously politics in themselves are not evil,
      television is not in itself evil, atomic energy is not evil, and
      yet you seem to fear that it will be used in an evil way. Why is
      it that the right people will not, in your estimation, use them?
      Why is it that the wrong people will use these various devices and
      for the wrong motives?<br>
      <br>
      HUXLEY: Well, I think one of the reasons is that these are all
      instruments for obtaining power, and obviously the passion for
      power is one of the most moving passions that exists in man; and
      after all, all democracies are based on the proposition that power
      is very dangerous and that it is extremely important not to let
      any one man or any one small group have too much power for too
      long a time.<br>
      <br>
      After all what are the British and American Constitution except
      devices for limiting power, and all these new devices are
      extremely efficient instruments for the imposition of power by
      small groups over larger masses.<br>

        Final Thoughts<br>
        <br>
      </b>This interview was recorded 27 years after the publication of
      Brave New World, which in and of itself was an eloquent warning to
      freedom loving people. Fast-forward to 2016 and we find that
      Huxley was right on every account,<br>

      <b><b><br>
        </b></b>The single, most impressive finding was that on direct
      waking suggestion of symptom relief, all glaucomatous patients
      showed a drop in the pressure of one or both eyes to a level as
      low as ( 1case) or lower than (6cases) the lowest recorded tension
      during the previous 12months that they had been followed in the
      eye clinic.<br>
      <br>
      (One subject had been followed for only 3&nbsp; months.) Post
      hypnotic suggestion of symptom relief resulted in subjective
      improvement only in several of the patients. These patients
      volunteered such improvement as having fewer headaches, less

      <div align="center"><b>Scientists have created a drug that
          replicates the health benefits of exercise</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Researchers have made the breakthrough of couch potatoes’ dreams
      with a new drug that mimics some of the most important effects of
      exercise. Scientists from Deakin University in Melbourne published
      their findings in Cell Reports earlier this week, showing that
      overweight mice who were given the drug no longer showed signs of
      cardiovascular disease.<br>
      <br>
      The biologists began their research almost a decade ago, says Sean
      McGee, associate professor of medical biology at the school, with
      the specific goal of replicating the effects of exercise. They
      began by examining the molecular response to exercise in muscle.
      The genes that control for lipid metabolism turn on during
      exercise, which causes the body to burn the fat that contributes
      to heart disease. McGee and his team found the protein that keeps
      these genes turned off most of the time, and were able to
      genetically manipulate it in order to turn on the fat-burning
      genes.<br>
      <br>
      Testing on mice showed that, in burning the fats, the drug
      effectively prevented heart disease in obese mice. The researchers
      are now redesigning the drug structure to make it more potent,
      specific—and effective for humans. Though testing has thus far
      been limiting to mice, they hope to have it available for human
      use in five- to 10 years.<br>
      <br>
      Though the drug could have huge health benefits for people with
      obesity and type-2 diabetes, McGee notes that it does not
      replicate all the benefits of exercise. For example, it doesn’t
      induce the same increase in endorphins.<br>
      <br>
      And mice who were given the drug did not lose weight. “Although it
      increases energy expenditure and fat burning, mice treated with
      the drug also ate a little bit more, meaning they remained weight
      stable,” says McGee.<br>
      <br>
      Last year, scientists at the University of Sydney created a
      blueprint of the molecular effects of exercise, with the long-term
      goal of creating a drug that completely replicates the effects of
      exercise. Rather than rewarding an inactive lifestyle, scientists
      hope that the drugs could have serious health benefits for the
      elderly, or those who struggle to do physical exercise.<b><br>

          Wounds and Trigger Cellular Regeneration</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Research by Russian scientists has revealed the efficacy of
      cold plasma as a treatment for non-healing wounds. Their study
      conclusions could lead to much-needed relief for the millions of
      people suffering from chronic open wounds.<br>
      <b><br>
        A Chilly Discovery<br>
        <br>
      </b>Non-healing wounds are troublesome to treat, with current
      methods teetering between extremely difficult and impossible, but
      cold plasma might be able to change all that.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers have attempted to use cold atmospheric-pressure plasma
      — a partially ionized gas with a proportion of charged particles
      close to 1 percent and a temperature of 99,726°C (179,540ºF) — for
      medical treatment before, but never specifically for non-healing
      wounds. Apart from confirming the bactericidal properties of cold
      plasma and showing that cells and tissues have a high resistance
      to it, those earlier studies yielded non-conclusive results. <br>
      <br>
      By focusing on application pattern, a team of researchers from
      Russia’s Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT) were
      able to reach more definite conclusions, establishing that cold
      plasma could indeed help heal non-healing wounds and trigger
      cellular regeneration. <br>
      <br>
      To test their hypothesis that application was key, the researchers
      studied the effects of cold plasma treatment using two kinds of
      cells (connective tissue cells called fibroblasts and epithelial
      cells called keratinocytes) and three regimes of application. They
      were able to conclude that a single application was most effective
      in triggering regeneration and also observed that plasma treatment
      significantly reduced the levels of β-galactosidase, an enzyme
      that triggers cellular aging, in their samples.<br>
      <b><br>
        Relief, Finally.<br>
        <br>
      </b>These results mean that the effect of plasma treatment can now
      be characterized as regenerative, as opposed to just neutral or
      even harmful. This opens doors for further research in the area
      and could lead to the development of a plasma therapy program for
      the reported 5.7 million patients suffering from open (chronic)
      wounds.<br>
      <br>
      In their future research, the scientists are planning to look into
      the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of plasma on cells
      and will also attempt to determine what impact, if any, a
      patient’s age has on the effectiveness of plasma therapy.<br>
      <br>
      If this research is any indication, a whole lot of people may
      experience an improved quality of life thanks to cold plasma
      therapy in the future.<b><br>

      <b>Abstract<br>
        <br>
      </b>The purpose of this work was to establish the influence of a
      regime of cold microwave argon plasma treatments on the
      physiological characteristics of human fibroblasts and
      keratinocytes. We used three regimes of plasma application: a
      single treatment, double treatment with a 48 h interval, and daily
      treatments for 3 d. Cell proliferation after plasma application
      was quantified in real time, and immunohistochemistry was used to
      establish the viability of the cells and determine changes in
      their physiology.<br>
      <br>
      It was established that the frequency of cell treatments is
      important for the outcome. In the samples treated with single
      plasma application and double plasma applications with a 48 h
      interval, a 42.6% and 32.0% increase was observed in the number of
      cells, respectively. In addition, there were no signs of
      deoxyribonucleic acid breaks immediately after plasma application.
      In contrast, plasma application increased the accumulation of
      cells in the active phases of the cell cycle. The activation of
      proliferation correlated with a decrease in the level of
      β-galactosidase, a senescence marker. This could be due to cell
      renovation after plasma application. Daily treatment decreased
      cell proliferation up to 29.1% in comparison with the control
      after 3 d.<b><br>

        SPECIAL REPORT<br>
        Contact: Editor@MedicalVeritas.org — (808)-946-6999.<br>
      </b><br>
      A team of experts investigating ZIKA fraud for a non-profit public
      health advocacy group in the United States has concluded that the
      spraying of toxic pesticides and release of government-approved
      genetically-modified (“GM”) mosquitoes to fight ZIKA has been
      schemed by a racketeering enterprise commercializing in
      bio-terrorism and “crisis capitalism.”.<br>
      <br>
      Experts from several fields filed a critical review of available
      intelligence for publication in Medical Veritas Journal evidencing
      a “high probability” of ZIKA fraud. The data identifies a criminal
      enterprise commercializing in bio-terrorism and crisis capitalism
      as the most probable cause of the costly and damaging ZIKA
      “emergency.” <br>
      <br>
      According to the reviewers, politicians and the media are
      “selling” citizens on unproven methods of “disease control” in
      Florida and elsewhere. The experts also question the “mystery” of
      ZIKA’s emergence from a Brazilian vaccine experiment generating
      mutated viruses, and then promoting drugs, vaccines, pesticides
      and genetically-modified (“GM”) mosquitoes to combat the plague.<br>
      <br>
      In conclusion, the professional group condemned “the creation of
      ‘alien species’ of microbes,” including ZIKA, as an “obvious
      man-made threat.” The MVI contributors wrote “this reckless
      disregard for life, nature, and the sanctity of intelligent design
      central to the physical sciences, is unconscionable.” <br>
      <br>
      The group recommends the remedy advanced by the U.S. Central
      Intelligence Agency (CIA) and IBM to regulate the medical industry
      applicable also to the judicial system to save costs, restrain
      corruption, reduce fraud, and discipline violators.<b><br>

      <b><br>
      </b>In the film "Erin Brockovich," the environmental crusader
      confronts the lawyer of a power company that polluted the tap
      water of Hinkley, Calif., with a carcinogenic chemical called
      chromium-6. When the lawyer picks up a glass of water, Brockovich
      says: “We had that water brought in ‘specially for you folks. Came
      from a well in Hinkley.”<br>
      <br>
      The lawyer sets down the glass and says, "I think this meeting’s
      over."<br>
      <br>
      But almost 25 years after that real-life confrontation,[1] the
      conflict over chromium-6 is not over. A new EWG analysis of
      federal data from nationwide drinking water tests shows that the
      compound contaminates water supplies for more than 200 million
      Americans in all 50 states. Yet federal regulations are stalled by
      a chemical industry challenge that could mean no national
      regulation of a chemical state scientists in California and
      elsewhere say causes cancer when ingested at even extraordinarily
      low levels…<b><br>

      Activated charcoal has long been used in medical settings to treat
      poisonings and drug overdoses. Unlike the charcoal we use for
      barbecues, this stuff is created when carbon is treated with an
      oxidizing agent, which results in a fine dust with millions of
      pores and an immense surface area. It’s these pores that give
      activated charcoal its sponge-like qualities, reducing the body’s
      absorption of toxic substances by an estimated 47 percent. It’s
      not the most specific absorber of substances,though, meaning it
      will absorb both good and bad substances in your stomach, but as
      long as you consume lots of water after ingesting it, you should
      be fine.<br>
      <br>
      But while the toxin-absorbing properties of activated charcoal are
      well documented, its recent uses as an edible food ingredient and
      teeth whitening agent are not. No charcoal-based teeth whitening
      products have been evaluated and accepted by the American Dental
      Association (ADA) until now, but that hasn’t stopped proponents
      from recommending it as an excellent all-natural way to get a
      shinier smile.<br>
      <br>
      Apparently,the natural adhesive qualities of activated charcoal
      let it bind with surface-staining culprits like coffee, tea, wine,
      and plaque, removing them from your teeth for good. Simply pop a
      capsule of the stuff, mix the contents with some water, put the
      paste on a toothbrush and clean your teeth for a few minutes. It’s
      a messy job, as the charcoal makes your mouth look like that of a
      horror movie monster and is known to stain grout and fabrics, but
      I guess it’s worth it, if it can make your teeth whiter.<br>
      <br>
      You’re going to find lots of dramatic before-and-after photos of
      people who promote the use of activated charcoal as an alternative
      to fluoride, but the jury is still out on whether it actually
      works. Dental specialists definitely don’t believe it does.
      “There’s no scientific indication that [activated charcoal]
      actually works and there are better options out there that do
      work,” Dr. Kim Harms, a Mineapolis-based dentists and spokesperson
      for the ADA, told The Daily Beast. “The important part of brushing
      and flossing is the physical removal of plaque. The toothpaste
      you’re using, from a dentist’s point of view, delivers fluoride to
      teeth. We’re concerned about practices where people are using
      products without fluoride. Fluoride is nature’s cavity fighter and
      can cut tooth decay by up to 40 percent.”<br>
      <br>
      “Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is,” said
      Dr. Mark Wolff, DDS, Professor and Chair of the Department of
      Cariology and Comprehensive Care at the New York University
      College of Dentistry. “I still recommend any of the mainstream
      whitening toothpastes or seeing the dentist. The mainstream
      whitening toothpastes are going to be safe. There are a number of
      products on the market that can be too abrasive.”<br>
      <br>
      But with the huge amounts of money being thrown around by
      companies to have their products promoted, I guess one could argue
      that such experts are biased. However, experiments done by
      ordinary people (like this one) have also yielded unimpressive
      results. On the flipside, there are loads of people who swear by
      this practice, claiming that as long as your teeth are not
      naturally darker or yellow, you’re going to see an improvement
      after just one charcoal brushing session.<b><br>

        <b>A Scientific Case for Nibiru/Planet X System</b><br>
        <b><br>
          By Joachim Hagopian</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Speculating and theorizing about the existence of yet
      undiscovered planets in our solar system has been bounced around
      for centuries. Prior to each new discovery of another outer planet
      has come detection of anomalies in the erratic, inexplicable
      motions of the outermost known planet. For instance, before
      Neptune’s existence was determined, for decades astronomers had
      been theorizing that Uranus’ (discovered in 1781) irregular
      movement may have been caused by the presence of yet another
      undiscovered planet. Indeed that was the case in 1846 when Neptune
      was first sighted and identified.<br>
      <br>
      The now dethroned ninth planet Pluto discovered in 1930 (relegated
      in 2006 to minor dwarf planet status) and Pluto’s later found moon
      Charon were then used to explain the observed “wobbles” in Uranus
      and Neptune’s respective orbits. Thus, errors in calculating
      precise positions of known planets hold an enduring pattern of
      later confirmation of cause determined by each newly discovered
      planet. Hence, for over a century scientists have debated that yet
      more major planets and dwarf planets belonging to our solar system
      are still out there in space waiting to be found and existing
      anomalies to be explained.<br>
      <br>
      Way back in 1940 Chilean astronomer Carlos Munoz Ferrada predicted
      accurately that the powers-that-be would attempt to cover-up
      Planet X when it comes barreling towards the earth. Ferrada
      referred to Nibiru/Planet X as a “Comet-Planet” because it has the
      size of a planet but speed and elliptical orbit of a comet.<br>
      <br>
      The most controversial “undiscovered” planet operating within our
      solar system dubbed Nibiru or Planet X was made (in)famous in 1976
      by noted researcher-author Zecharia Sitchin in his bestselling
      book The 12th Planet. As one of few scholars able to read and
      interpret Sumerian clay tablets, Sitchin utilized those ancient
      texts to make a highly plausible case for the existence of Planet
      X (also known as planet Nibiru the Destroyer in ancient scripts)
      coming closest to planet earth every 3600 years. The Sumerians
      lived over 6000 years ago in what is today Iraq. They are credited
      as the first known civilization on earth, inventing mathematics,
      writing, agriculture, law, schools, astronomy and astrology.<br>
      <br>
      The sun in our solar system is similar to 90% of the solar systems
      in the Milky Way Galaxy, all part of a binary star system
      containing two or more suns. The Planet X system can be considered
      a mini-constellation consisting of our sun’s twin, classified a
      brown dwarf star called Nemesis. This dark star is largely
      invisible even with infrared due to its surrounding red iron oxide
      dust clouds. Nemesis possesses at least three planets that revolve
      around it, Nibiru and Helion both with moons, and Arboda. Though
      Nibiru travels along an elliptical shaped orbit and enters our
      solar system approximately every 3600 years, one by one crossing
      the orbits of our solar system planets, it does not revolve around
      our sun.<br>
      <br>
      In 1990 researcher-author Zecharia Sitchin interviewed the
      supervising astronomer of the US Naval Observatory Robert S.
      Harrington to discuss Harrington’s recent discovery of the red
      Planet X. Harrington set up a special telescopic observatory in
      New Zealand to track Planet X. But the renowned head of the Naval
      Observatory suddenly died mysteriously at age 50 of a rare form of
      cancer under suspicious circumstances. His wife is convinced he
      was murdered for allegedly leaking too much information about
      Planet X.<br>
      <br>
      Yet two years after the Sitchin-Harrington interview and just
      months prior to Harrington’s January 1993 death, a NASA press
      release was still publicly embracing Nibiru/Planet X as real:<br>
      <br>
      Unexplained deviations in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune point
      to a large outer solar system body of 4 to 8 Earth masses on a
      highly tilted orbit, beyond 7 billion miles from the Sun.<br>
      <br>
      Also in 1992 a confident NASA scientist named Ray T. Reynolds went
      on record proclaiming, “Astronomers are so sure of the 10th planet
      they think there is nothing left but to name it.” NASA at that
      time did everything but scream “Nibiru!” from the mountaintops.<br>
      <br>
      But ever since Harrington’s untimely death with few exceptions,
      the lid has been tightly sealed on any more accurate information
      released by mainstream sources directly to the public. Apparently
      the US government had made the decision to keep Nibiru and its
      projected earthly destruction under wraps. In recent years the
      feds have sent out trolls to disseminate disinformation and false
      propaganda in attempts to debunk any would-be truth-tellers. The
      elite ensure that hired shills are planted to busily churn out
      concentrated disinfo campaigns smearing lies to prevent the story
      that never quite goes away from ever having full disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      Hyped up predictions of past non-event disasters are most common,
      like the recent predicted May 28th San Andreas earthquake
      purposely timed with the opening of the film of the same name, or
      the 2012 Mayan calendar doomsday non-event, or the 5/5/2000 ice
      age that never cometh, and who can forget theY2K fiasco, and on
      and on so it goes. The more of these “end days” predictions that
      are proven to be false, the more chance that any legitimate
      warnings of Planet X will be summarily scoffed at and ignored. The
      “boy who cried wolf” syndrome effectively desensitizes the human
      population into doubting any actual evidence or truth about Nibiru
      will ever be taken seriously by any reasonably sane person,
      notwithstanding the “aluminum foil hat” crowd of conspiracy
      realists who are more often right than wrong these days when it
      comes to exposing the myriad of government cover-ups, false flags
      and lies.<br>
      <br>
      The effects of such a large celestial body as Nibiru/Planet X
      estimated to be from 4 up to 8 times the size of the earth
      reentering our solar system is generating off-the-chart internet
      frenzy in 2015, convinced it will cause enormous amounts of huge
      sized space debris from an asteroid belt, potential comets (one
      recently cited to be two and half miles wide) and countless
      meteors plummeting violently to the earth. It’s believed that the
      impact of such giant objects crashing into the earth will push the
      reset button for another axis tilt, likely causing yet another
      mass extinction and radically altering global climate zones,
      raising sea levels dramatically to reshape coastlines worldwide,
      decreasing land mass and increasing oceanic water surface. In
      addition to tilting the earth’s axis, it’s speculated that
      Nibiru’s gravitational upset and electromagnetic fireworks on our
      planet will set off mammoth cracks in the tectonic plates
      resulting in never before seen killer quakes, volcanoes, tsunamis,
      tidal waves, hurricanes, record winds,massive flooding and
      tornados.<b><br>
        <br>
        Scientific Evidence<br>
        <br>
      </b>Rather than dig into ancient mythology or biblical prophecy as
      so much of the current speculation about Nibiru already covers,
      this presentation will limit its focus to reviewing the most
      tangible, credible pieces of scientific evidence supported by
      astronomers and astrophysicists who in recent years have risked
      destroying their careers, reputations and their very lives
      promoting their controversial findings and conclusions. This year
      more than ever the movement’s growing authenticity of the Planet X
      story is in fact gathering momentum, at least garnering lukewarm
      support from some rather high profile notables within the
      scientific community. This article will chronicle this growing
      body of empirical evidence validating not only Planet X’s
      existence but its eminent approach towards earth.<br>
      <br>
      This highly controversial Planet X system entering our solar
      system with potential catastrophic implications was first featured
      in a Washington Post article way back in 1983. NASA’s infrared
      astronomical telescope found the mysterious planet “possibly as
      large as Jupiter” near the constellation of Orion. As distant a
      time as thirty-two years ago, it was considered to be the closest
      heavenly body to the earth beyond Pluto.<br>
      <br>
      Researcher-activist John Moore has long asserted that a number of
      his inside ex-military and government intelligence sources have
      independently confirmed that a top secret meeting took place in
      1979 in a New Orleans briefing room where highest ranking US Naval
      flag officers were first informed of the coming inevitable Planet
      X disaster that would occur within their lifetime.<br>
      <br>
      In October 2003 a highly significant and telling Department of
      Defense sponsored government paper was published called “An Abrupt
      Climate Change Scenario and Its Implications for United States
      National Security.” This paper notes that oceanic saline levels
      were dropping, causing “thermohaline circulation collapse.” A
      serious disruption of the Atlantic conveyor belt that pushes warm
      saltwater near the surface circulating northward from the south
      while deeper cooler water flows southward would have a devastating
      impact on global climate. The paper concludes with the following
      sobering predictions: wars over energy, food and water resources,
      increasing draught over wider land mass, and violent climate
      change effects producing more frequent, higher magnitude natural
      catastrophes of all kinds.&nbsp; A dozen years later all of these
      most disturbing developments are clearly manifesting.<br>
      <br>
      Of course the current standard politically correct scientific
      dogma is that global warming aka climate change emanating from CO2
      greenhouse gases is the obvious culprit. This mass deception is
      designed to conveniently obscure the multiple dire effects caused
      by many decades of the globalists’ geoengineering, HAARP, weather
      modification and weather wars, not to mention the hidden,
      “nonexistent” Planet X system hurtling towards us deeper inside
      our solar system that’s likely causing tremendous changes at the
      surface of all our solar system planets of course including our
      own earth’s atmosphere and global surface.<br>
      <br>
      In March 2010 the mainstream UK newspaper The Telegraph ran a
      story entitled “Search on for Death Star that Throws out Deadly
      Comets.” The sub-headline announced that NASA is looking for the
      twin sun that’s the brown dwarf star Nemesis slowly circling our
      sun and periodically “catapulting” deadly comets to the earth. So
      as tight-lipped NASA has been over the years, little tidbits
      reflecting that it’s still keeping an ever-present eye out for the
      cataclysmic Planet X system still manages to seep through to the
      public every now and then from so called “reputable” news sources.
      The article goes on to state that the star that’s “five times the
      size of Jupiter” is the prime suspect that wiped out the dinosaur
      65 million years ago.<b><br>
      </b><br>
      The then latest NASA trophy piece surveying the heavens, the
      Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), was capable of
      detecting the faint heat emanating from the dwarf star 25 times
      the distance between earth and the sun, or one third a light year
      away. Launched in January 2009 WISE discovered at least 1000 dwarf
      stars located within 25 light years from the sun until October
      2010 when its coolant was scheduled to run out. Twice as far out
      as Nemesis is the Oort Cloud which is the sphere of icy bodies
      surrounding our solar system.<br>
      <br>
      With the Planet X system entering our solar system, its
      gravitational force is believed to launch trajectories of comets
      and asteroids that are large-sized space debris objects of icy
      rocks and dust that bombard our solar system planets including the
      earth. Professor John Matese of the University of Louisiana
      Lafayette believes that this Nemesis that includes planet Nibiru
      as part of the Planet X system is mainly responsible for supplying
      such a concentrated volley of comets from the Oort Cloud into our
      inner solar system.<br>
      <br>
      In May 2012 livescience.com and examiner.com both featured
      headline stories heralding the probable discovery of Planet X.
      Astronomer Rodney Gomes of Rio’s National Observatory of Brazil
      had just presented new evidence of the mysterious planet at a
      meeting of the American Astronomical Society. Gomes demonstrated
      that the icy objects outside Neptune’s orbit in the Oort Cloud
      displaying irregular movement that cannot be explained by known
      mathematical laws of astrophysics but can be by the gravitational
      influence of so called Planet X. Additionally, the dwarf planet
      Sedna’s peculiar orbit can also only be accounted for by the
      presence of a large unknown planet. Gomes findings were very well
      received by his peers, believing that he got his math right. But
      of course not wanting to endorse Planet X completely, they
      dutifully towed the scientific/gov. line of status quo by
      tempering their enthusiasm with a call for more research and
      posing alternative theories that may not involve another large
      planet.<br>
      <br>
      Then in November of last year iflscience.com reported evidence
      that two new undiscovered planets may be lurking in our solar
      system. A January 2015 article from Space.com also addressed the
      possibility of two more planets beyond Neptune and Pluto moving in
      the outer limits of our solar system subtly influencing the orbits
      of the dwarf planets. Carlos de la Fuente of Madrid’s University
      of Complutense stated:<br>
      <br>
      This excess of objects with unexpected orbital parameters makes us
      believe that some invisible forces are altering the distribution
      of the orbital elements of the ETNOs [extreme trans-Neptunian
      objects], and we consider that the most probable explanation is
      that other unknown planets exist beyond Neptune and Pluto.<br>
      <br>
      Still another team of astronomers in March 2014, Chadwick Trujillo
      and Scott Sheppard, announced the discovery of 2012 VP113, another
      ETNO joining Sedna as two known members of the “inner Oort Cloud,”
      the comet-filled sphere that lies just beyond the Kuiper Belt and
      Pluto. Trujillo and Sheppardclaim these two objects’ orbits comply
      with the gravitational presence of a big “perturber,” up to even
      10 times the mass of the earth.<br>
      <br>
      Major unheard of changes are currently appearing on the surface
      and atmosphere of the sun and all the planets. Astronomer Mike
      Lockwood from California’s Rutherford Appleton National
      Laboratories found that since 1901 the sun’s overall magnetic
      field has increased by 230%. Solar flares and storms have also
      increased. The earth’s moon now has a 6000 kilometer-deep
      atmosphere of Natrium that it never had before. Mercury, the
      planet closest to the sun, now has grown polar ice. Venus’
      brightness has skyrocketed by 2500% and experienced major changes
      in its atmosphere in the last four decades. Meanwhile, further
      away from the sun than the earth, Mars has melted polar icecaps
      and its magnitude of storms has strengthened exponentially.<br>
      <br>
      Jupiter has had the brightness of its plasma clouds increase 200%
      accompanied by a pattern of intermittent thickening then
      weakening. The largest planet in our solar system’s enormous belts
      have been changing color with radiation levels erratically waning
      and then flaring up again. An increase in asteroid and comet
      activity crashing into Jupiter likely from Nibiru’s entrance into
      our solar system has also been observed. During the last three
      decades the jet stream on Saturn’s equator has slowed in velocity
      while X-rays at the equator have spiked. Uranus has become
      brighter with a huge flare-up of storm activity when its surface
      before was always placid. Neptune has also increased in brightness
      by 40%. The atmospheric pressure on Pluto has jumped up by 300%
      despite it moving further from the sun. The glowing plasma on the
      edge of our solar system has increased 1000%. The profound changes
      being measured in space are unprecedented. An increase in energy
      emission is changing the fundamental structure of all matter
      throughout our solar system. Taken together, these massive, across
      the board changes most likely are all effects from Planet X moving
      through our solar system.<br>
      <br>
      Of course changes on the earth have been pronounced as well, most
      notably with electromagnetic changes, yearly incremental polar
      axis changes, and extreme weather changes. For instance, North
      Pole, Alaska recently sawits late spring temperatures soar to mid
      to high 80’s F. From 1963 to 1993 the frequency of natural
      disasters globally has leaped up by 410%. And in more recent years
      the rate of disasters has soared even higher. With an increasing
      number of volcanic eruptions along the Pacific Ring of Fire and
      earthquakes felt globally particularly along the San Andreas and
      the New Madrid fault lines, coupled with the Nepal 7.8 earthquake
      a couple months ago, major volcanic and earthquake activity in
      2015 is rapidly on the rise. As early as November 2013 10
      different long- dormant volcanos went active, first suggesting
      Planet X’s presence. The rate of volcanic eruptions from 1875 to
      1975 has increased by 500%, but even greater now.<br>
      <br>
      An exponential increase in 3.0 or higher earthquakes are shaking
      America’s heartland due to fracking, in Oklahoma alone going from
      two or three a year prior to fracking to 562 last year alone.
      Since 1973 earthquakes have risen worldwide by 400%. 6.0 magnitude
      earthquakes or greater have also spiked in recent years, jumping
      on average from 108.5 earthquakes per year in the 1980 to 1989
      decade to 160.9 earthquakes per year from 2000 to 2009, increasing
      by 38.9%. In the first quarter of 2014 alone, more than twice as
      many large earthquakes occurred than on average since 1979. Two
      months ago scientists at the European Science Foundation warned
      that in the years to come there is a 5-10% chance that a colossal
      sized volcano could send the earth back to pre-civilization
      status. A significant rise in landslides and floods have also been
      measured.<br>

      For the last 2000 years the earth’s magnetic field has been
      decreasing gradually. But in the last 500 years that decrease has
      become much more dramatic. Just this month scientists have been
      shocked at the alarming rate that the earth’s magnetosphere has
      been disappearing. The planet’s natural shield preventing solar
      winds and radiation from reaching the earth’s surface is being
      lost. This disturbing discovery comes while solar storm activity
      is also flaring up this year. These solar blasts seriously
      threaten to interfere with satellite and GPS communications, and
      risk bursts of electromagnetic pulses (if not launched by EMP
      weapons in the wrong hands like ISIS) that could be lethal to
      America’s power grid, instantaneously placing millions of people
      in the dark without any source of electricity for months or even
      years at a time.<br>
      <br>
      Effects from a diminishing magnetic field would double the amount
      of radiation causing an epidemic of skin cancer deaths, speed up
      climate change and magnify extreme weather. Solar winds would
      eliminate ions that allow the earth to retain water and air. All
      these horrific changes are happening right now. What next to no
      scientist who wants to stay alive is revealing is that this torrid
      rate of ecological degradation and life killing earth surface
      change are more than likely caused by Planet X racing ever-closer
      toward us.<b><br>
        <br>
      </b>Another rather peculiar development to the Planet X story has
      been Google Sky’s strange actions. Several years ago no doubt in
      literally keeping with the media blackout, Google actually did
      black out the grid in the sky to ensure that Planet X was X’d out
      of its sky map. Then about a week ago Google Sky mysteriously
      reinserted back in the missing grid fully depicting the flaming
      winged Nibiru. So it’s visible from both the actual sky, and the
      Google Skynow… more evidence that the tide is turning toward the
      truth about Planet X.<br>

      with the proposed hypothesis not if, but when. Hmm, sounds
      familiar to the Nibiru cataclysm scenario, minus the forbidden

            energy harvesters</b></b><br>
      </div>
      <b><b><br>
        </b></b>Large quantities of fish are consumed in India on a
      daily basis, which generates a huge amount of fish "biowaste"
      materials. In an attempt to do something positive with this
      biowaste, a team of researchers at Jadavpur University in Koltata,
      India explored recycling the fish byproducts into an energy
      harvester for self-powered electronics. The basic premise behind
      the researchers' work is simple: Fish scales contain collagen
      fibers that possess a piezoelectric property, which means that an
      electric charge is generated in response to applying a mechanical
      stress. As the team reports this week in Applied Physics Letters,
      from AIP Publishing, they were able to harness this property to
      fabricate a bio-piezoelectric nanogenerator. To do this, the
      researchers first "collected biowaste in the form of hard, raw
      fish scales from a fish processing market, and then used a
      demineralization process to make them transparent and flexible,"
      explained Dipankar Mandal, assistant professor, Organic
      Nano-Piezoelectric Device Laboratory, Department of Physics, at
      Jadavpur University. The collagens within the processed fish
      scales serve as an active piezoelectric element. "We were able to
      make a bio-piezoelectric nanogenerator -- a.k.a. energy harvester
      -- with electrodes on both sides, and then laminated it," Mandal
      said. Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting 2016-2026 While it's well
      known that a single collagen nanofiber exhibits piezoelectricity,
      until now no one had attempted to focus on hierarchically
      organizing the collagen nanofibrils within the natural fish
      scales. "We wanted to explore what happens to the piezoelectric
      yield when a bunch of collagen nanofibrils are hierarchically well
      aligned and self-assembled in the fish scales," he added. "And we
      discovered that the piezoelectricity of the fish scale collagen is
      quite large (~5 pC/N), which we were able to confirm via direct
      measurement." Beyond that, the polarization-electric field
      hysteresis loop and resulting strain-electric field hysteresis
      loop -- proof of a converse piezoelectric effect -- caused by the
      "nonlinear" electrostriction effect backed up their findings. The
      team's work is the first known demonstration of the direct
      piezoelectric effect of fish scales from electricity generated by
      a bio-piezoelectric nanogenerator under mechanical stimuli --
      without the need for any post-electrical poling treatments. "We're
      well aware of the disadvantages of the post-processing treatments
      of piezoelectric materials," Mandal noted. To explore the fish
      scale collagen's self-alignment phenomena, the researchers used
      near-edge X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy, measured
      at the Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology in Indore,
      India. Webinars Generic Banner Experimental and theoretical tests
      helped them clarify the energy scavenging performance of the
      bio-piezoelectric nanogenerator. It's capable of scavenging
      several types of ambient mechanical energies -- including body
      movements, machine and sound vibrations, and wind flow. Even
      repeatedly touching the bio-piezoelectric nanogenerator with a
      finger can turn on more than 50 blue LEDs. "We expect our work to
      greatly impact the field of self-powered flexible electronics,"
      Mandal said. "To date, despite several extraordinary efforts, no
      one else has been able to make a biodegradable energy harvester in
      a cost-effective, single-step process." The group's work could
      potentially be for use in transparent electronics, biocompatible
      and biodegradable electronics, edible electronics, self-powered
      implantable medical devices, surgeries, e-healthcare monitoring,
      as well as in vitro and in vivo diagnostics, apart from its myriad
      uses for portable electronics. "In the future, our goal is to
      implant a bio-piezoelectric nanogenerator into a heart for
      pacemaker devices, where it will continuously generate power from
      heartbeats for the device's operation," Mandal said. "Then it will
      degrade when no longer needed. Since heart tissue is also composed
      of collagen, our bio-piezoelectric nanogenerator is expected to be
      very compatible with the heart." The group's bio-piezoelectric
      nanogenerator may also help with targeted drug delivery, which is
      currently generating interest as a way of recovering in vivo
      cancer cells and also to stimulate different types of damaged
      tissues. "So we expect our work to have enormous importance for
      next-generation implantable medical devices," he added. "Our end
      goal is to design and engineer sophisticated ingestible
      electronics composed of nontoxic materials that are useful for a
      wide range of diagnostic and therapeutic applications," said
      Mandal.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Scientists solve puzzle of converting
          gaseous carbon dioxide to fuel</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>A team of scientists from the University of Toronto (U of T)
      believes they've found a way to convert all these emissions into
      energy-rich fuel in a carbon-neutral cycle that uses a very
      abundant natural resource: silicon. Silicon, readily available in
      sand, is the seventh most-abundant element in the universe and the
      second most-abundant element in the earth's crust.<br>
      <br>
      The idea of converting carbon dioxide emissions to energy isn't
      new: there's been a global race to discover a material that can
      efficiently convert sunlight, carbon dioxide and water or hydrogen
      to fuel for decades. However, the chemical stability of carbon
      dioxide has made it difficult to find a practical solution.<br>
      <br>
      "A chemistry solution to climate change requires a material that
      is a highly active and selective catalyst to enable the conversion
      of carbon dioxide to fuel. It also needs to be made of elements
      that are low cost, non-toxic and readily available," said Geoffrey
      Ozin, a chemistry professor in U of T's Faculty of Arts &amp;
      Science, the Canada Research Chair in Materials Chemistry and lead
      of U of T's Solar Fuels Research Cluster.<br>
      <br>
      In an article in Nature Communications published August 23, Ozin
      and colleagues report silicon nanocrystals that meet all the
      criteria. The hydride-terminated silicon nanocrystals -
      nanostructured hydrides for short - have an average diameter of
      3.5 nanometres and feature a surface area and optical absorption
      strength sufficient to efficiently harvest the near-infrared,
      visible and ultraviolet wavelengths of light from the sun together
      with a powerful chemical-reducing agent on the surface that
      efficiently and selectively converts gaseous carbon dioxide to
      gaseous carbon monoxide.<br>
      <br>
      The potential result: energy without harmful emissions.<b><br>
      </b><br>
      "Making use of the reducing power of nanostructured hydrides is a
      conceptually distinct and commercially interesting strategy for
      making fuels directly from sunlight," said Ozin.<br>
      <br>
      The U of T Solar Fuels Research Cluster is working to find ways
      and means to increase the activity, enhance the scale, and boost
      the rate of production. Their goal is a laboratory demonstration
      unit and, if successful, a pilot solar refinery. <b><br>

        Abstract <br>
        <br>
      </b>Silicon constitutes 28% of the earth’s mass. Its high
      abundance, lack of toxicity and low cost coupled with its
      electrical and optical properties, make silicon unique among the
      semiconductors for converting sunlight into electricity. In the
      quest for semiconductors that can make chemicals and fuels from
      sunlight and carbon dioxide, unfortunately the best performers are
      invariably made from rare and expensive elements. Here we report
      the observation that hydride-terminated silicon nanocrystals with
      average diameter 3.5 nm, denoted ncSi:H, can function as a single
      component heterogeneous reducing agent for converting gaseous
      carbon dioxide selectively to carbon monoxide, at a rate of
      hundreds of μmol h−1 g−1. The large surface area, broadband
      visible to near infrared light harvesting and reducing power of
      SiH surface sites of ncSi:H, together play key roles in this
      conversion. Making use of the reducing power of nanostructured
      hydrides towards gaseous carbon dioxide is a conceptually distinct
      and commercially interesting strategy for making fuels directly
      from sunlight.<b><br>

      <div align="center"><b>Nanotech bandage heals wounds in days</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Egyptian researchers have developed a bandage embedded with
      nanoparticles for the treatment of wounds using the anti-epilepsy
      drug Phenytoin, known for its capacity to treat skin injuries.<br>
      <br>
      The bandage can heal wounds in a few days, after just one
      application to soft tissue. Wounds normally take several days to a
      few weeks to heal completely, and some may only heal after several
      months or up to two years.<br>
      <br>
      Even though Phenytoin is known for its potential to accelerate
      wound healing, some of its properties limit its effectiveness. For
      example, a low percentage of the drug can be absorbed into the
      blood circulation. It also doesn’t cover the entire wounded area,
      which interferes with the efficiency of healing.<br>
      <br>
      To overcome these challenges, a research team from Zewail City of
      Science and Technology in Egypt, led by Ibrahim M. El-Sherbiny,
      the director of the Center for Materials Science, embedded the
      drug into a bandage consisting of nanoparticles carried on
      nanofibers.<br>
      <br>
      El-Sherbiny tells SciDev.Net: “This allowed a well-controlled
      release of phenytoin, distributing it effectively, which, boosts
      its efficiency.”<br>
      <br>
      He clarifies that embedding the drug into nanoparticles, and then
      loading it into nanofibers, is one of the most important
      advantages of the bandage design, distinguishing it from other
      bandages.<br>
      <br>
      "It acquired a greater ability [to heal] by increasing the surface
      area available to kill the bacteria, as well as by increasing
      porosity [of the skin], thus increasing its ability to absorb the
      drug,” El-Sherbiny adds.<br>
      <br>
      The team tested the bandage, which was developed in the
      laboratory, on samples of human fibrous tissue and on mice. The
      results showed that the wounds healed completely when using the
      bandage embedded with nanoparticles coated with a layer of
      lecithin as well.<br>
      <br>
      El-Sherbiny stressed: “One bandage is enough to heal wounds within
      10 days at the most.”<br>
      <br>
      The main benefit of the bandage is that it improves the
      reconstruction of the cells that form the epithelial tissue that
      lines the skin, the internal organs and body cavities. This is a
      healing phase that usually begins two days after the wound
      appears, but may be prolonged in some cases to ten weeks.<br>
      <br>
      The bandage also helps speed up the deposition of collagen, a
      protein that is the basic component in forming the skin’s
      connective tissue.<br>
      <br>
      Another advantage, the researchers note, is that the bandage
      minimises formation of dead cells and scars.<br>
      <br>
      They believe that the bandage may be a solution for treating
      wounds in areas of conflict that suffer from a shortage of medical
      supplies and personnel. Moreover, delays in wound healing cost
      health institutions a lot because of extended hospitalization
      periods.<br>
      <br>
      The results of the study, published last May in the Journal of
      Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces, also confirmed an improvement
      in the formation of granulation tissue — a fibrous connective
      tissue which grows from the base of the wound until it fills it,
      and replaces the blood clot that formed after the wound was
      received.<br>
      <br>
      The team achieved yet more results, as El-Sherbiny says: “We are
      currently working on the development of a special bandage for
      diabetic patients, to solve the problem of difficult and slow
      healing of wounds.”<br>
      <br>
      The next step is to manufacture a prototype of the bandage, to
      start marketing commercially, according to El-Sherbiny.<br>
      <br>
      Ahmed Abdel Moneim, head of the Department of Materials
      Engineering Science at the Egyptian-Japanese University, expressed
      admiration for the idea, saying: “Although using nanotechnology in
      bandages is not new, this one stands out most importantly for
      using technology to overcome the negative points of phenytoin, and
      taking advantage of its beneficial use in the treatment of
      wounds.”<br>
      <br>
      He added that it may soon reach the market in the region, as
      health authorities always take less time to approve bandages than
      they do to approve pharmaceuticals.<b><br>

      People often use one of two methods to disinfect germ-ridden water
      in regions that lack a pure source: boiling or placing plastic
      water bottles in direct sunlight so the ultraviolet rays can kill
      microbes. The problem is, boiling uses fuel and the UV method may
      take up to 48 hours without even fully disinfecting the water.<br>
      <br>
      In an effort to find a more effective and energy-efficient
      technique, Stanford researcher Yi Cui and his team developed the
      nanostructure device, made up of fingerprint-like arrangements of
      copper and a photocatalytic chemical called molybdenum disulfide.
      When struck by light, the walled structures release hydrogen
      peroxide and other bactericidal chemicals, which destroy the
      harmful bacteria and quickly dissolve.<br>
      <br>
      ce looks like a little rectangle of black glass,” lead author and
      PhD researcher Chong Liu said in a press release. “We just dropped
      it into the water and put everything under the sun, and the sun
      did all the work.”<br>
      <br>
      Although their experiments killed 99.999 percent of bacteria in 20
      minutes, Cui admits that the device need further research and
      development. For one thing, the trials only tested the device on
      small amounts of water and three strains of bacteria. In other
      words, the experiments lacked the complex mixture of contaminants
      often found in the real world.<br>
      <br>
      However, Cui remains optimistic: “It’s very exciting to see that
      by just designing a material you can achieve a good performance.
      It really works.”<b><br>

        <br>
      </b>The wonder material graphene has been celebrated for its
      strength, lightness, flexibility, and versatility of applications.
      Last year, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology study suggested
      that graphene could bring infrared night vision to everyday
      devices such as laptops and smartphones. In April, scientists at
      the Max-Planck Institute of Intelligent Systems designed
      graphene-based, remote-controlled nanobots to suck up lead
      contamination in water.<br>
      <br>
      Last month, researchers at Washington University in St. Louis
      published a paper detailing their development of a graphene
      oxide-based nanomaterial to effectively filter filthy water into
      drinking water.<br>
      <br>
      Graphene oxide — an inexpensive, paper-like form of graphene — is
      well-known for its ability to absorb light and convert it to heat,
      making it ideal for tasks that involve harvesting sunlight,
      according to Srikanth Singamaneni, associate professor of
      mechanical engineering and materials science and the corresponding
      author of the paper.<br>
      <br>

      resistant<br>
      <br>
      Singamaneni and his team created a two-layered biofoam by
      combining bacteria-produced cellulose and graphene oxide. The
      bottom layer consists of a pure nanocellulose network. The top
      layer is composed of a nanocellulose fiber network that’s embedded
      with graphene oxide flakes.<br>
      <br>
      “When this bilayered foam-like material is suspended on dirty
      water, water is [sucked up] by the pure cellulose layer at the
      bottom — just like a sponge — and brought to the top surface,”
      Singamaneni told Digital Trends.<br>
      <br>
      “Light shining on the top surface is converted to heat by the
      graphene oxide, which causes water to evaporate. The process is
      highly efficient as the heat is not dissipated into the bulk water
      and confined to the surface where evaporation occurs. The
      resulting fresh water can be easily collected from the top of the
      foam.”<br>
      <br>
      The researchers envisage their novel material being used to filter
      tons of water in developing countries that receive sufficient
      sunlight for the light-absorption-to-heat-conversion mechanism to
      occur. But, before that happens, they’ll have to scale the
      material up and run a few additional tests.<br>
      <br>
      “The next step in this research is to integrate this novel
      material into a device that can condense and collect fresh water
      and demonstrate the whole process at a pilot scale,” Singamaneni
      said. “We are also optimizing the graphene oxide content and
      investigating other designs of hybrid material,” including their
      use to boost solar energy harvesting devices.<b><br>

        <i>Engineers develop novel hybrid nanomaterials to transform
          water</i><br>

        <b>By Erika Ebsworth-Goold </b><br>

      <br>
      Graphene oxide has been hailed as a veritable wonder material;
      when incorporated into nanocellulose foam, the lab-created
      substance is light, strong and flexible, conducting heat and
      electricity quickly and efficiently.<br>
      <br>
      Now, a team of engineers at Washington University in St. Louis has
      found a way to use graphene oxide sheets to transform dirty water
      into drinking water, and it could be a global game-changer.<br>
      <br>
      “We hope that for countries where there is ample sunlight, such as
      India, you’ll be able to take some dirty water, evaporate it using
      our material, and collect fresh water,” said Srikanth Singamaneni,
      associate professor of mechanical engineering and materials
      science at the School of Engineering &amp; Applied Science.<br>
      <br>
      The new approach combines bacteria-produced cellulose and graphene
      oxide to form a bi-layered biofoam. A paper detailing the research
      is available online in Advanced Materials.<br>
      <br>
      “The process is extremely simple,” Singamaneni said. “The beauty
      is that the nanoscale cellulose fiber network produced by bacteria
      has excellent ability move the water from the bulk to the
      evaporative surface while minimizing the heat coming down, and the
      entire thing is produced in one shot.<br>
      <br>
      “The design of the material is novel here,” Singamaneni said. “You
      have a bi-layered structure with light-absorbing graphene oxide
      filled nanocellulose at the top and pristine nanocellulose at the
      bottom. When you suspend this entire thing on water, the water is
      actually able to reach the top surface where evaporation happens.<br>
      <br>
      “Light radiates on top of it, and it converts into heat because of
      the graphene oxide — but the heat dissipation to the bulk water
      underneath is minimized by the pristine nanocellulose layer.&nbsp;
      You don’t want to waste the heat; you want to confine the heat to
      the top layer where the evaporation is actually happening.”<br>
      <br>
      The cellulose at the bottom of the bi-layered biofoam acts as a
      sponge, drawing water up to the graphene oxide where rapid
      evaporation occurs. The resulting fresh water can easily be
      collected from the top of the sheet.<br>
      <br>
      The process in which the bi-layered biofoam is actually formed is
      also novel. In the same way an oyster makes a pearl, the bacteria
      forms layers of nanocellulose fibers in which the graphene oxide
      flakes get embedded.<br>
      <br>
      “While we are culturing the bacteria for the cellulose, we added
      the graphene oxide flakes into the medium itself,” said Qisheng
      Jiang, lead author of the paper and a graduate student in the
      Singamaneni lab.<br>
      <br>
      “The graphene oxide becomes embedded as the bacteria produces the
      cellulose. At a certain point along the process, we stop, remove
      the medium with the graphene oxide and reintroduce fresh medium.
      That produces the next layer of our foam. The interface is very
      strong; mechanically, it is quite robust.”<br>
      <br>
      The new biofoam is also extremely light and inexpensive to make,
      making it a viable tool for water purification and desalination.<br>
      <br>
      “Cellulose can be produced on a massive scale,” Singamaneni said,
      “and graphene oxide is extremely cheap — people can produce tons,
      truly tons, of it. Both materials going into this are highly
      scalable. So one can imagine making huge sheets of the biofoam.”<b><br>
        <br>
      </b>“The properties of this foam material that we synthesized has
      characteristics that enhances solar energy harvesting. Thus, it is
      more effective in cleaning up water,” said Pratim Biswas, the Lucy
      and Stanley Lopata Professor and chair of the Department of
      Energy, Environmental and Chemical Engineering.<br>
      <br>
      “The synthesis process also allows addition of other
      nanostructured materials to the foam that will increase the rate
      of destruction of the bacteria and other contaminants, and make it
      safe to drink. We will also explore other applications for these
      novel structures.”<b><br>

          Superbugs WITHOUT Antibiotics — Science Freaks Out</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>by Matt Agorist</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>“There is the danger that the ignorant man may easily
      underdose himself and, by exposing his microbes to non-lethal
      quantities of the drug (antibiotics), make them resistant,”
      Alexander Fleming, the man who discovered penicillin, cautioned at
      the acceptance of his Noble Prize in 1945.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks to the medical-industrial complex and its tendency to
      prescribe antibiotics for just about every illness, including
      viruses, bacteria are getting smarter. Because we are giving
      non-lethal doses of antibiotics to bacteria on a massive scale,
      Fleming’s prediction in 1945, is now coming true.<br>
      <br>
      The limited number of antibiotics in the world cannot keep up with
      the rapid rate of evolving bacteria. The world will soon be in a
      post-antibiotic era.<br>
      <br>
      “Things as common as strep throat or a child’s scratched knee
      could once again kill,” warned the World Health Organization’s
      director-general Margaret Chan in 2012.<br>
      <br>
      This ominous prediction is now swiftly coming in to fruition.<br>
      <br>
      Currently, 700,000 people (230,000 newborns) die every year from
      superbugs that have evolved a resistance to antibiotics. According
      to a British study, that number is estimated to jump to 10,000,000
      by the year 2050 and cost the world economy $100 trillion.<br>
      <br>
      “If we fail to address this problem quickly and comprehensively,
      antimicrobial resistance will make providing high-quality
      universal healthcare coverage more difficult if not impossible,”
      UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told The Guardian. “It will
      undermine sustainable food production. And it will put the
      sustainable development goals in jeopardy.”<br>
      <br>
      The outlook for humanity is, indeed, bleak. However, thanks to a
      handful of research students from the University of Melbourne
      School, we may have hope after all.<br>
      <br>
      Ph.D. student Shu Lam, the study’s lead researcher, believes
      they’ve found a way around antibiotic dependency in the battle
      against bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      “We’ve developed a new class of antimicrobial agents, which are
      very unique. They come in the form of tiny star-shaped molecules
      that are made from short chains of proteins,” Lam told VICE. “We
      found that they are very effective at wiping out [bacterial]
      infections in mice and they are also relatively non-toxic to the
      body.”<br>
      <br>
      These little miracle stars literally tear the bacteria apart by
      attaching to it and destroying the cell wall.<br>
      <br>
      “These star polymers screw up the way bacteria survives,” Lam
      said. “Bacteria need to divide and grow but when our star is
      attached to the membrane it interferes with these processes. This
      puts a lot of stress on the bacteria and it initiates a process to
      kill itself from stress.”<br>
      <br>

      wall. Image supplied by the University of Melbourne.<br>
      <br>
      “We still need to do a lot of studies and a lot of tests—for
      example, to see whether these polymers have any side effects on
      our bodies,” she explained to Vice. “We need a lot of detailed
      assessments like that, [but] they could hopefully be implemented
      in the near future.”<br>
      <br>
      Lam’s study was published in the prestigious journal, Nature
      Microbiology, this month, and has taken the scientific community
      by storm. This small team of scientists may have just saved
      humanity from the brink of extinction.<br>
      <br>
      “This research is significant because everyone is worried about
      superbugs. Suddenly, a lot of people have been telling me that
      either they themselves or their relatives have been infected, that
      they have been in intensive care because of a superbug, and that
      people they know have actually died,” Lam told the Telegraph.<br>
      <br>
      “I really hope that the polymers we are trying to develop here
      could eventually be a solution,” she added.<br>
      <br>
      Because pharmaceutical companies are more interested in developing
      drugs that must be taken for a person’s entire life, thereby
      guaranteeing them future income, only one antibiotic, teixobactin,
      has been developed in the last 30 years.<br>
      <br>
      “Incentives must be found to recreate the prolific era of
      antibiotic discovery that took place from 1940 to 1960,” said
      Margaret Chan, the director of the World Health Organisation.<br>
      Lam’s team may have just created that incentive by changing the
      face of modern medicine.<br>
      <br>
      Lam hopes her “innovative” research will encourage pharmaceutical
      companies to invest, according to the Telegraph. “I hope it will
      attract some interest, because what we have discovered is quite
      different from antibiotics,” she says.<br>
      <br>
      As the Telegraph reports:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor Greg Qiao, her PhD supervisor, says
      that Lam’s project is one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs
      he had seen in his 20 years at Melbourne university. But he
      cautions that it is still in the early stages, and will need at
      least another five years to develop, unless millions of pounds of
      investment can be found to speed the process. Cross-discipline
      work is still required to further reduce toxicity and work out the
      best way to administer the treatment, whether by tablet or
      injection.<br>
      <br>
      “The really good news about this is that, at the moment, if you
      have a superbug and you run out of antibiotics, there’s not much
      you can do. At least you can do something now,” said Qiao.<br>

      treatment of many different conditions, the site-specific delivery
      of a drug directly to or near a desired site of action in the body
      of a subject can be highly desirable to improve the efficacy
      and/or safety of the drug. Certain sites in a subject may require
      sophisticated delivery vehicles to overcome barriers for effective
      drug delivery. For example, the eye has a limited volume for
      administration and requires a pharmaceutical product with a high
      drug loading to ensure that adequate doses of drug can be
      delivered while keeping product volume to a minimum. Despite the
      limited volume it is desirable to be able to deliver drug to the
      site continuously and in a controlled manner over an extended
      period of time.<br>

      [0003] β-blockers are antagonists of beta-adrenoreceptor sites and
      are used to treat or manage a range of conditions, including
      cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, hypotension and glaucoma.
      Elevated intraocular pressure (ocular hypertension) is a risk
      factor for glaucoma. β-blockers can reduce intraocular pressure
      and exert an ocular hypotensive effect by reducing the production
      of aqueous humour in the eye.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Prostaglandin analogues are molecules designed to bind to a
      prostaglandin receptor and are used to treat gastro-intestinal
      acid related disorders such as duodenal and gastric ulcers, as
      abortifacients or uterotonics to induce labour or prevent past
      partum haemorrhage, and to treat ocular hypertension.
      Prostaglandin analogues exert an ocular hypotensive effect by
      increasing uveoscleral outflow of aqueous humour.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Prostaglandin analogues and β-blockers used in the
      treatment of glaucoma are presently formulated as eye drops, which
      if administered conscientiously to the affected eye will lower
      intraocular pressure. This in turn can slow the progression of
      glaucoma. The prostaglandin analogues and β-blockers are
      administered as eye drops, either alone (i.e. as a single agent)
      or in combination. It is postulated that combining prostaglandin
      analogues with β-blockers that exert their effect through a
      different mechanism, may provide an additive effect in reducing
      intraocular pressure. For example, some pharmaceutical
      preparations used in the treatment of glaucoma, such as Xalacom™
      eye drops marketed by Pfizer and Ganfort™ eye drops marketed by
      Allergan, contain a prostaglandin analogue in combination with a
      β-blocker.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Unfortunately, as glaucoma is an asymptomatic disease many
      patients do not use their drops conscientiously, compromising
      therapy. A recent study by Friedman et al. (Friedman et al. IOVS
      2007: 48, 5052-5057) showed that adherence to glaucoma treatment
      options is poor with only 59% of patients in possession of an
      ocular hypotensive agent at 12 months, and only 10% of patients
      used such medication continuously. Patient compliance in glaucoma
      therapy is therefore an issue.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Drug delivery systems have been developed to aid in the
      administration and/or sustained delivery of bioactive agents (such
      as drugs) to a desired site of action. One mode of delivering a
      drug to a subject involves the use of a polymer in association
      with the drug so that it can be delivered to and/or retained at a
      specific location.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] One form of a polymer/drug delivery system utilises an
      admixture of a polymer with a drug, where the drug is blended with
      the polymer matrix. However, such admixtures generally result in
      poor control over the release of the drug, with a “burst effect”
      often occurring immediately after administration and significant
      changes in the physical properties of the admixture occurring as
      the drug is released (Sjoquist, B.; Basu, S.; Byding, P.; Bergh,
      K.; Stjernschantz, J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1998, 26, 745.). In
      addition, such admixtures have limited dose loading capacity,
      resulting in a prohibitively large device for convenient
      administration to some sites in a subject.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Another form of a polymer/drug delivery system is based on
      the polymerisation of a drug so as to incorporate the drug
      molecule as part of the backbone of a polymer chain. Such a system
      is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,613,807, WO2008/128193, WO94/04593
      and U.S. Pat. No. 7,122,615. However, such polymer systems
      generally provide inefficient delivery of the drug, as release of
      the drug relies on breakdown of the polymer backbone. Furthermore,
      breakdown of the polymer backbone produces inactive intermediates.
      Such intermediates can complicate regulatory approval, which may
      require the safety of the intermediates to be demonstrated.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Another approach for preparing polymer-bioactive agent
      conjugates involves the covalent attachment of bioactive agent
      molecules to a pre-formed polymer backbone. Examples of such
      polymer conjugates have been reviewed in Nature Reviews: Drug
      Discovery 2003:2, 347-360. However, this approach can also be
      problematic. In particular, steric and thermodynamic constraints
      can affect the amount of bioactive agent that can be covalently
      attached, and also impact on the distribution of the bioactive
      agent along the polymer backbone. These factors can, in turn,
      reduce control over the release of the bioactive agent.
      Furthermore, the use of a pre-formed polymer backbone provides
      limited scope for modification of the polymer conjugate after
      attachment of the bioactive agent should the properties of the
      conjugate need to be adjusted to improve drug release and/or to
      aid patient comfort, particularly in the eye.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] For efficient delivery, bioactive agents such as drugs are
      ideally pendant from the backbone polymer chain.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In preparing polymer-bioactive agent conjugates,
      step-growth polymerisation is one approach that has been used. By
      means of step-growth polymerisation, polymer-bioactive agent
      conjugates can be prepared by covalently reacting a bioactive
      agent-functionalised monomer having at least two terminal reactive
      functional groups, with a co-monomer of complementary terminal
      functionality. An example is the reaction of a drug-functionalised
      dihydroxy monomer with a diisocyanate co-monomer to form a
      polymer-drug conjugate with a polyurethane polymer backbone.
      However, one problem with step-growth polymerisation methods is
      that many bioactive agents, such as drug molecules, can contain
      multiple functional groups that are capable of participating in
      the covalent reactions used to form the polymer. In such
      circumstances, there is a risk that a functional group on a drug
      molecule could react with a terminal functional group of a
      monomer, leading to intra-chain incorporation of the bioactive
      agent in the polymer. As a result, the bioactive agent becomes
      part of the polymer backbone structure, rather than forming a
      pendant group. Prostaglandin analogues and β-blockers are examples
      of such drugs with multiple nucleophilic functional groups with a
      consequential high risk of in-chain incorporation.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] It would be desirable to provide new polymer-bioactive
      agent conjugates, which address or ameliorate one or more
      disadvantages or shortcomings associated with existing materials
      and/or their method of manufacture, or to at least provide a
      useful alternative to such materials and their method of
      manufacture.<b><br>
        <br>
        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
        <br>
      </b>[0014] The present invention provides in one aspect, a
      polymer-bioactive agent conjugate comprising a polymer backbone
      comprising a plurality of triazole moieties, and a plurality of
      releasable bioactive agents covalently bonded to and pendant from
      the polymer backbone, wherein the bioactive moieties are selected
      from the group consisting of prostaglandin analogues, β-blockers,
      and mixtures thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Polymer-bioactive agent conjugates of the invention are
      obtained through the use of click chemistry, in particular through
      the application of variants of the Huisgen 1,3 dipolar
      cycloaddition of azides and alkynes. With click chemistry, at
      least two co-monomers of appropriate complementary terminal
      functionality covalently react to form the polymer-bioactive agent
      conjugate. At least one of the co-monomers carries a pendant
      bioactive agent. The triazole moieties present in the polymer
      backbone of the polymer-bioactive agent conjugate are reaction
      products obtained from the covalent coupling of terminal
      functional groups present on the co-monomers. Thus, the covalent
      reaction between the co-monomers results in the formation of a
      polymer-bioactive agent conjugate comprising a polymer backbone
      and bioactive agents pendant from the polymer backbone, together
      with triazole moieties in the polymer backbone structure…. <b><br>

          Seizure Explained: The Beast Has Its Head Wounded</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Time is up. A beast described in Revelation 13 is here. His
      number is 666. Please believe Jesus of Nazareth as Messiah and
      repent of sin.<br>
      <br>
      What was witnessed at the 9/11 event was intentional. Hillary
      Clinton fell ill. It wasn't Pneumonia, which I debunk in this
      video. Even Bill Clinton is confused by lie after lie coming from
      Hillary's campaign. He stated that Hillary has "the flu," which is
      a completely different illness. Hillary's Pneumonia was a coverup
      for what really happened at 9/11, she had another seizure, and the
      doctor traveling with her administered the autoinjector to prevent
      a spectacle. Despite this, Hillary's legs still went flaccid and
      her knees buckled. She passed out. However, a body double came out
      posing as Hillary, convincing lame media sources like NBC that she
      was just fine and completely healthy.<br>
      <br>
      The following strange details must be pointed out about the 9/11
      event:<br>
      1) Hillary was allowed to walk without any assistance after
      collapsing.<br>
      2) Hillary fainted in roughly 75 degree weather, but then was
      allowed to go back out in 90 degree midday humidity.<br>
      3) Hillary was allowed to be around politicians and diplomats with
      active Pneumonia.<br>
      4) Hillary was allowed to embrace a little girl with active
      Pneumonia.<br>
      5) Hillary has Pneumonia despite receiving a Pneumonia vaccine in
      2012.<br>
      6) Bill said Hillary had the "flu," which is a completely
      different illness cause by a virus.<br>
      7) The Diazepam autoinjector appears to have been utilized at the
      scene and a part of it dropped on the ground.<br>
      8) Hillary was allowed to be around her daughter, a postnatal
      mother with two children. Even if Chelsea wasn't at the residence
      at the time, Hillary's presence there could spread the pneumonia
      infection.<br>
      9) Hillary Clinton has attended rallies in the past and left early
      for a reason that wasn't related to Pneumonia.<br>
      10) Dr. Bardack diagnosed Hillary with "Non-contagious Bacterial
      Pneumonia." Except, this diagnosis does not exist and
      fundamentally defies the nature of biological pathogenesis.<br>
      <br>
      Looking at all of this evidence, I have concluded that Hillary did
      not have Pneumonia at all. Though it is hard to see her up close
      in the video footage, she looks like she is having another complex
      partial seizure. I wonder if this could have been a 9/11 ritual. I
      do believe Hillary is sick, but the whole scenario seems a bit too
      ritualistic, occurring on the exact day as a commemoration event.<br>
      <br>
      If we look at Hillary alongside some of her colleagues in the
      Senate, her fellow secretaries and diplomats, we can see that
      several individuals who worked for or with Obama have developed
      brain anomalies including brain tumors/cancer, dementia, and
      seizure disorders. Joe Biden has a history of brain aneurysms and
      has had brain surgery to correct them, his son Beau Biden just
      died of a brain tumor. Beau Biden was an up-and-coming politician
      in the Democrat Party. Arlen Specter, a Republican, had a previous
      bout of brain cancer and ended up dying of a third bout of cancer
      in 2012. Obama's former secretary of commerce, John Bryson, who
      was responsible for promoting the market concept behind Obamacare
      (a role of the commerce secretary, not the HHS secretary),
      suffered a seizure while driving, crashed his car, and was later
      diagnosed with "complex partial seizures" in 2012. This was the
      same diagnosis as Hillary Clinton, who fell and hit her head in
      2012. John Roberts, the Chief Justice and Jesuit who stunned the
      world after passing Obamacare on two occasions, suffers from
      Epilepsy. While the Vatican has denied rumors by one of Italy's
      largest newspapers that Pope Francis is suffering from benign
      brain tumors, it appears that Francis has fallen on multiple
      occasions and something is indeed wrong with him. It was leaked
      that Francis was being treated for his brain tumors by a Dr.
      Fukushima. Jimmy Carter, who called everybody racist who opposed
      Obama's initiatives after Freemason Joe Wilson interrupted Obama
      during a key speech on the Obamacare health initiative, has a
      secondary metastatic brain tumor. Edward Kennedy, a primary
      proponent of early Obamacare initiative in the Senate in 2009,
      received a diagnosis of a Glioblastoma. He is now dead.<br>
      <br>
      Obama himself has been the subject of a barrage of rumors about
      his own head scar, which looks like he had an operation called a
      Craniotomy done. Craniotomy's often involve a bone flap is made to
      allow the brain to swell, and after this is done, the bone is put
      back into the incision, but sometime the bone can't be reinserted
      and is replaced with titanium plates. Obama has three head scars
      on the right temporal parietal frontal area, the left temporal
      parietal incision, and a large occipital incision that extends up
      to the parietal bone. Whatever he had done, it was not to one
      region of his brain, but performed to the entirety of his skull.<br>

      I/R operations facilitate the ability to conduct rapid and
      decisive combat operations; deter, mitigate, and defeat threats to
      populations that may result in conflict; reverse conditions of
      human suffering; and build the capacity of a foreign government to
      effectively care for and govern its population. This includes
      capabilities to conduct shaping operations across the spectrum of
      military operations to mitigate and defeat the underlying
      conditions for conflict and counter the core motivations that
      result in support to criminal, terrorist, insurgent, and other
      destabilizing groups. I/R operations also include the daily
      incarceration of U.S. military prisoners at facilities throughout
      the world.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This manual continues the evolution of the I/R
      function to support the changing nature of OEs. In light of
      persistent armed conflict and social turmoil throughout the world,
      the effects on populations remain a compelling issue. The world
      population will increase from 6 billion to 9 billion in the next
      two decades, with 95 percent of the growth occurring in the
      developing world. By 2030, 60 percent of the world’s population
      will live in urban areas. Coexisting demographically and
      ethnically,&nbsp; diverse societies will aggressively compete for
      limited resources.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Typically, overpopulated third world societies
      suffer from a lack of legitimate and effective enforcement
      mechanisms, which is generally accepted as one of the cornerstones
      of a stable society. Stability within a population may eliminate
      the need for direct military intervention. The goal of military
      police conducting detainee operations is to provide stability
      within the population, its institutions, and its infrastructure.
      In this rapidly changing and dynamic strategic environment, U.S.
      forces will compete with local populations for the same space,
      routes, and resources. The modular force’s ability to positively
      influence and shape the opinions, attitudes, and behaviors of
      select populations is critical to tactical, operational, and
      strategic success.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An adaptive enemy will manipulate populations
      that are hostile to U.S. intent by instigating mass civil
      disobedience, directing criminal activity, masking their
      operations in urban and other complex terrain,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; maintaining an indistinguishable presence
      through cultural anonymity, and actively seeking the traditional
      sanctuary of protected areas as defined by the rules of land
      warfare. Such actions will facilitate the dispersal of threat
      forces, negate technological overmatches, and degrade targeting
      opportunities. Commanders will use technology and conduct police
      intelligence operations to influence and control populations,
      evacuate detainees and, conclusively, transition rehabilitative
      and reconciliation operations to other functional agencies. The
      combat identification of friend, foe, or neutral is used to
      differentiate combatants from noncombatants and friendly forces
      from threat forces.<br>

      Civilian Internees<b><br>
        <br>
      </b>1-10. A CI is a civilian who is interned during armed
      conflict, occupation, or other military operation for security
      reasons, for protection, or because he or she committed an offense
      against the detaining power. (JP 3-63) CIs, unless they have
      committed acts for which they are considered unlawful combatants,
      generally qualify for protected status according to the GC, which
      also establishes procedures that must be observedwhen depriving
      such civilians of their liberty. CIs are to be accommodated
      separately from EPWs and persons deprived of liberty for any other
      reason.<br>
      <br>
      1-11. Protected persons are persons protected by the Geneva
      Convention who find themselves, in case of a conflict or
      occupation, in the hands of a party to the conflict or occupying
      power of which they are not nationals. (AR 190-8). Protected
      persons who are interned for imperative reasons of security are
      also known as CIs. Protected persons under the Geneva Conventions
      include—<br>
      <br>
      Hors de combat (refers to the prohibition of attacking enemy
      personnel who are “out of combat”).<br>
      Detainees (combatants and CIs).<br>
      Wounded and sick in the field and at sea.<br>
      Civilians.<br>
      <br>
      Note. If protected persons are detained as spies or saboteurs or
      are suspected of or engaged in activities hostile to the security
      of the state or occupying power, they may be interned or
      imprisoned. In such cases, they retain their status as a protected
      person and are granted the full rights and privileges of protected
      persons.<b><br>
        <br>
        DISLOCATED CIVILIANS<br>
        <br>
      </b>1-19. The term dislocated civilian is a broad term that
      includes a displaced person, an evacuee, an expellee, an
      internally displaced person, a migrant, a refugee, or a stateless
      person. (JP 3-57) DCs are individuals who leave their homes for
      various reasons, such as an armed conflict or a natural disaster,
      and whose movement and physical presence can hinder military
      operations. They most likely require some degree of aid, such as
      medicine, food, shelter, or clothing. DCs may not be native to the
      area or to the country in which they reside. (See chapter 10.) The
      following DC subcategories are also defined in JP 3-57:<br>
      <br>
      Displaced person. A displaced person is a civilian who is
      involuntarily outside the national boundaries of his or her
      country. (JP 1-02) Displaced persons may have been dislocated
      because of a political, geographical, environmental, or threat
      situation.<br>
      Evacuee. An evacuee is a civilian removed from a place of
      residence by military direction for reasons of personal security
      or the requirements of the military situation. (JP 3-57)<br>
      Internally displaced person. An internally displaced person is any
      person who has left their residence by reason of real or imagined
      danger but has not left the territory of their own
      country.Internally displaced persons may have been forced to flee
      their homes for the same reasons as refugees, but have not crossed
      an internationally recognized border.<br>
      Expellee. An expellee is a civilian outside the boundaries of the
      country of his or her nationality or ethnic origin who is being
      forcibly repatriated to that country or to a third country for
      political or other purposes. (JP 3-57)<br>
      Migrant. A migrant is a person who (1) belongs to a normally
      migratory culture who may cross national boundaries, or (2) has
      fled his or her native country for economic reasons rather than
      fear of political or ethnic persecution. (JP 3-57)<br>
      Refugee. A refugee is a person, who by reason of real or imagined
      danger, has left their home country or country of their
      nationality and is unwilling or unable to return.<br>
      Stateless person. A stateless person is a civilian who has been
      denationalized or whose country of origin cannot be determined or
      who cannot establish a right to the nationality claimed.<b><br>
        <br>
        AGENCIES CONCERNED WITH INTERNMENT AND RESETTLEMENT<br>
        <br>
      </b>1-40. External involvement in I/R missions is a fact of life
      for military police organizations. Some government and
      government-sponsored entities that may be involved in I/R missions
      include—<br>
      <br>
      International agencies.<br>
      UN.<br>
      International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).<br>
      International Organization of Migration.<br>
      U.S. agencies.<br>
      Local U.S. embassy.<br>
      Department of Homeland Security.<br>
      U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).<br>
      Federal Emergency Management Agency.<br>
      <br>
      1-41. The U.S. Army National Detainee Reporting Center (NDRC),
      supported by theater detainee reporting centers (TDRCs), detainee
      accountability, including reporting to the ICRC central tracing
      agency.<br>
      <br>
      1-42. There are also numerous private relief organizations,
      foreign and domestic, that will likely be involved in the
      humanitarian aspects of I/R operations. Likewise, the news media
      normally provides extensive coverage of I/R operations. Adding to
      the complexity of these operations is the fact that DOD is often
      not the lead agency. For instance, the DOD could be tasked in a
      supporting role, with the Department of State or some other agency
      in the lead. (See appendix E.)<b><br>
        <br>
        SUPPORT TO CIVIL SUPPORT OPERATIONS<br>
      </b><br>
      2-39. Civil support is the DOD support to U.S. civil authorities
      for domestic emergencies, and for designated law enforcement and
      other activities. (JP 3-28) Civil support includes operations that
      address the consequences of natural or man-made disasters,
      accidents, terrorist attacks and incidents in the U.S. and its
      territories.<br>
      <br>
      2-40. The I/R tasks performed in support of civil support
      operations are similar to those during combat operations, but the
      techniques and procedures are modified based on the special OE
      associated with operating within U.S. territory and according to
      the categories of individuals (primarily DCs) to be housed in I/R
      facilities. During long-term I/R operations, state and federal
      agencies will operate within and around I/R facilities within the
      scope of their capabilities and identified role. Military police
      commanders must closely coordinate and synchronize their efforts
      with them especially in cases where civil authority and
      capabilities have broken down or been destroyed.<br>
      <b><br>
        PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS OFFICER<br>
        <br>
      </b>3-55. The PSYOP officer in charge of supporting I/R operations
      serves as the special staff officer responsible for PSYOP. The
      PSYOP officer advises the military police commander on the
      psychological impact of military police or MI actions to prevent
      misunderstandings and disturbances by detainees and DCs. The
      supporting I/R PSYOP team has two missions that reduce the need to
      divert military police assets to maintain security in the I/R
      facility. (See appendix J.) The team—<br>
      <br>
      Assists the military police force in controlling detainees and
      DCs.<br>
      Introduces detainees or DCs to U.S. and multinational policy.<br>
      <br>
      3-56. The PSYOP team also supports the military police custodial
      mission in the I/R facility. The team—<br>
      <br>
      Develops PSYOP products that are designed to pacify and acclimate
      detainees or DCs to accept U.S. I/R facility authority and
      regulations.<br>
      Gains the cooperation of detainees or DCs to reduce the number of
      guards needed.<br>
      Identifies malcontents, trained agitators, and political leaders
      within the facility who may try to organize resistance or create
      disturbances.<br>
      Develops and executes indoctrination programs to reduce or remove
      antagonistic attitudes.<br>
      Identifies political activists.<br>
      Provides loudspeaker support (such as administrative announcements
      and facility instructions when necessary).<br>
      Helps the military police commander control detainee and DC
      populations during emergencies.<br>
      Plans and executes a PSYOP program that produces an understanding
      and appreciation of U.S. policies and actions.<b><br>
        <br>
        DETAINEE PROCESSING TECHNIQUE<br>
        <br>
      </b>4-33. Upon capture, Soldiers must process detainees using the
      “search, silence, segregate, speed, safeguard, and tag (5 Ss and
      T)” technique. This technique provides a structure to guide
      Soldiers in conducting detainee operations until they transfer
      custody of detainees to another authority or location. Complete
      the “5 Ss and T” technique as follows:<br>
      <br>
      Search. Neutralize a detainee and confiscate weapons, personal
      items, and items of potential intelligence and/or evidentiary
      value.<br>
      Silence. Prevent detainees from communicating with one another or
      making audible clamor such as chanting, singing, or praying.
      Silence uncooperative detainees by muffling them with a soft,
      clean cloth tied around their mouths and fastened at the backs of
      their heads. Do not use duct tape or other adhesives, place a
      cloth or either objects inside the mouth, or apply physical force
      to silence detainees.<br>
      Segregate. Segregate detainees according to policy and SOPs
      (segregation requirements differ from operation to operation). The
      ability to segregate detainees may be limited by the availability
      of manpower and resources at the POC. At a minimum, try to
      segregate detainees by grade, gender, age (keeping adults from
      juveniles and small children with mothers), and security risk. MI
      and military police personnel can provide additional guidance and
      support in determining the appropriate segregation criteria.<br>
      Speed. Quickly move detainees from the continuing risks associated
      with other combatants or sympathizers who may still be in the area
      of capture. If there are more detainees than the Soldiers can
      control, call for additional support, search the detainees, and
      hold them in place until reinforcements arrive.<br>
      Safeguard. Protect detainees and ensure the custody and integrity
      of all confiscated items. Soldiers must safeguard detainees from
      combat risk, harm caused by other detainees, and improper
      treatment or care. Report all injuries. Correct and report
      violations of U.S. military policy that occur while safeguarding
      detainees. Acts and/or omissions that constitute inhumane
      treatment are violations of the law of war and, as such, must be
      corrected immediately. Simply reporting violations is
      insufficient. If a violation is ongoing, a Soldier has an
      obligation to stop the violation and report it.<br>
      Tag. Ensure that each detainee is tagged using DD Form 2745.
      Confiscated equipment, personal items, and evidence will be linked
      to the detainee using the DD Form 2745 number. When a DA Form 4137
      is used to document confiscated items, it will be linked to the
      detainee by annotating the DD Form 2745 control number on the
      form.<br>

          trying to sexually assault her granddaughter</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>A man belonging to the Muslim community was brutally murdered
      by the grandmother of a 13-year- old girl as he attempted to rape
      this young innocent soul. The grandmother attacked him several
      times with a machete.<br>
      <br>
      This bloody episode occurred yesterday morning in Saint-Denis,
      France. The fatal victim is Mohamed Asis (25), who died inside the
      house of Liz Eluchans (61).<br>
      <br>
      “Two days ago I was threatened that he would come to my house to
      kill me and my girl, I braced myself against this bastard and
      enlisted a machete,” said the humble housewife.<br>
      <br>
      Yesterday morning, taking advantage that only the lady and her
      granddaughter were in this modest home, the individual broke into
      through a hole the door has, crawled and approached where the girl
      was sleeping with the intention of sexually assault her.<br>
      <br>
      The yelling of the girl woke grandma up who grabbed a machete,
      attacked him in the dark and killed him eventually.<br>
      <br>
      “When I turned on the light, I realized it was the man who had
      threatened me two days ago because I didn’t allow him to tell my
      granddaughter nonsense stuff,” she said.<br>
      <br>
      “When I saw that desperate expression on the face of my girl and
      this naked Muslim, I went crazy and started to attack until I
      finished him, I really do not remember when I cut his penis” added
      the woman in shock.<br>
      <br>
      Police said that when they arrived to the elderly’s home, they
      found the rapist’s penis in his mouth and with more than 50 stabs
      in his body.<br>
      <br>
      “That bastard will not assault anyone else never again,” said Liz.<br>
      <br>
      The sexagenarian was taken to court where a judge released her,
      arguing that the lady acted in self-defense. “I fear for my life
      because there are individuals who continue to sow in the area, we
      ask the police to search for them and put them in jail, nobody
      welcomes them here,” said Dona Liz before leaving the police
      station.<br>
      <br>
      “What she did is wrong and broke the law but it is difficult to
      send to jail a woman who chastised one rapist” – the police chief
      Didier Thuram said – “Especially when 3 million people in the city
      want to name her President of the Nation. “<br>

        “The next Fourth Turning is due to begin shortly after the new
        millennium, midway through the Oh-Oh decade. Around the year
        2005, a sudden spark will catalyze a Crisis mood. Remnants of
        the old social order will disintegrate. Political and economic
        trust will implode. Real hardship will beset the land, with
        severe distress that could involve questions of class, race,
        nation and empire. The very survival of the nation will feel at
        stake. Sometime before the year 2025, America will pass through
        a great gate in history, commensurate with the American
        Revolution, Civil War, and twin emergencies of the Great
        Depression and World War II...” – Strauss &amp; Howe – The
        Fourth Turning <br>
        <br>
        “Don’t think you can escape the Fourth Turning the way you might
        today distance yourself from news, national politics, or even
        taxes you don’t feel like paying. History warns that a Crisis
        will reshape the basic social and economic environment that you
        now take for granted. The Fourth Turning necessitates the death
        and rebirth of the social order. It is the ultimate rite of
        passage for an entire people, requiring a luminal state of sheer
        chaos whose nature and duration no one can predict in advance.”
