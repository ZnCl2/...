<p>A scientist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research
Service (ARS) may have found a new way to remove a costly component of
biodiesel production.</blockquote>

<div class="pullquote">
<blockquote>Processing costs using dry flakes were estimated at $1.02 per
gallon, which is $2.12 less than for biodiesel made from full-moisture
soy flakes.</blockquote>
</div>

<blockquote>Michael Haas, a biochemist with the ARS Eastern Regional Research
Center's Fats, Oils and Animal Coproducts Research Unit in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania
has developed a new approach to synthesizing biodiesel.
<p>Soybean oil is the prevalent starting material in the United States
for biodiesel, and its relatively high production cost results in a high
resale cost for this renewable fuel.
<p>The method developed by Haas and his colleagues eliminates the use of
hexane, an air pollutant regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, from the production of soy oil for biodiesel synthesis. Hexane,
a colorless, flammable liquid derived from petroleum, is traditionally
used to extract vegetable oil triglycerides from the raw agricultural material
before biodiesel production.
<p>The new method eliminates the conventional oil extraction step. Instead,
the oilseed is incubated with methanol and sodium hydroxide, which are
currently used to process extracted oil.
<p>The researchers found that the moisture naturally present in soybeans
-- as much as 10 percent in soy flakes -- requires that a large amount
of methanol be used in this reaction. However, using dried flakes greatly
reduced the methanol requirement. Processing costs using dry flakes were
estimated at $1.02 per gallon, which is $2.12 less than for biodiesel made
from full-moisture soy flakes.
<p>The researchers are refining their economic model to account for income
from the sale of the lipid-free, protein-rich flakes left over from the
biodiesel reaction for use as animal feeds, and to account for differences
in the cost of the refined oil and flaked soybean feedstocks.

</div>

<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;
<br>Connecting a battery across the front of the head can boost verbal
skills, says a team from the US National Institutes of Health.
<p>A current of two thousandths of an ampere (a fraction of that needed
to power a digital watch) applied for 20 minutes is enough to produce a
significant improvement, according to data presented this week at the annual
meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, held in San Diego. And apart from
an itchy sensation around the scalp electrode, subjects in the trials reported
no side-effects.
<p>Meenakshi Iyer of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and
Stroke in Bethesda, Maryland, ran the current through 103 initially nervous
volunteers. "I had to explain it in detail to the first one or two subjects,"
she says. But once she had convinced them that the current was harmless,
Iyer says, recruitment was not a problem.
<p>The volunteers were asked to name as many words as possible beginning
with a particular letter. Given around 90 seconds, most people get around
20 words. But when Iyer administered the current, her volunteers were able
to name around 20% more words than controls, who had the electrodes attached
but no current delivered. A smaller current of one thousandth of an amp
had no effect.
<p><b>Trigger happy ~</b>
<p>Iyer says more work needs to be done to explain the effect, but she
speculates that the current changes the electrical properties of brain
cells in the prefrontal cortex, the brain region through which it passes.
She believes that the cells fire off signals more easily after the current
has gone by. That would make the brain area, a region involved in word
generation, generally more active, she suggests.
<p>Iyer's group, which is led by Eric Wassermann, was prompted to run the
tests after considering problems facing researchers who were studying the
effect of magnetic fields on the brain. Some neuroscientists hope that
magnetic fields could have a therapeutic effect, perhaps by boosting activity
in areas of the brain that have suffered cell loss owing to dementia. But
magnetic fields can cause seizures and also require bulky equipment to
generate them.
<p>Iyer hopes that low electric currents will offer a safer and more portable
alternative. After running further safety tests, she plans to test the
effect of the current on patients with frontal temporal dementia, a brain
disease that causes speech problems. "This won't be a cure," Iyer cautions.
"But it could be used in addition to drugs."
<p>The idea of using electrical current to boost brain activity dates back
to experiments on animals in the 1950s. The early work showed some potential,
but fell from favour because of a perceived link to electroconvulsive therapy,
a controversial technique in which patients with depression are treated
by having short but intense pulses of electricity applied to the brain.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;
<br>Physicists in France have discovered a liquid that "freezes" when it
is heated. Marie Plazanet and colleagues at the Universit&eacute; Joseph
Fourier and the Institut Laue-Langevin, both in Grenoble, found that a
simple solution composed of two organic compounds becomes a solid when
it is heated to temperatures between 45 and 75&deg;C, and becomes a liquid
when cooled again. The team says that hydrogen bonds are responsible for
this novel behaviour (M Plazanet <i>et al.</i>, 2004 <i>J. Chem. Phys</i>
121: 5031).</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;
<br>Solids usually melt when they are heated, and liquids turn into gas,
although exceptions do exist when heating leads to chemical changes that
cannot be reversed, such as polymerisation. However, a reversible transition
in which a liquid becomes a solid when heated has never been observed until
now.</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;
<br>Plazanet and colleagues prepared a liquid solution containing
<br>*-cyclodextrine (CD), water and 4-methylpyridine (4MP). Cyclodextrines
are cyclic structures containing hydroxyl end groups that can form hydrogen
bonds with either the 4MP or water molecules.</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">At room temperature, up to 300 grams of
CD can be dissolved in a litre of 4MP. The resulting solution is homogenous
and transparent, but it becomes a milky-white solid when heated. The temperature
at which it becomes a solid falls as the concentration of CD increases.</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Neutron-scattering studies revealed that
the solid phase is a "sol-gel" system in which the formation of hydrogen
bonds between the CD and the 4MP leads to an ordered, rigid structure.
At lower temperatures, however, the hydrogen bonds tend to break and reform
within the CD, which results in the solution becoming a liquid again.</div>


<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Molecular dynamics simulations by Plazanet
and co-workers confirmed that the cyclodextrine ring becomes distorted
as it is heated up to close to the solidification temperature. The hydrogen
bonds within the CD break and the hydroxyl groups rotate towards the outside,
which allows a network of bonds to form between the different molecules.
The team has found a number of cyclodextrine/pyridine systems that also
become solid when heated, and is now looking more closely at the structure
of the sol-gel system to understand the solidification mechanism in more
detail.

<div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;
<center>
<p><font size=+1>Deadly For Bacteria, Great For Consumers</font></center>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;
<br>"Electrolyzed water" -- produced by applying an electrical current
to a very dilute saltwater solution - kills bacteria on fresh produce more
effectively in some cases than heat or water containing chlorine, according
to a research report presented here today at the 220th national meeting
of the American Chemical Society, the world's largest scientific society.
<p>Electrolyzed water could also be used to sanitize cutting boards, eating
and drinking utensils, and food-processing equipment, says Yen-Con Hung,
Ph.D., the University of Georgia professor who conducted the research.
Soaking a cutting board in electrolyzed water for about five minutes at
a moderately warm temperature (about 95-105 F) can reduce bacteria up to
a million-fold, he says.
<p>One advantage of using electrolyzed water to kill bacteria on food surfaces
is that it doesn't adversely affect quality as heat can, according to Hung.
<p>Trained sensory panelists "found there was no significant effect of
the treatment on the quality," he said. They were "unable to find any differences
in color, appearance or smell" between produce washed with electrolyzed
water and produce washed with tap water.
<p>The electrolytic process produces very acidic water. Hung believes the
water's low pH (acidity) and potential for oxidation-reduction contribute
to its effectiveness.
<p>Essentially, oxidation-reduction involves the exchange of electrons.
In the case of bacteria like E. coli, salmonella and listeria, this exchange
may take away electrons needed by cell membranes for metabolism and survival.
<p>"We think the main indicator of the effectiveness of the solution is
the oxidation-reduction potential," says Hung. "When you compare chlorinated
water with electrolyzed water, there is a difference in the oxidation-reduction
potential, even though they have the same chlorine concentration." The
exact role of oxidation-reduction in destroying bacteria is still being
investigated, he says.
<p>Chlorine is not physically added to electrolyzed water, but is produced
when the electrical current passes through the water and salt mixture.
<p>The chlorine that is generated "is definitely one of the major components
for killing microorganisms," Hung acknowledges. But, he adds, electrolyzed
water has additional active components -- oxidants -- that his research
group is trying to identify.
<p>The equipment needed to produce and treat food with electrolyzed water
is compact and already produced by several companies in Japan. A typical&nbsp;
unit costs between $3,000 and $5,000, says Hung. He believes the food industry
will be first to use electrolyzed water and then, as equipment&nbsp; costs
come down, consumers will use it at home.
<p>A fast-food chain in the United States is testing the technology and
several other companies have expressed interest, according to Hung. He&nbsp;
did not identify them.
<p>A few U.S. water treatment plants already use technology similar to
that tested, according to Hung.

<div style="text-align: center;">
<center><font size=+1>"Shock Waves Tear Food Bugs Apart"</font>
<p>by Andy Coghlan</center>
</div>

<p><br>Shock waves have been used for the first time to destroy a host
of common food bacteria. If the technique can be perfected, it could one
day be used instead of pasteurisation to sterilise baby foods, dairy products
and fruit juices without spoiling their taste.
<p>The process is being developed by Achim Loske and colleagues at the
Autonomous University of Mexico’s Centre for Applied Physics and Advanced
Technology in Quer&eacute;taro. Loske subjected vials of bacteria to shock
waves in a device called an electrohydraulic generator, which generates
shocks with pressures of up to 1000 atmospheres, accompanied by intense
flashes of visible and ultraviolet light.</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;
<br>This combination, Loske says, killed bacteria in the vial. “A possible
advantage of the treatment is that, as far as we know, shock waves don’t
change the taste of the food,” he says.</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The pressure waves cause microscopic air
bubbles in the liquid surrounding the bacteria to expand momentarily and
then violently collapse -- a process known as cavitation -- generating
small regions of intense heat.</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;
<br>This, along with the pressure of the shock wave and the intense pulses
of visible and ultraviolet light, are what kill the bacteria. “It’s a combination
of compression, cavitation and electromagnetic radiation,” says Loske,
whose results will be published in a forthcoming edition of the journal
<i>Innovative
Food Science and Emerging Technologies</i>.
<p><b>Thousandfold Reduction ~</b>
<br>&nbsp;</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The system needs further development as
it does not yet kill enough bacteria to be useful. The best results were
with <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, a food-borne bug which can trigger
miscarriages. Least affected were <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7 bacteria, which
have caused fatal food poisoning outbreaks.</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;
<br>At best, populations of bacteria shrank a thousandfold following some
350 shock waves given over 15 minutes. Loske is confident of achieving
million-fold reductions, which would be enough to make food safe. “It’s
a matter of increasing the shock wave energy and dose, and has been achieved
recently in our lab with <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>,” he says.</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">His team is also investigating just how
the shock waves kill the bacteria. “We still don’t know whether this would
be cheaper than conventional technologies,” he says. Morse Solomon, a food
safety expert at the US Agricultural Research Service lab in Beltsville,
Maryland, says that understanding exactly how the bacteria are killed is
essential if the technique is ever to be commercialised.</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Solomon’s team once tried tenderising meat
using shock waves from a small dynamite explosion (<i>New Scientist</i>,
23 December 2000, p 10). That also killed some bacteria, but not in practical
quantities.</div>

<br><font size=+1>"Smart Glass Blocks Infrared when Heat is on"</font></center>

<p>Glass that blocks out heat but not light when a room starts getting
excessively warm has been developed by UK scientists.
<p>At most room temperatures the glass lets both visible and infrared light
pass through. But above 290C, a substance coating the glass undergoes a
chemical change causing it to block infrared light. This will prevent room
from overheating in bright sunshine or if temperatures outside start to
soar.
<p>Other solutions, such as tinted glass, do not respond to changing conditions.
As well as reducing the light entering a room, tinted glass keeps a room
cool even when some of the Sun's warmth would be welcome.
<p>The researchers behind the new glass technology believe it could change
the way architects design large buildings.
<p>"The current trend towards using glass extensively in building poses
a dilemma for architects," says Ivan Parkin, who developed the new glass
with colleague Troy Manning at University College London. "Do they tint
the glass, which reduces the benefit of natural light or face hefty air
conditioning bills?"
<p><b>Transition Temperature ~</b>
<p>The glass is coated the chemical vanadium dioxide. This material transmits
both visible and infrared wavelengths of light, and normally undergoes
a change at about 700 C.
<p>Above this transition temperature, the electrons in the material alter
their arrangement. This turns it from a semiconductor into a metal, and
makes it block infrared light. Parkin and Manning lowered the transition
temperature to 290C by doping the material with the metal tungsten.
<p>They also found a way to incorporate deposition of the coating into
a conventional glass manufacturing process. This should make it relatively
cheap to mass produce, they claim, with a commercial version of the glass
ready within three years.
<p>However, a number of issues still need to be overcome. Firstly, the
substance is not permanently fixed to the glass. Also, the coating itself
currently has a strong yellow tint.
<p>But Manning believes it should be possible to overcome these issues.
"You could add another substance, like titanium dioxide, to fix it to the
glass," he told <i>New Scientist</i>. "And you could use a dye that would
cancel out the yellow."

<center><font size=+1>"Solar Photovoltaic Breakthrough Taps Infrared Light"</font></center>

<p>In a paper published on the Nature Materials Web site on January 9,
senior author and Professor Ted Sargent, Nortel Networks - Canada Research
Chair in Emerging Technologies at the University of Toronto's Department
of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and his team report on their achievement
in tailoring matter to harvest the sun's invisible, infrared rays.
<p>"We made particles from semiconductor crystals which were exactly two,
three or four nanometres in size," Sargent said. "The nanoparticles were
so small they remained dispersed in everyday solvents just like the particles
in paint," explains Sargent.
<p>Sargent's team then tuned the tiny nanocrystals to catch light at very
long wavelengths. The result is a sprayable infrared detector.
<p>"Existing technology has given us solution-processible, light-sensitive
materials that have made large, low-cost solar cells, displays, and sensors
possible, but these materials have so far only worked in the visible light
spectrum," Sargent said.
<p>The discovery may help in the quest for cheaper, more efficient renewable
energy resources. Specifically, it could help drive up the efficiencies
of current polymer-based solar cells which hold the potential to be manufactured
at a lower cost than current crystalline silicon cells but have so far
been unable to match crystalline power conversion efficiencies.
<p>"Companies have already been formed which have discovered how to make
roll-to-roll, large area, plastic photovoltaics," Sargent said. "They face
the challenge of low efficiencies in harvesting the sun's power. Our work
has the potential to improve these efficiencies considerably.
<p>Sargent expects their research breakthrough could see commercial implementation
within 3 to 5 years.
<p>Flexible, roller-processed solar cells have the potential to harness
the sun's power, but efficiency, flexibility and cost are going to determine
how that potential becomes practice, said Josh Wolfe, Managing Partner
and nanotechnology venture capital investor at Lux Capital in Manhattan.
<p>"These flexible photovoltaics could harness half of the sun's spectrum
not previously accessed," he said.
<p>Professor Peter Peumans of Stanford University, who has reviewed the
U of T team's research, also acknowledges the groundbreaking nature of
the work.
<p>"Our calculations show that with further improvements in efficiency,
combining infrared and visible photovoltaics, could allow up to 30 percent
of the sun's radiant energy to be harnessed, compared to six percent in
today's best plastic solar cells," Peumans said.
<p>U of T electrical and computer engineering graduate student Steve MacDonald
carried out many of the experiments that produced the world's first solution-processed
photovoltaic in the infrared.
<p>"The key was finding the right molecules to wrap around our nanoparticles,"
he explains. "Too long and the particles couldn't deliver their electrical
energy to our circuit; too short, and they clumped up, losing their nanoscale
properties. It turned out that one nanometer -- eight carbon atoms strung
together in a chain -- was 'just right'."
<p>Other members of the U of T research team are Gerasimos Konstantatos,
Shiguo Zhang, Paul W. Cyr, Ethan J.D. Klem, and Larissa Lavina of electrical
and computer engineering; Cyr is also with the Department of Chemistry.

</dl>

<dl style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size=+0>ORONTO (CP) -- Researchers
at the University of Toronto have invented an infrared-sensitive material
that's five times more efficient at turning the sun's power into electrical
energy than current methods.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The discovery could lead to shirts and sweaters capable
of recharging our cellphones and other wireless devices, said Ted Sargent,
professor of electrical and computer engineering at the university.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Sargent and other researchers combined specially-designed
minute particles called quantum dots, three to four nanometres across,
with a polymer to make a plastic that can detect energy in the infrared.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Infrared light is not visible to the naked eye but it
is what most remote controls emit, in small amounts, to control devices
such as TVs and DVD players.</font>
<p><font size=+0>It also contains a huge untapped resource -- despite the
surge in popularity of solar cells in the 1990s, we still miss half of
the sun's power, Sargent said.</font>
<p><font size=+0>"In fact, there's enough power from the sun hitting the
Earth every day to supply all the world's needs for energy 10,000 times
over," Sargent said in a phone interview Sunday from Boston. He is currently
a visiting professor of nanotechnology at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Sargent said the new plastic composite is, in layman's
terms, a layer of film that "catches" solar energy. He said the film can
be applied to any device, much like paint is coated on a wall.</font>
<p><font size=+0>"We've done the same thing, but not with something that
just sit there on the wall the way paint does," said the Ottawa native.</font>
<p><font size=+0>"We've done it to make a device which actually harnesses
the power in the room in the infrared."</font>
<p><font size=+0>The film can convert up to 30 per cent of the sun's power
into usable, electrical energy. Today's best plastic solar cells capture
only about six per cent.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Sargent said the advance would not only wipe away that
inefficiency, but also resolve the hassle of recharging our countless gadgets
and pave the way to a true wireless world.</font>
<p><font size=+0>"We now have our cellphones and our BlackBerries and we're
walking around without the need to plug in, in order to get our data,"
he said.</font>
<p><font size=+0>"But we seem trapped at the moment in needing to plug
in to get our power. That's because we charge these things up electrically,
from the outlet. But there's actually huge amounts of power all around
us coming from the sun."</font>
<p><font size=+0>The film has the ability to be sprayed or woven into shirts
so that our cuffs or collars could recharge our IPods, Sargent said.</font>
<p><font size=+0>While that may sound like a Star Trek dream, venture capitalists
are keen to Sargent's invention.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Josh Wolfe, managing partner at Lux Capital, a New York
City-based venture capital firm, said while such a luxury may be five years
away, the technology knows no bounds.</font>
<p><font size=+0>"When you have a material advance which literally materially
changes the way that energy is absorbed and transmitted to our devices...
somebody out there tinkering away in a bedroom or in a government lab is
going to come up with a great idea for a new device that will shock us
all," he said in a phone interview.</font>
<p><font size=+0>"When the Internet was created nobody envisioned that
the killer app (application) would be e-mail or instant messaging."</font>
<p><font size=+0>Sargent's work was published in the online edition of
Nature Materials on Sunday and will appear in its February issue.</font>

<br><b><font size=+1>"Graphite Magnets get ready for Applications"</font></b>
<p><b>by Belle Dum&eacute;</b></center>


<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Physicists in Uruguay and Brazil have succeeded
in synthesising large quantities of magnetic graphite for the first time.
The material made by &Aacute;lvaro Mombr&uacute; and colleagues at the
Universidad de la Rep&uacute;blica in Montevideo and the Universidad Federal
de S&atilde;o Carlos has the advantage of remaining magnetic at room temperature
(H Pardo <i>et al.</i>, 2004: <a href="../arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0407303">arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0407303</a>).
Magnetic carbon could be used to make inexpensive, metal-free magnets for
applications in medicine and biology, nanotechnology and telecommunications.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Graphite and other forms of carbon can have
ferromagnetic properties. However, the effects are weak, and usually only
seen at very low temperatures, so physicists are not sure if the magnetism
is due to tiny amounts of iron-rich impurities, or if it is an intrinsic
property of the carbon.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Recently it was predicted that it should
be possible to induce magnetism in carbon by introducing defects, such
as pores and stacking structures, into the honeycomb structure of graphite.
To produce such material, the team placed two crucibles, one containing
highly pure powdered graphite and the other powdered copper oxide, in a
tube furnace containing either nitrogen or argon at 1200&deg;C for 24 hours.
In this way, the two components underwent a vapour phase reaction so that
the graphite remained pure but was microstructurally modified.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Mombr&uacute; and co-workers characterised
their graphite samples using scanning electron microscopy, together with
magnetic force microscopy and magnetometry, at different temperatures.
They found that pores, and other complex microstructural defects, were
distributed non-uniformly throughout the sample. Furthermore, they calculated
that the magnetization of the graphite was just 500 times weaker than iron
at 4.2 kelvin, and 800 times weaker at room temperature.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Mombr&uacute; believes that magnetic impurities
are not responsible for the magnetization because iron concentrations of
nearly 2000 parts per million (ppm) would be required to produce the values
observed, yet they only measured around 60 ppm of iron.

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">"In addition to being of fundamental interest,
our work will be important for technological applications in engineering,
nanotechnology, sensors and detectors, and telecommunications," says Mombr&uacute;.
"It will also have uses in medicine and biology as a unique biocompatible
magnetic material."

<br><font size=+1>What Causes Rain?</font></center>

<p>Until recently meteorologists were unable to explain why clouds contain
disproportionately large quantities of large and small water droplets.
<p>Now Dutch researchers claim that areas of air turbulence that forms
very small spiral patterns and that this then causes clouds to produce
rain.
<p>The research was carried out by Delft University of Technology and used
the computational facilities at the Academic Computation Centre in Amsterdam.
Researchers used a Cray C90 super computer to calculate how hundreds of
thousands of water droplets contained in one litre of cloud move and grow.
<p>During this process small tubular-shaped vortices are formed and that
these force droplets outwards by centrifugal force, so that they congregate
at the edge.
<p>For rain to happen one in every million droplets needs grow to a diameter
greater them 20 micrometers and this happens as droplets collide --- this
then sets off a chain reaction within the cloud.
<p>This new data turns on its head old meteorological calculations that
did not include the effect of small-scale areas of turbulence. The process
should take more than three hours before clouds become dense enough to
release rain, but in actual fact this process only takes about thirty minutes.
<p>What has also been shown is that there are very few droplets in the
center of each area of turbulence and that as a consequence the air there
remains supersaturated.
<p>Until recently meteorologists had considered this to be impossible,
but the results also indicated that air more than one hundred meters above
the base of a cloud becomes so supersaturated with water vapour that droplets
are created.
<p>Water vapour then condenses on particles (like dust), with a radius
of less than a micrometer. Just how many small droplets develop depends
on the level of supersaturation of the air.
<p>Meteorologists may now have to revise many of their long-held assumptions
about clouds and rain. This may not sound like a major scientific feat,
but it's right up there for many dry continents like Africa and Australia
where water may be one of the key regional security issues in the 21st
century.

<p><font size=+1>"Stirling Engine Gets Noisy Makeover"</font></center>

<p>Scientists from the University of California and Northrop Grumman Space&nbsp;
Technology have developed a novel method for generating electrical power
for deep-space travel using sound waves.
<p>The research, appearing in the journal Applied Physics Letters, suggests&nbsp;
that the traveling-wave thermoacoustic electric generator could be used
to power spacecraft venturing into the furthest reaches of the Universe.
<p>Scientist Scott Backhaus and his Northrop Grumman colleagues, Emanuel&nbsp;
Tward and Mike Petach say the traveling-wave engine/linear alternator system
is similar to the current thermoelectric generators in that it uses heat
from the decay of a radioactive fuel to generate electricity, but is more
than twice as efficient.
<p>The new design is an improvement over current thermoelectric devices
used for the generation of electricity aboard spacecraft. Such devices
convert only 7 percent of the heat source energy into electricity.
<p>The traveling-wave engine converts 18 percent of the heat source energy
into electricity.
<p>The traveling-wave engine is a modern-day adaptation of the 19th century
invention of Robert Stirling -- the Stirling engine -- which is similar
to a steam engine, but uses heated air instead of steam to drive a piston.
<p>The traveling-wave engine works by sending helium gas through a stack
of 322 stainless-steel wire-mesh discs called a regenerator. The regenerator
is connected to a heat source and a heat sink that causes the helium to
expand and contract.
<p>This expansion and contraction creates powerful sound waves -- in much
the same way that lightning causes the thermal expansion that produces
thunder. These oscillating sound waves in the traveling-wave engine drive
the piston of a linear alternator that generates electricity.
<p>Since the only moving component in the device besides the helium gas
itself is an ambient temperature piston, the device possesses the kind
of high-reliability required of deep space probes.

<center><font size=+1>"Ukrainian Scientists Discover Our Time Speeding
Up"</font>
<p>by Taras Vanakaplus</center>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;
<br>Ukrainian physicists made a remarkable discovery capable of changing
that our perception of Time Scientists of Kiev"s Institute of quantum physics
Dmitro Stary and Irina Soldatenko began their experiment in the early 70s.
Since then, it"s been going on for more than 30 years, despite all the
difficulties such lack of resources, power outages and no monthly salaries.
Their longstanding scientific exploit has finally paid off; it has lead
to a real scientific breakthrough, which could only be compared to Einstein"s
relativity theory. Their unprecedented experiment, which was originated
by famous Soviet physicist Anastas Korzh, entails measurement of the Universe"s
expansion.
<p>Their technique however differs from the one commonly used these days.
Usually, scientists measure the distance between galaxies or rather those
oblique "evidences" like the Doppler Effect for instance.
<p>Anastas in turn suggested the young specialists, graduates of the University
of Physics, to precisely measure the most ordinary distance such as the
length of iridium standard meter, accessible for scientists, using modern
high-precision quantum devices. After all, if the Universe does expand,
the process does not only affect the edges, but its entirety.
<p>The iridium standard meter rod will also have to become longer after
some time.
<p>Dmitro developed a unique computer program (BESM-4) which enabled the
scientist to compensate and correct mistakes of his electronic devices.
<p>In the end, after such tedious and lengthy research work, Ukrainian
scientists managed to calculate more accurately the exact number of years
of our Universe as well as to acquire other significant data. Practical
advantages of such research appear to be significant as well. For instance,
nowadays all leading airlines of the world take into account the so-called
Stary-Soldatenko factor for calculating the amount of over-expenditure
of aviation fuel.
<p>The major outcome however, which was never intended by the scientists,
became obvious only during the final stages of the experiment. After conducting
thorough analysis of acquired data, they discovered that not only does
the Universe expand, but Time tends to accelerate as well!
<p>Actually, we have been following this effect for quite some time now.
However, those physicists who measured Time by means of various electronic
devices, which in turn also accelerated, did not lead us to believe in
it.
<p>The results of Stary and Soldatenko turn our preconceived notions of
the Universe upside down. Today, they haven"t been totally accepted in
the scientific world. In the meantime, the results are being tested in
many laboratories worldwide. Perhaps, it will take additional 30 years
for the scientific world to repeat the experiment.
<p>Today, many researchers undoubtedly agree that this is a fundamentally
new physical phenomenon, which will trigger new breakthroughs in the world
of science.

<br><font size=+1>"Russian Scientist Invents Camera To Take Ghost Photos
"</font>
<p><font size=+0>Collection Of Unique Photos Includes Dinosaurs, WWII Soldiers</font>
<p><font size=+0>by Savely Kashnitsky</font>
<br><font size=+0>(&nbsp; 8-6-4 )</font></center>
</dl>

<dl style="margin-left: 40px;">Russian geologist, specialist for geophysical
devices Henry Silanov founded a photo studio, in which one can see the
collection of 80 unusual photographs - aliens, paranormal activities, people
from the past eras.
<p>When a girl was packing a camping tent, Henry was preparing his camera
to take a picture of her. The girl stood up and came up to the man. Henry
clicked the camera. When the film was developed, they saw the girl on a
shot bending over the tent. The picture depicted the girl several seconds
prior to the moment, when the picture was actually taken. Henry Silanov
photographed not the girl, but the informational trace she had left. It
does not sound scientific at all - the experienced geologist is aware of
that. He would never believe anyone saying a camera is capable of photographing
moments, which were over before the moment of shooting. The scientist would
never believe it, if he did not take tens of such photographs himself.
<p>He took the first unusual picture in St.Petersburg's Hermitage. In one
of the halls Silanov photographed the throne of Russian tsars. The developed
picture depictured the face of Peter the Great, who used to sit on the
throne indeed. Silanov started taking photographs of the past. The geologist
has a picture of the thermos bottle photographed on the grass. The image
of the bottle is slightly covered with vague outlines of a bucket, which
was used to keep fresh milk in. The image of the bucket is invisible, but
it inexplicably appears on a film. Another photograph shows an old tree
broken with a storm. One can see the pale shade of the tree top above the
fracture too.
<p>Henry Silanov uses unconventional cameras to take photographs of the
past. Object-glasses are usually covered with a thin layer of magnesium
fluoride to filter the ultra-violet part of the spectrum. However, Silanov
believes this is the exactly the frequency, which allows the film to fix
'the memory of the field.' The scientist uses this term, because there
is no better definition for the time being. Henry Silanov thinks space
is a huge hologram filled with information about everything that was ever
placed or moved in it. Certain conditions make it possible to 'turn the
memory of space on.' The memory is materialized in light quanta, which
retrieve images of the past. Many years of his extended experience in photographing
equipment became of great use in the new hobby.
<p>Traditional optical devices do not let ultraviolet rays pass through.
To make a unique object-glass Silanov uses tiniest grains of natural quartz,
analyzing them on a spectrometer. Then he melts the grains for the glass,
and polishes the lens manually. The film is also special: it is deprived
of the gelatin layer, which filters ultraviolet rays.
<p>Silanov took the majority of photographs in summer months, during his
annual missions to anomalous zones of the Hopyor river. The scientist is
the permanent leader of the public scientific expedition Hopyor. Every
summer he leads a group of enthusiasts to the river-bed to study paranormal
activities. There is a photograph of bushes, in which profiles of soldiers
are seen standing out. The analysis determined the picture depicted Czech
soldiers in 1943. The quartz object-glass captured a military unit, which
was apparently deployed in the area during World War II.
<p>Another photograph shows a man wearing ancient clothes. It is supposedly
a Scythian man - they used to inhabit the region in ancient times. Soldiers
in pointed helmets bring up the Golden Horde warriors. One can see ropes
across the river next to the warriors -- they were probably building a
passage. Another photograph depicts a dinosaur, which was probably hunting
in the region millions of years ago.
<p>It is impossible to choose the period of time-photographs. The scientist
does not know how to control his photo time-machine; he has not invented
the time-switch yet. Silanov tried to use five cameras at once: all photographs
differed from each other.
<p>Many professional photographers analyzed Henry Silanov's pictures and
found no technical flaws. Silanov learned from them he was not the only
one to discover mysterious images on photographs.
<p>The unique camera is capable of photographing dead people too. This
phenomenon has its own story. American citizen William Mummler took the
first picture of a ghost soon after the invention of photography. He took
a picture of himself, but was shocked to discover the see-through image
of his cousin Sarah, who had died in the same house 12 years before that.
A girl could be seen on the picture wearing white clothes, standing next
to Mummler.
<p>Henry Silanov has his own collection of ghosts on film. The scientist
believes they try to say they have not vanished, they live somewhere in
a parallel world, watching over us. Henry is a skeptic person. He perfectly
realizes a lot of people will never believe his theories, taking into consideration
the fact they are all based on photographs. However, physicians will have
to study 'the memory of the field' if other people's collections of unusual
photograph present more evidence of its existence.

<br><font size=+1>"Urine to improve diesel fumes?"</font></center>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Swiss scientists have come up with a way
to take the stink out of diesel exhaust fumes -- by spraying it with urine.
Researchers at Switzerland's Paul Scherrer Institute confirmed they had
developed the new catalytic converter for diesel engines based on urea,
a compound found in urine.</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;
<br>Diesel motors emit nitrogen oxides that drive up ozone levels and until
now there has not been a catalytic converter able to efficiently break
down these pollutants. But the PSI's Oliver Kroecher, who headed the research
team in Villigen in Switzerland, said: "Our method is to spray urea, which
is harmless and used as a fertiliser, to break down the oxides."</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">He explained that a urea solution is introduced
into the exhaust outlet as a fine spray, where it breaks down into ammonia.
The ammonia then reacts with the oxides, transforming them into nitrogen
and water.</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Kroecher added: "We expect our technology
to be on the market soon, within the next 18 months. There's been a lot
of interest from truck manufacturers."</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The EU plans to introduce new, tougher
emission limits for diesel engines by the end of next year.</div>
