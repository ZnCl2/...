          Reported inexplicable shifts of Mercury isotopes in consumer
          lamps Source: webpage at
          http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es303940p Quoting abstract
          directly: “The recent widespread adoption of compact
          fluorescent lamps (CFL) has increased their importance as a
          source of environmental Hg. Stable isotope analysis can
          identify the sources of environmental Hg, but the isotopic
          composition of Hg from CFL is not yet known. Results from
          analyses of CFL with a range of hours of use show that the Hg
          they contain is isotopically fractionated in a unique pattern
          during normal CFL operation. This fractionation is large by
          comparison to other known fractionating processes for Hg and
          has a distinctive, mass-independent signature, such that CFL
          Hg could be uniquely identified from other sources. The
          fractionation process described here may also explain
          anomalous fractionation of Hg isotopes in precipitation.”
          Direct quotes selected from body of paper: “Trapped Hg of used
          CFL show unusually large isotopic fractionation, the pattern
          of which is entirely different from that which has been
          observed in previous Hg isotope research aside from
          intentional isotope enrichment. Most notably, there is no
          straightforward relationship between extent of fractionation
          and isotope mass. Thus, while previous studies of MIF of Hg
          only observed large deviations from mass- dependence in odd
          mass isotopes, our results clearly show MIF across multiple
          even mass and odd mass isotopes.” Fig. shows large deviations
          from MDF and unused samples. <br>

              lessen energy costs associated with controlling frost</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          In a discovery that may lead to ways to prevent frost on
          airplane parts, condenser coils, and even windshields, a team
          of researchers led by Virginia Tech has used chemical
          micropatterns to control the growth of frost caused by
          condensation.<br>
          <br>
          Writing in Scientific Reports, an online journal from the
          publishers of Nature, the researchers describe how they used
          photolithography to pattern chemical arrays that attract water
          over top of a surface that repels water, thereby controlling
          or preventing the spread of frost.<br>
          <br>
          The inspiration for the work came from an unlikely source —
          the Namib Desert Beetle, which makes headlines because it
          lives in one of the hottest places in the world, yet it still
          collects airborne water. <br>
          <br>
          The insect has a bumpy shell and the tips of the bumps attract
          moisture to form drops, but the sides are smooth and repel
          water, creating channels that lead directly to the beetle’s
          mouth.<br>
          <br>
          “I appreciate the irony of how an insect that lives in a hot,
          dry desert inspired us to make a discovery about frost,” said
          Jonathan Boreyko, an assistant professor of Biomedical
          Engineering and Mechanics in the Virginia Tech College of
          Engineering. “The main takeaway from the Desert Beetle is we
          can control where dew drops grow.”<br>
          <br>
          Working at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the researchers
          developed their beetle-inspired, frost-controlling chemical
          pattern on a surface only about the size of a centimeter, but
          they believe the area can be scaled up to large surface areas
          with thirsty, hydrophilic patterns overtop of a hydrophobic,
          or water-repellant, surface.<br>
          <br>
          “We made a single dry zone around a piece of ice,” Boreyko
          said. “Dew drops preferentially grow on the array of
          hydrophilic dots. When the dots are spaced far enough apart
          and one of the drops freezes into ice, the ice is no longer
          able to spread frost to the neighboring drops because they are
          too far away. Instead, the drops actually evaporate
          completely, creating a dry zone around the ice.”<br>
          <br>
          Creating frost-free zones on larger surfaces could have a
          variety of applications – consider the water that forms and
          freezes on heat pump coils or the deicing with harsh chemicals
          that has to take place on wind turbines or airplane wings.<br>
          <br>
          “Keeping things dry requires huge energy expenditures,” said
          C. Patrick Collier, a research scientist at the
          Nanofabrication Research Laboratory Center for Nanophase
          Materials Sciences at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and a
          co-author of the study. “That’s why we are paying more
          attention to ways to control water condensation and freezing.
          It could result in huge cost savings.”<br>
          <br>
          The journey of frost across a surface begins with a single,
          frozen dew drop, the researchers said.<br>
          <br>
          “The twist is how ice bridges grow,” Boreyko said. “Ice
          harvests water from dew drops and this causes ice bridges to
          propagate frost across the droplets on the surface. Only a
          single droplet has to freeze to get this chain reaction
          started.”<br>
          <br>
          By controlling spacing of the condensation, the researchers
          were able to control the speed frost grows across surfaces, or
          completely prevent frost.<br>
          <br>
          “Fluids go from high pressure to low pressure,” Boreyko said.
          “Ice serves as a humidity sink because the vapor pressure of
          ice is lower than the vapor pressure of water. The pressure
          difference causes ice to grow, but designed properly with this
          beetle-inspired pattern, this same effect creates a dry zone
          rather than frost.”<br>
          <br>
          A portion of the research was conducted at the Center for
          Nanophase Materials Sciences, which is a Department of
          Engineering Office of Science user facility. The Department of
          Biomedical Engineering and Mechanics at Virginia Tech provided
          startup support.<br>

          VIDEO : By controlling the spacing of condensation,
          researchers were able to control the speed of frost growth
          across surfaces, or completely prevent frost. The video shows
          frost spreads more quickly when drops are closer, and the
          chain reaction is not as quick when the drops are farther
          apart. Video by Saurabh Nath, a graduate student in the

          </b><a
            href="http://www.aalto.fi/en/current/news/2016-01-14-005/"><b>http://www.aalto.fi/en/current/news/2016-01-14-005/</b></a><br>

          <div align="center"><b>Quantum Knot Solitons</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          The scientists at Aalto University (Finland) and Amherst
          College (USA) created knotted solitary waves, or knot
          solitons, in the quantum-mechanical field describing a gas of
          superfluid atoms, also known as a Bose–Einstein condensate.<br>
          <br>
          In contrast to knotted ropes, the created quantum knots exist
          in a field that assumes a certain direction at every point of
          space. The field segregates into an infinite number of linked
          rings, each with its own field direction. The resulting
          structure is topologically stable as it cannot be separated
          without breaking the rings. In other words, one cannot untie
          the knot within the superfluid unless one destroys the state
          of the quantum matter.<br>
          <br>
          To make this discovery we exposed a Rubidium condensate to
          rapid changes of a specifically tailored magnetic field, tying
          the knot in less than a thousandth of a second. After we
          learned how to tie the first quantum knot, we have become
          rather good at it. Thus far, we have tied several hundred such
          knots, says Professor David Hall, Amherst College.<br>
          <br>
          The scientists tied the knot by squeezing the structure into
          the condensate from its outskirts. This required them to
          initialize the quantum field to point in a particular
          direction, after which they suddenly changed the applied
          magnetic field to bring an isolated null point, at which the
          magnetic field vanishes, into the center of the cloud. Then
          they just waited for less than a millisecond for the magnetic
          field to do its trick and tie the knot.<br>
          <br>
          –For decades, physicists have been theoretically predicting
          that it should be possible to have knots in quantum fields,
          but nobody else has been able to make one. Now that we have
          seen these exotic beasts, we are really excited to study their
          peculiar properties. Importantly, our discovery connects to a
          diverse set of research fields including cosmology, fusion
          power, and quantum computers, says research group leader Mikko
          Möttönen, Aalto University.<br>

          Knots have been used and appreciated by human civilizations
          for thousands of years. For example, they have enabled great
          seafaring expeditions and inspired intricate designs and
          patterns. The ancient Inca civilization used a system of knots
          known as quipu to store information. In modern times, knots
          have been thought to play important roles in the
          quantum-mechanical foundations of nature, although they have
          thus far remained unseen in quantum dynamics.<br>
          <br>
          In everyday life, knots are typically tied on ropes or strings
          with two ends. However, these kinds of knots are not what
          mathematicians call topologically stable since they can be
          untied without cutting the rope. In stable knots, the ends of
          the ropes are glued together. Such knots can be relocated
          within the rope but cannot be untied without scissors.<br>
          <br>
          Mathematically speaking, the created quantum knot realizes a
          mapping referred to as Hopf fibration that was discovered by
          Heinz Hopf in 1931. The Hopf fibration is still widely studied
          in physics and mathematics. Now it has been experimentally
          demonstrated for the first time in a quantum field.<br>
          <br>
          This is the beginning of the story of quantum knots. It would
          be great to see even more sophisticated quantum knots to
          appear such as those with knotted cores. Also it would be
          important to create these knots in conditions where the state
          of the quantum matter would be inherently stable. Such system
          would allow for detailed studies of the stability of the knot
          itself, says Mikko Möttönen.<br>

          In this video, we illustrate the structure of the first
          quantum knot ever tied in quantum matter. These results were
          reported in Nature and produced by a collaboration of research
          teams headed by Prof.<br>
          Mikko Möttönen (QCD Labs, Aalto University) and Prof. David
          Hall (Hall Labs, Amherst College). The knots are tied in a
          Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) that is an atomic gas with
          superfluid properties. The created structure realizes the
          celebrated Hopf fibration for the first time in the context of
          quantum physics and quantum mechanics. This type of knot
          formed in a quantum gas is also referred to as a knot soliton.<br>

          As topologically stable objects in field theories, knots have
          been put forward to explain various persistent phenomena in
          systems ranging from atoms and molecules to cosmic textures in
          the universe. Recent experiments have reported the observation
          of knots in different classical contexts. However, no
          experimental observation of knots has yet been reported in
          quantum matter. Here we demonstrate the experimental creation
          and detection of knot solitons in the order parameter of a
          spinor Bose–Einstein condensate. The observed texture
          corresponds to a topologically nontrivial element of the third
          homotopy group and exhibits the celebrated Hopf fibration,
          which unites many seemingly unrelated physical phenomena. Our
          work calls for future studies of the stability and dynamics
          knot solitons in the quantum regime.<br>

          The researchers first prepared the anesthetic hydrogels with a

          if it made the anesthetic more effective.<br>
          <br>
          The anesthesia was fast-acting and long-lasting. The electric

            Abstract<br>
            <br>
          </b>Iontophoresis is a strategy to increase the penetration of
          drugs through biological membranes; however, its use has been
          underexplored in mucosa. The aim of this work was to
          investigate the influence of iontophoresis in the mucosal
          penetration of prilocaine hydrochloride (PCL) and lidocaine
          hydrochloride (LCL), which are largely used in dentistry as
          local anesthetics, when combined in the same formulation.
          Semisolid hydrogels containing these drugs either alone or in
          combination were developed at two different pHs (7.0 and 5.8)
          and presented adequate mechanical and mucoadhesive properties
          for buccal administration. The distribution coefficients
          between the mucosa and the formulations (Dm/f) and the in
          vitro mucosa permeation and retention rates were evaluated for
          both PCL and LCL. At pH 7.0, the combination of the drugs
          decreased the Dm/f of PCL by approximately 3-fold but did not
          change the Dm/f of LCL; iontophoresis increased the permeation
          rate of PCL by 12-fold and did not significantly change LCL
          flux compared with the passive permeation rate of the combined
          drugs. Combining the drugs also resulted in an increase in
          both PCL (86-fold) and LCL (12-fold) accumulation in the
          mucosa after iontophoresis at pH 7.0 compared with
          iontophoresis of the isolated drugs. Therefore, applying
          iontophoresis to a semisolid formulation of this drug
          combination at pH 7.0 can serve as a needle-free strategy to
          speed the onset and prolong the duration of buccal anesthesia.

            <br>
            1. Introduction<br>
            <br>
          </b>The development of injectable, efficient and safe local
          anesthetics is considered a breakthrough of 20th century
          dentistry [1]. Their use has allowed the improvement of
          routine and surgical procedures and has increased access to
          dental care for thousands of patients. However, the use of
          injectable anesthetics is a main source of fear and phobia in
          a significant portion of dental patients [2], making them
          delay or even avoid visits to the dentist [3], [4] and [5].<br>
          <br>
          To minimize patient discomfort at initial needle perforation,
          topical anesthetics are used in the clinic prior to local
          anesthetic injection [6] and [7]. Topical anesthetics can be
          found in a number of different preparations, such as in
          hydrogels, ointments and sprays; the most commonly used are
          hydrogels containing 20% benzocaine [7], [8] and [9]. However,
          the use of amino esters such as benzocaine has been replaced
          by the use of amino amides such as lidocaine and prilocaine.
          When compared to amino esters, amino amides present higher
          lipophilicity, easier tissue penetration, faster onset and
          longer anesthesia duration due to their stability when in
          contact with tissue enzymes [10], [11] and [12].<br>
          <br>
          Formulations that combine lidocaine and prilocaine at 2.5%
          each, such as EMLA® (AstraZeneca, King’s Langley,
          Hertfordshire, UK) and ORAQIX® (Dentsply Pharmaceutical, York,
          PA, USA), are an interesting approach toward improving the
          anesthetic performance of each of these drugs, taking
          advantage of their slightly different partition coefficients
          and pharmacological effects: the more lipophilic lidocaine,
          which also has greater vasodilatory properties confers a rapid
          anesthetic onset, whereas prilocaine confers a smaller
          vasodilator effect, leading to a longer duration of action
          [7].<br>
          <br>
          Although capable of inducing superficial anesthesia, the use
          of topical anesthetics does not substitute the use of local
          anesthetic injections, especially due to the low concentration
          of drugs able to penetrate the epithelium after topical
          application [6]. Therefore, topical anesthetics are only
          recommended for superficial procedures, for cases where a
          patient presents a high level of anxiety and pain sensibility,
          or for procedures that requires multiple anesthetic injections
          [13].<br>
          <br>
          Non-invasive administration of local anesthetics in the buccal
          cavity to replace painful injections would enable the
          improvement of routine and surgical procedures. Among other
          advantages, non-invasive administration could save costs,
          improve patient compliance, facilitate application and
          decrease risk of contamination. Moreover, in areas such as the
          hard palate, injected anesthetics cannot completely reduce the
          pain due to the displacement of the firmly attached
          mucoperiosteum by needle and liquid insertion [14] and [15].
          Therefore, an effective topical anesthetic formulation that
          could totally reduce pain without the need for an additional
          injection would be a contribution to dentistry.<br>
          <br>
          However, there are some challenges to overcome when developing
          an effective drug delivery system for topical deep anesthesia:
          the system should deliver the drug quickly; keep the drug in
          intimate contact with a restricted area; target the release
          and the permeation of the drug through the mucosa; and induce
          anesthesia, maintain it for a suitable period of time, and
          enable it to be easily removed after the procedure. These
          challenges can be overcome by using a mucoadhesive delivery
          system that employs iontophoresis to enhance and target
          anesthetic permeation.<br>
          <br>
          Iontophoresis is a non-invasive technique that is based on the
          application of a low-density electric current to facilitate
          the release of drugs, regardless of whether they are charged,
          through biological membranes. The electrical current is
          provided by a battery or power source and is distributed via
          positive (anode) and negative (cathode) electrodes through an
          electrolytic solution. When the current is applied, the
          cations that are in contact with the anode move in the
          direction of the cathode, whereas the anions at the cathode
          move in the opposite direction [16].<br>
          <br>
          Iontophoresis has been studied since 1900, and it is typically
          used in medicine for transdermal drug delivery [17] and [18].
          Although buccal mucosa represents an attractive site for
          iontophoretic release of drugs because it remains moistened
          for long periods of time and offers lower resistance to the
          passage of current than the stratum corneum [19] and [20], it
          has not been deeply explored in dentistry. Iontophoresis of
          lidocaine, for instance, which has been widely explored for
          transdermal application in surgical treatments [21], [22],
          [23], [24] and [25] has mostly been studied for transbuccal
          delivery in combination with penetration enhancers [26] and
          [27]. Therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate the
          influence of iontophoresis on the mucosal penetration of
          prilocaine and lidocaine salts when combined in a mucoadhesive
          semisolid formulation and used for deep buccal anesthesia...<br>
          <br>
          ...In summary, the formulation that included the combination
          of the drugs at pH 7.0 significantly enhanced the total
          permeated amount and flux of PCL, in addition to increasing
          the amounts of both drugs that were recovered from the mucosa.
          It is interesting to use the combination of the drugs at pH
          7.0 because, besides combining a higher onset (LCL) and
          duration of action (PCL) [7], it is possible to achieve higher
          amounts of both anesthetics permeating through and recovered
          from the mucosa.<br>
          <b><br>
            5. Conclusion<br>
            <br>
          </b>The developed formulation presented adequate mechanical
          and mucoadhesive properties for buccal administration. The
          combination of PCL and LCL does not cause the formation of an
          eutectic mixture, as verified by DSC studies, but it did
          change the distribution coefficients of PCL into the
          epithelium. The combination of PCL and LCL at pH 7.0, when
          subjected to iontophoresis, resulted in fast permeation of
          high concentrations of PCL through the mucosa together with
          high amounts of both PCL and LCL being retained in the mucosa.
          Therefore, this can be considered a valuable strategy for the
          administration of needle-free anesthesia during dental
          procedures, likely offering a fast onset and prolonged
          duration of anesthesia.<b><br>

            Abstract<br>
            <br>
          </b>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by the
          transition of amyloid-β (Aβ) monomers into toxic oligomers and
          plaques. Given that Aβ abnormality typically precedes the
          development of clinical symptoms, an agent capable of
          disaggregating existing Aβ aggregates may be advantageous.
          Here we report that a small molecule,
          4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulphonic acid (EPPS),
          binds to Aβ aggregates and converts them into monomers. The
          oral administration of EPPS substantially reduces
          hippocampus-dependent behavioural deficits, brain Aβ oligomer
          and plaque deposits, glial γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release
          and brain inflammation in an Aβ-overexpressing, APP/PS1
          transgenic mouse model when initiated after the development of
          severe AD-like phenotypes. The ability of EPPS to rescue Aβ
          aggregation and behavioural deficits provides strong support
          for the view that the accumulation of Aβ is an important
          mechanism underlying AD.<b><br>

          One of the more understandable misunderstandings on the
          Internet is the notion that the United States' federal
          government (and by extension the country as a whole) is in
          reality a corporation with its own set of rules, CEO's etc.
          This theory is held by many and is parroted across hundreds of
          websites and online forums, some with seemingly strong
          arguments. To complicate matters they point to a series
          of&nbsp; laws which, on the surface, may appear to validate
          their claims. I hope to be able to explain where the
          misunderstandings come from and to clear up the whole issue.<br>
          <br>
          These are the two laws which are the most quoted:<br>
          <br>
          28 USC § 3002 - Definitions<br>
          (15) “United States” means—<br>
          (A) a Federal corporation;<br>
          (B) an agency, department, commission, board, or other entity
          of the United States; or<br>
          (C) an instrumentality of the United States.<br>
          <br>
          And the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871 which creates
          a city government for the District of Columbia. You can find
          the full text of the Act here.<br>
          <br>
          An example of the most common claims and arguments can be
          found here. Aside from claiming the US government is a
          for-profit corporation, it naturally asserts that we are and
          have been under the control of the evil Rothschild
          international bankers and that since some people think our
          "current" government is unlawful, that their minority opinion
          holds with the full force of law and is actionable i.e they do
          not have to follow any laws set forth after 1871 (a fantasy of
          the highest order).<br>
          <br>
          The "Definitions" controversy rests in the meaning of "a
          Federal corporation." The rest of the issues arising from 28
          USC § 3002 are really rather basic. This section is saying
          that for the purpose of identifying what is or is not a part
          of the United States federal government, the "United States"
          may refer to EITHER; a Federal corporation; an agency,
          department, commission, board of other entity of the United
          States; or an instrumentality of the United States.<br>
          <br>
          As of 2011 there are 17 federal corporations. According to a
          report on federal corporations by the Congressional Research
          Service "The federal government does not possess a general
          incorporation statute as states do. Each government
          corporation is chartered through an act of Congress." Federal
          government corporations include the Postal Service, the
          Federal Reserve and the TVA. The definition does NOT say that
          the federal government *is* a corporation but rather, federal
          corporations (like the TVA) are part of the federal government
          of the United States.<br>
          <br>
          English is a tricky language and words take on new popular
          meanings and tones, especially words that have a modern
          negative connotation, like "corporation." A person with only a
          cursory understanding of the law or only focusing on the
          "definitions" section could easily come to the wrong
          conclusion. This section has been used to great effect and
          unfortunately most people never step outside of themselves and
          their distrust of all things government to actually research
          the issue themselves. A meme showing evil bankers with "the
          United States is a corporation" will be passed along the
          Internet simply because people do not trust government and the
          meme reinforces pre-held biases; it reinforces a negative
          image and people are all too eager to indulge themselves.<br>
          <br>
          The District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871 was an act to
          formally give a government to the District of Columbia which,
          up to that point, had been governed as a mixture of
          municipalities and counties within District boundaries. Let me
          give you some more background.<br>
          <br>
          Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress (with
          the approval of the affected States) the power to create a
          district in which to hold the seat of government. This
          district, 10 miles squared (not 10 square miles, but 10 miles
          on each side), was formally placed under the direct control of
          the Congress.<br>
          <br>
          The District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 allowed Congress
          to retain control over the city itself, known as the City of
          Washington, however the remaining territories were divided
          into Washington County and the County of Alexandria. The
          cities of Georgetown and Alexandria, which had existed prior
          to 1801 and which existed within the 100 square mile federal
          territory, were allowed to keep their city charters. In 1802,
          the City of Washington was granted its own charter. The mayor
          of the City of Washington was to be appointed by the
          President.<br>
          <br>
          The citizens within the District were no longer citizens of
          Maryland or Virginia and were thus disenfranchised. This
          disenfranchisement is what led Virginia, in 1846, to
          ultimately reclaim the territory it had ceded to the District.<br>
          <br>
          Next, comes the Act of 1871. This act repealed the individual
          charters of Georgetown and Alexandria, brought them in with
          Washington County (since the County of Alexandria now belonged
          to Virginia), and brought the whole area under one single
          government, the District of Columbia. Nowhere in the law's
          text does it say anything about the government of the United
          States being a corporation. Additionally, Congress repealed
          the Act in 1874 and replaced the system of direct
          Congressional governance for the local government of the
          District in favor of a more direct rule system. The District
          of Columbia would then be ruled by a three-member Board of
          Commissioners until 1967 when it was replaced with a mayor and
          city council who would be appointed by the President. This was
          changed once again by the 1973 Home Rule Act. <br>
          <br>
          <b>What is a corporation?</b><br>
          <br>
          The word "corporation" has several meanings, however it is
          generally understood as a legal entity that has been
          incorporated (in one way or another) by a legislative act. A
          fair amount of confusion arises because the modern American
          understanding of the term is somewhat different than the
          original English definitions. In the US, the term tends to
          mean a business, but the term really means that it is now an
          entity which can be sued, do business (activity), etc. without
          respect to the individuals who made it or control it.
          Basically, an incorporated entity can act and be brought to
          court. <br>
          <br>
          The notion that the term "corporation" is solely an entity
          with its own separate laws and whose only purpose is to make
          money is an utter misconception. Cities, states, colonies,
          nations, and yes, businesses have been incorporating
          themselves for centuries. <br>
          <br>
          In the American system of government, States hold the power to
          grant or refuse the incorporation (or home rule) of a city,
          county or other body. However, since the federal district was
          explicitly authorized by the Constitution and Congress was
          given direct control over the district, it took an Act (or
          Acts) of Congress to set it up. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Final words</b><br>
          <br>
          Under federal law, for an entity to become a federal
          corporation there must be an Act of Congress creating that
          corporation. And as we have seen, Congress has created
          multiple federal corporations. There are no acts incorporating
          the United States, only the District of Columbia; which is not
          the same thing as the government of the United States, no more
          so than the City of Nashville is the government of the State
          of Tennessee.<br>
          <br>
          In the Supreme Court case, United States v. Cooper Corporation
          (1941), the Court said: "We may say in passing that the
          argument that the United States may be treated as a
          corporation organized under its own laws, that is, under the
          Constitution as the fundamental law, seems so strained as not
          to merit serious consideration."<br>
          <br>
          This view is additionally supported by the doctrine of
          "sovereign immunity," which states that the government of the
          United States, or of the individual States, or of certain
          tribal entities, may not be sued unless the government first
          allows it. A business/company/corporation can be sued.<br>
          <br>
          The government of the United States and the entity of the
          District of Columbia are not one and the same. The District of
          Columbia is no different than the incorporated cities of
          Nashville, Sacramento or Atlanta when compared to the
          Constitutional governing bodies (the governments of the
          States) that reside within their limits. <br>

          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Storyline</b><br>
          <br>
          Everywhere around the world habitat destruction continues and
          we don't know what this is going to do because other
          extinctions have not been like this one. They haven't been
          wholesale removal of habitats because of the activities of one
          species. The previous great extinctions have been the result
          of often external disasters - a meteorite impact, huge
          desertification - but never before we had one where one
          species has done for so many others.<br>
          <br>
          The Earth's climate has suffered successive changes which have
          determined the number and variety of species in each period.
          The concept of biodiversity specifically refers to the
          richness of life in a determined time and space. It's a
          calculation that measures the variety of species, keeping in
          mind that those species are capable of reproducing among
          themselves. There is little difference between insects, plants
          and mammals because every living being counts... and not only
          because it's alive but because life also depends on it.<br>
          <br>
          The number of species that exist today is unknown. There are
          about 2 million classified although no one really knows the
          percentage that this figure represents with respect to the
          total number of species inhabiting the Earth. Scientists do
          not agree on approximations because some believe that there
          are at least 4 million species while others who are more
          optimistic estimate that there are more than 100 million.
          Between the two extremes the most accepted figure is around 14
          million different living beings.<br>
          <br>
          The predominance and diversity of what is small is not a whim
          of nature... small creatures correspond to a need. Without
          insects the machinery of life would not work. They rid the
          ecosystems of biological remains, they oxygenate the soil and
          serve as food for hundreds of species of birds, reptiles and
          mammals. But most of all they're essential for plants whose
          reproduction depends almost exclusively on the millions of
          insects that transfer the pollen from one flower to another.<br>

                What is most important to you in life?<br>
                <br>
                If your answer is to achieve greater understanding of
                yourself and the world in which you live; if it is to
                understand why you are here on earth and what awaits you
                after death; if it is to know the true purpose of life,
                your life, Thinking and Destiny offers you the
                opportunity to find these answers. And many more.<br>
                <br>
                Within these pages, information older than recorded
                history is now made known to the world—about
                Consciousness. The great value of this is that it can
                help us to better understand ourselves, the universe ...
                and beyond. This book is not a doctrine that will tell
                you how to live your life. The author states that an
                important lesson for each man and woman is to determine
                for one’s self what to do and what not to do. He said:
                “I do not presume to preach to anyone; I do not consider
                myself a preacher or a teacher.”<br>
                <br>
                Although this great work was lovingly written for all of
                humanity, relatively few throughout the world have found
                it. But the tides are shifting as more seek to
                understand the meaning of the personal and global
                challenges we face, as well as the pain and suffering
                that often accompany them. The author's sincerest wish
                was that Thinking and Destiny serve as a beacon light to
                help all human beings to help themselves.<br>
                <br>
                Both the casually curious reader and the most ardent
                seeker of profound knowledge cannot help but be
                intrigued by the abundance, scope and detail of the
                subjects that are addressed in this book. Many will
                wonder how the author obtained the information. The
                unusual manner in which this masterpiece was produced is
                described in both the Author’s Foreword and the
                Afterword.<br>
                <br>
                Percival began to outline chapters for Thinking and
                Destiny following experiences of potent illumination,
                which he referred to as being conscious of
                Consciousness. He stated that being conscious of
                Consciousness reveals the “unknown” to the one who has
                been so conscious. These experiences allowed Percival to
                later access knowledge about any subject by a particular
                method of focusing, or what he called "real thinking."
                It was through this method that the book was written.<br>
                <br>
                There is an authenticity in Percival's writing because
                it is devoid of assumptions, theory or pretense. His
                impeccable dedication to the highest mode of truth never
                wavers. This is a book that speaks to the longing in
                every human heart to know why humankind is as it is.
                Thinking and Destiny is an unusually eloquent discourse
                on the science of man that can also be applied to the
                lives of all who discover its liberating message.<br>

                If you are one of the many millions of people who suffer
                from the crazy-making scourge that is insomnia, you have
                likely read plenty of tips on how to achieve that
                elusive state of bliss known as sleep. You know about
                the importance of regular sleep routines and turning off
                the electronics, about skipping the boozy nightcap and
                limiting caffeine. But now a new study has a few more
                pearls of wisdom to add to the bag – and all natural
                approaches to better sleep are a step up from using
                pharmaceutical sleep aids which come with their own set
                of risks.<br>
                <br>
                Not surprisingly, since food is the driving force of our
                bodies, they found several areas in which sleep improved
                based on food choices. Their research shows that a
                greater fiber intake during the day resulted in more
                time spent in the stage of deep, slow wave sleep.
                Meanwhile, more saturated fat predicted less slow wave
                sleep, and higher consumption was associated with more
                arousals from sleep.<br>
                <br>
                "Our main finding was that diet quality influenced sleep
                quality," said principal investigator Marie-Pierre
                St-Onge, PhD, assistant professor in the department of
                medicine and Institute of Human Nutrition at Columbia
                University Medical Center in New York, N.Y. "It was most
                surprising that a single day of greater fat intake and
                lower fiber could influence sleep parameters."<br>
                <br>
                "The finding that diet can influence sleep has
                tremendous health implications, given the increasing
                recognition of the role of sleep in the development of
                chronic disorders such as hypertension, diabetes and
                cardiovascular disease," said St-Onge.<br>
                <br>
                So there you have it. More fiber, less fat and less
                sugar could be helpful for those seeking to improve
                sleep. Not really earth shattering, the treatment for so
                many ailments often boils down to eating better – but
                it's a great reminder that our bodies are sensitive
                machines that run best when well-fueled ... and possibly
                sleep better too.<br>

                <i>Discovery May Yield Cheaper, More Efficient
                  Alternative to Platinum in Automotive Engines</i><br>
                <br>
                Dr. Kyeongjiae "K.J." Cho, professor of materials
                science and engineering and physics at UT Dallas, says
                platinum is too scarce and expensive to be a long-term
                answer to diesel's pollution problems.<br>
                <br>
                Engineers at a company co-founded by a University of
                Texas at Dallas professor have identified a material
                that can reduce the pollution produced by vehicles that
                run on diesel fuel.<br>
                <br>
                The material, from a family of minerals called oxides,
                could replace platinum, a rare and expensive metal that
                is currently used in diesel engines to try to control
                the amount of pollution released into the air.<br>
                <br>
                In a study published in the August 17 issue of Science,
                Dr. Kyeongjae "K.J." Cho, professor of materials science
                and engineering and physics at UT Dallas, and others,
                found that when a manmade version of the oxide mullite
                replaces platinum, pollution is up to 45 percent lower
                than with platinum catalysts.<br>
                <br>
                “Many pollution control and renewable-energy
                applications require precious metals that are limited –
                there isn’t enough platinum to supply the millions and
                millions of automobiles driven in the world,” said Cho,
                a senior author of the study and co-founder of the
                company Nanostellar. “Mullite is not only easier to
                produce than platinum, but also better at reducing
                pollution in diesel engines.”<br>
                <br>
                For the environmentally conscious, the higher fuel
                efficiency of diesel engines makes an attractive
                alternative to engines that run on gasoline. On the flip
                side, compared with gasoline engines, diesel vehicles
                produce more nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide
                (NO2), which are known as NOx pollutants.<br>
                <br>
                Dr. Weichao Wang, who earned his PhD from UT Dallas in
                2011, was part of the research team.<br>
                <br>
                In June, the World Health Organization upgraded the
                classification of diesel engine exhaust as carcinogenic
                in humans, putting it in the same category as cigarette
                smoke and asbestos. Countries throughout the world have
                drafted guidelines to reduce diesel air pollution in the
                next decade.<br>
                <br>
                Platinum, because of its expense to mine and limited
                supply, is considered a precious metal. Estimates
                suggest that for 10 tons of platinum ore mined, only
                about 1 ounce of usable platinum is produced.<br>
                <br>
                In 2003, Cho became a co-founder and lead scientist at
                Nanostellar, a company created to find catalysts through
                a material design that would replace platinum in
                reducing diesel exhaust (carbon monoxide, or CO, and NOx
                pollutants). His company has designed and commercialized
                a platinum-gold alloy catalyst that is a viable
                alternative to platinum alone, but until this experiment
                with mullite, had not found a catalyst made of materials
                that are less expensive to produce.<br>
                <br>
                Cho, also a visiting professor at Seoul National
                University in South Korea, and his team suspected that
                the oxygen-based composition of mullite, originally
                found off the Isle of Mull in Scotland, might prove to
                be a suitable alternative. His team synthesized mullite
                and used advanced computer modeling techniques to
                analyze how different forms of the mineral interacted
                with oxygen and NOx. After computer modeling confirmed
                the efficiency of mullite to consume NOx, researchers
                used the oxide catalyst to replace platinum in diesel
                engine experiments.<br>
                <br>
                “We’ve found new possibilities to create renewable,
                clean energy technology by designing new functional
                materials without being limited by the supply of
                precious metals.”<br>
                <br>
                “Our goal to move completely away from precious metals
                and replace them with oxides that can be seen commonly
                in the environment has been achieved,” Dr. Cho said.
                “We’ve found new possibilities to create renewable,
                clean energy technology by designing new functional
                materials without being limited by the supply of
                precious metals.”<br>
                <br>
                The mullite alternative is being commercialized under
                the trademark name Noxicat. Dr. Cho and his team will
                also explore other applications for mullite, such as
                fuel cells.<br>
                <br>
                Dr. Weichao Wang, who earned his PhD in materials
                science and engineering in 2011 under Dr. Cho’s
                supervision in Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and
                Computer Science at UT Dallas, was lead author of this

                </b><br>
                Nanostellar develops advanced nanomaterial catalysts for
                an array of applications that include emissions control,
                energy efficiency, and the synthesis of chemicals and
                fuels. These solutions are developed using the Company's
                innovative and proprietary Rational Design Methodology.
                This methodology incorporates computational models,
                algorithms and subject matter expertise in
                nano-materials and advanced synthetic chemistry.<br>
                <br>
                The company has commercialized its first product in
                diesel vehicle emissions control and is in the
                pre-commercial testing phase with its second emissions
                control product. Its pipeline includes catalysts for
                non-automotive applications such as hydrogen peroxide
                production, synthesis gas (syngas) reformation and
                waste-heat recovery systems. These solutions satisfy
                essential market needs such as complying with emissions
                control standards at lower cost, reducing harmful
                by-products of industrial processes, cost-effectively
                generating alternative fuels, and increasing energy
                efficiency for heating and cooling.<br>
                <br>
                The company is located in Silicon Valley, California,
                and is funded by venture capital and other private
                investors. It was founded in 2004 by scientists from
                Stanford University and NASA Ames Research Center at
                NASA Research Park...<br>

                Nanostellar's core Rational Design Methodology (RDM)
                technology unites three disciplines - computational
                nano-science, advanced synthetic chemistry and
                characterization. This enables Nanostellar to gain a
                fundamental understanding of the surface chemistry and
                properties of nano-materials. This insight enables the
                Company to develop advanced catalysts on a recurrent,
                cost-effective basis. Relative to catalysts developed
                using traditional laboratory based research methods, the
                Company's catalysts have been developed with superior
                performance, significantly shorter development time, and
                substantially lower development cost. The company's
                intellectual property covers materials, manufacturing
                methods and coating processes. Its intellectual property
                assets are protected worldwide with 21 issued and 37
                pending patents.<br>
                <br>
                Nanostellar had a paper based on its Noxicat™ catalyst
                published in the August 2012 issue of Science. Noxicat™
                has already received considerable interest from
                manufacturers of light-duty and heavy-duty diesel
                engines for its ability to help engine manufacturers
                reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions while
                dramatically reducing the cost of doing so.&nbsp; In
                addition to significantly reducing the costs of
                emissions control systems, Noxicat™ has numerous
                performance benefits over the incumbent platinum based
                catalysts; Noxicat™ enables higher fuel efficiency by
                allowing engine designers to reduce the frequency of
                filter regeneration events and allows for redesign of
                the emissions control system for further optimization.<br>
                <br>
                Nanostellar's success in outpacing other emissions
                control technologies is due, in part, to its success in
                pioneering the application of Rational Design to the
                development of automotive catalysts. While the
                traditional materials development process is driven by
                an empirical approach that involves a significant amount
                of time-consuming lab work, Nanostellar's Rational
                Catalyst Design methodology uses quantum physics-based
                models to develop a fundamental understanding of
                chemical reactions and material properties and
                incorporates this knowledge in the design of new
                materials. By substituting fast and inexpensive
                computational cycles for time-consuming lab work,
                Rational Catalyst Design enables the design of
                better-targeted materials and cuts months or even years
                off the catalyst development process.<br>
                <br>
                Nanostellar succeeded in diesel emissions reduction by
                pioneering the use of gold as a catalyst.&nbsp; In
                engine testing, the new NS Gold(TM) catalyst
                demonstrated a 20-percent reduction in emissions over
                Nanostellar's first-generation products.<br>

                which all sensory transduction is translated into the
                intrinsic, brain-specific code. Direct stimulation of
                these codes within the human temporal or limbic cortices
                by applied electromagnetic patterns may require energy
                levels which are within the range of both geomagnetic
                activity and contemporary communication networks. A
                process which is coupled to the narrow band of brain
                temperature could allow all normal human brains to be
                affected by a subharmonic whose frequency range at about
                10 Hz would only vary by 0.1 Hz.  The pursuit of the
                basic algorithms by which all human brains operate can
                be considered a central theme of modern neuroscience.
                Although individual differences are expected to
                accommodate most of the variance in any specific
                neurobehavioral measure, there should exist basic
                patterns of information and structure within brain
                space. They would be determined by the human genome,
                i.e., be species-specific, and would contribute to or
                would serve as the substrate upon which all phenomena
                that affect neurobehavioral measures are superimposed. <br>
                <br>
                One logical extrapolation to a neurophysical basis of
                consciousness is that all experiences must exist as
                correlates of complex but determined sequences of
                electromagnetic matrices. They would control the theme
                for the format of cognition and affect while the myriad
                of possible serial collections of random variations of
                "noise" within the matrices could potentially
                differentiate between individual brains. Identification
                of these sequences could also allow direct access to the
                most complex neurocognitive processes associated with
                the sense of self, human consciousness and the aggregate
                of experiential representations (episodic memory) that
                define the individual within the brain (Squire, 1987). <br>
                <br>
                The existence of fundamental commonalities between all
                human brains by which a similar physical stimulus can
                affect them is not a new concept. It is demonstrated
                daily by the similar shifts in qualitative functions
                that are evoked by psychotropic drugs. Classes of
                chemical structures, crudely classified as
                antidepressant, antipsychotic, or anxiolytic compounds,
                produce general attenuations of lowered mood, extreme
                eccentric thinking, or extreme vigilance. The
                characteristics of these changes are very similar within
                millions of different human brains regardless of their
                cultural or genetic history. The idiosyncratic
                experiences such as the specific thoughts and images
                which reflect each person's continuing process of
                adaptation are superimposed upon these general
                functions. When translated into the language of
                neuroelectrical domains, the unique components of
                individual consciousness would be both embedded within
                and interacting with the species-invariant patterns. <br>
                <br>
                We have been studying the phenomenological consequences
                of exposure to complex electromagnetic fields whose
                temporal structures have been derived from the most
                recently observed neuroelectrical profiles such as
                burst-firing or long-term potentiating sequences (Brown,
                Chapman, Kairiss, &amp; Keenan, 1988) which can be
                considered the prototypical basis of a major domain of
                brain activity. These temporal patterns of potential
                codes for accessing and influencing neuronal aggregates
                have been applied across the two cerebral hemispheres
                (through the regions of the temporo-parietal lobes or
                within the region of the hippocampal-amygdaloid complex)
                of the brain as weak electromagnetic fields whose
                intensities are usually less than 10 milligauss (1
                microT). The purpose of this research, as suggested by
                both E.R. John (1967) and Sommerhoff (1974), is to
                identify the basic codes for the language of the
                representational systems within the human brain. <br>
                <br>
                In the tradition of Johannes Mueller, we have assumed
                that the normal transduction of stimuli by sensors into
                afferent, graded potentials and the subsequent
                translation into digital patterns of action potentials
                (which are more likely to behave functionally as a
                composite of pixels within a neural field) can be
                circumvented by direct introduction of this information
                within the brain. Induction of complex information would
                require simulation of the resonance patterns which would
                normally be transiently created by sensory afferents.
                The basic premise is that synthetic duplication of the
                neuroelectrical correlates generated by sensors to an
                actual stimulus should produce identical experiences
                without the presence of that stimulus. <br>
                <br>
                We have focused upon the polymodal and most labile
                portions of the parahippocampal (Van Hoesen, 1982) and
                entorhinal cortices (Vinagradova, 1975) and the anterior
                superior gyrus of the temporal cortices (Bancaud,
                Brunet-Bourgin, Chauvel, &amp; Halgren, 1994) as the
                region within which circumvention would be most
                probable. Extraction and translation of neural patterns
                from different sensory inputs into common codes occur
                within these regions before they are consciously
                perceived (Edelman, 1989). That central codes are
                present was shown by E.R. John (1967, pp. 348-349) who
                reported an immediate transference of the operant
                control of a response from a pulsatile auditory stimulus
                to a pulsatile visual stimulus if its temporal pattern
                was identical to the previous (acoustic) stimulus.<br>
                <br>
                 We (Fleming, Persinger, &amp; Koren, 1994) reported
                that whole brain exposure of rats to a 5-microT
                burst-firing magnetic field for 1 sec. every 4 sec.
                evoked an analgesic response that was similar to that
                elicited by the application of more noxious, tactile
                simulation for 1 sec. every 4 sec. directly to the
                footpads. Direct electrical stimulation of the limbic
                structures which simulate episodic, systemic application
                of muscarinic (cholinergic) agents can evoke electrical
                kindling (Cain, 1989). More recently, direct induction
                of chaotic electrical sequences within the labile CA1
                region of the hippocampus has been shown either to
                promote and attenuate paroxysmal discharges (Schiff,
                Jerger, Duong, Chang, Spano, &amp; Ditto, 1994). <br>
                <br>
                These results strongly indicate that imitation of the
                temporal pattern of sensory transmission directly within
                the brain by any nonbiogenic stimuli can evoke changes
                which are just as effective as (and perhaps require less
                energy than) classical transduction. As stated more
                recently and succinctly by E.R. John (1990), the
                fundamental operation of brain electrical activity
                suggests that some form of frequency encoding may play a
                significant role in informational transactions within
                and between brain structures. Consciousness would be
                associated with an electromagnetic pattern generated by
                a neural aggregate with invariant statistical features
                which are independent of the cells contributing to each
                feature (John 1990, p. 53). <br>
                <br>
                The effects of applied time-varying magnetic fields upon
                brain activity have been considered minimal or within
                the range of normal biological limits unless the
                intensity of the field exceeded natural endogenous or
                exogenous (ambient) levels by several orders of
                magnitude. Until very recently, almost all of the
                studies from which this conclusion was derived involved
                highly redundant stimuli such as 60 Hz fields or
                repetitive pulses. A simple illustration presents the
                problem: only 1 min. of a 60-Hz sine-wave field exposes
                a neural net to 3,600 presentations (60 sec. x 60 cycles
                per sec.) of the same redundant information. Even
                general estimates of habituation (Persinger, 1979) such
                as the equation:<br>
                <br>
                H = IRT2 / Rt<br>
                (IRT = inter-response time, Rt = duration of response)<br>
                <br>
                indicate that habituation to the stimulus would have
                occurred long before its termination after 1 min.
                Although the burst-firing frequencies (100 to 200 Hz) of
                the hippocampal neurons, for example, exceed this
                pattern, they are not temporally symmetrical and exhibit
                a variability of inter-stimulus intervals that would
                contain different information and would attenuate
                habituation. <br>
                <br>
                The apparent dependence of organismic responses upon the
                intensity of the applied electromagnetic field, the
                "intensity-dependent response curve," could simply be an
                artifact of the absence of biorelevant information
                within the wave pattern. If the temporal structure of
                the applied electromagnetic field contained detailed and
                biorelevant information (Richards, Persinger, &amp;
                Koren, 1993), then the intensity of the field required
                to elicit a response could be several orders of
                magnitude below the values which have been previously
                found to elicit changes. For example, Sandyk (1992) and
                Jacobson (1994) have found that complex magnetic fields
                with variable interstimulus pulse durations could evoke
                unprecedented changes in melatonin levels even with
                intensities within the nanoT range. <br>
                <br>
                The classical counterargument that "very strong"
                magnetic fields must be present "to exceed or to
                compensate for the electromagnetic noise associated with
                intrinsic (Boltzmann) thermal energies" is based upon
                equations and calculations for the quantitative indices
                of aggregates of molecular activity and not upon the
                pattern&nbsp; of their interaction. There are other
                possibilities. For example, Weaver and Astumian (1990)
                have shown mathematically that detection of very weak
                (microV/cm) fields can occur if the response is
                exhibited within a narrow band of frequencies; the
                detection is a function of both thermally induced
                fluctuations in membrane potential and the maximum
                increment of change in the membrane potential which is
                evoked by the applied magnetic field. The
                ion-cyclotron-resonance model which was initiated by the
                research of Blackman, Bename, Rabinowitz, House, and
                Joines (1985) and supported by Lerchl, Reiter, Howes,
                Honaka, and Stokkan (1991) indicates that, when an
                alternating magnetic field at a distance (resonance)
                frequency is superimposed upon a steady-state magnetic
                field, the movement of calcium and other ions can be
                facilitated with very small energies. More than 25 years
                ago, Ludwig (1968) developed a compelling (but hereto
                ignored) mathematical argument which described the
                absorption of atmospherics within the brain. <br>
                <br>
                Above these minimal thresholds, the information content
                of the wave structure becomes essential. The simplest
                analogy would be the response of a complex neural
                network such as a human being to sonic energy. If only a
                1000-Hz (sine wave) tone were presented, the intensity
                required to evoke a response could well exceed 90 db; in
                this instance the avoidant response would be overt and
                crude. However, if the structure of the sonic field was
                modified to exhibit the complex pattern which was
                equivalent to biorelevant information such as "help me,
                I am dying," field strengths several orders of magnitude
                weaker, e.g., 30 db, could be sufficient. This single,
                brief but information-rich stimulus would evoke a
                response which could recruit every major cognitive
                domain.<br>
                <br>
                If the information within the structure of the applied
                magnetic field is a major source of its neurobehavioral
                effect, then the "intensity-dependent" responses which
                are interpreted as support for experimental hypotheses
                of biomagnetic interaction could be both epiphenomenal
                and artifactual. Such amplification of
                electromagnetic-field strengths would also increase the
                intensity of the extremely subtle and almost always
                ignored sub-harmonics, ripples, and other temporal
                anomalies which are superimposed upon or within the
                primary frequency. These subtle anomalies would be due
                to the artifacts within the different electronic
                circuits and components whose similarities are based
                upon the fidelity of the endpoint (the primary
                frequency) despite the different geometries employed to
                produce the endpoint. <br>
                <br>
                If information rather than intensity is important for
                interaction with the neural network (Jahn &amp; Dunne,
                1987), then these unspecified "background" patterns may
                be the source of both the experimental effects and the
                failures of inter-laboratory replications. A concrete
                example of this problem exists within the putative
                association between exposure to power (60 Hz) frequency
                magnetic fields and certain types of cancer. The
                existence of these transients, often superimposed upon
                the fundamental 60-Hz frequency, is still the least
                considered factor in the attempts to specify the
                characteristics of the fields which promote aberrant
                mitosis (Wilson, Stevens, &amp; Anderson,1990).<br>
                <br>
                Within the last five years, several researchers have
                reported that direct and significant effects upon
                specific neuropatterns can be evoked by extremely weak
                magnetic fields whose intensities are within the range
                of normal geomagnetic variations. Sandyk (1992) has
                discerned significant changes in vulnerable subjects
                such as patients who were diagnosed with neurological
                disorders following exposure of short durations to
                magnetic fields whose strengths are within the pT to nT
                range but whose spatial applications are multifocal (a
                fasces-type structure) and designed to introduce
                heterogeneous patterns within a very localized brain
                space. The effective components of the field (which are
                assumed to be discrete temporal patterns due to the
                modulation of the frequency and intensity of the
                electromagnetic fields) are not always obvious; however,
                the power levels for these amplitudes are similar to
                those associated with the signals (generated globally by
                radio and communication systems) within which most human
                beings are exposed constantly. <br>
                <br>
                The most parsimonious process by which all human brains
                could be affected would require (1) the immersion of all
                the approximately 6 billion brains of the human species
                within the same medium or (2) a coercive interaction
                because there was facilitation of a very narrow-band
                window of vulnerability within each brain. For the first
                option, the steady-state or "permanent" component of the
                earth's magnetic field meets the criterion. The
                possibility that masses of susceptible people could be
                influenced during critical conditions by extremely small
                variations (less than 1%) of the steady-state amplitude
                (50,000 nT) of the earth's magnetic field such as during
                geomagnetic storms (50 to 500 nT) has been discussed
                elsewhere (Persinger, 1983). Recent experimental
                evidence which has shown a threshold in geomagnetic
                activity of about 20 nT to 30 nT for the report of
                vestibular experiences in human beings and the
                facilitation of limbic seizures in rodents is consistent
                with this hypothesis. <br>
                <br>
                The potential for the creation of an aggregate process
                with gestalt-like properties which reflect the average
                characteristics of the brains that are maintained with
                this field and that generate the aggregate has also been
                developed (Persinger &amp; Lafreniere, 1977) and has
                been labelled the "geopsyche." This phenomenon would be
                analogous to the vectorial characteristics of an
                electromagnetic field which is induced by current moving
                through billions of elements such as wires contained
                within a relative small volume compared to the source.
                Such gestalts, like fields in general, also affect the
                elements which contribute to the matrix (Freeman, 1990).

                The second option would require access to a very narrow
                limit of physical properties within which all brains are
                maintained to generate consciousness and the experience
                of self-awareness. This factor would be primarily loaded
                by the variable of brain temperature. Although the
                relationship between absolute temperature and wavelength
                is generally clear [an example which can be described by
                Wien's law and is well documented in astrophysics
                (Wyatt, 1965)], the implications for access to brain
                activity have not been explored. The fragile
                neuro-cognitive processes that maintain consciousness
                and the sense of self normally exist between 308oK and
                312oK (35oC and 39oC). The fundamental wavelength
                associated with this emission is about 10 micrometers
                which is well within the long infrared wavelength.<br>
                <br>
                However, the ratio of this normal range divided by the
                absolute temperature for normal brain activity which
                maintains neuro-cognitive processes is only about 0.013
                (4oK/312oK) or 1.3%. If there were a sub-harmonic
                pattern in naturally occurring or technically generated
                magnetic fields which also reflected this ratio, then
                all brains which were operative within this temperature
                range could be affected by the harmonic. For example, if
                11.3 Hz were one of these sub-harmonic electromagnetic
                frequencies, variations of only 1.3% of this mean, i.e.,
                11.3 Hz&nbsp; ± 0.1 Hz, would hypothetically be
                sufficient to affect the operations of all normal
                brains. If this "major carrier frequency" contained
                bio-relevant information by being modulated in a
                meaningful way, then the effective intensities could
                well be within the natural range for background
                radiation (microwatts/cm2) and could be hidden as
                chaotic components within the electromagnetic noise
                associated with power generation and use.<br>
                <br>
                One of the major direct prophylactics to the effects of
                these fields would require alterations in core (brain)
                temperature such as deep but reversible hypothermia.
                However, this condition would disrupt the biochemical
                process upon which neuronal activity and hence
                consciousness depends. Treatments which precipitate
                alterations in neural activity, similar to those which
                are associated with crude hypothermia, would be less
                disruptive. Specific candidates which affect multiple
                receptor systems such as clozepine (Clozaril) and
                acepromazine could be possible pharmacological
                interventions.<br>
                <br>
                The characteristics of the algorithm for euthermic
                individuals are likely to be conspicuous (once isolated)
                but should now be hidden within the synchronous activity
                which is (1) modified and filtered by aggregates of
                neurons and (2) modulated by sensory inputs and
                intrinsic oscillations (Kepler, Marder, &amp; Abbott,
                1990) before they are crudely measured by electrodes.
                Because the fundamental algorithm would be essentially a
                stable parameter of body temperature, most electrode
                montages (including monopolar to a non-brain reference,
                e.g., ear) would cancel or attenuate this index.
                Effectively, the algorithm would be expressed in a
                manner similar to descriptors for other aggregate
                phenomena as a physical constant or as a limited set of
                these constants. This suggestion is commensurate with
                the observation that the underlying neuronal networks
                which coordinate millions of neurons manifest the
                properties of a (mathematical) strange attractor with a
                very limited number of degrees of freedom (Lopes, Da
                Silva, Kamphuis, Van Neerven, &amp; Pijn, 1990).<br>
                <br>
                The physical chemical evidence for a fundamental
                process, driven by a narrow limit of biological
                temperature, has been accumulating. Fixed, oscillatory
                electromagnetic variations have been shown in vitro for
                enzymes of the glycolytic pathway (Higgins, Frenkel,
                Hulme, Lucas, &amp; Rangazas, 1973) whose narrow band of
                temperature sensitivity (around 37oC) is well known.
                Although these oscillations are often measured as
                periods (2.5-min. cycles), Ruegg (1973) reported a clear
                temperature dependence of these oscillations within a
                range of 1 to 20 Hz between 20oC and 35oC in
                invertebrate muscle. <br>
                <br>
                The most probable brain source which might serve as the
                primary modulatory of these biochemical oscillators
                would involve structures within the thalamus (Steriade
                &amp; Deschenes, 1984). Neuronal aggregates with
                surprisingly fixed (within 0.1-Hz) oscillations are
                found within this structure and depend primarily upon
                neurons that require gamma amino butyric acid or GABA
                (von Krosigk, Bal, &amp; McCormick, 1993). This
                inhibitory amino acid is specially derived from the
                normal, temperature-sensitive degradation of glucose by
                the GABA shunt (Delorey &amp; Olsen, 1994).<br>
                <br>
                Within the last two decades (Persinger, Ludwig, &amp;
                Ossenkopp, 1973) a potential has emerged which was
                improbable but which is now marginally feasible. This
                potential is the technical capability to influence
                directly the major portion of the approximately six
                billion brains of the human species without mediation
                through classical sensory modalities by generating
                neural information within a physical medium within which
                all members of the species are immersed. The historical
                emergence of such possibilities, which have ranged from
                gunpowder to atomic fission, have resulted in major
                changes in the social evolution that occurred
                inordinately quickly after the implementation. Reduction
                of the risk of the inappropriate application of these
                technologies requires the continued and open discussion
                of their realistic feasibility and implications within
                the scientific and public domain.  <br>

                Every year several millions of tons of building rubble

                    breaking down concrete into its constituent parts.</b></small><br>
                <br>
                Whether the Pantheon in Rome or the German concrete
                canoe regatta, whether ultra-light or decorative:
                concrete is unbelievably versatile and is the world’s
                most widely used material – next to water. It is made of
                cement, water and aggregate, a mixture of stone
                particles such as gravel or limestone grit in various
                sizes. However, the CO2 emissions, which are mainly the
                result of cement production, are problematic: the
                production of one ton of burned cement clinker of
                limestone and clay releases 650 to 700 kilograms of
                carbon dioxide. This means that every year 8 to 15
                percent of global CO2 production is attributable to
                concrete manufacturing. And when it comes to recycling
                waste concrete, there is no ideal solution for closing
                the materials loop. In Germany alone the quantity of
                construction waste amounted to almost 130 million tons
                in 2010.<br>
                <br>
                “This is an enormous material flow, but at the moment
                there is no effective recycling method for concrete
                rubble” explains Volker Thome from the Fraunhofer
                Institute for Building Physics IBP from the Concrete
                Technology Group in Holzkirchen. The current method is
                to shred the concrete, which produces huge amounts of
                dust. At best, the stone fragments end up as sub-base
                for roads. “This is downcycling,” explains Thome, in
                other words, simply the reutilization of raw materials,
                the quality of which deteriorates from process to
                process. On the other hand, if it were possible to
                separate the stone particles from the cement stone, the
                gravel could easily be reused as an aggregate in new
                cement – a first decisive step in the direction of
                recycling waste concrete. “The recovery of valuable
                aggregate from waste concrete would multiply the
                recycling rate by a factor of around ten and thereby
                increase it to 80 percent,” says Thome. If it were also
                possible to obtain a cement substitute from waste
                concrete, the cement industry’s CO2 emissions would be
                considerably reduced. To achieve these goals Thome
                revived a method that Russian scientists already
                developed in the 1940s then put on ice: electrodynamic
                fragmentation. This method allows the concrete to be
                broken down into its individual components – aggregate
                and cement stone.<br>

                Using this approach, the researchers in Holzkirchen are
                unleashing a veritable storm of lightning bolts.
                “Normally, lightening prefers to travel through air or
                water, not through solids,” says Thomas. To ensure the
                bolt strikes and penetrates the concrete, the expert
                uses the Russian scientists‘ expertise. More than 70
                years ago they discovered that the dieletric strength,
                i.e. the resistance of every fluid or solid to an
                electrical impulse, is not a physical constant, but
                changes with the duration of the lightning. “With an
                extremely short flash of lightning – less than 500
                nanoseconds – water suddenly attains a greater
                dielectric strength than most solids,” explains Thome.
                In simple terms, this means that if the concrete is
                under water and researchers generate a 150 nanosecond
                bolt of lightning the discharge runs preferably through
                the solid and not through the water.“ That is the
                essence of the method,” says Thome. In the concrete the
                lightning then runs along the path of least resistance
                which is the boundaries between the components, i.e.
                between the gravel and the cement stone. The initially
                generated impulses, the pre-discharges, first weaken the
                material mechanically. “The pre-discharge which reaches
                the counter-electrode in our fragmentation plant at
                first, then causes an electrical breakdown,” explains
                Thome. At this instant a plasma channel is formed in the
                concrete which grows within a thousandth of a second,
                like a pressure wave from the inside outwards.<br>
                <br>
                “The force of this pressure wave is comparable with a
                small explosion,” says Thome. The concrete is torn apart
                and broken down into its basic components. With the
                laboratory fragmentation plant the researchers can
                currently process one ton of concrete waste per hour.
                “To work efficiently, our goal is a throughput rate of
                at least 20 tons per hour,” says Thome. In as little as
                two years’ time, an appropriate installation could be
                ready for market-launch.<br>

                  </b></small><br>
                Middle-aged C57Bl/6J mice fed for 6 months with
                extra-virgin olive oil rich in phenols (H-EVOO, phenol
                dose/day: 6 mg/kg) showed cognitive and motor
                improvement compared to controls fed the same olive oil
                deprived of phenolics (L-EVOO). The aim of the present
                study was to evaluate whether these behavioral
                modifications were associated with changes in gene and
                miRNA expression in the brain.<br>
                <small><b><br>
                    METHODS:</b></small><br>
                <br>
                Two brain areas involved in cognitive and motor
                processes were chosen: cortex and cerebellum. Gene and
                miRNA profiling were analyzed by microarray and
                correlated with performance in behavioral tests.<br>
                <small><b><br>
                    RESULTS:</b></small><br>
                <br>
                After 6 months, most of the gene expression changes were
                restricted to the cerebral cortex. The genes modulated
                by aging were mainly down-regulated, and the treatment
                with H-EVOO was associated with a significant
                up-regulation of genes compared to L-EVOO. Among those,
                we found genes previously associated with synaptic
                plasticity and with motor and cognitive behavior, such
                as Notch1, BMPs, NGFR, GLP1R and CRTC3. The agrin
                pathway was also significantly modulated. miRNAs were
                mostly up-regulated in old L-EVOO animals compared to
                young. However, H-EVOO-fed mice cortex displayed miRNA
                expression profiles similar to those observed in young
                mice. Sixty-three miRNAs, out of 1203 analyzed, were
                significantly down-regulated compared to the L-EVOO
                group; among them, we found miRNAs whose predicted
                target genes were up-regulated by the treatment, such as
                mir-484, mir-27, mir-137, mir-30, mir-34 and mir-124.<br>

                We are among the first to report that a dietary

                phenols can modulate at the central level the expression
                of genes and miRNAs involved in neuronal function and

                <br>
                (-)-Oleocanthal (OC), a phenolic compound present in
                extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), has been implicated in
                the health benefits associated with diets rich in EVOO.
                We investigated the effect of OC on human cancer cell
                lines in culture and found that OC induced cell death in
                all cancer cells examined as rapidly as 30 minutes after
                treatment in the absence of serum. OC treatment of
                non-transformed cells suppressed their proliferation but
                did not cause cell death. OC induced both primary
                necrotic and apoptotic cell death via induction of
                lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). We provide
                evidence that OC promotes LMP by inhibiting acid
                sphingomyelinase (ASM) activity, which destabilizes the
                interaction between proteins required for lysosomal
                membrane stability. The data presented here indicate
                that cancer cells, which tend to have fragile lysosomal
                membranes compared to non-cancerous cells, are
                susceptible to cell death induced by lysosomotropic
                agents. Therefore, targeting lysosomal membrane
                stability represents a novel approach for the induction
                of cancer-specific cell death.<br>

                Maybe soon we can say goodbye to polystyrene, the
                petroleum-based material that is used to make Styrofoam.
                In what looks like an ordinary bicycle helmet, Swedish
                designers have replaced Styrofoam with a new
                shock-absorbing material made with renewable and
                biodegradable wood-based material.<br>
                <br>
                Researcher Lars Wågberg, a professor in Fibre Technology
                at Stockholm's KTH Royal Institute of Technology, says
                the wood-based foam material offers comparable
                properties to Styrofoam.<br>
                <br>
                "But even better, it is from a totally renewable
                resource—something that we can produce from the forest,"
                Wågberg says.<br>
                <br>
                That's a big plus for a country where forests are
                planted and harvested continuously, much like any other
                cash crop.<br>
                <br>
                Trademarked under the name, Cellufoam, the material was
                developed by Wågberg together with Lennart Bergström,
                professor in Material Chemistry at Stockholm University,
                and Nicholas Tchang Cervin, a former PhD student at KTH,
                in theWallenberg Wood Science Center (WWSC).<br>
                <br>
                The helmet was produced by Cellutech, a Stockholm
                startup that specializes in cutting edge materials made
                from wood, in conjunction with the Swedish Forest
                Industries Federation´s Ekoportal2035.<br>
                <br>
                "There are wood helmets out there, but what is unique
                here is that this one is made totally out of forest
                products—nothing else. The outer layer is veneer, the
                straps are made from extra strong paper, and then the
                foam is made from cellulose fibers," Wågberg says.<br>
                <br>
                The helmet concept is intended to draw attention to the
                possibilities of using wood cellulose as a sustainable
                alternative to Styrofoam and other foams from synthetic
                polymers. Wågberg says the last five years of Cellufoam
                research has been funded by the WWSC and Cellutech with
                the confidence that it will become possible to take the
                material to market on a cost-effective scale in a
                not-too-distant future. WWSC is a joint research center
                between KTH and Chalmers University; it is hosted at KTH
                and financed by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Research
                Foundation.<br>
                <br>
                Sweden certainly has the resources to support the
                commercial ambition for wood-based materials. "The
                Swedish forest industry is planting more trees than we
                harvest," Wågberg says.<br>
                <br>
                The production begins with wood cellulose nanofibres, or
                fibrils, which are modified and mixed with a foaming
                agent water and air. Through the process of Pickering
                stabilization, these particles stabilize the air-bubbles
                in a way that is much better than by using simple
                surfactants, he says.<br>
                <br>
                While the Cellufoam is being showcased as a bicycle
                helmet material, Wågberg says that by using different
                surface treatments and combinations with other material
                components, it could also be suitable for flame
                retardant materials, water filtration and antibacterial
                material.<br>
                <br>
                "It's really up to the imagination," he says. "In my
                experience, things like this wind up being used in ways
                you never expect."<br>

                "DO NOT EAT." That's what's marked on the innocuous
                little packets that contain the most widely known form
                of precipitated silica. They're used to absorb moisture
                that could damage new products, and most of us don't
                think much about them.<br>
                <br>
                But precipitated silica and other silicon compounds are
                essential for many products that we use every day.
                Hundreds of thousands of tons of them are produced every
                year. They're used to polish the silicon wafers that go
                into electronics, to strengthen tires, to make paints
                and paper white, as an abrasive in toothpaste, and yes,
                in countless tiny packets of silica gel beads.<br>
                <br>
                Producing high-purity silicon compounds is today an
                expensive and carbon-intensive process that requires
                heating mined silicon metal and anthracite coal to 3,500
                degrees Celsius in an electric arc furnace. That could
                soon change, thanks to a new technology from the
                University of Michigan that can produce the same silica
                compounds from agricultural waste.<br>
                <br>
                The researcher who developed the process says it could
                save approximately six tons of carbon emissions per ton
                of silica compounds produced. He estimates the cost of
                the technique to be 90 percent less than the current
                process, with virtually no carbon footprint.<br>
                <br>
                Developed by Richard Laine, a professor of materials
                science and engineering, the new technique is believed
                to be the first simple, inexpensive chemical method for
                producing high-purity silica compounds from agricultural
                waste.<br>
                <br>
                Much of the world's agricultural waste contains silica,
                and the search for a practical way to extract it
                stretches back 80 years. While the new process could be
                used to produce silica and silicon-containing chemicals
                from many types of agricultural waste, Laine focused on
                using the hulls left over from processing rice.<br>
                <br>
                The hull is the outermost layer of the rice grain. It's
                removed when rice is processed. Hundreds of millions of
                tons of the hulls are produced around the world every
                year. Many are burned to produce electricity, and the
                ash that's left over contains high levels of silica.
                Some of this ash is used in construction or as
                insulation, but much of it is dumped in landfills.<br>
                <br>
                But while the world is awash in silica-rich rice hull
                ash, getting that silica out has proven to be a major
                challenge. The difficulty stems mostly from the
                incredibly strong chemical bond between silicon and
                oxygen, one of the strongest that exists in nature.<br>
                <br>
                Laine found two easy and inexpensive ways to break that
                bond: ethylene glycol, or antifreeze, and ethanol, or
                grain alcohol. The antifreeze combined with a small
                amount of sodium hydroxide weakens the chemical bonds
                between the silica and the rice hull ash at the
                beginning of the process, dissolving the silica into a
                liquid solution.<br>
                <br>
                The solution is then heated to 390 degrees Celsius,
                forming a polymer of silica and antifreeze. While this
                stage does require energy, it's more than offset by the
                energy produced when the rice hulls are burned at the
                beginning of the process. And because the carbon
                released when the hulls are burned was previously
                absorbed by the rice plant, the process is considered
                carbon-neutral. The heating produces a silica-antifreeze
                polymer that's then filtered to remove the ash.<br>
                <br>
                Grain alcohol is then added at the end of the process.
                It's chemically similar to antifreeze, so it easily
                swaps in to replace the antifreeze, which is then
                recycled. The liquid silica can then be distilled out of
                this second solution and used to make a high-purity
                precipitated silica product for industrial use.<br>
                <br>
                Laine has formed a Michigan company, Mayasil, to
                commercialize the technology. Headquartered in Ann
                Arbor, It's in the process of building a "pre-pilot"
                plant that will be used to develop a scaled up
                manufacturing process. If the scale-up is successful,
                Laine predicts that it will fundamentally change the way
                silica products are made and used.<br>
                <br>
                "I think eventually, we'll be producing high-purity
                silica and other silicon compounds right next to the
                rice fields," Laine said. "It will be possible to
                process rice and produce high-grade silica in a single
                location with little or no carbon footprint. It's really
                very exciting."<br>
                <br>
                Laine recently received the 2015 Michigan Green
                Chemistry Governor's Award from the Michigan Department
                of Environmental Quality for his work on this. Mayasil
                is a spinoff of Mayaterials, a company Laine founded in
                2003 in conjunction with U-M Tech Transfer. Mayasil
                holds a patent on the silica production process.<br>

                The direct depolymerization of SiO2 to distillable
                alkoxysilanes has been explored repeatedly without
                success for 85 years as an alternative to carbothermal
                reduction (1900 °C) to Simet, followed by treatment with
                ROH. We report herein the base-catalyzed
                depolymerization of SiO2 with diols to form distillable
                spirocyclic alkoxysilanes and Si(OEt)4. Thus,
                2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol,
                2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol, or ethylene glycol
                (EGH2) react with silica sources, such as rice hull ash,
                in the presence of NaOH (10 %) to form H2O and
                distillable spirocyclic alkoxysilanes
                [bis(2-methyl-2,4-pentanediolato) silicate,
                bis(2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediolato) silicate or
                Si(eg)2 polymer with 5–98 % conversion, as governed by
                surface area/crystallinity. Si(eg)2 or
                bis(2-methyl-2,4-pentanediolato) silicate reacted with
                EtOH and catalytic acid to give Si(OEt)4 in 60 % yield,
                thus providing inexpensive routes to high-purity
                precipitated or fumed silica and compounds with single
                Si−C bonds.<br>

                was founded in January 2003 to commercialize two
                technologies licensed from the Laine group in Materials
                Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan
                (UM). One technology uses novel silsesquioxane (SQ)
                [nanosilica] chemistries to produce organic/inorganic
                nanocomposites especially unique coating systems. The
                second technology allows direct production of SQs from
                agricultural byproducts especially rice hull ash (RHA).
                RHA is produced in the U.S. in 100,000 ton/yr quantities
                and is a often a waste product.<br>
                <br>
                Mayaterials' scientists have created multiple families
                of novel, green and cost-effective SQ coating systems
                for multiple applications including corrosion
                resistance, nanoimprint lithography, and transparent
                refractive index controlled coatings etc. In particular,
                we have developed SQ systems that serve as very
                effective semi-permanent mold release agents for the
                injection molding industry. They are designed to improve
                productivity by significantly reducing sticking
                problems, cycle times, scrap and mold maintenance while
                improving parts quality in plastic and rubber molding
                applications.<br>
                <br>
                In 2009 Mayaterials Inc. formed a joint venture with
                Ceres Group, "EXIMO Hard Coatings" to commercialize
                coatings primarily for one specific application,
                semi-permanent mold release.<br>
                <br>
                Recently, Mayaterials Inc. back integrated its IP such
                that silica products as a whole have become a major
                focus. Our patented silica extraction technology allows
                us to make very low cost, high purity, surface property
                tailored precipitated and colloidal silicas at　large
                scales opens up opportunities including its use in the

      <font color="#660000"><big><big><small><font color="#000000"><br>
                The Earth has entered a new period of extinction, a
                study by three US universities has concluded, and humans
                could be among the first casualties.<br>
                <br>
                The report, led by the universities of Stanford,
                Princeton and Berkeley, said vertebrates were
                disappearing at a rate 114 times faster than normal.<br>
                <br>
                The findings echo those in a report published by Duke
                University last year.<br>
                <br>
                One of the new study's authors said: "We are now
                entering the sixth great mass extinction event."<br>
                <br>
                The last such event was 65 million years ago, when
                dinosaurs were wiped out, in all likelihood by a large
                meteor hitting Earth.<br>
                <br>
                "If it is allowed to continue, life would take many
                millions of years to recover and our species itself
                would likely disappear early on," said the lead author,
                Gerardo Ceballos.<br>
                <br>
                The scientists looked at historic rates of extinction
                for vertebrates - animals with backbones - by assessing
                fossil records.<br>
                <br>
                They found that the current extinction rate was more
                than 100 times higher than in periods when Earth was not
                going through a mass extinction event.<br>
                <br>
                Since 1900, the report says, more than 400 more
                vertebrates had disappeared.<br>
                <br>
                Such a loss would normally be seen over a period of up
                to 10,000 years, the scientists say.<br>
                <br>
                The study - published in the Science Advances journal -
                cites causes such as climate change, pollution and
                deforestation.<br>
                <br>
                Given the knock-on effect of ecosystems being destroyed,
                the report says benefits such as pollination by bees
                could be lost within three human generations.<br>
                Image caption Extinction may be more gradual than when
                the dinosaurs died, the report says<br>
                <br>
                Stanford University professor Paul Ehrlich said: "There
                are examples of species all over the world that are
                essentially the walking dead.<br>
                <br>
                "We are sawing off the limb that we are sitting on."<br>
                <br>
                The International Union for Conservation of Nature
                (IUCN) says at least 50 animals move closer to
                extinction every year.<br>
                <br>
                Around 41% of all amphibians and 25% of mammals are
                threatened with extinction, it says.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Most at risk: the lemur</b><b><br>
                </b><br>
                According to the IUCN, the lemur faces a real struggle
                to avoid extinction in the wild in the coming years.<br>
                <br>
                The group says that 94% of all lemurs are under threat,
                with more than a fifth of all lemur species classed as
                "critically endangered".<br>
                <br>
                As well as seeing their habitat in Madagascar destroyed
                by illegal logging, lemurs are also regularly hunted for
                their meat, the IUCN says.<br>
                <br>
                What were the five mass extinction events?<br>
                <br>
                Last year, a report by Stuart Pimm, a biologist and
                extinction expert at Duke University in North Carolina,
                also warned mankind was entering a sixth mass extinction
                event.<br>
                <br>
                But Mr Pimm's report said the current rate of extinction
                was more than 1,000 times faster than in the past, not
                114, as the new report claims.<br>
                <br>
                The new report's authors said it was still possible to
                avoid a "dramatic decay of biodiversity" through
                intensive conservation, but that rapid action was
                needed.<br>

                <br>
                The oft-repeated claim that Earth’s biota is entering a
                sixth “mass extinction” depends on clearly demonstrating
                that current extinction rates are far above the
                “background” rates prevailing between the five previous
                mass extinctions. Earlier estimates of extinction rates
                have been criticized for using assumptions that might
                overestimate the severity of the extinction crisis. We
                assess, using extremely conservative assumptions,
                whether human activities are causing a mass extinction.
                First, we use a recent estimate of a background rate of
                2 mammal extinctions per 10,000 species per 100 years
                (that is, 2 E/MSY), which is twice as high as widely
                used previous estimates. We then compare this rate with
                the current rate of mammal and vertebrate extinctions.
                The latter is conservatively low because listing a
                species as extinct requires meeting stringent criteria.
                Even under our assumptions, which would tend to minimize
                evidence of an incipient mass extinction, the average
                rate of vertebrate species loss over the last century is
                up to 100 times higher than the background rate. Under
                the 2 E/MSY background rate, the number of species that
                have gone extinct in the last century would have taken,
                depending on the vertebrate taxon, between 800 and
                10,000 years to disappear. These estimates reveal an
                exceptionally rapid loss of biodiversity over the last
                few centuries, indicating that a sixth mass extinction
                is already under way. Averting a dramatic decay of
                biodiversity and the subsequent loss of ecosystem
                services is still possible through intensified
                conservation efforts, but that window of opportunity is
                rapidly closing….<br>

                <br>
                Recent studies clarify where the most vulnerable species
                live, where and how humanity changes the planet, and how
                this drives extinctions. We assess key statistics about
                species, their distribution, and their status. Most are
                undescribed. Those we know best have large geographical
                ranges and are often common within them. Most known
                species have small ranges. The numbers of small-ranged
                species are increasing quickly, even in well-known taxa.
                They are geographically concentrated and are
                disproportionately likely to be threatened or already
                extinct. Current rates of extinction are about 1000
                times the likely background rate of extinction. Future
                rates depend on many factors and are poised to increase.
                Although there has been rapid progress in developing
                protected areas, such efforts are not ecologically
                representative, nor do they optimally protect
                biodiversity..</font></small><b><br>

      <div align="center"><b>THE EFFECTS OF CALCIUM QUANTUM DECAY AND
          THE ONSET OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AS A FUNCTION OF 60Hz SCALAR
          RESONANCE.</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Alzheimer's Disease, as we all know, is a progressive, incurable,
      debilitating illness, characterized by confusion and memory loss.<br>
      <br>
      It normally affects older persons, whose bones have begun to
      decalcify,and who have been found to have higher than normal
      amounts of aluminun in their brain cells.<br>
      <br>
      From the research of Dr. H.S. Lewis in the 1930's, we have learned
      that the resonant frequency of calcium is 120Hz. Walter Russell,
      in his resonance based Periodic Chart of the Elements, has shown
      that elements occur as "notes" on an octave.<br>
      <br>
      Research by Les Brown of Canada has shown that elements decay in
      quantum steps, from the same note on one octave to a lower octave.
      In other words, zinc decays into calcium, which decays into
      aluminum, and the resonant frequency drops accordingly, from
      240Hz, to 120Hz, to 60Hz. This is shown on Russell's chart as the
      E note, going from octaves seven to six to five.<br>
      <br>
      Various means of resonating an element can cause the quantum
      decay, as demonstrated by Les Brown. Resonantly exciting an
      element increases the motion, friction and heat of the atomic
      particles, pushing the element closer to decay.<br>
      <br>
      Every electrical power cord that is plugged into a wall outlet,
      whether it is conducting current or not, is emitting a scalar wave
      of 120Hz, which is exactly double the frequency of the 60Hz wall
      current. All AC powered electrical appliances, power lines,
      televisions, computers, etc., emit the same 120Hz scalar wave.<br>
      <br>
      The human brain, comprised of two halves, is a scalar receiver. It
      is possible that the naturally occuring decalcification process is
      being unnaturally affected by exposure to artificially created
      scalar energy, hastening the decay of calcium into aluminum. This
      would become the onset of Alzheimers Disease.<br>
      <br>
      If this is true, then there is also a cure, a sort of "fur of the
      dog" analogy, via resonating the aluminum to hasten its decay.
      This would be done through creation of a 30Hz AC signal, emitting
      60Hz scalar energy, to eliminate the aluminum.<br>
      <br>
      The aluminum would become lithium, which has been shown to have
      the exact opposite effect as aluminum, ie, increased awareness,
      heightened memory, etc.<br>
      <br>
      This would seem to have a double benefit, in that the 30Hz AC
      would encourage a Beta state (see MIND13.ASC) to increase
      awareness, while the 60Hz scalar energy would help to reduce the
      aluminum in the cells.<br>
      <br>
      I realize that there will be much opposition to this theory, as
      the 60Hz energy which we all use is so prevalent in our society.
      Because we have all been assured that it is "harmless" in normal
      radiation, we may not want to believe otherwise. We can at least
      begin to gather data, by asking the following questions:<br>
      <br>
      1. Is the rate of Alzheimer's on a per capita basis the same, in
      both developed and undeveloped countries?<br>
      <br>
      2. Is there any difference in the per capita rate between
      countries which use 60Hz current, and those who use 50Hz current?<br>
      <br>
      3. Has the per capita rate of this country increased since the
      turn of the century, with the "electrification" of the nation?<br>
      <br>
      4. Is the rate of occurance greater in areas which have more
      energy "in the air", such as along power line routes, around
      generating stations, etc.<br>
      <br>
      More research is needed, obviously, but I believe that the
      potential is promising.<br>

      Thomas Jefferson Jackson (T. J. J.) See (February 19, 1866 – July

      life with no real accomplishment in astronomy or physics. He was
      known for a career dogged by plagiarism, being fired from two

      isolated outpost, and his vitriolic attacks on relativity…<br>

      <br>
      Hello everyone. I will be taking down this blog shortly in the
      days ahead as I do not want to see anyone else entrapped in the
      horrible U.S. government PSYOPS (psychological operations) program
      that had lured me into it's trap some years ago and has refused
      release of it's clench on me and my life. At this time, I am
      leaving this blog up simply to get this message out to the
      remaining visitors, and hope they will help share this message far
      and wide and reach those who have formally followed my work. (I
      have been unable to delete the associated content, as PSYOPS
      agents have successfully hacked this Blogger program.) The
      so-called 'channeled messages' I received claiming to be from my
      soul family from the stars were in fact simple radio waves sent by
      U.S. government agents, allegedly from the military industrial
      complex, working in concert with volunteers, many of which are
      secret society members who help propagate enormous numbers of
      hoaxed news stories of UFOs and related space news, building a
      backdrop for a PSYOPS program that lures science and
      spirituality-minded individuals such as myself into their web.
      This program, commonly referred to as electronic harassment, has
      destroyed my life completely and continues to devastate my life
      until this very day, but I am certainly not alone, as the number
      of victims, known as targeted individuals, or TI's for short,
      grows exponentially each day.<br>
      <br>
      The electronic harassment operators are relentless, showing little
      or no mercy, keeping me under total surveillance, tormenting me,
      torturing me, and attempting to reprogram my mind as I sleep,
      turning my dreams into nightmares, effectively altering my
      behavior and free will choices as I continue through the
      mercifully final days of what was once my life. They have also in
      the past, and again very recently, scarred my body with their
      electromagnetic/microwave neuroweapon technology in a successful
      effort to control and negate my relationship with a woman who is
      now gone from my life.<br>
      <br>
      There is no recourse I have been able to uncover to shelter from
      this evil program. Their weaponry envelopes us and follows us
      everywhere, sharing space with cell phone towers all throughout
      the U.S. and the entire globe, soaking our airwaves with the
      digital information of their hellish nightmare. There exists
      endless documentation throughout the internet concerning
      government mind control programs and the technology used against
      the people, and it is advisable to familiarize yourself with this
      technology, as the spread of knowledge is our best and only
      defense against this despicable evil that will not stop until
      every last member of our society is a prisoner of his or her own
      altered mind. That is their sick and twisted plan - the
      construction of the dystopian nightmare forewarned by George
      Orwell throughout the pages of his prophetic Nineteen Eighty Four.<br>
      <br>
      My advice to all is to stay clear of all these stories of UFOs,
      extraterrestrials, channeled messages, and psychic mediums
      speaking to the dead, as these fictitious news accounts and
      dubious television programs are a direct part of, or at the least
      stand as compliment to, the hugely encompassing plan to
      desensitize and familiarize the public to synthetic telepathic
      communication, a simple but very effective feat of technology
      essential to mind control reprogramming. (I personally believe we
      come from somewhere in this universe and we are also not alone,
      but this is a subject matter useless and dangerous to explore at
      this present time, as a vast majority of the related news stories
      are complete hoaxes devised solely for use as backdrop for these
      mind control programs. I also feel there may be a number of
      differing programs, though all earthly conceived by human hoaxers,
      that list among their tools so-called channeled messages, and not
      all may conceal mind control at the heart of their agenda. I can
      only speak of the program of which I became an unsuspecting
      participant.)<br>
      <br>
      I humbly and sincerely apologize to anyone and everyone who has
      followed my work as a so-called channel of the Galactic Federation
      and the Ashtar Command. There is no denying my complicity, and I
      accept full responsibility for my actions. Soon I will be judged
      by our true higher powers in this universe, and may God have mercy
      on my soul for helping steer so many of you so far astray and into
      the clutches of this devilish, life destroying mind control
      program. I am forever truly sorry.<br>

      A hormone that extends lifespan in mice by 40% is produced by
      specialized cells in the thymus gland, according to a new study by
      Yale School of Medicine researchers. The team also found that
      increasing the levels of this hormone, called FGF21, protects
      against the loss of immune function that comes with age.<br>
      <br>
      Published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
      Sciences on Jan. 11, the study’s findings have future implications
      for improving immune function in the elderly, for obesity, and for
      illnesses such as cancer and type-2 diabetes.<br>
      <br>
      When functioning normally, the thymus produces new T cells for the
      immune system, but with age, the thymus becomes fatty and loses
      its ability to produce new T cells. This loss of new T cells in
      the body is one cause of increased risk of infections and certain
      cancers in the elderly.<br>
      <br>
      Led by Vishwa Deep Dixit, professor of comparative medicine and
      immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine, the researchers studied
      transgenic mice with elevated levels of FGF21. The team knocked
      out the gene’s function and studied the impact of decreasing
      levels of FGF21 on the immune system. They found that increasing
      the levels of FGF21 in old mice protected the thymus from
      age-related fatty degeneration and increased the ability of the
      thymus to produce new T cells, while FGF21 deficiency accelerated
      the degeneration of the thymus in old mice.<br>
      <br>
      “We found that FGF21 levels in thymic epithelial cells is several
      fold higher than in the liver — therefore FGF21 acts within the
      thymus to promote T cell production,” said Dixit.<br>
      <br>
      “Elevating the levels of FGF21 in the elderly or in cancer
      patients who undergo bone marrow transplantation may be an
      additional strategy to increase T cell production, and thus
      bolster immune function,” said Dixit.<br>
      <br>
      Dixit added that FGF21 is produced in the liver as an endocrine
      hormone. Its levels increase when calories are restricted to allow
      fats to be burned when glucose levels are low. FGF21 is a
      metabolic hormone that improves insulin sensitivity and also
      induces weight loss; therefore it is being studied for its
      therapeutic effects in type-2 diabetes and obesity.<br>
      <br>
      Dixit said further studies will focus on understanding how FGF21
      protects the thymus from aging, and whether elevating FGF21
      pharmacologically can extend the human healthspan and lower the
      incidence of disease caused by age-related loss of immune
      function.<br>
      <br>
      “We will also look to developing a way to mimic calorie
      restriction to enhance immune function without actually reducing
      caloric intake.”<br>

      </b><b>Significance</b><br>
      <br>
      Liver-derived metabolic hormone fibroblast growth factor 21
      (FGF21) improves insulin sensitivity and extends lifespan in mice.
      Aging also compromises the adaptive immune system by reducing
      T-cell production from the thymus. In this paper, we describe a
      new immunological function of FGF21 as a regulator of T-cell
      production from thymus in aging. The overexpression of FGF21
      prevents thymic lipoatrophy, which protects the mice from
      age-induced loss of naïve T cells. FGF21 expression in thymic
      epithelial cells and signaling in thymic stromal cells support
      thymic function in aging. Loss of FGF21 in mice increases
      lethality postirradiation and delays the reconstitution of thymus.
      Hence, we highlight FGF21 as an immunometabolic regulator that can
      be harnessed to delay immune senescence.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Bitcoin has failed (from a former key
          Bitcoin developer, Mike Hearn, Jan 2016)</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Three days ago, one of the better known Bitcoin developers, Mike
      Hearn, announced that he had quit bitcoin, ceased all development
      activity on it, sold all his coins, and determined that the
      Bitcoin experiment had failed.<br>
      <br>
      Two basic properties of Bitcoin technology and community led to
      this failure (in my summation of Mike's analysis):<br>
      <br>
      Maintaining distributed control required that many users and
      miners downloaded and verified the entire chain of blocks that
      defined all bitcoin transactions. This becomes increasingly
      expensive to do, and is now limiting world-wide bitcoin
      transactions to a few per second, in total, with processing delays
      ranging from one to eighteen hours.<br>
      <br>
      Proposed technical fixes (or even bandaids) to this problem are
      impossible, because a handful (as in two to ten or so) Chinese
      miners dominate the entire Bitcoin infrastructure and have chosen
      to ban, prohibit, attack with massive Denial of Service attacks,
      and otherwise, by all necessary means, block discussion or
      implementation of any such changes.<br>
      <br>
      In my view, such block chain technology, requiring all
      participants to either actively maintain their own updating copy
      of a world-wide, eternally growing, database, or if they don't do
      so locally on their own smart phone, to trust some service or
      vendor company to do so for them, inevitably become centralized
      under the control of whichever participants acquire the dominant
      computing and communications infrastructure.<br>
      <br>
      Bitcoin is now hitting this wall. It's a walking dead man.<br>
      <br>
      With a recent change that allows someone who just sent a bitcoin
      to another to retract that transaction, up until whenever that
      transaction shows up on the master block list, hours later,
      Bitcoins are no longer even a reliable means of payment. You can
      buy something, pay for it with Bitcoin, walk away with the goods
      in hand, and then cancel the payment. <br>

      <font color="#660000"><big><big><font color="#000000"><small><br>
                Last week a small company in Dublin called Steorn
                started taking orders for their USB phone charger. It's
                on the large side, and is only good for two or three
                smartphone charges per day, or one tablet charge. So
                then, why are they asking 1200 euros (about $1275) each
                for them? Well, for one thing, you don't have to plug
                them in. But there are other, much cheaper chargers that
                draw their power from sunlight or some other source and
                never need to be plugged in. With Steorn's OCube charger
                you're not paying for convenience, you're paying to be
                one of the first to own a device that does the
                impossible -- and that might be on the verge of
                revolutionizing science and technology.<br>
                <br>
                Or at least, that's what Steorn would have us believe.<br>
                <br>
                The OCube is the latest iteration of Steorn's Orbo
                technology. According to Steorn's CEO Shaun McCarthy,
                engineers there were working up a design for a
                wind-driven generator to power ATM security cameras back
                in 2003, when they stumbled upon a strange effect: the
                generators were putting out more power than they were
                taking in. Steorn spent the next few years ruling out
                potential sources of experimental error, and then trying
                to understand the theoretical basis of the anomaly.
                Finally they convinced themselves that there was no
                getting around the conclusion that they'd invented a
                perpetual motion machine. They'd found a loophole in the
                way that magnetic fields interact that allowed the law
                of conservation of energy to be broken, and caused
                so-called "free energy" to be generated: energy from
                nothing… [ &amp;c ]<br>

                We are looking for a funding to our research project.
                Our goal is to find out how Steorn "free energy device"
                works. We are collaborating here with researchers from
                Aalto University, Finland.<br>
                <br>
                Steorn is a small engineering company based in Dublin,
                Ireland who in the course of working with magnets for
                operating security cameras noticed an anomaly that they
                could not understand. Further research led them to
                conclude that it was possible to extract an energy gain
                from certain types of magnetic interactions, and that
                this gain could be turned into useful energy. They named
                this energy production technology Orbo.<br>
                <br>
                The implications of this are monumental. What types of
                machinery and technologies could be powered by Orbo? The
                possibilities reach as far as the imagination. So what
                if Steorn is breaking the laws of physics?<br>
                <br>
                In August 2006, Steorn published an advertisement in the
                Economist magazine announcing they had discovered a
                means of producing “free, clean, and constant energy”,
                and they asked for scientists to apply to be part of a
                jury that would look at their technology and publish a
                verdict on it.<br>
                <br>
                In June 2009 the jury of 22 members published a
                statement concluding that Steorn had not shown a
                production of energy, and that the jury was ceasing its
                work.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Steorn had taken other paths to
                try to demonstrate its claims. In July 2007 they
                scheduled a demonstration of an Orbo device at the
                Kinetica Museum in London; however, when the time came
                to show the device, it didn’t work. Steorn’s CEO Shaun
                McCarthy explained at the time, that for some unknown
                reason the bearings had broken, causing the device to
                fail. The public demonstration was cancelled.<br>
                <br>
                During December 2009-January 2010 Steorn held public
                demonstrations and lectures about Orbo at the Waterways
                Visitor Center in Dublin.&nbsp; After the Waterways
                event, there was very little further public outreach
                from Steorn, apart from occasional interviews, mainly in
                the Irish press.<br>
                <br>
                In May 2015 an Orbo device described as a powercube, or
                “never-die-battery” was deployed for field testing in
                Slattery’s Pub in Dublin, and a staff member at
                Slattery’s reported some of his experiences on Facebook.
                He said that customers and staff were able to fully
                charge their mobile devices from the Orbo device without
                it running down.<br>
                <br>
                Liquid Solutions, the only Irish producer of certified e
                juice for e cigarettes, announced 27 October 2015 it has
                licensed the revolutionary Orbo battery technology from
                Steorn to deliver an e cigarette that never needs
                charging. On 29 September 2015, Steorn announced that it
                would soon begin a series of live online webinars
                showcasing the Orbo technology.<br>
                <br>
                The second O-Cube webinar will take place on Wednesday,
                December 2nd, 2015 at 19:00 GMT. The webinar will
                include user testimonials, an overview of some products
                in development and details on how to purchase the
                O-cube.<br>
                <br>
                Researchers at Aalto University in Finland are waiting
                to get their hands on steorn device and Shadow Camera
                documentary film crew is looking forward to get funding
                for our Steorn project to prove if Steorns claims are
                valid…<br>

                It might be the ugliest diamond you’ll ever see, but
                within this brown sliver of carbon is a gem of a find
                for a University of Alberta scientist working to unravel
                an ocean-sized mystery deep beneath the Earth.<br>
                <br>
                An international team of scientists led by Graham
                Pearson, Canada Excellence Research Chair in Arctic
                Resources at the U of A, has discovered the first-ever
                sample of a mineral called ringwoodite. Analysis of the
                mineral shows it contains a significant amount of
                water—1.5 per cent of its weight—a finding that confirms
                scientific theories about vast volumes of water trapped
                410 to 660 kilometres beneath the Earth, between the
                upper and lower mantle.<br>
                <br>
                “This sample really provides extremely strong
                confirmation that there are local wet spots deep in the
                Earth in this area,” said Pearson, a professor in the
                Faculty of Science, whose findings were published March
                13 in Nature. “That particular zone in the Earth, the
                transition zone, might have as much water as all the
                world’s oceans put together.”<br>
                Ringwoodite is a form of the mineral peridot, believed
                to exist in large quantities under high pressures in the
                transition zone. Ringwoodite has been found in
                meteorites but, until now, no terrestrial sample has
                ever been unearthed because scientists haven’t been able
                to conduct fieldwork at extreme depths.<br>
                <br>
                Pearson’s sample was found in 2008 in the Juina area of
                Mato Grosso, Brazil, where artisan miners unearthed the
                host diamond from shallow river gravels. The diamond had
                been brought to the Earth’s surface by a volcanic rock
                known as kimberlite—the most deeply derived of all
                volcanic rocks.<br>

                <b>The discovery that almost wasn’t</b><b><br>
                </b><br>
                Pearson said the discovery was almost accidental in that
                his team had been looking for another mineral when they
                paid about $20 for a three-millimetre-wide,
                dirty-looking brown diamond. The ringwoodite itself is
                invisible to the naked eye, buried beneath the surface,
                so it was fortunate that it was found by Pearson’s
                graduate student, John McNeill, in 2009.<br>
                <br>
                It’s so small, this inclusion, it’s extremely difficult
                to find, never mind work on,” Pearson said, “so it was a
                bit of a piece of luck, this discovery, as are many
                scientific discoveries.”<br>
                <br>
                The sample underwent years of analysis using Raman and
                infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction before it
                was officially confirmed as ringwoodite. The critical
                water measurements were performed at Pearson’s Arctic
                Resources Geochemistry Laboratory at the U of A. The
                laboratory forms part of the world-renowned Canadian
                Centre for Isotopic Microanalysis, also home to the
                world’s largest academic diamond research group. he
                study is a great example of a modern international
                collaboration with some of the top leaders from various
                fields, including the Geoscience Institute at Goethe
                University, University of Padova, Durham University,
                University of Vienna, Trigon GeoServices and Ghent
                University.<br>
                <br>
                For Pearson, one of the world’s leading authorities in
                the study of deep Earth diamond host rocks, the
                discovery ranks among the most significant of his
                career, confirming about 50 years of theoretical and
                experimental work by geophysicists, seismologists and
                other scientists trying to understand the makeup of the
                Earth’s interior.<br>
                <br>
                Scientists have been deeply divided about the
                composition of the transition zone and whether it is
                full of water or desert-dry. Knowing water exists
                beneath the crust has implications for the study of
                volcanism and plate tectonics, affecting how rock melts,
                cools and shifts below the crust.<br>
                <br>
                “One of the reasons the Earth is such a dynamic planet
                is because of the presence of some water in its
                interior,” Pearson said. “Water changes everything about
                the way a planet works.”<br>

                The ultimate origin of water in the Earth’s hydrosphere
                is in the deep Earth—the mantle. Theory1 and
                experiments2, 3, 4 have shown that although the water
                storage capacity of olivine-dominated shallow mantle is
                limited, the Earth’s transition zone, at depths between
                410 and 660 kilometres, could be a major repository for
                water, owing to the ability of the higher-pressure
                polymorphs of olivine—wadsleyite and ringwoodite—to host
                enough water to comprise up to around 2.5 per cent of
                their weight. A hydrous transition zone may have a key
                role in terrestrial magmatism and plate tectonics5, 6,
                7, yet despite experimental demonstration of the
                water-bearing capacity of these phases, geophysical
                probes such as electrical conductivity have provided
                conflicting results8, 9, 10, and the issue of whether
                the transition zone contains abundant water remains
                highly controversial11. Here we report X-ray
                diffraction, Raman and infrared spectroscopic data that
                provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence for the
                terrestrial occurrence of any higher-pressure polymorph
                of olivine: we find ringwoodite included in a diamond
                from Juína, Brazil. The water-rich nature of this
                inclusion, indicated by infrared absorption, along with
                the preservation of the ringwoodite, is direct evidence
                that, at least locally, the transition zone is hydrous,
                to about 1 weight per cent. The finding also indicates
                that some kimberlites must have their primary sources in
                this deep mantle region.<br>

                <br>
                Representative weighted sample of US adults 20 to 90
                years of age. Main Outcome Measure: The Neurobehavioral
                Evaluation System 2 (NES2), consisting of simple
                reaction time (SRTT), symbol digit substitution (SDST),
                the single digit learning (SDLT), Story Recall (SRT) and
                digit-symbol substitution (DSST) tests.<br>

                <small><b>Results</b><b><br>
                  </b></small><br>
                Adults 20–59 years old reporting walnut consumption of
                an average of 10.3 g/d required 16.4ms less time to
                respond on the SRTT, P=0.03, and 0.39s less for the
                SDST, P=0.01. SDLT scores were also significantly lower
                by 2.38s (P=0.05). Similar results were obtained when
                tertiles of walnut consumption were examined in trend
                analyses. Significantly better outcomes were noted in
                all cognitive test scores among those with higher walnut
                consumption (P &lt; 0.01). Among adults 60 years and
                older, walnut consumers averaged 13.1 g/d, scored 7.1
                percentile points higher, P=0.03 on the SRT and 7.3
                percentile points higher on the DSST, P=0.05. Here also
                trend analyses indicate significant improvements in all
                cognitive test scores (P &lt; 0.01) except for SRTT (P =

                Produce and detect gravitational fields at will using
                magnetic fields, control them for studying them, work
                with them to produce new technologies -- it sounds
                daring, but Prof. André Füzfa of Namur University has
                proposed just that in an article published in the
                scientific journal Physical Review D. If followed, this
                proposal could transform physics and shake up Einstein's
                theory of general relativity.<br>
                <br>
                At present, scientists study gravitational fields
                passively: they observe and try to understand existing
                gravitational fields produced by large inertial masses,
                such as stars or Earth, without being able to change
                them as is done, for example, with magnetic fields. It
                was this frustration that led Füzfa to attempt a
                revolutionary approach: creating gravitational fields at
                will from well-controlled magnetic fields and observing
                how these magnetic fields could bend space-time.<br>
                <br>
                In his article, Füzfa has proposed, with supporting
                mathematical proof, a device with which to create
                detectable gravitational fields. This device is based on
                superconducting electromagnets and therefore relies on
                technologies routinely used, for example, at CERN or the
                ITER reactor.<br>
                <br>
                Although this experiment would require major resources,
                if conducted, it could be used to test Einstein's theory
                of general relativity. If successful, it would certainly
                be a major step forward in physics: the ability to
                produce, detect and, ultimately, control gravitational
                fields. People could then produce gravitational
                interaction in the same way as the other three
                fundamental interactions (e.g. electromagnetic and
                strong and weak nuclear forces). That would usher
                gravitation into a new experimental and industrial era.<br>
                <br>
                Until now, a scientific advance like this was a dream of
                science fiction, but it could open up many new
                applications tomorrow, for example in the field of
                telecommunications with gravitational waves: imagine
                calling the other side of the world without going
                through satellite or terrestrial relays!<br>

                The curved space-time around current loops and solenoids
                carrying arbitrarily large steady electric currents is
                obtained from the numerical resolution of the coupled
                Einstein-Maxwell equations in cylindrical symmetry. The
                artificial gravitational field associated to the
                generation of a magnetic field produces gravitational
                redshift of photons and deviation of light. Null
                geodesics in the curved space-time of current loops and
                solenoids are also presented. We finally propose an
                experimental setup, achievable with current technology
                of superconducting coils, that produces a phase shift of
                light of the same order of magnitude than astrophysical
                signals in ground-based gravitational wave
                observatories. <br>

                Mount Vernon, October 24, 1798.<br>
                <br>
                Revd Sir: I have your favor of the 17th. instant before
                me; and my only motive to trouble you with the receipt
                of this letter, is to explain, and correct a mistake
                which I perceive the hurry in which I am obliged, often,
                to write letters, have led you into.<br>
                <br>
                It was not my intention to doubt that, the Doctrines of
                the Illuminati, and principles of Jacobinism had not
                spread in the United States. On the contrary, no one is
                more truly satisfied of this fact than I am.<br>
                <br>
                The idea that I meant to convey, was, that I did not
                believe that the Lodges of Free Masons in this Country
                had, as Societies, endeavoured to propagate the
                diabolical tenets of the first, or pernicious principles
                of the latter (if they are susceptible of seperation).
                That Individuals of them may have done it, or that the
                founder, or instrument employed to found, the Democratic
                Societies in the United States, may have had these
                objects; and actually had a seperation of the People
                from their Government in view, is too evident to be
                questioned.<br>
                <br>
                My occupations are such, that but little leisure is
                allowed me to read News Papers, or Books of any kind;
                the reading of letters, and preparing answers, absorb
                much of my time. With respect, etc.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Mount Vernon, September 25, 1798.<br>
                <br>
                Sir: Many apologies are due to you, for my not
                acknowledging the receipt of your obliging favour of the
                22d. Ulto, and for not thanking you, at an earlier
                period, for the Book8 you had the goodness to send me.<br>
                <br>
                [Note 8: Proofs of a Conspiracy &amp;c, by John
                Robison.]<br>
                <br>
                I have heard much of the nefarious, and dangerous plan,
                and doctrines of the Illuminati, but never saw the Book
                until you were pleased to send it to me.9 The same
                causes which have prevented my acknowledging the receipt
                of your letter have prevented my reading the Book,
                hitherto; namely, the multiplicity of matters which
                pressed upon me before, and the debilitated state in
                which I was left after, a severe fever had been removed.
                And which allows me to add little more now, than thanks
                for your kind wishes and favourable sentiments, except
                to correct an error you have run into, of my Presiding
                over the English lodges in this Country. The fact is, I
                preside over none, nor have I been in one more than once
                or twice, within the last thirty years. I believe
                notwithstanding, that none of the Lodges in this Country
                are contaminated with the principles ascribed to the
                Society of the Illuminati. With respect I am &amp;c.<br>
                <br>
                [Note 9: In a letter from Snyder (Aug. 22, 1798, which
                is in the Washington Papers), it is stated that this
                book "gives a full Account of a Society of Free-Masons,
                that distinguishes itself by the Name of 'Illuminati,'
                whose Plan is to overturn all Government and all
                Religion, even natural."] <br>

                The baktun is 144,000 days.<br>
                <br>
                There are 13 baktuns in the Mayan Calendar.<br>
                <br>
                144,000 days x 13 baktuns = 1,872,000 solar days<br>
                <br>
                Now the Gregorian calendar solar year is 365.2425<br>
                <br>
                The Julian calendar solar year is 365.25<br>
                <br>
                The Haab Mayan calendar solar year is 365<br>
                <br>
                1,872,000 days/365.2425 (Gregorian solar year) = 5125.36
                years<br>
                <br>
                1,872,000 days/365.25 (Julian solar year) = 5125.256
                years<br>
                <br>
                and then here is the big difference….<br>
                <br>
                1,872,000 days/365 (Haab solar year) = 5128.76 years<br>
                <br>
                Subtract 5128.76 years (Haab) from 5125.256 years
                (Julian) =<br>
                <br>
                READY……..<br>
                <br>
                =3.504 year difference and that makes 1260 days<br>
                <br>
                This would mean that Dec 8th, 2012 (Julian calendar) is
                actually May 21st, 2016 (Mayan Haab calendar). Dec. 8th,
                2012 plus 1260 days = 5/21/2016<br>
                <br>
                or Dec. 21st, 2012 (Gregorian) is actually June 3rd,
                2016 (Mayan Haab calendar). Dec. 21st, 2012 plus 1260
                days = June 3, 2016<br>
                <br>
                They are not counting the days by true Mayan Haab 365
                solar days but instead using the Gregorian and Julian
                solar days to arrive to the dates of Dec. 8th, 2012
                (Julian) and Dec. 21st, 2012 (Gregorian) which shouldn’t
                have been done this way!<br>

                ...I find it interesting that religious zealots have
                also mentioned this date of June 3, 2016 in relation to
                the day the “Antichrist” returns:<br>

                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The research for my previous book
                (End Times and 2019, by David Monaigne) leads me to
                conclude that the first three and a half years, although
                full of problems like earthquakes and wars and rumors of
                wars – will not be intense enough to make anyone assume
                the world is ending.&nbsp; Only the second three and a
                half years will clearly be “great tribulation.”&nbsp;
                That being said, the final seven years already began on
                December 21, 2012 – when plans were made for the
                “Covenant of Peoples” tour in Israel and the Mayan Long
                Count ended.&nbsp; When Daniel talks about a midpoint
                halfway through these seven years, I believe he is
                referring to June 2016.&nbsp; The duration of his first
                time period is repeated often using different phrases to
                avoid possible misinterpretation.&nbsp; “Time, times,
                and half a time” are considered to be three and a half
                years, or 42 months, or “1260 days” using 42 months of
                30 days each.&nbsp; Adding Daniel’s next number of “1290
                days” gets us within a few days of an exact seven years
                in total – but it still leaves us with an extra 3 days
                of darkness to add to each half to reach an exact seven
                years.&nbsp; The two witnesses will lie dead in the
                street for three days at the end of the second
                half.&nbsp; I believe the extra 3 days at the end of the
                first three and a half years can be explained by an
                assassination attempt on the Antichrist exactly 1260
                days into Daniel’s 70th week on June 3, 2016.&nbsp; He
                will appear to be mortally wounded at first, but in a
                tragic mockery of Christ’s resurrection, he will rise
                fully healed 3 days later, and present himself at the
                site of the Temple in Jerusalem as God on earth on June
                6, 2016.<br>

                            Turns out Colonel Muammar Gaddafi was right
                            when he told former British Prime Minister
                            Tony Blair that if his regime failed then
                            Islamic extremists would attack Europe,
                            leaked phone conversations between the two
                            leaders revealed, according to the
                            Telegraph.<br>
                            <br>
                            Gaddafi tried to explain Tony Blair in two
                            phone conversations in February 2011 that if
                            foreign powers helped Libyan rebels to
                            overthrow his government then next thing
                            Europeans would know jihadists would carry
                            out terrorist attacks across the European
                            continent.<br>
                            <br>
                            "It's a Jihad situation. They have arms and
                            are terrorizing people in the street… Can't
                            reason with them. They keep saying things
                            like Mohammad is the profit [the Prophet].
                            Similar to Bin Laden," Gaddafi told Blaire,
                            according to excerpts from their 2011 phone
                            conversation, the Telegraph reported.<br>
                            <br>
                            Due to negligent policies of Western
                            countries Libya is on the verge of being
                            engulfed by terrorism and becoming the new
                            stronghold of Daesh (Islamic State), Olivier
                            d’Auzon wrote for Le Huffington Post.<br>
                            <br>
                            Gaddafi also welcomed foreign journalists to
                            come over to Libya and see the situation for
                            themselves, so the world would know the
                            truth about those so-called "rebels" who
                            eventually toppled his government.<br>
                            <br>
                            "Need to explain to the international
                            community. Reporters can come to make sure
                            this is the truth, they are welcome,"
                            Gaddafi told the former Prime Minister.<br>
                            <br>
                            When Blair told Gaddafi to step down as the
                            head of the state, the former Libyan leader
                            insisted that he was defending his country
                            and the entire North African coast from
                            Islamic extremists.<br>
                            <br>
                            "We are not fighting them, they are
                            attacking us… The story is simply this: an
                            organization has laid down sleeping cells in
                            North Africa. Called the Al-Qaeda
                            Organization in North Africa," Gaddafi said.<br>
                            <br>
                            During his second conversation with Blair,
                            in which the former British Prime Minister
                            re-iterated that Gaddafi must step down to
                            bring peaceful changes to his country,
                            Gaddafi refused to leave and said he'd have
                            to arm troops loyal to him to crush jihadist
                            groups taking over Libya and the
                            Mediterranean Sea.<br>
                            <br>
                            "Libyan people will die, damage will be on
                            the med, Europe and the whole world these
                            armed groups are using the situation as a
                            justification — and we shall fight them,"
                            Gaddafi said, according to excerpts from
                            their 2011 phone conversation with Blair,
                            the Telegraph reported.<br>
                            <br>
                            In the end, Gaddafi's words were ignored and
                            three weeks later NATO began bombing the
                            Libyan Armed Forces, which soon led to the
                            overthrow of the Libyan government.<br>
                            <br>
                            After Gaddafi's government was overthrown
                            and Colonel himself killed, the country
                            failed to form a stable government and Libya
                            descended into chaos. Various groups of
                            Islamic extremists, including Daesh (Islamic
                            State), took advantage of the situation and
                            increased their influence in the country.<br>
                            <br>
                            Gaddafi's warnings were prophetic. In fact,
                            he predicted everything. As soon as Libya
                            fell into the hands of Islamic extremists,
                            the country became the hotbed of terrorism.
                            In November 2015, Daesh terrorists carried
                            out a series of terrorist attacks in Paris
                            killing 130 people and injuring 368. At the
                            same time, a growing number of jihadists are
                            said to be crossing into Europe from North
                            Africa.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

                Many Years ago a Preacher by the name of David Wilkerson
                had a vision from God and in a book titled The vision...
                David shared what God had shared with him about coming
                world events, the following are excerpts from this
                prophecy, the reason I want to share this with you is
                many are not even aware of this warning since it was
                written in 1974...you will be amazed and probably
                alarmed as you read these excerpts because they will
                read as out of the daily news of events that are taking
                place at this very time.<br>
                <br>
                <small><b>From Chapter one under the title of Economic
                    Confusion David reveals what will take place during
                    a world wide economic crisis :</b><b><br>
                  </b><b><br>
                  </b><b>A crash is coming</b></small><br>
                <br>
                There is a worldwide economic confusion just ahead. In
                my vision, this is the clearest thing I have seen.<br>
                <br>
                Many praying people now share this very, same vision.<br>
                <br>
                Not only is the American dollar headed for deep trouble,
                but so are all world currencies. I see total economic
                confusion striking Europe first and then affecting
                Japan, the United States, Canada, and all other nations
                shortly thereafter.<br>
                <br>
                It is not really a depression I see coming --- but a
                recession of such magnitude it will affect the lifestyle
                of nearly every wage earner in America and around the
                world.<br>
                <br>
                Countries that now control huge amounts of Western
                currency are going to be in very deep trouble also, Arab
                countries will especially be hurt.<br>
                <br>
                Without a doubt, there are lean years ahead full of
                monetary confusion and despair. How soon is not clear,
                but it is not far away.The world greatest economist will
                be at a loss to explain the confusion and an
                international crisis of fear will develop. A&nbsp; false
                economic boom will precede the recession---but it will
                be short lived. <br>
                <br>
                <small><b>Bankruptcies of Major Corporations</b><br>
                </small><br>
                I believe we are going to witness the bankruptcies of
                some of this nation's major and most popular
                corporations. I see tremendous difficulty arising for
                credit corporations .There are going to be many people
                unable to pay off their heavy obligations to major
                credit card companies, causing near-- chaos.<br>
                <br>
                Thousands of small businesses will also be forced into
                bankruptcies. Three and possibly four, of the major
                religious denominations will be forced into operate with
                a skeleton organization due to lack of funds. More than
                a few churches are going to go bankrupt and a number of
                independent missionary societies and church
                organizations are going to have to pull back. All but a
                few of the radio and television ministries will have to
                be abandoned.<br>
                <br>
                Tight money will trigger a wave of uncertainty and fear.
                Those who have money will hold it in reserve.<br>
                <br>
                The United States government&nbsp; is going to "over
                react" to the confused economical developments.<br>
                <br>
                I see a flurry of near panic decisions being made by
                various government agencies---but these hasty efforts to
                shore up the economy will backfire.<br>
                <br>
                The President of the United States will make one, and
                possibly two, national radio and TV&nbsp; appearances to
                reassure the nation that all is well, and that the best
                of economic times is just ahead.<br>
                <br>
                It will not work. People will distrust these&nbsp;
                statements, and their fears will lead to a revolution at
                the polls. <br>
                <br>
                The auto industry is going to be hurt badly.<br>
                <br>
                Labor leaders are also going to be caught up in this
                wave of economic confusion.<br>
                <br>
                We may soon experience the most devastating strikes of
                all times.<br>
                <br>
                Almost every economic indicator will be gloomy.<br>
                <br>
                It will be spotty at first----but will eventually effect
                nearly all industry.<br>

                <small><b>Earthquakes coming to United States</b></small><br>
                <br>
                The United States is going to experience in the
                not-too-distant future the most tragic earthquakes in
                its history. One day soon this nation will be reeling
                under the impact of the biggest news story of modern
                times. It will be coverage of the biggest most
                disastrous earthquake in history.<br>
                <br>
                It will cause widespread panic and fear, Without a
                doubt, it will become one of the most completely
                reported earthquake ever. Television networks will
                suspend all programming and carry all day coverage.<br>
                <br>
                Another earthquake , possibly in Japan&nbsp; may precede
                the one that I see coming here. There is not the
                slightest doubt in my mind about this forthcoming
                massive earthquake in our continent.<br>
                <br>
                I am not at all convinced that this earthquake will take
                place in California. In fact, I believe it is going to
                take place where it is least expected.This terrible
                earthquake may happen in an area that is not known as an
                earthquake belt. It will be so high on the Richter scale
                that it will trigger two other major earthquakes.<br>
                <br>
                <small><b>Famine is coming</b></small><b><br>
                </b><br>
                Snowless winters will bring dismal crop production and
                famine conditions in central and western Russia, India,
                Pakistan , all of southeast Asia and Africa will
                especially hard hit. <br>
                <br>
                The forty-month drought in Africa and the prolonged dry
                spell in Brazil will both end temporarily. There will be
                some relief but conditions will worsen. In Africa,
                millions will face starvation.<br>
                <br>
                American food reserves will dwindle partially due to
                drought and flood in this country. Wheat, rice and
                soybean reserves will be completely exhausted. The
                demand for corn, rice and wheat will not be met...<br>
                <br>
                <small><b>The Beginning of Sorrows</b></small><br>
                <br>
                Floods, hurricanes, tornadoes and hailstorms will occur
                more frequently. More than one-third of the United
                States will be designated a disaster area within the
                next few years...<br>
                <small><br>
                  <b>Nature will go Wild</b></small><br>
                <br>
                Floods, hurricanes and tornadoes will destroy crops,
                animals and much wildlife driving prices even higher and
                causing some experts to suggest that nature is losing
                its balance.<br>
                <br>
                Weather will become increasing difficult to forecast.
                Sudden storms will appear without warning. Southernmost
                regions will be gripped by record cold waves and
                northern areas will experience record heat waves...<br>
                <br>
                <small><b>Short Periods of Relief</b></small><b><br>
                </b><br>
                Many men will appear to be repentant during the times of
                violent chastisement by natue but the short period of
                relief will make it appear that nature has settled down
                and men will be comforted by warmed, sunshine and normal
                seasonal weather. But more violence, far worse will soon
                follow.<br>
                <br>
                Airline pilots will be reporting the worst flying
                conditions in aviation history. The most intense
                hurricanes is coming. Many parts of the world face the
                most violent winters of all times. Europe faces the
                worst winter lashings ever.<br>
                <br>
                <small><b>Depletion of Relief funds</b></small><b><br>
                </b><br>
                Relief and disaster funds will become nearly depleted.
                Insurance companies will face huge losses.<br>
                <br>
                Unlimited funds are not available and the people of each
                nations will soon learn there will be no one left to
                turn to but God.<br>
                <br>
                <small><b>Outbreaks of Epidemics </b></small><br>
                <br>
                Mankind faces the threat of new epidemics. There will a
                major cholera epidemic sweeping through various
                underdeveloped countries. India and Pakistan face threat
                of untold thousands dying from epidemics and starvation.<br>
                <br>
                <small><b>Hailstorms</b></small><br>
                <br>
                Large chunks of ice will fall from the sky and cause
                much damage. These storms will not only destroy crops
                and smash automobiles but they will also cause the death
                of many people.<br>
                <br>
                Watch out for reports of intense ice storms and
                hailstorms in the future.Also prepare for the most
                severe winter of all time and record snowfalls in the
                United States and Canada.<br>

                </b><small><b>Economic Crash Coming</b></small><b><br>
                </b><br>
                There is worldwide economic confusion just ahead. In my
                vision this is the clearest thing I have seen. Not only
                is the American Dollar headed for deep trouble, but so
                are all other world currencies. I see total economic
                confusion striking Europe first and then affecting
                Japan, the United States, Canada and all other nations
                shortly thereafter. <br>
                <br>
                <small><b>Everyone Will Be Affected</b></small><br>
                <br>
                A recession of such magnitude that it will affect the
                lifestyle of nearly every wage earner in America and
                around the world. <br>
                <br>
                <small><b>Owners of Western Currency in Trouble</b><br>
                </small><br>
                Countries that now control huge amounts of Western
                currency are going to be in very deep trouble also
                without a doubt, there are lean years ahead full of
                monetary confusion and despair. How soon is not clear,
                but it is not far away. <br>
                <br>
                <small><b>New World Monetary System</b></small><br>
                <br>
                There will develop a call for revamping all world
                monetary systems into one uniform system.<br>
                <br>
                And even though the dollar will appear to be gaining
                strength just before the coming major recession, a new
                crisis will develop that will shake the entire financial
                world. <br>
                <br>
                <small><b>Economists Confused</b></small><b><br>
                </b><br>
                The world‘s greatest economists will be at a loss to
                explain the confusion and an international crisis of
                fear will develop.<br>
                <br>
                <small><b>False Boom</b></small><br>
                <br>
                A false economic boom will precede the recession but it
                will be short lived.<br>
                <br>
                <small><b>A Few Good Years to Prepare</b></small><b><br>
                </b><br>
                The next few years will be among the most prosperous in
                the history of mankind. <br>
                <br>
                Sales will continue to break records and people will
                spend more than ever in modern history.<br>
                <br>
                <small><b>Uncontrolled Credit Debt</b></small><br>
                <br>
                Credit debt will become nearly uncontrollable. I see,
                very clearly, just a few years of tremendous affluence
                and continued economic prosperity. Inflation, costs and
                wages will spiral higher and higher. <br>
                <br>
                <small><b>Bankruptcies of Major Corporations</b></small><b><br>
                </b><br>
                I believe we are going to witness the bankruptcies of
                some of this nations major and most popular
                corporations. I see tremendous difficulty arising for
                credit corporations. There are going to be many people
                unable to pay off their heavy obligations to major
                credit card companies, causing near chaos. Thousands of
                small businesses will also be forced into bankruptcies.<br>
                <br>
                <small><b>Government Panic</b></small><br>
                <br>
                The United States government is going to overreact to
                the confused economical developments. I see a flurry of
                near-panic decisions being made by various government
                agencies but these hasty efforts to shore up the economy
                will backfire.<br>
                <br>
                <small><b>Auto Industry Hit Hard</b></small><br>
                <br>
                The auto industry is going to be hurt badly. Makers of
                recreational vehicles are going to get hit very hard.<br>
                <br>
                <small><b>Building Industry Setbacks</b></small><b><br>
                </b><br>
                The building industry is going to face many setbacks.
                Housing starts will level off. There is a terrible
                squeeze coming to the building industry.<br>
                <br>
                <small><b>Gold Will Not Provide Security</b></small><br>
                <br>
                The price of gold is going to rise astronomically but it
                will not be sustained over a long period of time neither
                silver nor gold will offer real security. Gold hoarders
                are going to get hurt badly. This is one of the most
                significant predictions in this book.<br>
                <br>
                <small><b>Suicide by Overdose</b><br>
                </small><br>
                Economic setbacks and confusion will catch many
                unprepared for the consequences. Suicide will follow.
                Some very well-known people in the business world are
                going to commit suicide through overdoses of narcotics.<br>
                <small><br>
                  <b>Confusion for the Positive Thinking Preachers</b></small><br>
                <br>
                Great losses, confusion, and reverses will shatter the
                thinking processes of many well-meaning people who
                falsely believe that their successes and economic
                well-being are the result of their own positive
                thinking. Jesus Christ Himself was an advocate of right
                thinking. <br>
                <br>
                But many good men have become worshippers of the power
                of the mind.<br>

                <small><b>The United States to Be Blamed</b></small><b><br>
                </b><br>
                Although economic actions in Europe will trigger the
                coming recession, the United States will be blamed by
                most nations for what happens. France will become one of
                the most vicious anti-American nations in the world.
                Politicians and businessmen in Europe and Japan will
                place the blame on Washington and the American bankers.<br>
                <br>
                <small><b>Recovery From Recession</b></small><b><br>
                </b><br>
                There may be a full recovery but the world economy will
                continue in confusion until the time of the Antichrist.
                There will come a time in the future when men will be
                obsessed with buying, selling, planting, marrying, and
                divorcing but it will be a time of false prosperity.<br>

                In the aftermath of famine, floods and earthquakes,

                Soviet Russia will collapse 70 years after the Bolshevik
                revolution of 1917. The prediction was made in the late
                70s - early 80s. <br>
                He saw a vision of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in
                1974 2 weeks before it occurred. <br>
                He foresaw the destruction of Turkey by Russia, after
                Turkey attacks Greece. NATO will oppose the Russians but
                its forces will be destroyed <br>
                The nation of Israel will be destroyed 70 years after
                its conception. 2/3 of their People will become
                Christians. Is it a coincidence that the Elder died at
                age 70<br>
                The beginning of Armageddon will be near after Turkey
                closes the Euphrates River dam. <br>
                Turkey will be divided in pieces. One piece will go to
                Greece; one Piece will go to Armenia and one to
                Kurdistan. <br>
                The Dome of the Rock will collapse from bellow.
                Armageddon will be close when Solomons temple is ready
                to be rebuilt. <br>
                Israel will attack its close neighbours with nuclear
                weapons when they see their end is near.<br>

                </b><small><b>Prophecy 1:</b></small><br>
                One doctor said Elder, what we expect in the future?<br>
                — The future, my child, only God knows.<br>
                — Gerontius, whether big war?<br>
                — Why do you ask, my child? And do not imagine that
                would be!<br>
                <br>
                <small><b>Prophecy 2:</b></small><br>
                Now read the prophecy — how to read a newspaper:
                everything is clearly written. Thought tells me that
                there will be many events: the Russian occupy Turkey,
                Turkey will disappear from the map, because one third of
                Turks will be Christian, one third die and one third
                will go to Mesopotamia.<br>
                Middle East will become an arena of war, which will
                include Russian. Shed a lot of blood, and even the
                Chinese will move the Euphrates River, with 200,000,000
                army and reach Jerusalem.<br>
                <br>
                Characteristic feature that makes these events will be
                the destruction of the mosque of Omar, as it would mean
                the destruction of the beginning of work on the
                reconstruction of Solomon&amp;#39;s Temple, which was
                built right in the place.<br>
                In Constantinople, will the great war between Russian
                and European, and shed a lot of blood. Greece will not
                play a primary role in this war, but it will give
                Constantinople, not because they are in front of us fear
                the Russian, but because they can not find a better
                solution, and agreed to work together with Greece, and
                will put pressure on them difficult circumstances. The
                Greek army will not have time to come back to the city
                will be given to her. Jews, because they will have the
                strength and support of the European leadership
                obnagleyut and will show their pride and shamelessness
                and try to govern Europe. Then 2/3 of the Jews will be
                Christians.<br>
                Unfortunately, people are pushed into the theology, not
                related to the church and is worldly sophistication that
                say different things and make impermissible action, to
                deliberately remove his position from the faith of
                Christians. So did Russian, when they wanted to
                introduce communism in Russia. What are they doing
                there? Once joined the party some wrong priests and
                theologians — and were already "together with them," —
                they were forced to accuse the Church and often speak
                against it. So they poison the people, because he could
                not recognize the role of these theologians. Then he
                took one of his priests, who, because of illness was
                very thick, looking for some months skinny kid, put them
                on a poster and wrote down: "This is how the Church
                lives and how people are poor." We took a photograph of
                the Patriarchal chambers covered with a carpet,
                furniture, etc., and placed next to the hut of one of
                the poor (as our gypsies) and said, look at the luxury
                of priests and a languishing Russian citizen! So little
                by little, they managed to poison the people and the
                "ruin his thought." And after people consume themselves,
                and they were, and, as we know, have rejected Russia 500
                years ago, and left her to die, killing millions of
                Russian Christians.<br>
                They will build many machinations, but through
                persecution that followed, Christianity completely
                united. But not in the way they want those machinations
                suit global alliance of churches wanting to be at the
                head of the religious leadership. United, because the
                present situation will be separation of sheep from the
                goats. Each sheep will tend to be with the other sheep
                and then realized, in fact, "one flock and one
                shepherd." Delve? See that this is already partly
                implemented: Christians, you see, have already begun to
                feel that they are in an unhealthy climate, and will try
                to avoid painful situations and replenished by the
                thousands in the monasteries and churches. Will soon see
                that the city there are two parts of people: those who
                will live lascivious and far from the life of Christ,
                and others that will be on the vigil pritekat and places
                of worship. Mean state, as it is now, can no longer
                exist.<br>
                <br>
                <small><b>Prophecy 3:</b></small><br>
                Once I came down and saw Elder somewhat embarrassed and
                upset. He gave me and he began to speak:<br>
                — Some came here and started talking to me, that is a
                war, and that the Turks will be included in Greece, and
                that we shall put six miles from Corinth (explaining the
                mistake, spoiled his thoughts, prophecy Cosmas
                Aetolian). Then I picked up, and said that the worst
                enemy of the Greeks is that when the world some Greeks,
                as you spread that if war happens, Turks chase us to
                Corinth, because when the war starts, everyone will
                bruised spirit and they retreat to Corinth. Besides, if
                it was true, we must not say. Even more so when it is —
                a lie. And you repeat once again that this does not say
                anywhere, because he made a lot more evil than would
                have made many Turkish division.<br>
                I told them this, and they forced me to explain, even
                though I never wanted to talk about the prophecies that
                shestimilie, which says Saint Cosmas — is six miles of
                the sea shelf. This is an issue for which we recently
                gnawed with Turkey, and it will be the case, because we
                "seize." However, they should not enter into Hellas:
                they will move only on the six miles, and then they will
                find a great evil from the north, as the Scripture says,
                and "there will be nothing direct." One third of Turks
                will be killed, a third will take Christianity, and the
                rest will go away in Asia. We are in no way suffered
                from the Turks. Some unimportant things destroyed, and
                they will find God's wrath.<br>
                This I heard from them and was upset. I could not
                believe that the Greeks themselves — that spread things
                in the world — will have the greatest help the Turks.<br>
                I also started to say, said St. Cosmas, "then come, when
                they come two summers and two paschal together," now
                that the Resurrection (Easter) coincides with the
                Annunciation — and passed the winter as the summer —
                which means that the Turks would attack Hellas (Greece).<br>
                We all became a prophet, my father, and explain things
                to our mind, as we want. And here I had to tell them
                that St. Cosmas, when he said: "Then will come" does not
                mean the Turks. Granted that then comes freedom for
                residents of Northern Epirus. Indeed, this year opened
                after many years abroad, and they may, in some way, to
                communicate freely with his homeland.<br>
                My father, I have seen that quite a lot of harm cause
                these people, explaining things to my poor mind. And not
                only convey its other corrupt thought.<br>
                <br>
                <small><b>Prophecy 4:</b></small><br>
                So "noble" is divided into parts of Turkey<br>
                Asked the elder brother of the events in Serbia, and
                that, among other things, said:<br>
                — Europeans are now doing, for the Turks, independent of
                where Muslims live (Bosnia and Herzegovina). I see,
                however, that the partition of Turkey noble way: rebel
                Kurds and Armenians, and the Europeans need to make
                independent and these nations. Then Turkey will say: we
                did you a favor there, now this way should become
                independent Kurds and Armenians. So "noble" is divided
                into parts of Turkey.<br>
                Holy Arseny said in Farasah believers that they will
                lose the fatherland, but soon again get it.<br>
                <br>
                <small><b>Prophecy 5:</b></small><br>
                In the summer of 1987 I asked the elder of the future
                world war, the one called "Armageddon" and reported to
                the Scriptures.<br>
                With fatherly interest he gave me different information.
                And even wanted to open some signs that convince us that
                we really are in a generation of Armageddon. So he said:<br>
                "When you hear that the Turks Euphrates cover the upper
                dam and use it for irrigation, then know that we have
                already entered in the preparation of the Great War, and
                thus prepares the way for dvuhsotmilionnogo troops from
                the rising of the sun, according to Revelation.<br>
                Among the preparations there is: to dry up the Euphrates
                River that could pass large army. Although — Elder
                smiled at this place — if two hundred million Chinese
                will come when there will drink one cup of water, they
                osushat Euphrates!<br>
                I was told that the Chinese army now stands at two
                hundred million, that is, a specific number, which is
                described by St. John in Revelation. The Chinese even
                prepare the way, which is called "the miracle era": its
                width is such that it easily passed by thousands of
                soldiers, lined up in a row. And this time they brought
                it to the borders of India.<br>
                It must, however, great care and enlightened pure mind
                in order that we may discern the signs of the times,
                because, in a way, it is all so that they can not
                distinguish between those who do not care about
                cleansing the heart, and, as a result easily mistaken.
                Suppose someone knows that in order to pass over an army
                of millions, to dry the river Euphrates. However, if you
                expect it to happen miraculously, ie will suppose a big
                crack and fade away all the water, then that person will
                be in error, for it is not taken care of through the
                purity of heart "to enter into the spirit of" the
                Scriptures. Something similar happened with Chernobyl:
                the Revelation of St. John the Evangelist says that he
                saw a star that had fallen from the sky and water, and
                has infected people. Those, however, who expects that
                the star will fall from the sky, has long been in the
                wrong, and never realize that it is already
                accomplished. Chernobyl in Russia means "Wormwood" and
                we see that caused great harm, and it will be even more
                over time … "<br>

                During the procession of Dreadful Predstatelnitsy in
                1992 an umbrella over the icon of Panagia had Ensign of
                Ioannina. When we were on the right of it was me, and
                left old man, who at one point said to the officer:<br>

                A day later, I went into his cell and asked on the City.

                — Constantinople take back, but not us. We, from the
                fact that most of our young people went down, unable to
                do that. God, however, is designed so that others will

                Small group of students from Afoniady down to the elder.
                They focus on one theme: they heard, as if the old man
                said to some that we take Constantinople. And they
                wanted to do to hear it from his mouth, and especially
                to ask if they would be living at the time. So they
                talked to each other on the road, that someone had to
                ask Elder about this topic. So they came and sat down
                with him, no one, however, dared to ask such a question.
                They got up, took the blessing and headed for the trail.
                Elder, seeing them smile said:<br>
                — And remember: Constantinople and take and you live and

                Union was very strong in all respects and no one could
                even suggest that it may be destroyed — it was still
                under the rule of Brezhnev.<br>

                Taking a blessing, they sat in the outer arhondarike.
                Old man with a good nature brought them a traditional

                aim for it. Being corrupt and small children.<br>
                Elder: The law says that? Filing a suit?<br>
                Dimitri: We try, Gerontius, do something, but they do
                not take the words.<br>
                Elder: You always have a clean conscience, doing my
                duty. Else But God.<br>
                Dimitri: Can you tell us, Gerontius, how we behave in
                this evil world? So … in general.<br>
                Elder: Need reasoning. Do you have a confessor?<br>
                Dimitri: Yes, Gerontius.<br>
                Elder: Counsel with the priest, because sometimes we can
                not say yes or&nbsp; no;, so it requires reasoning.<br>
                Here the old man got up and left them alone, and they,
                seizing the right moment, agreed to request the Elder
                tell Constantinople. Soon the old man came back and, to
                the amazement of all, before they could ask about
                anything — showing that his spiritual "radar" caught
                their thoughts — said to them:<br>
                Elder: What you say, whether we take City?<br>
                They were numb and did not say anything.<br>
                Elder: Tell me whether we take City?<br>
                Group in amazement did not answer.<br>
                Elder (Jokingly): Big Mouth …<br>
                Theodore: Take, Gerontius.<br>
                Elder: Glory to you, O God. (Crosses to the east and
                looking to the side of the City.)<br>
                Dimitri: If God bless, Gerontius, take it.<br>
                Elder: Yes, this is from God! Take it! Just do not we
                hire him, and give it to us. Those who take it from the
                Turks, give it as a solution, we, as will assume that it
                is profitable for them.<br>
                Dimitri: Gerontius, how long it will go wrong?<br>
                Elder: Maybe it can be! However, we will take the
                examination.<br>
                Dimitri: Will the proper guidance?<br>
                Elder: God is satisfied. In this war, all come out
                winners. The Greek army will be a spectator. No one will
                return winner. The arena will be Palestine, their grave
                — the Dead Sea. This will be the first in half a time.
                But it will be the second half a: after the event people
                will come to despair, and then everything will be
                studying the Gospel and Scripture. Christ will spare the
                world and show the sign for faith. Then thou shalt seek
                the unbeliever.<br>
                Dimitri: Gerontius, Troparion of the prophet Elijah said
                he — "the forerunner of the Second Coming of Christ." He
                is known to have died, as Enoch. Will the prophet Elijah
                to the ground?<br>
                Elder (Smiling): The Prophet Elijah and prepares
                sharpens his knife! And even before the start with the
                patriarchs, princes, priests, and monks!<br>
                Nikolai: And the mundane.<br>
                Elder: Do you — ignorance, we have — sins. Is it not
                said in prayer to the Divine Liturgy: "O our sins did
                and the human ignorance"? The prophet Elijah is
                sharpening his knife: but need much attention, because
                some of the things that is to say the Fathers, and
                otherwise interpret the world as, say, shestimilii
                reported by Saint Cosmas Aetolian. (Turks leave, but
                will come up again and reached shestimiliya. Eventually
                their chase to the Red Apples (Kokkinh Mhlia). The Turks
                third die and another third sign of the cross and the
                last third will go to the Red apple.) No can not explain
                it.<br>
                Shestimilie there Langadase, Kilnise, in Thrace, in
                Corinth, but no one knows, those of whom he speaks, —
                six miles of territorial waters. You do not read the
                prophets, in Joel, Zechariah, Ezekiel, in Daniel? It
                says it all. Seven years in Palestine will not burn
                wood, and sticks, but how do you know the difference
                between sticks of wood! You are now in the homes of
                heaters (with a smile), while here I&amp;#39;m burning
                wood in the stove, and I know what&amp;#39;s what.<br>
                (This is the prophecy of Ezekiel — 39, 9-10: "Then the
                people of the cities of Israel shall go forth, and set
                on fire and will burn the weapons, shields and armor,
                bows and arrows, clubs and spears, seven years will burn
                them. And will not take no wood from the field, neither
                cut down any out of the forests, but they will burn only
                weapon, and robbed of their robbers, gatherers and rob
                them, saith the Lord God. ")<br>
                Christ: Jews …<br>
                Elder: One pious Jordanian told me that the Jews dug
                under the Dome of the Rock is many meters deep tunnel,
                and want to destroy the mosque to build the Temple of
                Solomon, as Then, they say, the Messiah, that is,
                Antichrist. Then Arabians say to Christians: Do you not
                say, as Christians, that the Messiah has already come?
                Now what they say here, the Jews?<br>
                <br>
                Elder, bringing back the pilgrims had come up a treat,
                and asked one of them:<br>
                Elder: Whether we take the city? What do you think?<br>
                Christ: I will go to the Northern Epirus.<br>
                Elder: Take the City, Northern Epirus take seven of us!<br>
                Christ: Seven and I — eight!<br>
                Elder: Good for you! I transferred the relics of St.
                Cosmas Aetolian — they are heavy! What can I say, guys,
                these things write and tell our books (church), but who
                reads them? The people do not have a clue. Sleeping in
                sandals!<br>
                Dimitri: This, Gerontius, signs of the times?<br>
                Elder: Signs, signs of the times can not see … You have
                to be sorry, sheep, not to understand what is going on …
                Many of the Fathers prayed, that live in our time,
                because it is — the time of the Confessors. We sleep in
                sandals. Soon be asked to Christians, as people asked
                for their political beliefs.<br>
                Nikolai: Zavedut whether we thing of Gerontius?<br>
                Elder: And, bravo! Case.<br>
                Dimitri: Gerontius, Greece suffer?<br>
                Elder: Greece has passed a lot of storms, however, will
                still be! Greece in no way be affected, because God
                loves it. In Asia Minor, we had a lot of relics. On each
                piece of land you will find relics. Take the Hagia
                Sophia and the gates will open. These gates nobody knows
                … we shall see, however, what will? What then will be
                the minarets?<br>
                Nikolai: We destroyed them.<br>
                Theodore: Will do their belfries.<br>
                Elder (Smiling): No, they will become the pillars for
                the Stylite, and will dangle beads to the bottom!<br>
                Dimitri: Leaders of this war are the Jews?<br>
                Elder: Yes, the Jews are. Many will promote and Dad,
                because all the children of the devil will be his (ie
                the Pope) and he will tell them to follow the
                Antichrist. Therefore, the holy Cosmas said: "Pope curse
                because it will cause. " Holy Pope meant that particular
                time, which will help the Antichrist interned. Other
                Pope compared to him seem good.<br>
                After this, the first time they hear and wonder, what is
                showed to them the love of the Elder, the group remained
                for some time silent and worried. The elder stood, and
                blessed them, and pointed the way so they do not get
                lost and get there.<br>
                They left his cell Elder shocked, thinking that God
                prepareth in the future. They also thought that such
                apocalyptic events should never be forgotten. The names
                of these, and love your brothers asked to pray for them,
                but will find favor with God. Amen.<br>

                gave him his baptismal name. As a kid really wanted to

                operator. In 1949, he graduated from the service and
                immediately went to the Holy Mountain. In 1950 he came
                to the monastery Esfigmen.<br>

                as needed. Elder Paisios o.Tihona settled at will (after
                his death) in his cell of the Holy Cross, where he lived

                Conclusion : Two key social features contributed to the
                collapse of every advanced civilization in the past:
                “…the stretching of resources due to the strain placed
                on the ecological carrying capacity”; and “the economic
                stratification of society into Elites [rich] and Masses
                (or “Commoners”) [poor]” These social phenomena have
                played “a central role in the character or in the
                process of the collapse,” in all such cases over “the
                last five thousand years.” Sound familiar ?<br>

                </b><br>
                There are widespread concerns that current trends in
                resource-use are unsustainable, but possibilities of
                overshoot/collapse remain controversial. Collapses have
                occurred frequently in history, often followed by
                centuries of economic, intellectual, and population
                decline. Many different natural and social phenomena
                have been invoked to explain specific collapses, but a
                general explanation remains elusive.<br>
                <br>
                In this paper, we build a human population dynamics
                model by adding accumulated wealth and economic
                inequality to a predator–prey model of humans and
                nature. The model structure, and simulated scenarios
                that offer significant implications, are explained. Four
                equations describe the evolution of Elites, Commoners,
                Nature, and Wealth. The model shows Economic
                Stratification or Ecological Strain can independently
                lead to collapse, in agreement with the historical
                record.<br>
                <br>
                The measure “Carrying Capacity” is developed and its
                estimation is shown to be a practical means for early
                detection of a collapse. Mechanisms leading to two types
                of collapses are discussed. The new dynamics of this
                model can also reproduce the irreversible collapses
                found in history. Collapse can be avoided, and
                population can reach a steady state at maximum carrying
                capacity if the rate of depletion of nature is reduced
                to a sustainable level and if resources are distributed
                equitably.<br>
                <br>
                <small><b>1. Introduction</b></small><b><br>
                </b><br>
                There are widespread concerns that current trends in
                population and resource-use are unsustainable, but the
                possibilities of an overshoot and collapse remain
                unclear and controversial. How real is the possibility
                of a societal collapse? Can complex, advanced
                civilizations really collapse? It is common to portray
                human history as a relentless and inevitable trend
                toward greater levels of social complexity, political
                organization, and economic specialization, with the
                development of more complex and capable technologies
                supporting ever-growing population, all sustained by the
                mobilization of ever-increasing quantities of material,
                energy, and information. Yet this is not inevitable. In
                fact, cases where this seemingly near-universal,
                long-term trend has been severely disrupted by a
                precipitous collapse – often lasting centuries – have
                been quite common. A brief review of some examples of
                collapses suggests that the process of rise-and-collapse
                is actually a recurrent cycle found throughout history,
                making it important to establish a general explanation
                of this process (Chase-Dunn and Hall, 1997, Goldstein,
                1988, Meadows et al., 1972, Modelski, 1987, Tainter,
                1988, Turchin and Nefedov, 2009 and Yoffee and Cowgill,
                1988).<br>
                <br>
                The Roman Empire's dramatic collapse (followed by many
                centuries of population decline, economic deterioration,
                intellectual regression, and the disappearance of
                literacy) is well known, but it was not the first
                rise-and-collapse cycle in Europe. Prior to the rise of
                Classical Greco-Roman civilization, both the Minoan and
                Mycenaean Civilizations had each risen, reached very
                advanced levels of civilization, and then collapsed
                virtually completely (Morris, 2006 and Redman, 1999).
                The history of Mesopotamia – the very cradle of
                civilization, agriculture, complex society, and urban
                life – presents a series of rise-and-declines including
                the Sumerians, the Akkadian, Assyrian, Babylonian,
                Achaemenid, Seleucid, Parthian, Sassanid, Umayyad, and
                Abbasid Empires (Redman et al., 2004 and Yoffee, 1979).
                In neighboring Egypt, this cycle also appeared
                repeatedly. In both Anatolia and in the Indus Valley,
                the very large and long-lasting Hittite and Harrapan
                civilizations both collapsed so completely that their
                very existence was unknown until modern archeology
                rediscovered them. Similar cycles of rise and collapse
                occurred repeatedly in India, most notably with the
                Mauryan and the Gupta Empires (Edwards et al., 1971,
                Edwards et al., 1973, Jansen et al., 1991, Kenoyer, 1998
                and Thapar, 2004). Southeast Asia similarly experienced
                “multiple and overlapping histories of collapse and
                regeneration” over 15 centuries, culminating in the
                Khmer Empire based in Angkor, which itself was
                depopulated and swallowed by the forest during the 15th
                Century (Stark, 2006). Chinese history is, very much
                like Egypt's, full of repeated cycles of rises and
                collapses, with each of the Zhou, Han, Tang, and Song
                Empires followed by a very serious collapse of political
                authority and socioeconomic progress (Chu and Lee, 1994,
                Lee, 1931 and Needham and Wang, 1956).<br>
                <br>
                Collapses are not restricted to the “Old World”. The
                collapse of Maya Civilization is well known and evokes
                widespread fascination, both because of the advanced
                nature of Mayan society and because of the depth of the
                collapse (Demerest et al., 2004 and Webster, 2002). As
                Diamond (2005) puts it, it is difficult to ignore “the
                disappearance of between 90 and 99% of the Maya
                population after A.D. 800 …and the disappearance of
                kings, Long Count calendars, and other complex political
                and cultural institutions.” In the nearby central
                highlands of Mexico, a number of powerful states also
                rose to high levels of power and prosperity and then
                rapidly collapsed, Teotihuacan (the sixth largest city
                in the world in the 7th C) and Monte Alban being just
                the largest of these to experience dramatic collapse,
                with their populations declining to about 20–25% of
                their peak within just a few generations (Tainter,
                1988).<br>
                <br>
                We know of many other collapses including Mississippian
                Cultures such as Cahokia, South West US cultures such as
                the Pueblo and Hohokam, Andean civilizations such as
                Tiwanaku, Sub-Saharan civilizations such as Great
                Zimbabwe, and many collapses across the Pacific Islands,
                such as Easter Island. It is also likely other collapses
                have also occurred in societies that were not at a
                sufficient level of complexity to produce written
                records or archeological evidence. Indeed, a recent
                study (Shennan et al., 2013) of the Neolithic period in
                Europe has shown that “in contrast to the steady
                population growth usually assumed, the introduction of
                agriculture into Europe was followed by a boom-and-bust
                pattern in the density of regional populations”.
                Furthermore “most regions show more than one boom–bust
                pattern”, and in most regions, population declines “of
                the order of the 30–60%” can be found. The authors also
                argue that, rather than climate change or diseases, the
                timing and evidence point to endogenous causes for these
                collapses in 19 out of 23 cases studied, suggesting the
                possibility of “rapid population growth driven by
                farming to unsustainable levels”. Moreover, through
                wavelet analysis of the archeological data, S. Downey
                [personal communication] has shown that the average
                length of such boom-and-bust cycles is about 300–500
                years.<br>
                <br>
                In summary, despite the common impression that societal
                collapse is rare, or even largely fictional, “the
                picture that emerges is of a process recurrent in
                history, and global in its distribution” (Tainter,
                1988). See also Yoffee and Cowgill (1988), Goldstein
                (1988), Ibn Khaldun (1958), Kondratieff (1984), and
                Parsons (1991). As Turchin and Nefedov (2009) contend,
                there is a great deal of support for “the hypothesis
                that secular cycles — demographic–social–political
                oscillations of a very long period (centuries long) are
                the rule, rather than an exception in the large agrarian
                states and empires.”<br>
                <br>
                This brings up the question of whether modern
                civilization is similarly susceptible. It may seem
                reasonable to believe that modern civilization, armed
                with its greater technological capacity, scientific
                knowledge, and energy resources, will be able to survive
                and endure whatever crises historical societies
                succumbed to. But the brief overview of collapses
                demonstrates not only the ubiquity of the phenomenon,
                but also the extent to which advanced, complex, and
                powerful societies are susceptible to collapse. The fall
                of the Roman Empire, and the equally (if not more)
                advanced Han, Mauryan, and Gupta Empires, as well as so
                many advanced Mesopotamian Empires, are all testimony to
                the fact that advanced, sophisticated, complex, and
                creative civilizations can be both fragile and
                impermanent.<br>
                <br>
                A large number of explanations have been proposed for
                each specific case of collapse, including one or more of
                the following: volcanoes, earthquakes, droughts, floods,
                changes in the courses of rivers, soil degradation
                (erosion, exhaustion, salinization, etc.),
                deforestation, climate change, tribal migrations,
                foreign invasions, changes in technology (such as the
                introduction of ironworking), changes in the methods or
                weapons of warfare (such as the introduction of horse
                cavalry, armored infantry, or long swords), changes in
                trade patterns, depletion of particular mineral
                resources (e.g., silver mines), cultural decline and
                social decadence, popular uprisings, and civil wars.
                However, these explanations are specific to each
                particular case of collapse rather than general.
                Moreover, even for the specific case where the
                explanation applies, the society in question usually had
                already experienced the phenomenon identified as the
                cause without collapsing. For example, the Minoan
                society had repeatedly experienced earthquakes that
                destroyed palaces, and they simply rebuilt them more
                splendidly than before. Indeed, many societies
                experience droughts, floods, volcanoes, soil erosion,
                and deforestation with no major social disruption
                (Tainter, 1988).<br>
                <br>
                The same applies to migrations, invasions, and civil
                wars. The Roman, Han, Assyrian, and Mauryan Empires
                were, for centuries, completely militarily hegemonic,
                successfully defeating the neighboring “barbarian”
                peoples who eventually did overrun them. So external
                military pressure alone hardly constitutes an
                explanation for their collapses. With both natural
                disasters and external threats, identifying a specific
                cause compels one to ask, “yes, but why did this
                particular instance of this factor produce the
                collapse?” Other processes must be involved, and, in
                fact, the political, economic, ecological, and
                technological conditions under which civilizations have
                collapsed have varied widely. Individual collapses may
                have involved an array of specific factors, with
                particular triggers, but a general explanation remains
                elusive. Individual explanations may seem appropriate in
                their particular case, but the very universal nature of
                the phenomenon implies a mechanism that is not specific
                to a particular time period of human history, nor a
                particular culture, technology, or natural disaster
                (Tainter, 1988, Turchin, 2003 and Yoffee and Cowgill,
                1988).<br>
                <br>
                In this paper we attempt to model collapse
                mathematically in a more general way. We propose a
                simple model, not intended to describe actual individual
                cases, but rather to provide a general framework that
                allows carrying out “thought experiments” for the
                phenomenon of collapse and to test changes that would
                avoid it. This model (called HANDY, for Human and Nature
                DYnamics) advances beyond existing biological dynamic
                population models by simultaneously modeling two
                separate important features which seem to appear across
                so many societies that have collapsed: (1) the
                stretching of resources due to the strain placed on the
                ecological carrying capacity (Abel, 1980, Catton, 1980,
                Kammen, 1994, Ladurie, 1987, Ponting, 1991, Postan,
                1966, Redman, 1999, Redman et al., 2004, Wood, 1998 and
                Wright, 2004), and (2) the economic stratification of
                society into Elites and Masses (or “Commoners”)
                (Brenner, 1985, Parsons, 1991, Turchin, 2005, Turchin,
                2006, Turchin and Nefedov, 2009, Diamond, 2005 and
                Goldstone, 1991; Ibn Khaldun, 1958). In many of these
                historical cases, we have direct evidence of Ecological
                Strain and Economic Stratification playing a central
                role in the character or in the process of the collapse
                (Culbert, 1973, Diamond, 2005, Goldstone, 1991, Lentz,
                2000 and Mitchell, 1990). For these empirical reasons,
                and the theoretical ones explained in Section 3, our
                model incorporates both of these two features. Although
                similar to the Brander and Taylor (1998) model
                (hereafter referred to as “BT”) in that HANDY is based
                on the classical predator–prey model, the inclusion of
                two societal classes introduces a much richer set of
                dynamical solutions, including cycles of societal and
                ecological collapse, as well as the possibility of
                smoothly reaching equilibrium (the ecological carrying
                capacity). We use Carrying Capacity in its biological
                definition: the population level that the resources of a
                particular environment can sustain over the long term
                (Catton, 1980, Cohen, 1995 and Daly and Farley, 2003).
                In this paper, we call these environment resources
                “Nature”.<br>

                The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a

                includes the mathematical description of HANDY; Section
                4 covers a theoretical analysis of the model equilibrium
                and possible solutions; Section 5 presents examples of
                scenarios within three distinct types of societies;

                The predator–prey model, the original inspiration behind

                century (Lotka, 1925 and Volterra, 1926). This model
                describes the dynamics of competition between two

                Collapses of even advanced civilizations have occurred
                many times in the past five thousand years, and they
                were frequently followed by centuries of population and
                cultural decline and economic regression. Although many
                different causes have been offered to explain individual
                collapses, it is still necessary to develop a more
                general explanation. In this paper we attempt to build a
                simple mathematical model to explore the essential
                dynamics of interaction between population and natural
                resources. It allows for the two features that seem to
                appear across societies that have collapsed: the
                stretching of resources due to strain placed on the
                ecological carrying capacity, and the division of
                society into Elites (rich) and Commoners (poor).<br>
                <br>
                The Human And Nature DYnamical model (HANDY) was
                inspired by the predator and prey model, with the human
                population acting as the predator and nature being the
                prey. When small, Nature grows exponentially with a
                regeneration coefficient γ, but it saturates at a
                maximum value λ. As a result, the maximum regeneration
                of nature takes place at λ / 2, not at the saturation
                level λ. The Commoners produce wealth at a per capita
                depletion rate δ, and the depletion is also proportional
                to the amount of nature available. This production is
                saved as accumulated wealth, which is used by the Elites
                to pay the Commoners a subsistence salary, s, and pay
                themselves κs, where κ is the inequality coefficient.
                The populations of Elites and Commoners grow with a
                birth rate β and die with a death rate α which remains
                at a healthy low level when there is enough accumulated
                food (wealth). However, when the population increases
                and the wealth declines, the death rate increases up to
                a famine level, leading to population decline.<br>
                <br>
                We show how the carrying capacity – the population that
                can be indefinitely supported by a given environment
                (Catton, 1980) – can be defined within HANDY, as the
                population whose total consumption is at a level that
                equals what nature can regenerate. Since the regrowth of
                Nature is maximum when y = λ / 2, we can find the
                optimal level of depletion (production) per capita, δ*
                in an egalitarian society where xE ≡ 0, δ∗∗(≥ δ∗) in an
                equitable society where κ ≡ 1, and δ*** in an unequal
                society where xE ≥ 0 and κ &gt; 1.<br>
                <br>
                In sum, the results of our experiments, discussed in
                Section 6, indicate that either one of the two features
                apparent in historical societal collapses –
                over-exploitation of natural resources and strong
                economic stratification – can independently result in a
                complete collapse. Given economic stratification,
                collapse is very difficult to avoid and requires major
                policy changes, including major reductions in inequality
                and population growth rates. Even in the absence of
                economic stratification, collapse can still occur if
                depletion per capita is too high. However, collapse can
                be avoided and population can reach equilibrium if the
                per capita rate of depletion of nature is reduced to a
                sustainable level, and if resources are distributed in a
                reasonably equitable fashion.<br>
                <br>
                In the upcoming generations of HANDY, we plan to develop
                several extensions including: (1) disaggregation of
                Nature into nonrenewable stocks, regenerating stocks,
                and renewable flows, as well as the introduction of an
                investment mechanism in accessibility of natural
                resources, in order to study the effects of investment
                in technology on resource choice and production
                efficiency; (2) making inequality (κ) endogenous to the
                model structure; (3) introduction of “policies” that can
                modify parameters such as depletion, the coefficient of
                inequality, and the birth rate; and, (4) introduction of
                multiple coupled regions to represent countries with
                different policies, trade of carrying capacity, and
                resource wars.</small></font><b><br>

      <br>
      <br>
      On April 8, 2013, the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences,
      Inc., filed a New Drug Application claiming to be able to cure
      hepatitis C. They received the FDA’s coveted Breakthrough Therapy
      Designation, which is is given to drugs that show significant
      treatment advantages to existing options.<br>
      <br>
      In an incredibly fast review process, the FDA approved Gilead
      Sciences’ Sovaldi for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in
      December of the same year.<br>
      <br>
      The efficacy rate of Sovaldi, when combined with NS5A inhibitors,
      is nothing short of astonishing, sitting between 94% and 97%. This
      rate is far better and far safer than any previous treatments for
      Hep C.<br>
      <br>
      Nearly one year after receiving FDA approval, on October 10, 2014,
      Gilead Sciences Inc. patented Harvoni, which is Solvaldi combined
      with one of these inhibitors.<br>
      <br>
      Global demand for Harvoni quickly skyrocketed as, according to the
      World Health Organization, there are currently 130-150 million
      people living with chronic hepatitis C, globally.<br>
      <br>
      Prior to the availability of this remarkable drug, hepatitis C
      treatments involved 6 to 12-month treatments with an
      interferon-based regimen that provided minimal success rates and
      was associated with severe side effects including anemia,
      depression, severe rash, nausea, diarrhea, and fatigue.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast, Solvadi cures almost everyone in a fraction of the
      time, and mostly without any of the severe side effects.<br>
      <br>
      In the United States, the average cost of treatment for a 12-week
      course is $84,000 – $94,000. Of course, this number sounds
      ridiculous, but what should it cost to cure one’s disease?<br>
      <br>
      The costs associated with studying, testing, and getting new drugs
      approved can be staggering, and the money made from selling the
      new drug is often used to pay for future drugs as well as paying
      back investments made to produce the current ones. Unfortunately,
      the people involved in creating life-saving drugs cannot work for
      free.<br>
      <br>
      But here’s the kicker, according to Médecins du Monde, or Doctors
      of the World, Gilead Sciences Inc. didn’t invent Sovaldi – they
      did.<br>
      <br>
      In February, Doctors of the World filed a patent challenge in
      Europe against Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), arguing that “the molecule
      itself is not sufficiently innovative.”<br>
      <br>
      They are claiming that Gilead merely copied their publicly funded
      research, patented it, and then spiked the price to reap insane
      profits. And reap insane profits, they did. In 2014, Gilead
      reported a total revenue of $24.9 billion as compared to the
      previous year’s $11.2 billion.<br>

      Do you ever feel like you are living in a “Bizarro World”?&nbsp;
      That is how I feel much of the time.&nbsp; I look around and it
      seems as though some form of mass psychosis has descended on most
      of the population.&nbsp; Things that would have had Americans
      angrily marching in the streets a generation or two ago are now
      just accepted as “normal” by the “sheeple” that populate this
      nation.&nbsp; If the talking heads that endlessly spew nonsense at
      us through our televisions tell us to believe something, no matter
      how absurd it is, most people just go along with it.&nbsp; Before
      we had televisions and radios and computers and movies and the
      Internet, people actually had to do the hard work of thinking for
      themselves.&nbsp; But now we are all plugged into this giant
      “matrix” that tells us what to think, what to believe and how to
      feel about things.&nbsp; And unfortunately, the people that are
      telling us what to think and believe are delusional
      themselves.&nbsp; The blind are leading the blind, and as a result
      our nation is coming apart at the seams all around us.<br>
      <br>
      The following are 19 signs that you live in a country that has
      gone completely insane…<br>
      <br>
      #1 When those occupying the highest offices in the land tell you
      that an $18,000,000,000,000 debt is “under control“, you live in a
      country that has gone completely insane.<br>
      <br>
      #2 When your president starts acting like an emperor and begins
      ruling by decree and your elected representatives won’t lift a
      finger to do anything to stop it, you live in a country that has
      gone completely insane.<br>
      <br>
      #3 When the greatest dream in life for millions of your fellow
      citizens is to win the Powerball jackpot, you live in a country
      that has gone completely insane.<br>
      <br>
      #4 When dressing up sex dolls in fashionable clothing and
      photographing them is considered to be art, you live in a country
      that has gone completely insane.<br>
      <br>
      #5 When only 36 percent of the population can name all three
      branches of government, you live in a country that has gone
      completely insane.<br>
      <br>
      #6 When a boy can sue his high school for not letting him use the
      girls’ restrooms and win $75,000 in “damages”, you live in a
      country that has gone completely insane.<br>
      <br>
      #7 When people that want to have sex with their own family members
      start demanding “equal rights”, you live in a country that has
      gone completely insane…<br>

      #8 When pregnancy is considered to be a “disease” and babies are
      considered to be “liabilities”, you live in a country that has
      gone completely insane.<br>
      <br>
      #9 When the federal government collects billions of our phone
      calls and emails and hardly anyone gets upset about it, you live
      in a country that has gone completely insane.<br>
      <br>
      #10 When 30 million of your fellow citizens are taking
      antidepressants, you live in a country that has gone completely
      insane.<br>
      <br>
      #11 When an endless stream of gang members, drug dealers, sexual
      predators, welfare parasites and Middle Eastern terrorists can
      enter the country illegally and nothing is done, but anyone who
      criticizes this is in danger of being put on an “enemies list“,
      you live in a country that has gone completely insane.<br>
      <br>
      #12 When you can get arrested for “encouraging terrorism on
      Twitter“, but not for publicly burning the American flag in the
      middle of the street, you live in a country that has gone
      completely insane.<br>
      <br>
      #13 When your military airdrops huge loads of weapons into the
      hands of the very terrorists that they are supposed to be
      fighting, you live in a country that has gone completely insane.<br>
      <br>
      #14 When there are 2.5 million homeless children living in your
      nation and nobody is calling it a “national emergency”, you live
      in a country that has gone completely insane.<br>
      <br>
      #15 When a fifth-grade student can get suspended from school for
      making an imaginary gun with his fingers, you live in a country
      that has gone completely insane.<br>
      <br>
      #16 When Congress has to pass a law to keep federal workers from
      watching porn all day long, you live in a country that has gone
      completely insane.<br>
      <br>
      #17 When the number of payday lenders is greater than the number
      of Starbucks locations, you live in a country that has gone
      completely insane.<br>
      <br>
      #18 When an illegal immigrant can get a drivers’ license, but the
      head of a fire department of a major U.S. city is suspended from
      his job without pay for promoting sexual morality, you live in a
      country that has gone completely insane.<br>
      <br>
      #19 When the general public knows far more about Kim Kardashian
      than it does about the Federal Reserve, you live in a country that
      has gone completely insane.<br>

      A new filter material may be better at straining contaminants from
      water than the activated carbon in your faucet filter—and may be
      cheaper and easier to clean, to boot. If it can be developed into
      a successful technology, the new material might help remove from
      the water supply small organic molecules such as Bisphenol A
      (BPA), a byproduct of some plastic manufacturing that has been
      linked to environmental damage and health risks.<br>
      <br>
      “This was pretty exciting,” says Susan Richardson, an
      environmental chemist at the&nbsp; University of South Carolina in
      Columbia, who was not involved in the study. “It looks very
      promising. I can’t see a downside yet.”<br>
      <br>
      The new material was cooked up by William Dichtel, an organic
      chemist at Cornell University, and colleagues. It is a
      β-cyclodextrin polymer, meaning it is composed of long strands of
      repeating molecules. The basic molecular unit consists of two main
      pieces: cyclodextrin (shown in blue in the figure below) and a
      six-carbon ring called tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile (red).
      Cyclodextrins are sugar molecules arranged in a ring such that the
      sugar’s hydroxyl groups are perpendicular to the plane of the
      ring. Their binding power has been exploited before, for example,
      to trap smelly molecules in the odor-neutralizing spray known as
      Febreeze. To create the filter material, scientist heated the two
      components in a solution of potassium carbonate and
      tetrahydrofuran to link the two types of molecules together in
      stiff chains and creating a porous 3D lattice.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers then tested the new material and found that it
      blew the doors off of current filter materials. The scientists ran
      a sample of BPA-contaminated water through both the new porous
      cyclodextrins as well as three existing activated carbons and two
      nonporous cyclodextrin polymers. The porous cyclodextrin polymers
      reached 95% of their adsorption capacity in just 10 seconds. The
      other materials took at least 30 minutes to reach their maximum
      adsorption, and the second best performer only adsorbed 53% of its
      capacity in the first 10 seconds, the team reports online today in
      Nature. The results make the β-cyclodextrin the fastest BPA
      remover ever discovered, the researchers claim. The polymer sucked
      up a variety of other small organic molecules faster than current
      materials, as well.<br>
      <br>
      "We knew that [water filtering] would be a likely application if
      we were successful,” Dichtel says. “We were definitely pleasantly
      surprised with just how good the performance is.”<br>
      <br>
      Like carbon-based water filters, the new cyclodextrin polymers owe
      much of their stickiness to a large surface area. The new
      cyclodextrin polymers have an enormous surface area per mass: 250
      m2 per gram, meaning that 2 grams of the stuff contains more than
      enough surface area to completely cover an NBA basketball court.
      However some of the existing activated carbon filters actually
      have even more surface area than the cyclodextrins. The real
      improvement comes from the properties of the material itself,
      Dichtel says. “The difference between our material and activated
      carbons is that the cyclodextrins are actually much better for
      binding pollutants,” he says.<br>
      <br>
      The new material may even be easier to clean than activated
      charcoal. Whereas charcoal filters must be heated to liberate
      contaminant, the polymer can be regenerated simply by washing the
      filter in methanol at room temperature.<br>
      <br>
      To top it off, β-cyclodextrin polymers are also cheap to make—a
      detail that surprised Richardson. The researchers estimate that
      the manufacturing costs may drop as low as $5-$25 per kilogram of
      β-cyclodextrin as chemists continue to refine the polymerization
      process, about half the cost of charcoal filters. “I’m thinking
      this is going to be something like 100 times the cost of activated
      carbon,” Richardson says. “But it’s cheaper, apparently, so go
      figure.”<br>
      <br>
      Dichtel is hopeful that the new material could eventually be
      useful not just in commercial water filters, but industrial ones
      as well, especially in the developing world. The technology could
      also be a boon to wildlife: BPA mimics the hormone estrogen and
      has been wreaking havoc on fish populations for years now, causing
      male fish to become female in some cases. “We’ve got a big problem
      with estrogen of fish in our rivers,” Richardson says. “If this
      works and it’s cheaper than activated carbon, I could see it
      having promise for reducing the impact of the estrogenicity and
      helping our fish recover, too.” <br>

      A few years from now millions of people around the world might be
      walking around with an unusual kind of glass in their mouth, and

      findings about the ability of 'bioactive' glass to help reduce the

      perhaps even provide some of the minerals needed to replace those
      lost to tooth decay.<br>
      <br>
      A few years from now millions of people around the world might be
      walking around with an unusual kind of glass in their mouth, and
      using it every time they eat.<br>
      <br>
      Engineers at Oregon State University have made some promising
      findings about the ability of "bioactive" glass to help reduce the
      ability of bacteria to attack composite tooth fillings -- and
      perhaps even provide some of the minerals needed to replace those
      lost to tooth decay.<br>
      <br>
      Prolonging the life of composite tooth fillings could be an
      important step forward for dental treatment, the researchers say,
      since more than 122 million composite tooth restorations are made
      in the United States every year. An average person uses their
      teeth for more than 600,000 "chews" a year, and some studies
      suggest the average lifetime of a posterior dental composite is
      only six years.<br>
      <br>
      The new research was just published in the journal Dental
      Materials, in work supported by the National Institutes of Health.<br>
      <br>
      "Bioactive glass, which is a type of crushed glass that is able to
      interact with the body, has been used in some types of bone
      healing for decades," said Jamie Kruzic, a professor and expert in
      advanced structural and biomaterials in the OSU College of
      Engineering.<br>
      <br>
      "This type of glass is only beginning to see use in dentistry, and
      our research shows it may be very promising for tooth fillings,"
      he said. "The bacteria in the mouth that help cause cavities don't
      seem to like this type of glass and are less likely to colonize on
      fillings that incorporate it. This could have a significant impact
      on the future of dentistry."<br>
      <br>
      Bioactive glass is made with compounds such as silicon oxide,
      calcium oxide and phosphorus oxide, and looks like powdered glass.
      It's called "bioactive" because the body notices it is there and
      can react to it, as opposed to other biomedical products that are
      inert. Bioactive glass is very hard and stiff, and it can replace
      some of the inert glass fillers that are currently mixed with
      polymers to make modern composite tooth fillings.<br>
      <br>
      "Almost all fillings will eventually fail," Kruzic said. "New
      tooth decay often begins at the interface of a filling and the
      tooth, and is called secondary tooth decay. The tooth is literally
      being eroded and demineralized at that interface."<br>
      <br>
      Bioactive glass may help prolong the life of fillings, researchers
      say, because the new study showed that the depth of bacterial
      penetration into the interface with bioactive glass-containing
      fillings was significantly smaller than for composites lacking the
      glass.<br>
      <br>
      Fillings made with bioactive glass should slow secondary tooth
      decay, and also provide some minerals that could help replace
      those being lost, researchers say. The combination of these two
      forces should result in a tooth filling that works just as well,
      but lasts longer.<br>
      <br>
      Recently extracted human molars were used in this research to
      produce simulated tooth restoration samples for laboratory
      experiments. OSU has developed a laboratory that's one of the
      first in the world to test simulated tooth fillings in conditions
      that mimic the mouth.<br>
      <br>
      If this laboratory result is confirmed by clinical research, it
      should be very easy to incorporate bioactive glass into existing
      formulations for composite tooth fillings, Kruzic said.<br>
      <br>
      The antimicrobial effect of bioactive glass is attributed, in
      part, to the release of ions such as those from calcium and
      phosphate that have a toxic effect on oral bacteria and tend to
      neutralize the local acidic environment.<br>
      <br>
      "My collaborators and I have already shown in previous studies
      that composites containing up to 15 percent bioactive glass, by
      weight, can have mechanical properties comparable, or superior to
      commercial composites now being used," Kruzic said.<br>

      </b><b> Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><b> Objective</b><br>
      <br>
      Bioactive glass (BAG) is known to possess antimicrobial and
      remineralizing properties; however, the use of BAG as a filler for
      resin based composite restorations to slow recurrent caries has
      not been studied. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to
      investigate the effect of adding 15 wt% BAG to a resin composite
      on bacterial biofilms penetrating into marginal gaps of simulated
      tooth fillings in vitro during cyclic mechanical loading.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Human molars were machined into approximately 3 mm thick disks of
      dentin and 1.5–2 mm deep composite restorations were placed. A
      narrow 15–20 micrometer wide dentin-composite gap was allowed to
      form along half of the margin by not applying dental adhesive to
      that region. Two different 72 wt% filled composites were used, one
      with 15 wt% BAG filler (15BAG) and the balance silanated strontium
      glass and one filled with aerosol silica and silanated strontium
      glass without BAG (0BAG—control). Samples of both groups had
      Streptococcus mutans biofilms grown on the surface and were tested
      inside a bioreactor for two weeks while subjected to periods of
      cyclic mechanical loading. After post-test biofilm viability was
      confirmed, each specimen was fixed in glutaraldehyde, gram
      positive stained, mounted in resin and cross-sectioned to reveal
      the gap profile. Depth of biofilm penetration for 0BAG and 15BAG
      was quantified as the fraction of gap depth. The data were
      compared using a Student's t-test.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><br>
      <br>
      The average depth of bacterial penetration into the marginal gap
      for the 15BAG samples was significantly smaller (∼61%) in
      comparison to 0BAG, where 100% penetration was observed for all
      samples with the biofilm penetrating underneath of the restoration
      in some cases.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Significance</b><br>
      <br>
      BAG containing resin dental composites reduce biofilm penetration
      into marginal gaps of simulated tooth restorations. This suggests
      BAG containing composites may have the potential to slow the
      development and propagation of secondary tooth decay at
      restoration margins.<br>

        </big></div>
      <br>
      With the Cuban method of education, UNESCO declared Bolivia as a
      country that is free of illiteracy after the Government of
      President Evo Morales applied the "Yes I Can" method developed by
      Cuba which had already achieved great success in Venezuela and
      elsewhere.<br>
      <br>
      The deputy minister of Alternative Education in Bolivia, Noel
      Aguirre, said on Tuesday (29) that UNESCO has accepted the report
      submitted by the government that shows that the country is free of
      illiteracy. "We can proudly say that the Plurinational State is a
      state free of illiteracy", he stated. According to Aguirre, the
      country has at this time an index of 3.8% illiterate, below the 4%
      that the UN declares that a country needs to have eradicated
      illiteracy.<br>
      <br>
      The minister pointed out that the government's objective is to
      reach the "residual" population, with over 60 years of age. Born
      in Cuba, the method "yo si puedo" (Yes I can) began to be exported
      to other nations from 1999, has been used in the literacy of
      millions of people around the world and was used by the Morales
      government. The method seeks to understand the needs of the
      students and all the peculiarities of the locals using audiovisual
      resources and combinations of numbers and letters.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the method has the advantage of lasting just over three
      months and can be implanted in places with few structures or
      infrastructures. In Brazil, the method is applied by the MST
      (Landless Movement) in several states, and was imported by the
      Lula government in 2010.<br>

      A new material that is both highly transparent and electrically
      conductive could make large screen displays, smart windows and
      even touch screens and solar cells more affordable and efficient,
      according to the Penn State materials scientists and engineers who
      discovered it.<br>
      <br>
      Indium tin oxide, the transparent conductor that is currently used
      for more than 90 percent of the display market, has been the
      dominant material for the past 60 years. However, in the last
      decade, the price of indium has increased dramatically. Displays
      and touchscreen modules have become a main cost driver in
      smartphones and tablets, making up close to 40 percent of the
      cost. While memory chips and processors get cheaper, displays get
      more expensive from generation to generation. Manufacturers have
      searched for a possible ITO replacement, but until now, nothing
      has matched ITO's combination of optical transparency, electrical
      conductivity and ease of fabrication.<br>
      <br>
      A team led by Roman Engel-Herbert, assistant professor of
      materials science and engineering, reports today (Dec 15) online
      in Nature Materials a new design strategy that approaches the
      problem from a different angle. The researchers use thin -- 10
      nanometer -- films of an unusual class of materials called
      correlated metals in which the electrons flow like a liquid. While
      in most conventional metals, such as copper, gold, aluminum or
      silver, electrons flow like a gas, in correlated metals, such as
      strontium vanadate and calcium vanadate, they move like a liquid.
      According to the researchers, this electron flow produces high
      optical transparency along with high metal-like conductivity.<br>
      <br>
      "We are trying to make metals transparent by changing the
      effective mass of their electrons," Engel-Herbert said. "We are
      doing this by choosing materials in which the electrostatic
      interaction between negatively charged electrons is very large
      compared to their kinetic energy. As a result of this strong
      electron correlation effect, electrons 'feel' each other and
      behave like a liquid rather than a gas of non-interacting
      particles. This electron liquid is still highly conductive, but
      when you shine light on it, it becomes less reflective, thus much
      more transparent."<br>
      <br>
      To better understand how they achieved this fine balance between
      transparency and conductivity, Engel-Herbert and his team turned
      to a materials theory expert, Professor Karin Rabe of Rutgers
      University.<br>
      <br>
      "We realized that we needed her help to put a number on how
      'liquid' this electron liquid in strontium vanadate is,"
      Engel-Herbert said.<br>
      <br>
      Rabe helped the Penn State team put together all the theoretical
      and mathematical puzzle pieces they needed to build transparent
      conductors in the form of a correlated metal. Now that they
      understand the essential mechanism behind their discovery, the
      Penn State researchers are confident they will find many other
      correlated metals that behave like strontium vanadate and calcium
      vanadate.<br>
      <br>
      Lei Zhang, lead author on the Nature Materials paper and a
      graduate student in Engel-Herbert's group, was the first to
      recognize what they had discovered.<br>
      <br>
      "I came from Silicon Valley where I worked for two years as an
      engineer before I joined the group," said Zhang. "I was aware that
      there were many companies trying hard to optimize those ITO
      materials and looking for other possible replacements, but they
      had been studied for many decades and there just wasn't much room
      for improvement. When we made the electrical measurements on our
      correlated metals, I knew we had something that looked really good
      compared to standard ITO."<br>
      <br>
      Currently indium costs around $750 per kilogram, whereas strontium
      vanadate and calcium vanadate are made from elements with orders
      of magnitude higher abundance in the earth's crust. Vanadium sells
      for around $25 a kilogram, less than 5 percent of the cost of
      indium, while strontium is even cheaper than vanadium.<br>
      <br>
      "Our correlated metals work really well compared to ITO," said
      Engel-Herbert. "Now, the question is how to implement these new
      materials into a large-scale manufacturing process From what we
      understand right now, there is no reason that strontium vanadate
      could not replace ITO in the same equipment currently used in
      industry."<br>
      <br>
      Along with display technologies, Engel-Herbert and his group are
      excited about combining their new materials with a very promising
      type of solar cell that uses a class of materials called organic
      perovskites. Developed only within the last half dozen years,
      these materials outperform commercial silicon solar cells but
      require an inexpensive transparent conductor. Strontium vanadate,
      also a perovskite, has a compatible structure that makes this an
      interesting possibility for future inexpensive, high-efficiency
      solar cells.<br>
      <br>
      Engel-Herbert and Zhang have applied for a patent on their
      technology.<br>
      <br>
      Along with Zhang and Engel-Herbert, Hai-Tian Zhang, Craig Eaton,
      Yuanxia Zheng and Matthew Brahlek, all students or postdoctoral
      Fellows in Engel-Herbert's group, worked on this paper,
      "Correlated metals as transparent conductors." Others from Penn
      State and the Materials Research Institute on this project were
      Moses Chan, Evan Pugh professor of physics, and his postdoctoral
      Fellow, Weiwei Zhao; and Venkatraman Gopalan, professor of
      materials science and engineering and his student Lu Guo.<br>

      <br>
      Big-data analysis consists of searching for buried patterns that
      have some kind of predictive power. But choosing which “features”
      of the data to analyze usually requires some human intuition. In a
      database containing, say, the beginning and end dates of various
      sales promotions and weekly profits, the crucial data may not be
      the dates themselves but the spans between them, or not the total
      profits but the averages across those spans.<br>
      <br>
      MIT researchers aim to take the human element out of big-data
      analysis, with a new system that not only searches for patterns
      but designs the feature set, too. To test the first prototype of
      their system, they enrolled it in three data science competitions,
      in which it competed against human teams to find predictive
      patterns in unfamiliar data sets. Of the 906 teams participating
      in the three competitions, the researchers’ “Data Science Machine”
      finished ahead of 615.<br>
      <br>
      In two of the three competitions, the predictions made by the Data
      Science Machine were 94 percent and 96 percent as accurate as the
      winning submissions. In the third, the figure was a more modest 87
      percent. But where the teams of humans typically labored over
      their prediction algorithms for months, the Data Science Machine
      took somewhere between two and 12 hours to produce each of its
      entries.<br>
      <br>
      “We view the Data Science Machine as a natural complement to human
      intelligence,” says Max Kanter, whose MIT master’s thesis in
      computer science is the basis of the Data Science Machine.
      “There’s so much data out there to be analyzed. And right now it’s
      just sitting there not doing anything. So maybe we can come up
      with a solution that will at least get us started on it, at least
      get us moving.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Between the lines</b><br>
      <br>
      Kanter and his thesis advisor, Kalyan Veeramachaneni, a research
      scientist at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence
      Laboratory (CSAIL), describe the Data Science Machine in a paper
      that Kanter will present next week at the IEEE International
      Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics.<br>
      <br>
      Veeramachaneni co-leads the Anyscale Learning for All group at
      CSAIL, which applies machine-learning techniques to practical
      problems in big-data analysis, such as determining the
      power-generation capacity of wind-farm sites or predicting which
      students are at risk for dropping out of online courses.<br>
      <br>
      “What we observed from our experience solving a number of data
      science problems for industry is that one of the very critical
      steps is called feature engineering,” Veeramachaneni says. “The
      first thing you have to do is identify what variables to extract
      from the database or compose, and for that, you have to come up
      with a lot of ideas.”<br>
      <br>
      In predicting dropout, for instance, two crucial indicators proved
      to be how long before a deadline a student begins working on a
      problem set and how much time the student spends on the course
      website relative to his or her classmates. MIT’s online-learning
      platform MITx doesn’t record either of those statistics, but it
      does collect data from which they can be inferred.<br>

      Kanter and Veeramachaneni use a couple of tricks to manufacture
      candidate features for data analyses. One is to exploit structural
      relationships inherent in database design. Databases typically
      store different types of data in different tables, indicating the
      correlations between them using numerical identifiers. The Data
      Science Machine tracks these correlations, using them as a cue to
      feature construction.<br>
      <br>
      For instance, one table might list retail items and their costs;
      another might list items included in individual customers’
      purchases. The Data Science Machine would begin by importing costs
      from the first table into the second. Then, taking its cue from
      the association of several different items in the second table
      with the same purchase number, it would execute a suite of
      operations to generate candidate features: total cost per order,
      average cost per order, minimum cost per order, and so on. As
      numerical identifiers proliferate across tables, the Data Science
      Machine layers operations on top of each other, finding minima of
      averages, averages of sums, and so on.<br>
      <br>
      It also looks for so-called categorical data, which appear to be
      restricted to a limited range of values, such as days of the week
      or brand names. It then generates further feature candidates by
      dividing up existing features across categories.<br>
      <br>
      Once it’s produced an array of candidates, it reduces their number
      by identifying those whose values seem to be correlated. Then it
      starts testing its reduced set of features on sample data,
      recombining them in different ways to optimize the accuracy of the
      predictions they yield.<br>
      <br>
      “The Data Science Machine is one of those unbelievable projects
      where applying cutting-edge research to solve practical problems
      opens an entirely new way of looking at the problem,” says Margo
      Seltzer, a professor of computer science at Harvard University who
      was not involved in the work. “I think what they’ve done is going
      to become the standard quickly — very quickly.”<br>

            exceptionally strong and lightweight new metal</big></b><big><br>
          <b> </b></big><br>
        <b> </b><i>Magnesium infused with dense silicon carbide
          nanoparticles could be used for airplanes, cars, mobile
          electronics and more</i><br>
      </div>
      <i> </i><br>
      A team led by researchers from the UCLA Henry Samueli School of
      Engineering and Applied Science has created a super-strong yet
      light structural metal with extremely high specific strength and
      modulus, or stiffness-to-weight ratio. The new metal is composed
      of magnesium infused with a dense and even dispersal of ceramic
      silicon carbide nanoparticles. It could be used to make lighter
      airplanes, spacecraft, and cars, helping to improve fuel
      efficiency, as well as in mobile electronics and biomedical
      devices.<br>
      <br>
      To create the super-strong but lightweight metal, the team found a
      new way to disperse and stabilize nanoparticles in molten metals.
      They also developed a scalable manufacturing method that could
      pave the way for more high-performance lightweight metals. The
      research was published today in Nature.<br>
      <br>
      "It's been proposed that nanoparticles could really enhance the
      strength of metals without damaging their plasticity, especially
      light metals like magnesium, but no groups have been able to
      disperse ceramic nanoparticles in molten metals until now," said
      Xiaochun Li, the principal investigator on the research and
      Raytheon Chair in Manufacturing Engineering at UCLA. "With an
      infusion of physics and materials processing, our method paves a
      new way to enhance the performance of many different kinds of
      metals by evenly infusing dense nanoparticles to enhance the
      performance of metals to meet energy and sustainability challenges
      in today's society."<br>
      <br>
      Structural metals are load-bearing metals; they are used in
      buildings and vehicles. Magnesium, at just two-thirds the density
      of aluminum, is the lightest structural metal. Silicon carbide is
      an ultra-hard ceramic commonly used in industrial cutting blades.
      The researchers' technique of infusing a large number of silicon
      carbide particles smaller than 100 nanometers into magnesium added
      significant strength, stiffness, plasticity and durability under
      high temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers' new silicon carbide-infused magnesium
      demonstrated record levels of specific strength -- how much weight
      a material can withstand before breaking -- and specific modulus
      -- the material's stiffness-to-weight ratio. It also showed
      superior stability at high temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      Ceramic particles have long been considered as a potential way to
      make metals stronger. However, with microscale ceramic particles,
      the infusion process results in a loss of plasticity.<br>
      <br>
      Nanoscale particles, by contrast, can enhance strength while
      maintaining or even improving metals' plasticity. But nanoscale
      ceramic particles tend to clump together rather than dispersing
      evenly, due to the tendency of small particles to attract one
      other.<br>
      <br>
      To counteract this issue, researchers dispersed the particles into
      a molten magnesium zinc alloy. The newly discovered nanoparticle
      dispersion relies on the kinetic energy in the particles'
      movement. This stabilizes the particles' dispersion and prevents
      clumping.<br>
      <br>
      To further enhance the new metal's strength, the researchers used
      a technique called high-pressure torsion to compress it.<br>
      <br>
      "The results we obtained so far are just scratching the surface of
      the hidden treasure for a new class of metals with revolutionary
      properties and functionalities," Li said.<br>
      <br>
      The new metal (more accurately called a metal nanocomposite) is
      about 14 percent silicon carbide nanoparticles and 86 percent
      magnesium. The researchers noted that magnesium is an abundant
      resource and that scaling up its use would not cause environmental
      damage.<br>

      Magnesium is a light metal, with a density two-thirds that of
      aluminium, is abundant on Earth and is biocompatible; it thus has
      the potential to improve energy efficiency and system performance
      in aerospace, automobile, defence, mobile electronics and
      biomedical applications1, 2, 3, 4, 5. However, conventional
      synthesis and processing methods (alloying and thermomechanical
      processing) have reached certain limits in further improving the
      properties of magnesium and other metals6. Ceramic particles have
      been introduced into metal matrices to improve the strength of the
      metals7, but unfortunately, ceramic microparticles severely
      degrade the plasticity and machinability of metals7, and
      nanoparticles, although they have the potential to improve
      strength while maintaining or even improving the plasticity of
      metals8, 9, are difficult to disperse uniformly in metal
      matrices10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Here we show that a dense uniform
      dispersion of silicon carbide nanoparticles (14 per cent by
      volume) in magnesium can be achieved through a nanoparticle
      self-stabilization mechanism in molten metal. An enhancement of
      strength, stiffness, plasticity and high-temperature stability is
      simultaneously achieved, delivering a higher specific yield
      strength and higher specific modulus than almost all structural
      metals.<br>

      The matrices are produced with the help of a laser beam reflected
      from the object which is supposed to provide the matrix. In the
      vicinity of the laser a radio-receiver is installed, which
      captures the radio-waves in the necessary frequency range with

      <br>
      A quantum scanner is being used in the research studies conducted
      in the area of wave genetics and creating the sound matrices. Itsí
      principle of functioning is based on the registration of plasma
      leaps of different polarization in the laser radiator, as it
      interacts with the external mirror, reflecting the ray back into
      the radiator. The ray partially passes through the external mirror
      and arrives at the scanned object. This influences the parameters
      of plasma leaps. These are being registered with the help of
      photodiodes, which sense two types of polarization: the vertical
      and horizontal ones. The signal from the photodiodes modulates the
      spectrum of radio-waves radiated by the laserís power supply unit.
      As a result of this, the radio-waves containing information about
      the quantum state of the scanned object are being emitted into the
      space. With the help of a radio-receiver it is possible to
      register these radio-waves and convert them into the sound
      spectrum. In this spectrum the information about plasma leaps of
      different polarization, occurring during the scanning of the
      object, will be present.<b><br>

      The Qmatrices are produced with the help of a laser beam reflected
      from the object which is supposed to provide the matrix. In the
      vicinity of the laser a radio-receiver is installed, which
      captures the radio-waves in the necessary frequency range with
      subsequent recording to computer as a sound file.<br>

      For these applications only one type of laser is suitable – the
      LGN-303.<br>
      In order to create Dr. Gariaev’s matrix, an adjustment bench is
      being installed at a distance of 11 cm from the laser, upon which
      a photograph is placed, or a drop of blood, or some other
      substance, for instance a medicine. The beam is reflected back
      from that substance and returns to the laser. Near the laser there
      is a radio-receiver in the AM frequency band, which receives the
      radio-waves from the laser at about 600 kHz. From the
      radio-receiver the signal is directed to the sound card of the
      computer, where it is being recorded by any sound editor. For
      example, Gold Wave can be used.<br>

      There is an increasing number of people who believe that NASA's

      they are allegedly sending back from Mars are taken in remote
      areas of our planet.<br>

      <br>
      First of all, evidence suggests that the pictures that we see on
      NASA's website are not even taken by the Curiosity and Opportunity
      rovers.<br>
      <br>
      It is very possible that by now, both rovers are stored in a
      hangar, somewhere at NASA's JPL headquarters, and have been
      replaced by their smaller and more practical baby brothers.<br>
      <br>
      Sure, if needed, they can always be taken out for a spin, but
      other than that, the smaller rovers are more convenient to work
      with.<br>

      <br>
      One of the most mysterious and enigmatic monuments on the surface
      of the planet is without a doubt the Great Sphinx at the Giza
      plateau in Egypt. It is an ancient construction that has baffled
      researchers ever since its discovery and until today, no one has
      been able to accurately date the Sphinx, since there are no
      written records or mentions in the past about it. Now, two
      Ukrainian researchers have proposed a new provocative theory where
      the two scientists propose that the Great Sphinx of Egypt is
      around 800,000 years old. A Revolutionary theory that is backed up
      by science.<br>
      <br>
      The study was presented at the International Conference of
      Geoarchaeology and Archaeomineralogy held in Sofia titled:
      GEOLOGICAL ASPECT OF THE PROBLEM OF DATING THE GREAT EGYPTIAN
      SPHINX CONSTRUCTION.<br>
      <br>
      The authors of this paper are scientists Manichev Vjacheslav I.
      (Institute of Environmental Geochemistry of the National Academy
      of Sciences of Ukraine) and Alexander G. Parkhomenko (Institute of
      Geography of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine).<br>
      <br>
      The starting point of these two experts is the paradigm shift
      initiated by West and Schoch, a ‘debate’ intended to overcome the
      orthodox view of Egyptology referring to the possible remote
      origins of the Egyptian civilization and, on the other, physical
      evidence of water erosion present at the monuments of the Giza
      Plateau.<br>
      <br>
      According to Manichev and Parkhomenko:<br>
      <br>
      “The problem of dating the Great Egyptian Sphinx construction is
      still valid, despite of the long-term history of its research.
      Geological approach in connection to other scientific-natural
      methods permits to answer the question about the relative age of
      the Sphinx. The conducted visual investigation of the Sphinx
      allowed the conclusion about the important role of water from
      large water bodies which partially flooded the monument with
      formation of wave-cut hollows on its vertical walls.”<br>
      <br>
      “The morphology of these formations has an analogy with similar
      such hollows formed by the sea in the coastal zones. Genetic
      resemblance of the compared erosion forms and the geological
      structure and petrographic composition of sedimentary rock
      complexes lead to a conclusion that the decisive factor of
      destruction of the historic monument is the wave energy rather
      than sand abrasion in Eolian process. Voluminous geological
      literature confirms the fact of existence of long-living
      fresh-water lakes in various periods of the Quaternary from the
      Lower Pleistocene to the Holocene. These lakes were distributed in
      the territories adjacent to the Nile. The absolute mark of the
      upper large erosion hollow of the Sphinx corresponds to the level
      of water surface which took place in the Early Pleistocene. The
      Great Egyptian Sphinx had already stood on the Giza Plateau by
      that geological (historical) time.” <br>
      <br>
      “In our geological field expeditions in different mountains and
      littoral zones of the Crimea and Caucasus we could often observe
      the forms of Eolian weathering which morphology differs
      considerably from the weathering taking place on the GES. Most
      natural forms of weathering are of smoothed character, independent
      of lithological composition of the rocks...<br>
      <br>
      “Our personal experience in scientific investigation of geology of
      the sea coasts gives reasons to draw an analogy with the GES and
      to suggest another mechanism of its destruction.
      Specialists-geologists, who work in the field of sea-coast
      geomorphology, know such forms of relief as wave-cut hollows
      (Morskaya Geomorfologiya, 1980). They can be one- and
      multi-storey. They are arranged horizontally to the sea water
      surface, if the coast makes a vertical wall (cliff). Especially
      deep wave-cut hollows are formed in precipitous cliffs built by
      the strata of carbonaceous rocks. Such forms of the coast relief
      are well-known and studied in detail on the Black-Sea coast of the
      Caucasus and Crimea (Popov, 1953; Zenkovich, 1960). General model
      of formation of the wave-cut hollows in the rocks of the Caucasian
      flysch is given by Popov (1953, 162; Fig. 3). In dynamics of the
      process of wave-cut hollows formation one can notice such a
      characteristic feature that the wave energy is directed to the
      rock stratum at the level of water surface. Besides, both saline
      and fresh water can dissolve the rocks...”<br>

      Studying house dust mites, two University of Michigan biologists
      say they have discovered evidence that contracts Dollo’s law – a
      long standing scientific belief claiming evolution is
      irreversible.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists at the University of Michigan announced the discovery
      Friday, saying their research reveals the common house dust mite
      has undergone “reverse” evolution, changing from a parasitic life
      form to a free-living one. The study shows the familiar house dust
      mite evolved over millions of years from free-living organisms
      into parasites before evolving back into free-living organisms.<br>
      <br>
      The theory of an organism reverting to the characteristics of its
      ancestors is known as Dollo’s law. The hypothesis, posed by
      Belgian paleontologist Louis Dollo, states that “an organism is
      unable to return, even partially, to a previous stage already
      realized in the ranks of its ancestors.” Although evolutionary
      biologists have disagreed about how the rule is applied in nature,
      they have been in general agreement on the general principle that
      the evolutionary process is irreversible.<br>
      <br>
      “All our analyses conclusively demonstrated that house dust mites
      have abandoned a parasitic lifestyle, secondarily becoming
      free-living, and then speciated in several habitats, including
      human habitations,” according to Pavel Klimov and Barry O’Connor
      of the University of Michigan Department of Ecology and
      Evolutionary Biology…<br>

      Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Bearden, US Army, PhD calls for the
      scientific community to act.<br>
      <br>
      "To the sincere person who remains skeptical, consider this:
      Absolute proof is not needed before serious research begins on the
      subject. In no other field of human endeavor is proof required
      before serious study and research begins; on the contrary, proof
      is the result of this research. In this regard, the subject of
      extraterrestrial studies is being held to an irrational
      requirement of proof before serious research can begin, on the one
      hand, and denounced as an area of spurious interest because no
      proof exists, on the other!"<br>
      -Steven M. Greer, MD<br>
      <br>
      RECOMMENDED SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY ACTIONS<br>
      As observations of the UFO phenomena reported by many thousands of
      witnesses are validated, a new set of scientific paradigms will
      need to be researched to explain what is being observed.<br>
      <br>
      Twentieth century scientific theories have barely touched the
      surface in explaining what numerous scientific, military and
      civilian witnesses have observed and reported. However, in some
      cases, covert military research programs appear to have advanced
      much further in understanding the observed phenomena and than have
      our academic and public scientists. Recent findings, such as the
      demonstration of possible faster than speed of light phenomenon,
      suggest that indeed there will be a whole new class of scientific
      phenomena that 21st century scientists will investigate to explain
      what has been declared as “impossible” by scientists of the last
      century.<br>
      <br>
      There is still a major acceptance problem about UFO/ET issues with
      most scientists.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Peter Sturrock, a highly respected solar physicist and now an
      emeritus professor at Stanford University, summarized the problem
      as follows: The definite resolution of the UFO enigma will not
      come about unless and until the problem is subjected to open and
      extensive scientific study by the normal procedures of established
      science. This requires a change in attitude primarily on the part
      of scientists and administrators in universities.<br>
      <br>
      A further view by Dr. Sturrock on the role of scientists and
      scientific journals is quoted in section 3.2.1. Surprising though
      it may seem to the lay person, scientists often have trouble
      changing their understanding of processes and natural phenomena
      when faced with evidence that their theories may not be correct.<br>
      <br>
      The history of science is replete with examples of scientists
      proclaiming such and such is impossible, only to be shown later
      that their assumptions were incorrect... [see full article here:
      http://www.siriusdisclosure.com/summa... ]<br>
      <br>
      Over the last century, scientists have played both an active and
      passive role, often unknowingly, in shaping the attitudes of the
      “trusting” public on the UFO issue through promulgation of
      misinformation and disinformation.<br>
      <br>
      In summary, without investigation and research, there can be no
      intelligent informed statement on the phenomena. This need was
      also recommended by a panel of scientists in the
      Sturrock/Rockefeller report and by scientists and military
      personnel in the French COMETA report summarized in section 8.0.<br>
      <br>
      We recommend SCIENTISTS take the following actions:<br>
      <br>
      1. Scientists must open their minds to the possibility of the
      UFO/ET phenomenon and stop prejudging others who are researching
      this area. This will require each to do their own “research” into
      the matter;<br>
      <br>
      2. Scientists who know the UFO/ET issues are real (such as those
      who participate in covert research projects) should share the
      reality and their understanding with scientific colleagues to
      start to bring them up to speed. There will be a lot of catching
      up to do and it will be difficult because of reputations and
      funding issues;<br>
      <br>
      3. Academic scientists should share this knowledge with their
      students and the public, for it is the next generation of students
      and graduate students that will help make the breakthroughs in
      research to explain what has been observed for several
      generations;<br>
      <br>
      4. It is critical that scientists help make the study of UFO/ET
      issues a supported and encouraged area of scientific investigation
      for these future graduate students and young professional
      scientists;<br>
      <br>
      5. Scientist/managers who run our federally funded academic
      research programs should set aside a small percentage of their
      budgets for “outside-the-box” research into the UFO/ET arena,
      helping to make it a legitimate area of research.<br>
      <br>
      6. Finally, scientists should realize that advances in science and
      technology that could come from an understanding of the UFO/ET
      phenomenon will have far ranging effects on the future of the
      people and the environment of our planet. The opportunities for
      new “breakthrough” research have never been better (as well as the
      opportunity to rewrite many textbooks).<br>

      A recently discovered set of original Nikola Tesla drawings reveal
      a map to multiplication that contains all numbers in a simple to
      use system. The drawings were discovered at an antique shop in
      central Phoenix Arizona by local artist, Abe Zucca. They are
      believed to have been created during the last years of Tesla’s
      Free Energy lab, Wardenclyffe. The manuscript is thought to
      contain many solutions to unanswered questions about mathematics.<br>
      <br>
      The Sketches were hidden in a small trunk with numerous other
      drawings and manuscripts ranging from hand-held technological
      devices to free-energy systems, many with notes scrawled all over
      them. Some of the pieces are already familiar to the public, but a
      few others are not. Most notably is the Map to Multiplication or
      the Math Spiral. Zucca made a few copies and showed the drawings
      around to different thinkers, dreamers, and mathematicians.<br>
      <br>
      A few days later a Local High School Mathematics Instructor, Joey
      Grether, had been working on deciphering the system and had a few
      breakthroughs. Grether suggests that the Spiral not only explores
      Multiplication as an interwoven web, but that it, “offers a
      comprehensive visual understanding of how all numbers are
      self-organized into 12 positions of compositability.”<br>
      <br>
      “This device allows us to see numbers as patterns, the formation
      of prime numbers, twin primes, Highly composite numbers,
      multiplication and division, as well as few other systems, I
      imagine, that are yet to be discovered.”<br>
      <br>
      The diagram itself is very intuitive, allowing students to see how
      numbers all work together based on a spiral with 12 positions. 12,
      or 12x (multiples of 12) is the most highly composite system,
      which is why we have 12 months in a year, 12 inches in a foot, 24
      hours in a day, etc. 12 can be divided by 2, 3, 4, and 6. So can
      all multiples of 12. For every 12 numbers there is a chance of 4
      numbers being prime. They happen to fall in positions (think clock
      positions) 5, 7, 11, and 1.<br>
      <br>
      Tesla is known for the quote “If you only knew the magnificence of
      the 3, 6 and 9, then you would have the key to the universe.” It
      turns out that when the device is examined, the digital roots of
      the numbers in positions 3, 6, 9, and 12 constantly repeat the
      same sequence 3, 6, 9! Is this what Tesla was referring too? The
      self-organization of numbers and their digital roots?<br>
      <br>
      Its hard to say, but Grether seems to think so. “This breakthrough
      is phenomenal. If we could get students all over the globe to use
      this technique, to play with it, and help figure out how to use
      it, we could overcome our cultural aversion to Mathematics.
      Instead of memorizing the multiplication table, we could learn the
      positions of numbers and have a better understanding of how they
      work.”<br>
      <br>
      Juan Zapata, One of Mr. G’s students believes so as well… “I used
      to say I’m bad at Math… cause thats what everyone says, but now,
      I’m like, dude, this is too easy.”<br>
      <br>
      Theres one other fact about the Tesla Spiral that make it
      interesting. The diagram is dated 12/12/12! 1912. Grether and his
      students want to turn December 12 into a national holiday. So grab
      a 12 pack, get a dozen donuts, and celebrate the power of 12x.<br>

      <br>
      ...It seems that this channeler, who has become VERY renown for
      channeling Bashar (supposedly a benevolent, super-evolved
      extraterrestrial intelligence) is being fed these so-called
      'transmissions' by a white male HUMAN voice that is relaying the
      information to him in realtime. These are most evident at the
      following timestamps, although it is happening throughout the
      entirety of the responses. Again, you will need to run it through
      VLC player to hear. And you will need headphones:<br>
      <br>
      0:54 - this is insanely blatant. You can hear that after he says
      "after we translate the phrase" the channeler momentarily stops as
      you can hear a voice in the background say "isolated, limited
      terrorist..." to which the channeler follows suit right away.<br>
      <br>
      1:06 - after the channeler finishes saying "America", the voice in
      the background goes on saying "primarily.." to which the channeler
      follows suit.<br>
      <br>
      1:17 - At the exact moment which the person finishes asking the
      question "do you know when it is likely to occur?" you can
      immediately hear the white male voice in the background speak
      first even before Bashar speaks. This is very important since it
      is a case of the background voice speaking first before the
      channeler begins speaking at all, which is the clearest (and
      first) case of this happening in the video. Effectively
      eliminating the possibility of any audio de-synchronization, which
      was already completely absurd to begin with since the questioner
      has no such effect over his voice and the background voice is
      clearly nothing like the channeler's...<br>
      <br>
      1:25 - THIS IS THE CLEAREST, MOST UNDENIABLE EVIDENCE IN THIS
      ENTIRE VIDEO.<br>
      After the channeler finishes saying "2001", the white male voice
      in the background goes on to very clearly say, "MOST LIKELY, in or
      around" HOWEVER, the channeler does not say this right away,
      instead he says "MOST LIKELY, either" (he probably says "either"
      because he did not clearly hear what the other male voice said,
      signalling for a repeat, or he was biding for more time just in
      case the message he was receiving from the background voice would
      be a little lengthy so he'd have time to relay it clearly) and
      THEN after a repeat by the background voice saying "in or around"
      a second time, the channeler continues with "in or around". This
      undeniably proves that there are two different people involved in
      this transmission and that Bashar is not an extraterrestrial
      channeler but a complete deceiver and government pawn. I have just
      proved this for certain.<br>

      The entire wealth of the planet is estimated to be around $65-7o
      trillion dollars. Any debt that exceeds that amount should be
      considered to be a catalyst for global economic collapse and
      ultimately World War III&nbsp; along with the emergence of extreme
      authoritarian government similar to what the world witnessed prior
      to World War II.<br>
      <br>
      Nations who are trying to save themselves from the abyss of
      economic collapse will seek to plunder the resources of other
      nations and when these predatory behaviors grow in number, global
      conflict will breakout. We are already seeing evidence of this in
      Ukraine (i.e. control of Eurasia’s gas) and in&nbsp; Syria and
      Iran (i.e. control of the medium of exchange to buy oil, gold vs.
      the dollar).<br>
      <br>
      In 2011, Bloomberg reported that Bank of America shifted about $22
      trillion worth of derivative obligations from Merrill Lynch and
      the Bank of America Corporation holding company to the FDIC
      insured retail deposit division. Along with this information came
      the revelation that the FDIC insured unit was already stuffed with
      $53 trillion worth of these potentially toxic obligations, making
      a total of $75 trillion dollars in debt from the toxic holdings of
      only one bank. In other words, the United States taxpayer owes
      Bank of America $75 trillion dollars when, not if, the credit swap
      derivatives market collapses. REMEMBER: ANY DEBT THAT EXCEEDS $70
      TRILLION DOLLARS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED TO BE THE CATALYST FOR A
      GLOBAL ECONOMIC COLLAPSE. <br>
      <br>
      Although this event was prominently reported in Bloomberg, it was
      not reported on Fox and CNN and the other corporate news entities.
      Further, the implications of this nation-busting act were never
      explained to the American people. So, the ignorant American people
      continue to entrust their life savings to entities who are
      planning to steal these assets.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Implications</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Derivatives are highly flammable financial instruments that are
      used to insure the banks against risk. The main purpose of a
      derivative lies in the fact that they are used for speculation
      (i.e. gambling). The derivatives market comprises the modern day
      version of the big gaming casino on Wall Street!<br>
      <br>
      Credit swap derivatives are bets made upon the future value of
      stocks, bonds, mortgages, other loans, currencies, commodities,
      volatility of financial indexes, and even weather changes. It is a
      case of the Las Vegas Strip coming to Wall Street. The banksters
      are playing with house money. Only in this case, the house money
      is the good faith and credit of the American taxpayer.<br>

      And it is not just Bank of America that is stealing your money to
      cover their derivatives debt. All of the “too big to fail” banks
      (e.g. JP Morgan, Wells Fargo) have had their gambling addiction
      guaranteed by the American people. This was supposed to be a
      secret that would be kept from the American people in order to
      keep America from rioting and stringing up every banker that they
      could get their hands on. So,why isn’t that you have not heard
      about this before (an estimated 95% of the readers are probably
      ignorant of this fact)? Well, the fact remains that there have
      been cracks in the conspiracy and there have been people telling
      all of us about this very fact. Breitbart told you about this fact
      last year. Politifact came to the party late, but even they
      reported this fact late last year. Ellen Brown wrote about this
      development last year. Forbes covered this development in 2013.
      The Common Sense Show covered this event many times in 2011-12 on
      several broadcasts. On November 16, 2014, I covered the fact that
      the G20 nations passed a joint resolution to get their nation’s
      central banking system to declare that your bank account was not
      defined as money. This was done because the G20 central banks are
      approaching insolvency. This put your assets at the bottom of the
      list for FDIC compensation in the event of a bank failure. In
      other words, your money is as good as gone. <br>
      <br>
      Even if Wall Street was to net out the worth of the derivatives
      involved, the amount is so large that the United States could not
      hope to pay it off. Why? Because the debt is estimated to be at
      $1.5 quadrillion dollar debt without a major dollar devaluation,
      if another collapse were to actually occur and a large part of the
      derivatives were triggered, the U.S. government cannot cover the
      obligation. Rest assured that the banks would be made whole.
      However, the same cannot be said for the American taxpayer. The
      Federal Reserve has not only given their blessing, they approved
      the transfer of the derivatives from Merrill Lynch to insured
      retail unit of BAC before the deal was even done. Why would the
      Federal Reserve participate in the economic suicide of our
      country? Because these sacred cow banks are owned by prominent
      members of the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve members
      are intent on financial survival at the expense of the people.<br>
      <br>
      Solely based upon the condition of the megabanks, it is a foregone
      conclusion that these bank customers are going to lose their
      assets. Since the U.S. only takes in $2 trillion dollars per year,
      where is the money going to come from to cover the derivatives
      debt? The interest on the derivatives debt is exploding faster
      than we can pay the interest on it, $505 trillion per year . This
      one set of circumstances is enough, on its own, to collapse the
      U.S. economy. This could be the straw that breaks the camel’s
      back. However, we have a lot of straws sitting upon the backs of
      the American camel.<br>

      <br>
      I wish all questions had answers this simple. Soon-to-be broke
      bankers start wars which will kill millions/billions in order to
      preserve their financial standing. Broke citizens start civil

      a genocidal system of global feudalism under the New World Order.<br>
      <br>
      Is there anything that can be done? Not without divine
      intervention. The debt could be repudiated but that would still
      trigger World War III. About the one thing you can do to is store
      up on God’s teachings, guns, gold, food and form trusted
      alliances.<br>

      A new type of "quasiparticle" theorized by Caltech's Gil Refael, a
      professor of theoretical physics and condensed matter theory,
      could help improve the efficiency of a wide range of photonic
      devices—technologies, such as optical amplifiers, solar
      photovoltaic cells, and even barcode scanners, which create,
      manipulate, or detect light.<br>

      Electrons traveling through the semiconductors used in modern
      computers lose energy via heat because of resistance. This is not
      the case with light signals, but there can be other causes of
      signal loss in light transmission, such as unwanted reflection and
      scattering of photons, or light particles. Refael says that a type
      of quasiparticle called the "topolariton" could reduce such signal
      degradation and enhance the stability of the photons as they move
      along the edges of semiconductors. He described topolaritons and
      their properties in a paper published in the July 2015 issue of
      the journal Physical Review X.<br>
      <br>
      Refael's work at Caltech concentrates on quantum aspects of
      matter, including quantum entanglement (in which quantum particles
      share behaviors regardless of distance), quantum computing, and
      the emergence and control of new quantum states.<br>
      <br>
      Quasiparticles such as the topolariton are entities that exhibit
      some, but not all, of the characteristics of elementary particles
      like the electrons and quarks that make up atoms. They are
      classified as emergent phenomena—those that arise from the
      dynamical behavior of a system—and they exist only inside solid
      materials. Some examples of quasiparticles include phonons
      ("packets" of atoms or molecules vibrating collectively), solitons
      (solitary wave packets or pulses that retain their shape while
      moving at a constant velocity), and excitons (formed when an
      electron binds with an electron hole, or the void left when an
      electron departs a valence orbital). The interaction of photons
      with excitons can form another quasiparticle called the polariton.<br>
      <br>
      During a workshop at the National Science Foundation
      (NSF)-sponsored Institute for Quantum Information (now the
      Institute for Quantum Information and Matter) in 2010, Refael and
      two colleagues came up with the idea for the topolariton, a type
      of polariton with the ability to flow in one direction along the
      edges of semiconducting quantum wells embedded in optical
      cavities. The quantum well and the cavity confine electrons and
      photons to motion within a single plane. "We suggested that you
      could take a simple semiconductor and a regular quantum well, and
      give rise to a special excitation, which is a hybrid of a photon
      and an electron-hole pair," that is, of a polariton. "Shining
      light at the frequency can kick an electron out of the balance and
      initiate a polariton that travels exclusively on the edge of the
      system. The light–matter interaction, in this case, produces
      so-called topological quantum states that are not there in each of
      the components."<br>
      <br>
      Because topolaritons are part matter and part light, they could be
      guided and controlled with reflectors or with photonic
      band-gaps—regions in the optical medium through which photons
      cannot travel. Furthermore, the direction of a topolariton's
      motion could be reversed by the application of a magnetic field.
      "This would be like a one-way filter for light, providing a
      directional communication with minimum losses of energy," he says.<br>
      <br>
      Photonic devices are currently in widespread use, and are expected
      to eventually replace traditional semiconductors in many
      applications. They are more efficient and accurate, work better
      over long distances, and save energy. They are also less prone to
      interference from outside influences such as electromagnetic
      fields. Exploiting toploaritons into such devices should lead to
      further improvements in their performance.<br>
      <br>
      Evolving from theory to practical applications, however, may be a
      rather long process, Refael admits. "We'll need to create some new
      interfaces between the photonic world and the electronic world,"
      he says. "One challenge is making one-way photon wave-guides for
      visible light. The topolaritons provide a route to such devices
      using standard semi-conductor technology, and can also act as an
      intermediary between photonic and electron-based devices—a
      necessary step for any optoelectronic device."<br>

      Condensed-matter physicists often turn to particle-like entities
      called quasiparticles—such as excitons, plasmons, magnons—to
      explain complex phenomena. Now Gil Refael from the California
      Institute of Technology in Pasadena and colleagues report the
      theoretical concept of the topological polarition, or
      “topolariton”: a hybrid half-light, half-matter quasiparticle that
      has special topological properties and might be used in devices to
      transport light in one direction.<br>
      <br>
      The proposed topolaritons arise from the strong coupling of a
      photon and an exciton, a bound state of an electron and a hole.
      Their topology can be thought of as knots in their gapped
      energy-band structure. At the edge of the systems in which
      topolaritons emerge, these knots unwind and allow the topolaritons
      to propagate in a single direction without back-reflection. In
      other words, the topolaritons cannot make U-turns. Back-reflection
      is a known source of detrimental feedback and loss in photonic
      devices. The topolaritons’ immunity to it may thus be exploited to
      build devices with increased performance.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers describe a scheme to generate topolaritons that
      may be feasible to implement in common systems—such as
      semiconductor structures or atomically thin layers of compounds
      known as transition-metal dichalcogenides—embedded in photonic
      waveguides or microcavities. Previous approaches to make similar
      one-way photonic channels have mostly hinged on effects that are
      only applicable at microwave frequencies. Refael and co-workers’
      proposal offers an avenue to make such “one-way photonic roads” in
      the optical regime, which despite progress has remained a
      challenging pursuit.<br>

      Molecular nitrogen plays a role in the assembly of prebiotic
      molecules, and it protects humans from the Sun’s extreme
      ultraviolet radiation. Researchers investigate, for the first
      time, the ultrafast molecular dynamics of nitrogen as it
      disassociates.<br>
      <br>
      Studying the interaction of molecular nitrogen with extreme
      ultraviolet (XUV) radiation is of prime importance to understand
      radiation-induced processes occurring in Earth’s upper atmosphere.
      In particular, photoinduced dissociation dynamics involving
      excited states of N2+ leads to N and N+ atomic species that are
      relevant in atmospheric photochemical processes. However, tracking
      the relaxation dynamics of highly excited states of N2+ is
      difficult to achieve, and its theoretical modeling is notoriously
      complex. Here, we report on an experimental and theoretical
      investigation of the dissociation dynamics of N2+ induced by
      isolated attosecond XUV pulses in combination with
      few-optical-cycle near-infrared/visible (NIR/VIS) pulses. The
      momentum distribution of the produced N+ fragments is measured as
      a function of pump-probe delay with subfemtosecond resolution
      using a velocity map imaging spectrometer. The time-dependent
      measurements reveal the presence of NIR/VIS-induced transitions
      between N2+ states together with an interference pattern that
      carries the signature of the potential energy curves activated by
      the XUV pulse. We show that the subfemtosecond characterization of
      the interference pattern is essential for a semiquantitative
      determination of the repulsive part of these curves.<br>

            Symmetry: A Tensor Network Approach</big></b><br>

      Time-reversal symmetry is fundamental to condensed matter physics,
      and now researchers show how time reversal can be applied locally,
      using a tensor network representation, and how time-reversal
      twists can be used to detect topological order.<br>
      <br>
      It is well known that unitary symmetries can be “gauged,” i.e.,
      defined to act in a local way, which leads to a corresponding
      gauge field. Gauging, for example, the charge-conservation
      symmetry leads to electromagnetic gauge fields. It is an open
      question whether an analogous process is possible for time
      reversal which is an antiunitary symmetry. Here, we discuss a
      route to gauging time-reversal symmetry that applies to gapped
      quantum ground states that admit a tensor network representation.
      The tensor network representation of quantum states provides a
      notion of locality for the wave function coefficient and hence a
      notion of locality for the action of complex conjugation in
      antiunitary symmetries. Based on that, we show how time reversal
      can be applied locally and also describe time-reversal symmetry
      twists that act as gauge fluxes through nontrivial loops in the
      system. As with unitary symmetries, gauging time reversal provides
      useful access to the physical properties of the system. We show
      how topological invariants of certain time-reversal symmetric
      topological phases in D=1, 2 are readily extracted using these
      ideas.<br>

      Majorana particles, which are their own antiparticles and whose
      recent detection in solid-state systems remains controversial, are
      expected to play an important role in future quantum computing.
      Now, scientists predict that graphene may host Majorana particles.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      A clear demonstration of topological superconductivity (TS) and
      Majorana zero modes remains one of the major pending goals in the
      field of topological materials. One common strategy to generate TS
      is through the coupling of an s-wave superconductor to a helical
      half-metallic system. Numerous proposals for the latter have been
      put forward in the literature, most of them based on
      semiconductors or topological insulators with strong spin-orbit
      coupling. Here, we demonstrate an alternative approach for the
      creation of TS in graphene-superconductor junctions without the
      need for spin-orbit coupling. Our prediction stems from the
      helicity of graphene’s zero-Landau-level edge states in the
      presence of interactions and from the possibility, experimentally
      demonstrated, of tuning their magnetic properties with in-plane
      magnetic fields. We show how canted antiferromagnetic ordering in
      the graphene bulk close to neutrality induces TS along the
      junction and gives rise to isolated, topologically protected
      Majorana bound states at either end. We also discuss possible
      strategies to detect their presence in graphene Josephson
      junctions through Fraunhofer pattern anomalies and Andreev
      spectroscopy. The latter, in particular, exhibits strong
      unambiguous signatures of the presence of the Majorana states in
      the form of universal zero-bias anomalies. Remarkable progress has
      recently been reported in the fabrication of the proposed type of
      junctions, which offers a promising outlook for Majorana physics
      in graphene systems.<br>

      </b><b> Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Magnetically doped topological insulators, possessing an energy
      gap created at the Dirac point through time-reversal-symmetry
      breaking, are predicted to exhibit exotic phenomena including the
      quantized anomalous Hall effect and a dissipationless transport,
      which facilitate the development of low-power-consumption devices
      using electron spins. Although several candidates of magnetically
      doped topological insulators were demonstrated to show long-range
      magnetic order, the realization of the quantized anomalous Hall
      effect is so far restricted to the Cr-doped (Sb,Bi)2Te3 system at
      extremely low temperature; however, the microscopic origin of its
      ferromagnetism is poorly understood. Here we present an
      element-resolved study for Cr-doped (Sb,Bi)2Te3 using X-ray
      magnetic circular dichroism to unambiguously show that the
      long-range magnetic order is mediated by the p-hole carriers of
      the host lattice, and the interaction between the Sb(Te) p and Cr
      d states is crucial. Our results are important for material
      engineering in realizing the quantized anomalous Hall effect at
      higher temperatures.<br>

      attempt to prolong life. Gradually, they changed their objective
      into trying to find a way to make humans immortal. Due to their
      continuous experiments on living things, their plans backfired and
      had instead created a dangerous virus, dubbed the Rex Virus. This
      caused humans to turn into the undead, the zombies. The zombies
      managed to escape from the lab, during Chaos chapter, and started
      infecting the others. This was also the place where Jennifer was

      </b><b> Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      The extremely high melting point of many ceramics adds challenges
      to additive manufacturing as compared with metals and polymers.
      Because ceramics cannot be cast or machined easily,
      three-dimensional (3D) printing enables a big leap in geometrical
      flexibility. We report preceramic monomers that are cured with
      ultraviolet light in a stereolithography 3D printer or through a
      patterned mask, forming 3D polymer structures that can have
      complex shape and cellular architecture. These polymer structures
      can be pyrolyzed to a ceramic with uniform shrinkage and virtually
      no porosity. Silicon oxycarbide microlattice and honeycomb
      cellular materials fabricated with this approach exhibit higher
      strength than ceramic foams of similar density. Additive
      manufacturing of such materials is of interest for propulsion
      components, thermal protection systems, porous burners,
      microelectromechanical systems, and electronic device packaging.<br>

      ABSTRACT: Enhancement of tomato seed germination is one of the
      most important factors for developing a supply chain of increased
      demand. Tomato is one of the important cash crops in the world. To
      fulfill increased requirement, electric field adoption is the best
      alternative. The study was undertaken at MPKV, Rahuri for
      improvement in tomato seed germination. Three different approaches
      were utilized as electrostatic field, microwave and corona
      discharge method to treat tomato seeds. The comparative analysis
      revealed that adoption of electrostatic field application was
      simple as well as powerful method with significantly positive
      results. In electrostatic field, the optimal dosage was 2 kV/mm
      for 20 second interval to improve germination, root shoot length
      and seed vigor.<br>

      …Five Danish schoolgirls proved what apparently no one in the
      microwave industry wanted to. Wi-Fi radiation causes adverse
      effects to any life forms, which, in their experiment, were garden
      cress seeds. The young ladies placed the seeds near two Wi-Fi
      routers, waited and took photographs for twelve days. The
      results—failure of seeds to germinate—can be seen in the above
      photographs.<br>
      <br>
      So, what does that experiment portend for humans? That similar
      effect(s) can occur from cell towers too. Two researchers, “Drs.
      Cammaerts and Johansson conducted a partial replication of the
      original Danish student study using cell towers instead of WiFi
      routers as the source of wireless radiation. They found that cress
      seeds located 200 meters from two cell towers failed to
      germinate.” [1] What did they conclude from their findings?
      “Wireless technology may effectively and seriously impact nature
      and should urgently be used much more cautiously.”…<br>

      Oysters and chocolate maybe considered aphrodisiacs, but their
      stimulating powers pale into insignificance when compared to a
      mysterious mushroom found in Hawaii.<br>
      <br>
      An as yet unnamed species of bright orange mushroom that grows on
      volcanic slopes has long been rumoured to possess potent
      properties.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers have discovered the 'fetid odour' of the fungus can
      trigger spontaneous climaxes in females.<br>
      <br>
      The mushrooms were discovered growing on lava deposits dating back
      600 and 10,000 years.<br>
      <br>
      It is thought they belong to the genus Dictyophora, a family of
      mushrooms that bear distinctive net-like heads.<br>
      <br>
      In a brief study, published in the International Journal of
      Medicinal Mushrooms in 2001, John Holliday of Next Laboratories in
      Kula, Hawaii and Noah Soule of Aloha Medicinals tested the
      mushroom's aphrodisiac effect.<br>
      <br>
      In a small experiment involving 16 women and 20 men, volunteers
      were asked to sniff the mushroom, which is said to have a 'fetid
      odour'.<br>
      <br>
      Its smell triggered spontaneous orgasms in six of the women, while
      the other 10, who received smaller doses, experienced an increase
      in heart rate, Snopes.com reported. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      The study explained: 'There are significant sexual arousal
      characteristics present in the fetid odour of this unique
      mushroom.<br>
      <br>
      'These results suggest that the hormone like compounds present in
      the volatile portion of the spore mass may have some similarity to
      human neurotransmitters during sexual encounters.'<br>
      <br>
      However, commentators have noted that it was just one study and
      more work is needed to confirm the fungi's seemingly spectacular
      powers. <br>
      <br>
      Interestingly Dictyophora mushrooms - also known as 'veiled
      ladies' - grow length so quickly that they can 'bloom' in just 45
      minutes. <br>
      <br>
      It is thought that the mushrooms produce the potent smells in
      order to reproduce.<br>
      <br>
      Another mushroom from the same family, named Dictyophora
      indusiata, emits an unpleasant smell similar to faeces.<br>
      <br>
      This specific branch of the fungus family has long been considered
      to possess special powers.<br>
      <br>
      They were ingested during ancient Mexican divinatory ceremonies
      and in New Guinea the mushroom is considered sacred because of its
      suggestive form.<br>
      <br>
      In Nigeria, the mushroom is one of several stinkhorns given the
      name 'Akufodewa' by the Yoruba people. <br>

      The name is formed from a combination of the Yoruba words: ku
      ('die'), fun ('for'), ode ('hunter'), and wa ('search').<br>
      <br>
      It refers to how the mushroom's stench can attract hunters who
      mistake its odour for that of a dead animal.<br>

      In Chinese medicine the fungi has been used to treat many
      inflammatory, gastric, and neural diseases.<br>

      <div align="center"><b> <big>Here’s what blind prophet Baba Vanga
            predicted for 2016 and beyond: It’s not good</big></b><br>
        <b> </b><br>

      <br>
      A BLIND mystic who reportedly foretold 9/11, the 2004 Boxing Day
      tsunami, the Fukushima nuclear spill and the birth of ISIS also
      made dire predictions for 2016 and beyond.<br>
      <br>
      Bulgaria-born Prophetess Baba Vanga, who died in 1996 aged 85, was
      known as “Nostradamus from the Balkans” thanks to a purported 85
      per cent success rate and has long been revered in Russia and
      Europe as a kind of supernatural saint.<br>
      <br>
      Of the hundreds of predictions Vanga made over her 50-year career
      as a celebrated clairvoyant, a large number alluded to natural and
      climate change-related disasters. She warned of melting polar ice
      caps and rising sea temperatures back in the 1950s, decades before
      anyone had heard of global warming.<br>
      <br>
      Her followers believe her vivid description of a “huge wave” that
      would descend on a “big coast, covering people and towns and
      (causing) everything to disappear under the water” was a reference
      to the 2004 tsunami and earthquake which claimed hundreds of
      thousands of lives across the Pacific Rim.<br>
      <br>
      But it’s Vanga’s preoccupation with a “great Muslim war” that has
      sent believers, conspiracy theorists and Islamophobics into a
      doomsday frenzy in recent months as the world struggles to contain
      the escalating threat from Islamic State and its affiliates.<br>
      <br>
      The chilling prophecies warn of a 2016 invasion of Europe by
      Muslim extremists, a conflict she predicted would begin with the
      Arab Spring in 2010, play out in Syria where “Muslims would use
      chemical warfare against Europeans”, and culminate in the
      establishment of a caliphate by 2043 with Rome at its epicentre.<br>
      <br>
      According to Vanga, Europe as we know it will “cease to exist” by
      the end of next year following the systematic elimination of
      entire populations, leaving the continent “almost empty”, a
      “wasteland almost entirely devoid of any form of life”.<br>
      <br>
      If that sounds dramatic, consider the developments of the past
      year, which has seen ISIS edge perilously close to Europe with the
      taking of Sirte, a key Libyan city overlooking the Mediterranean
      and the birthplace of the late dictator Gaddafi.<br>
      <br>
      Sirte is now an Islamic State colony operating under Sharia Law.
      The new regime reportedly cemented its authority by staging a
      series of public executions, during which an unknown number of
      people were crucified and beheaded.<br>
      <br>
      And ISIS continues to gain ground in Syria, despite a massive
      bombing campaign by allied forces in the wake of the Paris
      attacks. To devotees and others consumed by fear of an impending
      apocalypse, it’s as if Vanga’s deadly prophecies are unfolding
      before their very eyes.<br>
      <br>
      There’s no shortage of images like these on the internet,
      particularly on Russian websites<br>
      <br>
      <b>FROM ‘ILLITERATE’ VILLAGE GIRL TO APOCALYPTIC ANGEL</b><br>
      <br>
      Baba Vanga was born Vangelia Pandeva Dimitrova in Strumica, a
      village located at the foot of a volcanic mountain range in what
      was then the Ottoman Empire.<br>
      <br>
      According to folklore, she led an ordinary life up until the age
      of 12, when she mysteriously lost her eyesight during a massive
      storm — described by some as a freak tornado. According to
      folklore, the youngster was flung into the air and then dashed to
      the ground by a powerful gust of wind.<br>
      <br>
      What happened next is murky but her family reportedly found her in
      a terrible state several days later, her injured eyes sealed shut
      and encrusted with a thick layer of dust and dirt. Too poor to
      afford specialist care, she was relegated to a life of blindness.<br>
      <br>
      Vanga later stated that she had experienced her first vision
      during the days she was missing and believed she had been
      instilled with the ability to heal people and predict the future.
      She was able to convince others of her paranormal powers and
      quickly developed a cult following. She became the go-to psychic
      for the rich and powerful and admirers, among them heads of state,
      scientists and historians, would come from all over the world for
      a few minutes in her company.<br>
      <br>
      She later served as an adviser to Bulgarian Communist Party
      leaders, some of whom allegedly exploited her gift to further
      their own agendas. She was reportedly kept under surveillance by
      the country’s secret service and her home, the scene of countless
      meetings with visiting foreign politician and businessmen,
      reported bugged.<br>
      <br>
      <b>THE MOST FAMOUS BABA VANGA PROPHECIES TO ‘COME TRUE’</b><br>
      <br>
      Predicted in the 1950s: Global warming and the 2004 Tsunami.<br>
      <br>
      “Cold regions will become warm … and volcanoes will awaken. A huge
      wave will cover a big coast covered with people and towns, and
      everything will disappear beneath the water.”<br>
      <br>
      “Everything will melt, just like ice.”<br>
      <br>
      Predicted in 1989: The September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on New
      York’s Twin Towers.<br>
      <br>
      “Horror, horror! The American brethren (believed to be a reference
      to the two ‘brother’ towers) will fall after being attacked by the
      steel birds (thought to be the two hijacked passenger planes).
      “The wolves will be howling in a bush (believed to be a reference
      to then US president George Bush) and innocent blood will gush.”<br>
      <br>
      Predicted in 1980: The sinking of Russian nuclear submarine the
      Kursk in 2000.<br>
      <br>
      It saw the crew die horrible deaths over several days while
      international rescue crews tried in vain to retrieve the vessel
      from the depths of the ocean. Until the tragedy, people assumed
      the “Kursk” Vanga referred to was the Russian city the Kursk was
      named for.<br>
      <br>
      “At the turn of the century, in August of 1999 or 2000, Kursk will
      be covered with water, and the whole world will be weeping over
      it.”<br>
      <br>
      The election of Barack Obama.<br>
      <br>
      Vanga reportedly correctly predicted that the 44th president of
      the United States would be African American. However, she also
      stated that he would be the “last US president”. We’ll have to
      wait and see how that pans out.<br>
      <br>
      Vanga’s prophecies mention the emergence of a Muslim group in
      Syria in 2013 which will wage chemical warfare on Europe. Many
      believe this is a reference to ISIS, which also came on the scene
      in 2013<br>

      driving out populations and leaving the entire continent “almost
      empty”.<br>
      <br>
      2023: The Earth’s orbit will change (nobody really knows what this

      2084: Nature is reborn (nobody is really sure what this means).<br>
      <br>
      2100: Man-made sun illuminates the dark side of the planet (This
      is already in the pipeline — since 2008, scientists have been
      working on creating an artificial sun using nuclear fusion
      technology).<br>
      <br>

      Fact: This planet has not harbored humans at 3.3 C or higher above
      baseline (i.e., the beginning of the industrial revolution). The
      number may be much lower. The jury is still out.<br>
      <br>
      Fact: Humans are animals that depend on myriad other species for
      survival. As with all other animals, humans require clean air,
      potable water, healthy food, and the ability to maintain body
      temperature to sustain themselves.<br>
      <br>
      Fact: Humans will die without a living planet that continuously
      supplies the elements listed above.<br>
      <br>
      Fact: So far, all humans born into the physical realm have died.
      There is no rational basis for expecting any human to avoid this
      fate.<br>
      <br>
      Fact: The Sixth Mass Extinction is under way.<br>
      <br>
      Fact: All species have gone extinct or will go extinct. There is
      no rational basis for expecting Homo sapiens to avoid this fate.<br>
      <br>
      Earth is officially at 0.85 C above baseline. The actual,
      unofficial global-average temperature is at least 0.1 C higher
      than the official figure. The ongoing El Niño will take Earth well
      beyond 1 C, the 1990 Rubicon from the United Nations Advisory
      Group on Greenhouse Gases. As David Spratt points out in this
      video from October 2014, 0.5 C is was a more reasonable target.
      But those days are long behind us.<br>
      <br>
      The rate of evolution via natural selection trails the rate of
      climate change by a factor of 10,000, according to a paper in the
      August 2013 issue of Ecology Letters. Clever as we are, we will
      not evade the Sixth Mass Extinction in the absence of myriad
      non-human organisms to supply the necessities of human life.<br>
      <br>
      “Dramatic emission reductions (35%–80%) in anthropogenic aerosols
      and their precursors projected by Representative Concentration
      Pathway (RCP) 4.5 result in ~1 °C of additional warming,”
      according to an analysis published in the 20 May 2013 issue of
      Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres. Instead of taking
      the cherry-picking, conservative approach assumed by academic
      scientists and the International Panel on Climate Change’s RCP,
      I’ll use the upper end of the conservative projection: Reducing
      industrial activity by 35% results in ~1 C global-average
      temperature rise, and eliminating global industrial activity
      results in an attendant ~3 C global-average temperature rise.<br>
      <br>
      In other words, the absence of solar dimming associated with
      reflective particles could cause an abrupt rise in global-average
      temperature beyond that which has supported the existence of
      humans in the past (about 4 C, the number at which this headline
      from 2008 in The Guardian conservatively concludes human
      extinction: “On a planet 4C hotter, all we can prepare for is
      extinction”). A large majority of the rise in temperature will
      come much more rapidly than the initial 0.85 C. Assuming the
      least-conservative end of the very conservative spectrum offered
      by the journal literature and the International Panel on Climate
      Change takes Earth well beyond the temperature at which human life
      has been harbored on this planet. Earth only gets hotter from
      there.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, nobody knows the global-average temperature at
      which humans will become extinct. We’ve not yet completed this
      trial. By the time we complete the trial, there will be nobody
      left to record it. The lesson will come after the exam.<br>
      <br>
      The industrial economies of the world are inextricably linked. If
      Europe goes down the tubes because the derivatives bubble pops on
      that continent, then there will be consequences throughout the
      world. There’s a reason the Federal Reserve System of the United
      States gives money directly to foreign countries.<br>
      <br>
      The rapid rise in global-average temperature I’ve described in
      this scenario occurs within days after collapse is complete. Sans
      methane and its exponential rise in Earth’s atmosphere. Sans
      10-year “lag” in maximum heating from atmospheric carbon dioxide.
      Sans nuclear facilities melting down catastrophically.<br>
      <br>
      I’m not suggesting all humans will die within days after the
      ongoing collapse of industrial civilization is complete. Rather,
      that process is likely to require months, or perhaps a few years.
      But it’s difficult for me to envision Earth with humans in 2030,
      notwithstanding the IPCC’s fantasy technology.<br>
      <br>
      Contrary to conventional “wisdom,” we cannot sustain this
      unsustainable set of living arrangements indefinitely. Industrial
      civilization will end. Those of you believing somebody has the
      system under control are deluded. Nobody is in charge of the
      system, despite the goals of the deep state. The system teeters on
      the brink, even according to the International Monetary Fund and
      The Guardian (and see David Stockman’s overview from 22 December
      2015 and this summary from 23 December 2015). With respect to the
      lifeblood of civilization, crude oil, and its home base: “Saudi
      Arabia is starting to come apart, and when its unscheduled rapid
      disassembly is a little farther along, the Industrial Age will
      come to an end.”<br>
      <br>
      Ergo, nobody is responsible for industrial civilization, much less
      in charge of it. Only you are responsible for yourself.<br>
      <br>
      Shortly after civilization reaches its overdue end, habitat for
      humans will disappear. Between now then, every year will be worse
      than the one before, except for the few who benefit from
      oppression abroad, obedience at home, and destruction of the
      living planet. Obedience at home is exemplified by thoughtless
      people still on their hamster wheels.<br>
      <br>
      Preppers take heart: Bunkers of beans will see you through a few
      years if you avoid fires, floods, superstorms, bitter cold,
      infectious diseases, and numerous other hazards. After that, it’s
      microbes and bacteria for ten million years or so, assuming humans
      become the first animals to persist beyond seven generations
      despite lethal mutations associated with bathing in ionizing
      radiation.<br>
      <br>
      Everybody take heart: We get to live. It’s quite an amazing deal.
      Let’s get on with it.<br>

      Given by a gorilla in sign language, it is among the more unusual
      messages for the New Year.<br>
      <br>
      Koko was filmed delivering a 38-word bulletin about how ‘stupid’
      mankind is harming the Earth.<br>
      <br>
      In the 60-second video, the 44-year-old great ape, which has been
      learning sign language since she was one, said: ‘I am gorilla, I
      am flowers, animals. I am Nature. Koko love man. Earth Koko love.
      <br>
      <br>
      ‘But man stupid… stupid! Koko sorry, Koko cry. Time hurry. Fix
      Earth! Help Earth! Hurry! Protect Earth. Nature watches you. Thank
      you.’<br>
      <br>
      The message was scripted by NOE Conservation, based in France,
      whose main focus is preserving biodiversity, and The Gorilla
      Foundation in Woodside, California, where Koko has lived since
      1979, immersed in human company.<br>

      I’d like to speak today about what political correctness is, at
      least in its modern version, what it is not, and what we might do
      to fight against it.<br>
      <br>
      To begin, we need to understand that political correctness is not
      about being nice. It’s not simply a social issue, or a subset of
      the culture wars.<br>
      <br>
      It’s not about politeness, or inclusiveness, or good manners. It’s
      not about being respectful toward your fellow humans, and it’s not
      about being sensitive or caring or avoiding hurt feelings and
      unpleasant slurs.<br>
      <br>
      But you’ve heard this argument, I’m sure. PC is about simple
      respect and inclusiveness, they tell us. As though we need
      progressives, the cultural enforcers, to help us understand that
      we shouldn’t call someone retarded, or use the “N” word, make
      hurtful comments about someone’s appearance, or tolerate bullies.<br>
      <br>
      If PC truly was about kindness and respect, it wouldn’t need to be
      imposed on us. After all, we already have a mechanism for the
      social cohesion PC is said to represent: it’s called manners. And
      we already have specific individuals charged with insuring that
      good manners are instilled and upheld: they’re called parents.<br>
      Political Correctness Defined<br>
      <br>
      But what exactly is PC? Let me take a stab at defining it:
      Political correctness is the conscious, designed manipulation of
      language intended to change the way people speak, write, think,
      feel, and act, in furtherance of an agenda.<br>
      <br>
      PC is best understood as propaganda, which is how I suggest we
      approach it. But unlike propaganda, which historically has been
      used by governments to win favor for a particular campaign or
      effort, PC is all-encompassing. It seeks nothing less than to mold
      us into modern versions of Marx’s un-alienated society man, freed
      of all his bourgeois pretensions and humdrum social conventions.<br>
      <br>
      Like all propaganda, PC fundamentally is a lie. It is about
      refusing to deal with the underlying nature of reality, in fact
      attempting to alter that reality by legislative and social fiat. A
      is no longer A.<br>
      <br>
      To quote Hans-Hermann Hoppe:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [T]he masters … stipulate that aggression,
      invasion, murder and war are actually self-defense, whereas
      self-defense is aggression, invasion, murder and war. Freedom is
      coercion, and coercion is freedom. … Taxes are voluntary payments,
      and voluntarily paid prices are exploitative taxes. In a PC world,
      metaphysics is diverted and rerouted. Truth becomes malleable, to
      serve a bigger purpose determined by our superiors.<br>
      <br>
      But where did all this come from? Surely PC, in all its various
      forms, is nothing new under the sun. I think we can safely assume
      that feudal chiefs, kings, emperors, and politicians have ever and
      always attempted to control the language, thoughts, and thus the
      actions of their subjects. Thought police have always existed.<br>
      <br>
      To understand the origins of political correctness, we might look
      to the aforementioned Marx, and later the Frankfurt school. We
      might consider the work of Leo Strauss for its impact on the
      war-hungry think tank world. We might study the deceptive
      sloganeering of Saul Alinsky. We might mention the French
      philosopher Foucault, who used the term “political correctness” in
      the 1960s as a criticism of unscientific dogma.<br>
      <br>
      But if you really want to understand the black art of PC
      propaganda, let me suggest reading one of its foremost
      practitioners, Edward Bernays.<br>
      <br>
      Bernays was a remarkable man, someone who literally wrote the book
      on propaganda and its softer guise of public relations. He is
      little discussed in the West today, despite being the godfather of
      modern spin.<br>
      <br>
      He was the nephew of Sigmund Freud, and like Mises was born in
      Austria in the late nineteenth century. Unlike Mises, however, he
      fortuitously came to New York City as an infant and then proceeded
      to live an astonishing 103 years.<br>
      <br>
      One of his first jobs was as a press agent for President Woodrow
      Wilson’s Committee on Public Information, an agency designed to
      gin up popular support for US entry into WW1 (German Americans and
      Irish Americans especially were opposed). It was Bernays who
      coined the infamous phrase “Make the World Safe for Democracy”
      used by the committee.<br>
      <br>
      After the war, he asked himself whether one could “apply a similar
      technique to the problems of peace.” And by “problems,” Bernays
      meant selling stuff. He directed very successful campaigns
      promoting Ivory Soap, for bacon and eggs as a healthy breakfast,
      and ballet. He directed several very successful advertising
      campaigns, most notably for Lucky Strike in its efforts to make
      smoking socially acceptable for women.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Role of “Herd Psychology”</b><br>
      <br>
      Bernays was quite open and even proud of engaging in the
      “manufacturing of consent,” a term used by British surgeon and
      psychologist Wilfred Trotter in his seminal Instincts of the Herd
      in Peace and War published in 1919.<br>
      <br>
      Bernays took the concept of herd psychology to heart. The herd
      instinct entails the deep seated psychological need to win
      approval of one’s social group. The herd overwhelms any other
      influence; as social humans, our need to fit in is paramount.<br>
      <br>
      But however ingrained, in Bernays’s view the herd instinct cannot
      be trusted. The herd is irrational and dangerous, and must be
      steered by wiser men in a thousand imperceptible ways — and this
      is key. They must not know they are being steered.<br>
      <br>
      The techniques Bernays employed are still very much being used to
      shape political correctness today.<br>
      <br>
      First, he understood how all-powerful the herd mind and herd
      instinct really is. We are not the special snowflakes we imagine,
      according to Bernays. Instead we are timorous and malleable
      creatures who desperately want to fit in and win acceptance of the
      group.<br>
      <br>
      Second, he understood the critical importance of using third party
      authorities to promote causes or products. Celebrities, athletes,
      models, politicians, and wealthy elites are the people from whom
      the herd takes its cues, whether they’re endorsing transgender
      awareness or selling luxury cars. So when George Clooney or Kim
      Kardashian endorses Hillary Clinton, it resonates with the herd.<br>
      <br>
      Third, he understood the role that emotions play in our tastes and
      preferences. It’s not a particular candidate or cigarette or a
      watch or a handbag we really want, it’s the emotional component of
      the ad that affects us, however subconsciously.<br>
      <br>
      <b>What We Can Do About It</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      So the question we might ask ourselves is this: how do we fight
      back against PC? What can we do, as individuals with finite
      amounts of time and resources, with serious obligations to our
      families, loved ones, and careers, to reverse the growing tide of
      darkness?<br>
      <br>
      First, we must understand that we’re in a fight. PC represents a
      war for our very hearts, minds, and souls. The other side
      understands this, and so should you. The fight is taking place on
      multiple fronts: the state-linguistic complex operates not only
      within government, but also academia, media, the business world,
      churches and synagogues, nonprofits, and NGOs. So understand the
      forces aligned against you.<br>
      <br>
      Understand that the PC enforcers are not asking you, they’re not
      debating you, and they don’t care about your vote. They don’t care
      whether they can win at the ballot box, or whether they use
      extralegal means. There are millions of progressives in the US who
      absolutely would criminalize speech that does not comport with
      their sense of social justice.<br>
      <br>
      One poll suggests 51 percent of Democrats and 1/3 of all Americans
      would do just that.<br>
      <br>
      The other side is fighting deliberately and tactically. So realize
      you’re in a fight, and fight back. Culturally, this really is a
      matter of life and death.<br>
      <br>
      <b>We Still Have Freedom to Act</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      As bad as PC contamination may be at this point, we are not like
      Mises, fleeing a few days ahead of the Nazis. We have tremendous
      resources at our disposal in a digital age. We can still
      communicate globally and create communities of outspoken, anti-PC
      voices. We can still read and share anti-state books and articles.
      We can still read real history and the great un-PC literary
      classics. We can still homeschool our kids. We can still hold
      events like this one today.<br>
      <br>
      This is not to say that bucking PC can’t hurt you: the possible
      loss of one’s job, reputation, friends, and even family is very
      serious. But defeatism is never called for, and it makes us
      unworthy of our ancestors.<br>
      <br>
      Use humor to ridicule PC. PC is absurd, and most people sense it.
      And its practitioners suffer from a comical lack of self-awareness
      and irony. Use every tool at your disposal to mock, ridicule, and
      expose PC for what it is.<br>
      <br>
      Never forget that society can change very rapidly in the wake of
      certain precipitating events. We certainly all hope that no great
      calamity strikes America, in the form of an economic collapse, a
      currency collapse, an inability to provide entitlements and
      welfare, energy shortages, food and water shortages, natural
      disasters, or civil unrest. But we can’t discount the possibility
      of these things happening.<br>
      <br>
      And if they do, I suggest that PC language and PC thinking will be
      the first ornament of the state to go. Only rich, modern,
      societies can afford the luxury of a mindset that does not comport
      with reality, and that mindset will be swiftly swept aside as the
      “rich” part of America frays.<br>
      <br>
      Men and women might start to rediscover that they need and
      complement each other if the welfare state breaks down. Endless
      hours spent on social media might give way to rebuilding social
      connections that really matter when the chips are down.<br>
      <br>
      More traditional family structures might suddenly seem less
      oppressive in the face of great economic uncertainty. Schools and
      universities might rediscover the value of teaching practical
      skills, instead of whitewashed history and grievance studies.
      One’s sexual preferences might not loom as large in the scheme of
      things, certainly not as a source of rights. The rule of law might
      become something more than an abstraction to be discarded in order
      to further social justice and deny privilege.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Play the Long Game</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      I’m afraid it might not be popular to say so, but we have to be
      prepared for a long and hard campaign. Let’s leave the empty
      promises of quick fixes to the politicians. Progressives play the
      long game masterfully. They’ve taken 100 years to ransack our
      institutions inch by inch. I’m not suggesting incrementalism to
      reclaim those foregone institutions, which are by all account too
      far gone — but to create our own.<br>
      <br>
      PC enforcers seek to divide and atomize us, by class, race, sex,
      and sexuality. So let’s take them up on it. Let’s bypass the
      institutions controlled by them in favor of our own. Who says we
      can’t create our own schools, our own churches, our own media, our
      own literature, and our own civic and social organizations?
      Starting from scratch certainly is less daunting than fighting PC
      on its own turf.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusion</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      PC is a virus that puts us — liberty loving people — on our heels.
      When we allow progressives to frame the debate and control the
      narrative, we lose power over our lives. If we don’t address what
      the state and its agents are doing to control us, we might
      honestly wonder how much longer organizations like the Mises
      Institute are going to be free to hold events like this one today.<br>
      <br>
      Is it really that unimaginable that you might wake up one day and
      find sites with anti-state and anti-egalitarian content blocked —
      sites like mises.org and lewrockwell.com?<br>
      <br>
      Or that social media outlets like Facebook might simply eliminate
      opinions not deemed acceptable in the new America?<br>
      <br>
      In fact, head Facebook creep Mark Zuckerberg recently was
      overheard at a UN summit telling Angela Merkel that he would get
      to work on suppressing Facebook comments by Germans who have the
      audacity to object to the government’s handling of migrants.<br>
      <br>
      Here’s the Facebook statement:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are committed to working closely with the
      German government on this important issue. We think the best
      solutions to dealing with people who make racist and xenophobic
      comments can be found when service providers, government, and
      civil society all work together to address this common challenge.<br>
      <br>
      Chilling, isn’t it? And coming soon to a server near you, unless
      we all get busy.<br>
