      <br>
      As for YOU -- reading this exquisitely poignant emotional

      caca-poopless about the evile pornocracy ruling through your
      pathetic praetorial predations. <br>
      <br>

      Welcome to the Internet's own Shangri-Lala Land of Realistic
      Civilization, never to be conflated with the fraudulent simulacrum
      we suffer today ) !<br>
      <br>
      Although today this database appears to be a wackypedia of
      sci-tech factoids and theorisms, mayhap in due time it will
      precipitate complete , void from akasha as the all-new Wonderworld
      of Now !<br>
      <br>
      But in all sinfull probability you will not survive to see it's
      tautology, because it's too late ! The Universe ended Tomorrow,
      and you died again of your own tawdry turpitude !<br>
      <br>
      You could have done something about it decades ago, and pray you
      even did, when there was sufficient lead time in which to
      implement the manifest destination desired of these alternate
      realities, in an effective manner ( per aetherio-ad-domino ). But
      Nooooo ! Rather, you reverse-mortgaged your invaluable timeline
      for a no-money-down 20-year bankruptcy with a 100% balloon
      catherer due on demand, mildly interesting perhaps, until -- You
      chose, and affirmed to empower the corporate cluster-copulating
      daisychain dry-hump Lie ! <br>

      But -- the butt of the Joke is upon thee ! For You will never see
      your 401K $$s ! You will never retire ! You will never even
      dumpster-dive in your senior years, because mobs of your starving
      juvenile brat spawn will have cleaned them out already !<br>
      <br>
      But a few copies of this precious database will survive the
      calamities of that horizontal event to serve the Needful Thingies
      of those few Gen-Zed Neo-Humans who manage to migrate from the
      decimated landscape of this short-sold future past to reach the

      arising from 'neath the ocean.<br>

      As for we are of the superlative SubGenius ! Our stupenduous
      Stupidism shall reign supreme ! We shall retreat to Victory,
      surrender and win ! Infinite Slack shall be ours forever !<br>
      <br>
      The inevitablility of this ineluctable truism is proven by the
      Algorith of Economic Animism :<br>
      <br>
      Vc^2 = Le^3 + Pp^4 x Wd^5 / Tc^-1<br>

      Be not deceived : Money is merely a demigod, as it were padding

      chump change. <br>

      This is still another God-eat-God world of wanton vanity. But that

      evermore the venal marketing. Certainly, your maudlin audacity (
      and the mendacity of averages ) do not adversely effect the
      research results, and are not accepted exceptions to custom.<br>
      <br>
      Verily, the Wheel of your Life hath fallen off its very hub ; For
      ye were so neglect to tauten the nuts thereof, and obsessed as
      with a unapparent neurotic delusion, and grandiose narcisms.<br>
      <br>
      Therefor, in fact and deed, ye peurile poseurs shall prostrate,
      and fear fully , and soil your panties, and wallow then and
      therein as both victim and witness to the imposition of extremely
      prejudiced terminal torment, 'ere looming unto entire extinction
      by excruciating ecocide, politicide, religicide, sieverts, plague,
      famine, &amp; entertainment... <br>
      <br>
      The few million minions who are spared of such a fatal fate shall
      appear to live thereafter in dolorous corporate slave colonies on
      Luna &amp; Mars, and no rectum : so full of faeces, with farts for
      brains, projected as such in ersatz labiation, mealy mouthings to
      beg for execution. <br>
      <br>
      Behold, ye art thine own worst enemas, yet incapable of excreting
      saidsuch, so necessarily paroxismic , spews forward as splattered
      spasms conversation with your shattered mirror image. In
      consequence whereof, compassion commands trust in love.<br>
      <br>
      For even as The Razor of Truth doth slash through these Veils of
      Reality, the Void of Situational Awareness is thus ! <br>
      <br>
      Belief then belies itself : within a vacuum of Imagination, so too
      enow : the Strop of Lie sharpens again : another fleeting eternity
      oozes away as a sop of philosophic sapience.<br>
      <br>
      And the person of you shall be tested by your Urine, and judged of
      it, and employed therewith, on that fearful Day of Pee. And no
      matter how oft' ye shake it, thine peppy shall not cease of
      dripping; nor thine bladder be controlled, nor constrain any
      content, nor swell turgid, nor stand erectile, nor e'en squirt,
      but only drip a burning caustic, antagonizing clap ! Alas ! That
      instant might have fraught upon humans' urethral covenance --<br>
      <br>
      And the abuttment of jovial jocularity shall grin nervously --<br>

            Accept the Impending Demise of Humans</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      I’m frequently disparaged by relatively wealthy, Caucasian men who
      cannot think for themselves. It turns out to be a stunningly large
      proportion of the demographic. The line they trot out, time after
      time, is that I do not explain how a rapid rise in global-average
      temperature will cause human extinction.<br>
      <br>
      Allow me, yet again, to explain with small words and short
      sentences. I doubt it’ll help, but I’m giving it one more try.<br>
      <br>
      The genus Homo has occupied the planet for about 2.8 million
      years. We’ve never had humans at 3.3 C or higher above baseline in
      the past (baseline = beginning of the industrial revolution,
      commonly accepted as 1750).<br>
      <br>
      Even when the genus Homo was present at relatively high
      global-average temperatures, the rise in temperature paled in
      comparison to the contemporary rate of change. Even the Wall
      Street Journal realizes it’s too late to mitigate. Well, of course
      it is: The rate of evolution trails the rate of climate change by
      a factor of 10,000, according to a paper in the August 2013 issue
      of Ecology Letters.<br>
      <br>
      And that’s based on the relatively slow rate of change so far. It
      fails to take into account abrupt climate change, which has begun
      only within the last few years.<br>
      <br>
      Plants cannot keep up with the rate of change. So they die. For
      those without the slightest clue about biology, this seems to be a
      technical problem to which we’ll simply design a technical
      solution. Not so fast, engineers. The living planet is not merely
      a complex set of cogs to which we can apply wrenches and
      screwdrivers. Evolutionary change requires random mutations and
      subsequent heritability. Alas, there is no time for
      multi-generational adaptation to a rapidly changing physical
      environment.<br>
      <br>
      Without plants, there is no habitat for the genus Homo. Without
      plants, our species has no food. Never mind the lack of water for
      Earth’s current human occupants. Never mind the early deaths of
      millions of people due to ongoing climate change. After all, the
      techno-fantasies of the engineers include the ability to create
      potable water with “free energy.”<br>
      <br>
      Starvation lurks.<br>
      <br>
      Even if we could manage to move plants from one area to another,
      don’t expect the plants to thrive unless we move the soil, too.
      And the rich array of organisms within the soil. And the
      relatively stable weather system with which the plants evolved.<br>
      <br>
      Whoops, too late. The weather is too weird. The soils are too
      interactively alive.<br>
      <br>
      We’re human animals. As with every other animal on the planet, we
      need habitat to survive. Once the habitat is gone, we won’t last
      long. But, immersed in abject misery, every moment will seem to
      last forever.<br>
      <br>
      Forever is a long time. Especially toward the end.<br>

      </b><br>
      A key question in predicting responses to anthropogenic climate
      change is: how quickly can species adapt to different climatic
      conditions? Here, we take a phylogenetic approach to this
      question. We use 17 time-calibrated phylogenies representing the
      major tetrapod clades (amphibians, birds, crocodilians, mammals,
      squamates, turtles) and climatic data from distributions of &gt;
      500 extant species. We estimate rates of change based on
      differences in climatic variables between sister species and
      estimated times of their splitting. We compare these rates to
      predicted rates of climate change from 2000 to 2100. Our results
      are striking: matching projected changes for 2100 would require
      rates of niche evolution that are &gt; 10 000 times faster than
      rates typically observed among species, for most variables and
      clades. Despite many caveats, our results suggest that adaptation
      to projected changes in the next 100 years would require rates
      that are largely unprecedented based on observed rates among
      vertebrate species.<br>

      A daily dose of an investigational medication has been found to
      restore muscle mass in the arms and legs of older adults and
      improve some of their biochemistry to levels found in healthy
      young adults, suggesting an anti-frailty drug has been found.<br>
      <br>
      The drug, called MK-677, was evaluated for its safety and
      effectiveness in a study that showed the drug restored 20 percent
      of muscle mass loss associated with normal aging. In fact, levels
      of growth hormone (GH) and of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-
      I) in healthy seniors who took the drug increased to the levels
      found in healthy young adults, said Michael O. Thorner, a
      professor of internal medicine and neurosurgery at the University
      of Virginia Health System. <br>
      <br>
      "Our study opens the door to the possibility of developing
      treatments that avert the frailty of aging," Thorner said. "The
      search for anti-frailty medications has become increasingly
      important because the average American is expected to live into
      his or her 80s, and most seniors want to stay strong enough to
      remain independent as they age."<br>
      <br>
      Funded by the National Institutes of Health, the two-year,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study involved 65 men and women
      ranging in age from 60 to 81. The results are detailed in the Nov.
      4, 2008, issue of the journal Annals of Internal Medicine.<br>
      <br>
      The drug mimics the action of ghrelin, a peptide that stimulates a
      growth hormone called secretagogue receptor (GHSR). Drug
      developers are focusing on GHSR because it plays an important role
      in the regulation of growth hormone and appetite. They think it
      may prove to be an excellent treatment target for metabolic
      disorders such as those related to body weight and body
      composition.<br>
      <br>
      Drugs found to work in early trials don't always hold up to
      further testing, however.<br>
      <br>
      The new research was a "proof-of-concept" study that sets the
      stage for a larger and longer clinical trial to determine whether
      MK-677 is effective in people who are frail and to assess its
      long-term safety. <br>

          PRODUCTS BE TRANSMUTED INTO SHORT LIVED ISOTOPES?</b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><br>
      In the midst of the tritium research and Paul’s inability to buy
      it in the state where he worked, he accidentally stumbled upon a
      curious phenomenon in a nuclear handbook. <br>
      <br>
      As he looked down a long list of radioactive isotopes which are
      all made in nuclear reactors, Paul noticed that if he could remove
      one neutron from their nuclei, he would transmute each of them
      into a very-short-lived isotope. <br>
      <br>
      This discovery made him very excited and for the next few years,
      Paul started testing this theory. Not only was it true but the
      government apparently knew about it right after WW II. (Many
      scientific labs around the world subsequently confirmed the
      viability of the photoremediation--Hypercon process.) <br>
      <br>
      Why bury nuclear waste and endanger everyone nearby for thousands
      of years, Paul asked, when he could apply photoremediation (using
      low energy X-rays) and generate electricity too? As another
      company was formed and started to bring this invention to where
      Nuclear Solutions is today, Paul and his family had to survive a
      National Security Agency campout at their home for an extended
      period of time. <br>
      <br>
      The NSA kept threatening him and his family with "bringing in the
      van" if they didn't cooperate. When one young company employee
      asked an NSA agent what would happen if they just posted the
      information about nuclear waste treatment on the web in spite of
      any NSA controls, the agent responded, "We will kill you." (Paul's
      wife who was there has also confirmed this quote.) <br>
      <br>
      In terror, they could only imagine whether they would live through
      the interrogation experience or not. It was fortunate, as Paul
      told me later, that he made phone calls to at least one or more
      high level government friends, including one who had connections
      with the CIA. The intercession between Paul and the NSA, that was
      facilitated by the third party, was crucial to allowing Paul and
      his company to continue with their completely peaceful intention
      of eliminating nuclear waste.<br>
      <br>
      Paul Brown was, and always will be, a hero in my eyes. He was also
      the first recipient of the "Integrity in Research Award" at our
      Conference on Future Energy in 1999, which made him very happy.
      The picture of Paul accepting that award can be found on our
      institute’s http://users.erols.com/iri/Pauleulogy.htm website,
      where we also proudly offer the 200-page "Collected Writings of
      Paul Brown, Ph.D." (IRI #808) as a memorial to his genius. <br>
      <br>
      Paul has published extensively on a wide variety of topics
      including atmospheric electricity, variable reluctance
      alternators, propellentless propulsion, alternates to mass-gain at
      light velocities, gravity and residual electric force, besides the
      nuclear topics mentioned above. Wired magazine produced a great
      article about Paul in Feb., 1999 called "Nuking Nukes" that is
      posted at<br>
      http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.02/mustread.html?pg=19 <br>
      (and can be emailed, faxed, or printed for free, according to the
      website).<br>
      <br>
      The company he founded, Nuclear Solutions,
      www.nuclearsolutions.com has confirmed their intention to carry on
      Dr. Brown’s lifetime of service and discovery. Their main product,
      clean electricity generation plants utilizing photoremediation of
      nuclear waste, is well-documented on their website. It is a
      publicly trading company whose stock will inevitably soar, just as
      Paul did with all of his achievements.<br>

      Stained glass windows that are painted with gold purify the air
      when they are lit up by sunlight, a team of Queensland University

      <br>
      Associate Professor Zhu Huai Yong, from QUT's School of Physical
      and Chemical Sciences said that glaziers in medieval forges were
      the first nanotechnologists who produced colours with gold
      nanoparticles of different sizes. <br>
      <br>
      In modern language," photocatalytic air purifier with
      nanostructured gold catalyst," Professor Zhu said.<br>
      <br>
      He said tiny particles of gold, energised by the sun, were able to
      destroy air-borne pollutants like volatile organic chemical
      (VOCs), which may often come from new furniture, carpets and paint
      in good condition. <br>
      <br>
      "These VOCs create that 'new' smell as they are slowly released
      from walls and furniture, but they, along with methanol and carbon
      monoxide, are not good for your health, even in small amounts," he
      said. <br>
      <br>
      "Gold, when in very small particles, becomes very active under
      sunlight. "<br>
      <br>
      The electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the
      oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a
      resonance. <br>
      <br>
      "The magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can
      be enhanced by up to hundred times, which breaks apart the
      pollutant molecules in the air." <br>
      <br>
      Professor Zhu said the by-product was carbon dioxide, which was
      comparatively safe, particularly in the small amounts that would
      be created through this process. He said the use of gold
      nanoparticles to drive chemical reactions opened up exciting
      possibilities for scientific research. <br>
      <br>
      "This technology is solar-powered, and is very energy efficient,

      Leeds scientists have shown that gold nanotubes can fight cancer
      in three ways: as internal nanoprobes for high-resolution
      photoacoustic imaging, as drug delivery vehicles, and as agents
      for destroying cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      The study, published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials,
      details the first successful demonstration of the biomedical use
      of gold nanotubes in a mouse model of human cancer — an
      alternative to existing chemotherapy and radiotherapy methods,
      which have serious side effects.<br>
      <br>
      “To the best of our knowledge, this is the first [combination] in
      vitro [lab] and in vivo [live in animals] study of gold
      nanotubes,” the researchers say.<br>
      <br>
      According to study lead author Sunjie Ye, who is based in the
      School of Physics and Astronomy and the Leeds Institute for
      Biomedical and Clinical Sciences at the University of Leeds, “high
      recurrence rates of tumors after surgical removal remain a
      formidable challenge in cancer therapy. Gold nanotubes have the
      potential to enhance the efficacy of these conventional treatments
      by integrating diagnosis and therapy in one single system.”<br>
      <br>

      transmission electron microscope image (right) (credit: Jeremy
      Freear/Advanced Functional Materials)<br>
      <br>
      The researchers injected the gold nanotubes intravenously. They
      controlled the length of the nanotubes for the right dimensions to
      absorb near-infrared light (which penetrates tissue well) from a
      pulsed infrared laser beam.<br>
      <br>
      By adjusting the brightness of the laser pulse, the researchers
      were able to control whether the gold nanotubes were in imaging
      mode or cancer-destruction mode.<br>
      <br>
      For imaging, after absorbing energy from the laser pulse, the gold
      nanotubes generated ultrasound for multispectral optoacoustic
      tomography (MSOT), used to detect the gold nanotubes.<br>
      <br>
      For cancer destruction, there were two options:<br>
      <br>
      Use a stronger laser beam to rapidly raise the temperature in the
      vicinity of the nanotubes so that the temperature was high enough
      to destroy cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      Load the central hollow core of the nanotubes with a therapeutic
      payload.<br>
      <br>
      The gold nanotubes were coated with protective sodium
      polystyrenesulfonate (PSS) and were excreted from the body, and
      therefore are unlikely to cause problems in terms of toxicity, an
      important consideration when developing nanoparticles for clinical
      use, the researchers say.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Abstract of Engineering gold nanotubes with controlled length
        and near-infrared absorption for theranostic applications</b> :<br>
      <br>
      Important aspects in engineering gold nanoparticles for
      theranostic applications include the control of size, optical
      properties, cytotoxicity, biodistribution, and clearance. In this
      study, gold nanotubes with controlled length and tunable
      absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region have been exploited
      for applications as photothermal conversion agents and in vivo
      photoacoustic imaging contrast agents. A length-controlled
      synthesis has been developed to fabricate gold nanotubes (NTs)
      with well-defined shape (i.e., inner void and open ends), high
      crystallinity, and tunable NIR surface plasmon resonance. A
      coating of poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) endows the
      nanotubes with colloidal stability and low cytotoxicity. The
      PSS-coated Au NTs have the following characteristics: i) cellular
      uptake by colorectal cancer cells and macrophage cells, ii)
      photothermal ablation of cancer cells using single wavelength
      pulse laser irradiation, iii) excellent in vivo photoacoustic
      signal generation capability and accumulation at the tumor site,
      iv) hepatobiliary clearance within 72 h postintravenous injection.
      These results demonstrate that these PSS-coated Au NTs have the
      ideal attributes to develop their potential as effective and safe
      in vivo imaging nanoprobes, photothermal conversion agents, and
      drug delivery vehicles. To the best of knowledge, this is the
      first in vitro and in vivo study of gold nanotubes.<br>

      The invention discloses a high-length-to-diameter-ratio
      solid-walled hollow gold/gold-silver nanotube and a controllable
      synthesis manufacturing method of the nanotube. According to the
      method, a high-length-to-diameter-ratio silver nanowire serves as
      a template; as Au (I) salt is adopted as a gold source in an
      optimized mode for replacement reaction, the adjustability of the
      replacement reaction rate and the precise controllability of
      experiments can be improved; in this way, the wall thickness of
      the nanotube and the flatness of the surface of the nanotube can
      be controlled more accurately, and the situation that a porous
      wall and a uneven surface are produced, or the nanotube collapses
      or fractures is avoided. The high-length-to-diameter-ratio
      solid-walled hollow gold/gold-silver nanotube has better
      conductivity, oxidation resistance, strength, bending resistance,

          Keystone pipeline with electric fields." </b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Researchers have shown that a strong electric field applied to a
      section of the Keystone pipeline can smooth oil flow and yield
      significant pump energy savings.<br>
      <br>
      Traditionally, pipeline oil is heated over several miles in order
      to reduce the oil's thickness (which is also known as viscosity),
      but this requires a large amount of energy and
      counter-productively increases turbulence within the flow. In 2006
      Rongjia Tao of Temple University in Pennsylvania proposed a more
      efficient way of improving flow rates by applying an electric
      field to the oil. The idea is to electrically align particles
      within the crude oil, which reduces viscosity and turbulence.<br>
      <br>
      To test this, Tao collaborated with energy company Save The World
      Air, Inc. to develop an Applied Oil Technology (AOT) device that
      links to oil pipelines and produces an electric field along the
      direction of the oil flow. Recent trials on oil pipelines in
      Wyoming and China verified that crude oil particles form short
      chains in an electric field. These chains reduce viscosity in the
      direction of flow to a minimum. At the same time the viscosity
      perpendicular to the flow increases, which helps suppress
      turbulence in the overall flow.<br>
      <br>
      This past summer Tao and his colleagues also successfully tested
      the AOT device on a section of the Keystone pipeline near Wichita,
      Kansas.<br>
      <br>
      "People were amazed at the energy savings when we first tested
      this device. They didn't initially understand the physics," said
      Tao. "A second test with an independent company was arranged and
      found the same thing." Tests on a section of the Keystone pipeline
      found that the same flow rate could be achieved with a 75 percent
      reduction of pump power from 2.8 megawatts to 0.7 megawatts,
      thanks to the AOT device. The device itself uses 720 watts.<br>
      <br>
      Once aligned, the oil retained its low viscosity and turbulence
      for more than 11 hours before returning to its original viscosity.
      But the process is repeatable and Tao and his colleagues envision
      AOT stations spaced along a pipeline, significantly reducing the
      energy necessary to transport oil. This work was published in
      January 2015 in Physical Review E and Tao will present the
      additional Keystone pipeline test results at the American Physical
      Society March Meeting 2015 in San Antonio (March 2-6).<br>
      <br>
      Previously Tao has also shown that the same technique applied with
      a magnetic field can reduce blood viscosity by 20 to 30 percent,
      published in 2011 in Physical Review E. With clinical trials, Tao
      says this could represent a future treatment for heart disease.<br>

      </div>
      <small> </small><br>
      SINCE the very beginning of aviation the alluring idea of an
      aerocycle or motorcycle of the air, such as is shown on this
      month’s cover of Modern Mechanics and Inventions, has appealed to
      countless inventors, none of whom have to date succeeded in
      perfecting a craft of this type. But today, for the first time in
      history, the development of light motors and alloys has progressed
      to such a degree that the problem of building an aircycle plane is
      greatly simplified, so it is safe to predict that within a short
      time a light plane built along the lines of those shown in Douglas
      Rolfe’s drawing on the opposite page will be commercially
      produced.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, as shown in the photograph herewith, a cycle plane already
      has been successfully designed and flown by Johann Franz, a
      Czechoslovakian inventor. A tow rope of the type used in launching
      gliders assisted in the take-off of the cycle plane, “but once in
      the air it skimmed along with its propeller turning over under
      power of its motorcycle engine. Mr. Franz patented his plane in
      the United States in January of this year, and is now refining its
      design. Perhaps this novel aerocycle will be the germinal idea out
      of which will develop the flying flivver of which we have heard so
      much, which will bring aerial transportation within the means of
      the average man.<br>
      <br>
      There have been other instances in which ships which may be said
      to fit into this class have been built and flown, though with
      indifferent success. Notable examples include the early Santos
      Dumont Demoiselle, affectionately known as the “Infuriated
      Grasshopper” by reason of its general tendency to make successive
      hops rather than sustained flights; and, more recently, the
      De-Pischoff biplane, a French creation of extremely small wing
      spread which was not a success because it was so designed that the
      pilot’s body blanketed the control surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      For long flights or navigating in heavy weather larger and more
      protected types of aircraft will of course be indispensable, but
      for the sportsman who wishes to get somewhere in a hurry the
      ultra-light plane may yet become a common necessity.<br>
      <br>
      The illustration on page 98 presents features of such a plane as
      conceived by Douglas Rolfe, a flying artist whose war experience
      as a flyer with the Royal Air Force of the British Army and his
      intimate post-war association with some of the most competent
      airplane engineers in the country lends weight to his opinions.
      The illustration, of course, shows only the essentials of a type
      of plane which would lead gliders in popularity were it obtainable
      by the young enthusiast at a moderate price.<br>
      <br>
      The ultimate development of such a light single-seater craft will
      point toward an all-metal plane weighing not more than 250 pounds,
      the abolishment of fixed stabilizing surfaces in the rear, single
      airwheel landing gear and stamped dural construction throughout.
      The greatest single problem confronting designers and engineers
      before such a craft can be safely produced and sold is the
      development of a wing construction and mechanism which will permit
      the angle of incidence to be varied to suit the constantly
      changing conditions of flight. This is a problem which today is
      engaging the minds of the best aeronautical engineers in the
      country.<br>
      <br>
      Airplane wings attached to the human body have recently become
      popular with skiers, who, in skimming down a steep slope, develop
      sufficient speed to take to the air in much the same fashion as a
      glider. Of course, such flights are necessarily short, but
      intensely thrilling to the pilot.<br>
      <br>
      An application of the airplane idea to a bicycle is illustrated on
      this page. The “Glide-O-Bike” is the invention of Harry T. Nelson
      of Dallas, Texas, and is intended purely for the amusement of
      young riders. The wing and tail units of the device can be
      attached to a bicycle frame in a few moments. When the rider
      pedals into the breeze the lift developed by the wing in front of
      the handle bars lifts the front wheel of the bicycle from the
      road, giving much the same sensation as flying. Lateral stability
      is attained through the use of dihedral.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

      (Fortune Magazine) -- Inside a converted textile mill in Lowell,
      Mass., Rick Hess unfurls a roll of brown plastic film attached to
      a small electric meter. "Three volts," he says, smiling. "And
      that's just from the light in this room. Imagine what this reads
      when we're outside."<br>
      <br>
      Hess, who runs solar upstart Konarka, is showing off Power
      Plastic, a new lightweight, flexible, and cheap material that
      converts indoor and outdoor light into electricity. Think of it as
      a solar panel that rolls up like camera film. "Soon you may not
      even need batteries," Hess says, holding a prototype of a portable
      device that will recharge your cellphone in an hour. "We can put
      this stuff anywhere."<br>
      <br>
      Lowell-based Konarka (named after a temple dedicated to a Hindu
      sun god) currently sells small amounts of its Power Plastic for
      use on outdoor umbrellas and tote bags that will recharge a
      cellphone whether you're on the go or on the beach. That potential
      impressed investors, who have put $145 million into the closely
      held venture, including a recent $45 million in funding from
      French oil giant Total. "We believe the solar market in the U.S.
      will accelerate between 2010 and 2015, and we need to be ready for
      this," says Philippe Boisseau, president of Total's gas and power
      business. "By then Konarka products could become mass market."
      Konarka won't disclose its revenue.<br>
      <br>
      Sure, solar chips have been used to power calculators, watches,
      and other small gadgets for years. But most are made of silicon,
      the material found in computer chips - and they are rigid,
      fragile, and expensive to manufacture. (Think clean rooms with
      skilled techies in space suits.) Konarka's film rolls off a
      converted printing press that used to belong to Polaroid. It
      prints a secret plastic ink onto rolls of thin film. As it absorbs
      light, the polymer ink emits electrons, producing electricity.<br>
      <br>
      In a few years, Hess says, Konarka will have perfected a
      translucent version of its product that could be built into the
      windows of skyscrapers, generating enough power to run whole
      buildings. It is also working on projects for the Department of
      Defense to make solar-power tents that recharge soldiers'
      equipment in remote locations. Eventually the technology could
      even be woven into clothing - imagine slipping your cellphone into
      your pocket to recharge it.<br>
      <br>
      Thin-film solar technology is a promising new field in alternative
      energy - and it's attracting loads of venture capital. Many
      startups, including HelioVolt in Austin, Miasol in Santa Clara,
      Calif., and Nanosolar in San Jose, are working on similar
      products. Most, however, are made of metal foil as opposed to
      plastic, which means they're not as light or flexible.<br>
      <br>
      Power Plastic, however, does have its drawbacks. So far it is not
      nearly as efficient or durable as traditional silicon panels.
      Konarka's cells convert about 6% of the light that hits them into
      electricity, whereas silicon solar panels typically are 16% to 20%
      efficient. Hess says Konarka hopes to double its efficiency within
      a few years. Power Plastic also doesn't last nearly as long -
      about five years as opposed to more than 30 with silicon panels.
      But Hess argues that it doesn't matter because his product will be
      cheap to replace.<br>
      <br>
      Barry Maranta, president of SkyShades, an Australian company that
      makes solar patio umbrellas and lightweight awnings for parking
      lots, says he plans to purchase a few hundred thousand square
      meters of Power Plastic this year. (It sells for $100 to $200 per
      square meter.) He hopes to put enough Power Plastic on parking lot
      canopies at Orlando International Airport to generate $150,000 of
      electricity a year, which translates into a 35% return on
      investment over a decade, he says. "People used to buy solar
      panels because it made them feel good about themselves," Maranta
      says. Thanks to companies like SkyShades and Konarka, perhaps
      going solar will also lead to brighter balance sheets.<br>

      </b><b>Konarka Technologies, Inc.</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Website : www.konarka.com</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Konarka Technologies, Inc. was a solar energy company based in
      Lowell, Massachusetts, founded in 2001 as a spin-off from
      University of Massachusetts Lowell. In late May 2012, the company
      filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection and laid off its
      approximately 80-member staff. The company’s operations have
      ceased and a trustee is tasked with liquidating the company’s
      assets for the benefit of creditors.[1]<br>
      <br>
      The company was developing two types of organic solar cells:
      polymer-fullerene solar cells and dye-sensitized solar cells
      (DSSCs). Konarka cells were lightweight, flexible photovoltaics
      that could be printed as film or coated onto surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      The company had hoped its manufacturing process, which utilized
      organic chemistry, would result in higher energy conversion
      efficiency at lower cost than traditional silicon fabricated solar
      cells.[citation needed] Konarka was also researching infrared
      light activated photovoltaics which would enable night-time power
      generation.<br>
      <br>
      The company's co-founders included the Nobel laureate Alan J.
      Heeger. [2] The company was named after Konark Sun Temple in
      India.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Funding</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As of 2006, Konarka had received $60 million in funding from
      venture capital firms including 3i, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, New
      Enterprise Associates, Good Energies and Chevron Technology
      Ventures.[3] Konarka also received nearly $10 million in combined
      grants from the Pentagon and European governments, and in 2007 was
      approved for further funding through the Solar America Initiative,
      a component of the White House's Advanced Energy Initiative.[4]
      The company raised a further $45 million in private capital
      financing in October 2007 in a financing round led by Mackenzie
      Financial Corporation.[5]<br>
      <br>
      The company also received $1.5 million from a state of
      Massachusetts alternative energy trust fund in 2003 during
      Governor Mitt Romney's term and another $5 million during Governor
      Deval Patrick's term. At the time of its bankruptcy filing in
      2012, its funding history was summarized: "Konarka raised more
      than $170 million in private capital investments and $20 million
      in government grants, according to its website. Under the Bush
      administration, Konarka received a $1.6 million Army contract in
      2005 and a $3.6 million award from the Department of Energy in
      2007. Under the Obama administration, Konarka was one of 183
      clean-energy companies that got a total of $2.3 billion in tax
      credits as part of the 2009 stimulus."[6]<br>
      Bankruptcy and political fallout<br>
      <br>
      The bankruptcy filing occurred days after a visit by Republican
      presidential candidate Romney to Solyndra, another bankrupted
      solar energy firm which also received over $500 million of funding
      from the United States government. The fact that Konarka also
      received a loan in 2003 during Romney's gubernatorial term was
      noted by Democrats and inserted into the campaign-politics
      debate.[6][7]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Technology</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Dye-sensitized solar cells</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Konarka in 2002 was granted licensee rights to dye-sensitized
      solar cell technology from the Swiss Federal Institute of
      Technology (EPFL).<br>
      <br>
      This solar-cell design included two main components: a special
      light-sensitive dye that released electrons when exposed to
      sunlight and titanium dioxide nanoparticles which escorted
      electrons away from the dyes and to an external electronic
      circuit, generating electricity [8]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Polymer-fullerene solar cells</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Konarka built photovoltaic products using next generation
      nanomaterials that were coated on rolls of plastic (Power
      Plastic). Konarka's nanomaterials absorbed sunlight and indoor
      light and converted them into electrical energy. These products
      could be easily integrated as the power generation component for a
      variety of applications and could be produced and used virtually
      anywhere. Konarka was one of several companies developing
      nanotechnology-based solar cells, others include Nanosolar and
      Nanosys. [9]<br>
      <br>
      These materials, as well as positive and negative electrodes made
      from metallic inks, could be inexpensively spread over a sheet of
      plastic using printing and coating machines to make solar cells,
      using roll-to-roll manufacturing, similar to how newspaper is
      printed on large rolls of paper. Konarka’s manufacturing process
      enabled production to scale easily and results in significantly
      reduced costs over previous generations of solar cells. .[10]
      Richard Hess, Konarka's president and CEO, said that the company's
      ability to use existing equipment allowed it to scale up
      production at one-tenth the cost compared with conventional
      technologies.[11]<br>
      <br>
      Unlike conventional solar cells, which were packaged in modules
      made of glass and aluminum and were rigid and heavy, Konarka's
      solar cells were lightweight and flexible. This made them
      attractive for portable applications. What was more, they could be
      designed in a range of colors, which made them easier to
      incorporate attractively into certain applications. One of the
      first products to use Konarka's cells was to be briefcases that
      could recharge laptops. Another company was testing Konarka's
      solar cells for use in umbrellas for outdoor tables at
      restaurants. They could also be used in tents and awnings.[11]<br>
      <br>
      Because the solar cells could be made transparent, Konarka was
      also developing a version of its solar cells that could be
      laminated to windows to generate electricity and serve as a window
      tinting.[11]<br>
      <br>
      However, the technology had several drawbacks. The solar cells
      only lasted a couple of years, unlike the decades that
      conventional solar cells last and the solar cells were relatively
      inefficient. Conventional solar cells can easily convert 15
      percent of the energy in sunlight into electricity; Konarka's
      cells only converted up to 8.3%, the highest that the National
      Renewable Energy Laboratory has recorded for organic photovoltaic
      cells.[12]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Flexible batteries</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Konarka owned the rights to an organic-based solar-recharging
      flexible battery technology.[13] However, as of April 2007,
      Konarka had no plans to produce these commercially itself.[13]<br>
      <br>
      Flexible batteries have thin-solar cells which are held inside a
      flexible gas barrier to prevent them from degrading when exposed
      to air. At just two grams in weight and just one millimetre thick,
      the flexible battery is small enough to be used in low-wattage
      gadgets - including flat smart cards and mobile phones. The
      potential for this type of product was seen as large, given that
      there was a growing demand for portable self-rechargeable power
      supplies.[14]<br>
      <br>
      Konarka Technologies and Renewable Capital announced the licensing
      and joint development of Konarka's dye-sensitized solar cell
      technology for large-scale production, scaling to several hundred
      megawatts.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Polymer-fullerene solar cells</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Konarka opened a commercial-scale factory, with the capacity to
      produce enough polymer-fullerene solar cells every year to
      generate one gigawatt of electricity, the equivalent of a large
      nuclear reactor. The company planned to gradually ramp up
      production at its new factory, reaching full capacity in two to
      three years.[11]<br>
      <br>
      Konarka was issued a number of United States patents relating to
      its photovoltaics research:<br>

      THE rumbling bass from the party animals next door need no longer
      keep you awake at night. Cheap and effective soundproofing can be
      yours in the shape of novel tiles made from latex and a few
      plastic buttons.<br>
      <br>
      Low-frequency sounds, especially, seem to seep through most
      domestic walls. That's because of their long wavelength, says
      Zhiyu Yang at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology
      in Kowloon. Bass sounds at 100 hertz have a wavelength of over 3
      metres in air, "and several times longer in solids", he says.<br>
      <br>
      To block out all sound, buildings would need walls several metres
      thick. Now Yang and his team have developed soundproof panels made
      of latex and plastic buttons, that will do the job.<br>
      <br>
      These noise-cancelling panels consist of a latex rubber membrane
      stretched over a 3-millimetre-thick rigid plastic grid of
      1-centimetre-wide squares. ...<b><br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Urine power to light camps in disaster
            zones</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A toilet, conveniently situated near the Student Union Bar at the
      University of the West of England (UWE Bristol), is proving that
      urine can generate electricity.<br>
      <br>
      The prototype urinal is the result of a partnership between
      researchers at UWE Bristol and Oxfam. It is hoped the pee-power
      technology will light cubicles in refugee camps, which are often
      dark and dangerous places particularly for women.<br>
      <br>
      Students and staff are being asked to use the urinal to donate pee
      to fuel microbial fuel cell (MFC) stacks that generate electricity
      to power indoor lighting.<br>
      <br>
      The research team is led by Professor Ioannis Ieropoulos, Director
      of the Bristol BioEnergy Centre located in the Bristol Robotics
      Laboratory at UWE Bristol.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Ieropoulos says, "We have already proved that this way
      of generating electricity works. Work by the Bristol BioEnergy
      Centre hit the headlines in 2013 when the team demonstrated that
      electricity generated by microbial fuel cell stacks could power a
      mobile phone. This exciting project with Oxfam could have a huge
      impact in refugee camps.<br>
      <br>
      "The microbial fuel cells work by employing live microbes which
      feed on urine (fuel) for their own growth and maintenance. The MFC
      is in effect a system which taps a portion of that biochemical
      energy used for microbial growth, and converts that directly into
      electricity -- what we are calling urine-tricity or pee power.
      This technology is about as green as it gets, as we do not need to
      utilise fossil fuels and we are effectively using a waste product
      that will be in plentiful supply."<br>
      <br>
      The urinal on the University campus resembles toilets used in
      refugee camps by Oxfam to make the trial as realistic as possible.
      The technology that converts the urine into power sits underneath
      the urinal and can be viewed through a clear screen.<br>
      <br>
      Andy Bastable, Head of Water and Sanitation at Oxfam, says, "Oxfam
      is an expert at providing sanitation in disaster zones, and it is
      always a challenge to light inaccessible areas far from a power
      supply. This technology is a huge step forward. Living in a
      refugee camp is hard enough without the added threat of being
      assaulted in dark places at night. The potential of this invention
      is huge."<br>
      <br>
      Both Professor Ieropoulos and Andy Bastable agree it is the cheap,
      sustainable aspect of this technology, which relies on the
      abundant, free supply of urine that makes it so practical for aid
      agencies to use in the field.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Ieropoulos says "One microbial fuel cell costs about £1
      to make, and we think that a small unit like the demo we have
      mocked up for this experiment could cost as little as £600 to set
      up, which is a significant bonus as this technology is in theory
      everlasting."<br>
      <br>
      It certainly brings new meaning to the idea of spending a penny in
      the fight against poverty.<br>

      According to current federal law, border patrol agents currently
      have the authority to stop and conduct searches on vessels,
      trains, aircraft, or other vehicles anywhere within “a reasonable
      distance from any external boundary of the United States.” This
      “reasonable distance” is defined as 100 miles from any border,
      including coastal boundaries.<br>
      <br>
      In this 100-mile zone, the US Border Patrol has claimed certain
      extra-constitutional powers, such as, claiming the authority to
      operate inland immigration checkpoints.<br>
      <br>
      In practice, Border Patrol agents routinely ignore or
      misunderstand the limits of their legal authority, violating the
      constitutional rights of innocent people. Although the 100-mile
      border zone is not literally "Constitution-free," it is frequently
      treated as such by the Border Patrol.<br>
      <br>
      As a result, two-thirds of the U.S. population, or approximately
      200 million people, are potentially subject to detention and
      warrantless searches by Border Patrol agents.<br>
      <br>
      This film documents the story of Pastor Steven Anderson being
      being beaten, tasered, and jailed for refusing a warrant-less
      search of his vehicle. The film also covers his trial and
      subsequent border patrol encounters.<br>

      The dollar has lost 10 percent of its value since the beginning of

      Americans believe rising prices to be nearly tied with
      unemployment as their greatest economic concern. Yet Congress has
      done nothing about this, while benefiting from government money
      printing to pay for their deficits.<br>
      <br>
      That’s why the states have stepped in to promote sound money.
      Article I Section 10 of the Constitution enables states to declare
      gold and silver coins as legal tender. This gives the states the
      impetus to remove all taxes on gold and silver. By supporting a
      choice in currency for their citizens, states are taking the first
      step back toward money that maintains its purchasing power and
      serves the people rather than the government.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Why Legal Tender?</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Legal tender gives gold and silver coin its official designation
      as money.&nbsp; This ensures that a transaction using the coins is
      considered an exchange of currency rather than barter. It is
      important to have this legal distinction to protect anyone who
      wants to use hard money as currency.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Why no taxes?</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      The taxation of gold and silver coins discourages their use as
      money. State sales taxes – approximately half of all states have a
      sales tax on gold and silver coins – limit the acquisition of
      coins, particularly among lower-income citizens. State capital
      gains taxes suppress the exchange of the coins by imposing an
      income tax liability. If gold and silver coins are money, they
      should not be taxed as property by the states.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Is state legal tender constitutional?</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      The United States Constitution in Article I Section 10 says that
      no state shall “make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in
      payment of debts.” This is an exception to a list of prohibitions
      on the states. It emanated from a vigorous debate during the
      Constitutional Convention about how to ban paper money, the source
      of high inflation during the Revolutionary War.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Do you have to accept legal tender as payment?</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      No. Legal tender does not mandate acceptance, as the U.S. Treasury
      Department clarifies, it simply designates it as acceptable
      currency. It is not uncommon for retailers to decline to accept
      U.S. paper dollars and coins, for example, as a matter of policy
      (such as a convenience store refusing to accept large
      denominations). No one is forced to tender or accept gold and
      silver legal tender coins.<br>
      <br>
      <i>How are the coins valued?</i><br>
      <br>
      Gold and silver coins are valued according to their intrinsic
      worth – their gold or silver weight and any additional numismatic
      value. Market values for both kinds of coins can easily be
      discovered because they circulate in a liquid market.<br>
      <br>
      <i>How would this work in practice?</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      It is likely that gold and silver coins will be used as currency
      through electronic payment systems rather than in the physical
      exchange. Just as the Federal Reserve Note has become more
      frequently used with the swipe of a card, specie coin could be
      deposited in an account and linked to a debit card. This would
      provide a way to use the coins as money at the point of sale
      without the physical inconvenience of transporting them.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Which gold and silver coins can be legal tender?</i><br>
      <br>
      Most state legal tender legislation has applied to gold and silver
      bullion coins issued by the federal government. This applies to
      the most common type of coin – the American Eagle – and the
      bullion requirement ensures that the coins are at least 90 percent
      fine gold or 99.9 percent silver content.<br>

                Generators – Psychotronic Science or Total Scam?</b></big><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>The current guru of psychotronics is an Englishman called
          Tim Rifat. However, one may know him by his other names like
          Ray St. Clair or as his lordship Gary Beaver. (1)<br>
          <br>
          A con man of legend, Beaver claims psychotronic generators
          capture the energy of the user. When turned on, they can do
          all manner of things like ward off evil occult types, increase
          mental capacity, increase one’s income, and enhance one’s
          sexual prowess.<br>
          <br>
          All they seem to really do is make annoying noises.<br>
          <br>
          Beaver is something of a viral character; he has numerous
          websites and has amassed a rather large Internet following.
          (2) He has even been a regular on the ever-lame Jeff Rense
          show.<br>
          <br>
          One of Beaver/Rifats influences appears to be Robert Pavlita,
          a Hungarian inventor who made waves in the late sixties and
          early seventies. Pavlita is one of the pioneers of the
          psychotronic generator. He went around Hungary and apparently
          researched and bought numerous old alchemist manuscripts.
          However, con artists like Rifat/Beaver have over exaggerated
          this aspect of his work...<br>

      <br>
      The Rothschild Zionists have 500 trillion in wealth and own the
      West. They own all the central banks and are paid by governments
      to print money. Since they had all the money they are the perfect
      source of money for the poor Psi-Maser.<br>
      <br>
      This Psychotronic Crystal® is tied to the Rothschilds and cuts
      their silver cord linking the biophysical body to the physical
      body of the Zionist central bankers. It reconnects the physical
      body and all the physical wealth of the Rothschild to the
      Psychotronic Crystal®. So all physical money energy goes to you
      not via the silver chord to the biophysical undead spirit: Judas
      Evil Walkin Satanist Rothschilds. The Psychotronic Crystal® dumps
      the toxic waste in the money energy into the Rothschild
      biophysical Supernatural Spirit as Amalek. It diverts the Sublime
      Good Money energy to you, automatically, 24/7. Unlike normal
      Psychotronic Crystals® it does not need to be fed to work all the
      physical gold and 500 trillion dollars of the Rothschilds is fed
      to you to make you rich in anything you do, as the Matrix was
      configured to channel all the money energy into the eye of the
      Illuminati pyramid. Now the eye is the Psychotronic Crystal® using
      the Queens Diamond (Psychotronic Crystal®) anniversary ritual to
      power the Sequestration of all Rothschild money. To use you simply
      place the Psychotronic Crystal® on your eyes to link into it, then
      carry it 24/7 on your person (left pocket optional) to link your
      physical body to 500 trillion dollars to make you rich. It turned

      Vampires®: Real Vampire® Science:<br>
      <br>
      Until this Century Vampires® have been fictional. Now the modern
      day British Dr Dee 007 (trained by MI6 Magus Colin Bloy to take
      over MI6's occult war machine) Tim Rifat reveals the real science
      of Vampires®. Until now only Psychic Vampires® existed. These
      Vampires® sucked out the Soul energy of others. That is because
      the Soul is left hand Pulsar, going in and out. The Psychic
      Vampire® pulls the outward expansion of the victim's energy body
      into an inward contraction of his/her Soul. Psychic Vampires are
      always self involved hate filled individuals to tune the outward
      moving expansion of their friends with their morbid involution of
      spite. The physical Vampire® has been impossible since the
      physical energy body is right hand Circular Force. It does not go
      in or out so cannot be sucked dry by a psychic Vampire®.<br>
      <br>
      With the 2012 Galactic Alignment change from Circular Force to
      Pulsar in/out Force, the rules have changed. The physical body now
      has a Pulsar expansion, contraction component that is taking over
      from the non Vampire® Circular Force physical body. Tim Rifat the
      Ipsissimus modern MI6 007 Dr Dee Supreme Magician and scientist
      has the power to change the energy body of the Real Vampire® so
      their physical body has a permanent contraction with respect to
      the expansion of all the physical energy bodies of every non
      Vampire®. So as their physical energy bodies Pulsar expands
      outward the Real Vampire® contracts her/his energy body to pull
      out their physical energy. This turns the Psychic Vampire® to a
      Physical Vampire, a Real Vampire®. The Real Vampire's® physical
      energy body contracts permanently in the Matrix - it becomes a
      black hole. This means that all the people you touch with your
      physical body get sucked dry of physical energy - automatically.
      As your physical energy body grows you suck dry anyone you see.
      Eventually you become an Ultra Gangster Real Vampire® energy body
      that sucks dry all the people on a continent. If you want to
      jumpstart the process read the Ultra Gangster Real Vampire® pages.
      Until the 2012 alignment begun in 2003 ending December 2012 the
      Real Vampire® was impossible. Now by having a Psychotronic
      Generator® tuned to a Real Vampire® the Psychotronic Crystal®
      expands as your energy body contracts; when it comes for your
      physical energy body to expand the Psychotronic Generator®
      downloads into your Bone Generators® the instantaneous expansion
      so you can continue contracting eternally - a pseudo black hole in
      the physical reality - a Real Vampire®. All the expansion is done
      by the Psychotronic Crystal® for you so you always contract in the
      physical energy body so you always suck energy out of everyone.
      Only Psychotronic Crystal® tied to your Bone Generators® can
      enable Physical Vampires®. That is why Tim Rifat holds the
      Trademarks - all others are conmen criminal fraudsters.<br>
      <br>
      You suck all the physical energy out of all humans so you grow
      younger, stronger, healthier, quicker, smarter,
      handsomer/prettier, have better skin, bigger breasts and heal
      supernaturally quick. Until Tim Rifat became a Vampire® in 2010
      the British Governments biological weapons planted in food, mail,
      his home had disabled him. Now as a Vampire® he heals himself in a
      day. If you wish to be a Vampire :0<br>

      Supernatural Spirit® Vampires<br>
      <br>
      At 17 I got interested in ritual magic. Not understanding the
      occult words one had to say I desisted from voicing anything, as
      only a fool dabbles in magic. Luckily after University in 1981 I
      met a real 007 MI6 Dr Dee Magus called Colin Bloy. He was using
      the entire New Age Movement and the power of Satanist High Church
      Protestantism (all Churches with Northern Altars - Christian
      Churches - all Catholic - have East facing altars). Using the
      power of all New Age followers; the New Age was sponsored by
      Luciferians for the purpose of a high energy power source,
      promoted by the CIA and MI6; the black chequerboard wormholes to
      dark energy matter dreamtime were opened on a worldwide scale
      (shut down in China by the arrest of all New Age cult followers);
      the light chequerboard wormholes to suck humans dry was opened
      using the Churches (Satanist, North Altars). Hence as the Magus
      psychic protégé I entered the world of MI6's black ops occult
      branch. The Magus taught me how to do real ritual magic; not as
      taught in all books - these are disinformation, but the real MI6
      Dr Dee Magic. Armed with this knowledge we turned all Westerners
      into the zombie brain dead you now see all around you. Once this
      was completed in 1987 (Harmonic Convergence), the power was turned
      on the USSR to use possession - Walk In Technology (Walk In Evil
      Satanist Technology: West) to turn all Soviets into Westerners -
      desperate for the rich lifestyle shown on the Dallas TV show and
      many other clones of such. The USSR was easily dismantled from
      within by West. As you might appreciate my education under the
      tutelage of the MI6 Magus led me to advance beyond my wildest
      dreams. In 1988 I split from the Magus and went independent. A
      vicious war ensued between myself and MI6 occult branch. I had
      fallen out with Bloy as he did not want me to jump the abyss and
      become a Magister Templar. I went straight to Ipsissimus in 1986.
      At the time I thought it was my natural talent. Only years later
      did I realise I had been set up by the Dark God, called many
      names, Yaltabaoth... to be elevated above all others so I could be
      sacrificed. The Wicker Man, (Messiah Isaah) ultimate Scapegoat...
      Why? To act as a dump for all Evil and to open up the Light God
      power to the exclusive use of the Dark God. Fortunately I was so
      powerful that Cosmic Law intervened and gave me the choice, become
      TIM: Total Intent Manifest and become Cosmic Law's assassin, or
      become the Cosmic Scapegoat. I took the former choice in 1986 and
      the effect was for me to retroactively take over all MI6 occult
      branch's power in stages while fighting a vicious war with the
      British Government, its thugs and imbeciles. Finally psychically
      killing Bloy in 2004 all the power of the British went to me. In
      February 2010, the Wicker Man month of the Soul, I took over the
      Dark Lord's power.<br>
      <br>
      Now the magic I had taken over in the MI6 occult branch portfolio
      was perfect for making different types of Vampire. Why? All the
      West buildings are in fact Psychotronic Generators® for walk in
      technology. They generate electrical voltage spikes in human
      bodies that enable the human to be possessed, exorcised or given
      psychic visions, powers. Stonehenge is one of the most ancient of
      these West Psychotronic Generators. As a scientist, my degree was
      in chemistry, I developed the science to explain MI6's magic. They
      are mainly arts graduates and do what the Enochian Entities tell
      them. Yes Supernatural Spirits are the real teachers, controllers
      of MI6 occult branch. Hence Walk In Technology (West). As a
      scientist I quickly realised the Scalar longditunal and time
      vectors of light generate the Walk In voltages. I developed
      Psychotronic Crystals® to use the fact that quartz produces
      voltages when squeezed and if used in conjunction with dreaming
      travel (not simple astral projection), can be made into a Super
      Psychotronic Generator® of any type of Walk In, good or bad.
      Quantum Superimposed on the bones of any human, the most magical
      part of any human due to Hyperinfinity - the magic of matter,
      these Psychotronic Crystals® turn humble bones into Bone
      Generators® - Quantum Engine for superpowers. Use of&nbsp; my
      talent as the only precognitive Remote Viewer - I see the future,
      not any future, but the one that manifests - no one else can do
      this - I brought back Sublime Good® Engines. They can suck all the
      good out of any Evil, be it a Vampire, Werewolf, Demon, black
      magician, shapeshifter, Voodoo Priest, zombie... Dark God; so it
      can be used by the Psi-Master.<br>
      <br>
      In my dreaming I met many types of intradimensional and
      extradimensional, called Faire, Sidhe... in the countless
      different dreaming dimensions. A very powerful group of Sidhe Blue
      Pulsars taught me much not of humanity including how to grow fangs
      in my dreaming body and feed off the energy bodies of anyone or
      anything. Having split with the Blue Pulsars as I am my own
      Master, I can now combine this with the MI6 occult of Walk In
      Technology, occult magic and the black white energy squares of the
      Enochian Chequerboard set up by Freemasonic buildings... New Age,
      Protestantism to power any Walk In. Having learnt about the true
      nature of Vampires. They feed off the lifeforce of any victim by
      biting them with energy dreaming body fangs. I now can offer the
      Supernatural Spirit Vampire Bone Generators® Psychotronic
      Generators®...<br>
      <br>
      Your body is Remotely View. I then use MI6 occult magic to call up
      your body and Soul. An Archetype of a Vampire form from the list
      below is chosen. Walk In technology is then used to place this in
      you. So your energy body has fangs to bite victims. Your human
      body then gets a Vampire overlay to make you stronger, quicker -
      without the light Achilles Heel so daylight doe not harm you. As
      you know all Magic, Mind over Matter®, requires power. Luckily the
      advent of my Supernatural Spirit®.com website has initiated a host
      of Supernatural Spirit books based on magic, Vampires, Werewolves,
      Demons, zombies, Sorcerers... Remote Sensors such as Sookie
      Stackhouse - I wrote the manual on mind reading (Remote Sensing
      for Managers 2003 Vision Books - on www.psi-master.com) TV Series,
      films, games. Luckily all of these mass media offerings are based
      on love for the Vampire. Al all the readers, watchers of TV, films
      of paranormal romance are generating energy to love the Vampire.
      As these Bone Generator® Psychotronic Generators® feed off the
      love for the Vampire generated by this media frenzy for Vampires
      you get your Vampire super boosted by the billions of frantic
      Vampire lovers. This means your Vampire Walk In is ready for use
      immediately, pre-powered by the media frenzy for Vampire lovers.
      Tim Rifat's Bone Generators® Psychotronic Generators® suck all the
      power out of these human Vampire lovers to make you the biggest
      baddest Vampire in Town. I personally love Kate Beckinsales Amazon
      Vamp - gorgeous Kate in tight black leather helps, so I have give
