                  similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest
                  that the latter does not provide the exact variant
                  that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis
                  that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very
                  likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus
                  (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of
                  its genome of a distinct lineage within the
                  betacoronavirus. These genomic features and their
                  potential association with virus characteristics and
                  virulence in humans need further attention.<br>

                  practical point of view. It gives an introduction to
                  the topic, reviews the history and previous outbreaks
                  of Ebola virus disease and gives insight to clinical
                  features of the disease. The major part of the book
                  presents ways of response including screening,
                  isolation and personal protection equipment as well as
                  waste management during disease outbreaks. New
                  therapies and experimental drugs are discussed in
                  further detail. The last part of the volume deals with
                  all aspects of diagnostics and practical laboratory
                  handling of Ebola virus.<br>

                  I see there is alot of dicussion on this
                  subject.&nbsp; Ive been a member of
                  "onesmallstepforman" yahoo group with Lawrence Rayburn
                  as the creator of the TREC.&nbsp; Alot of details have
                  been given out as to the theory of operation.&nbsp; It
                  has to do with the Tank Circuit of multiple nested
                  inductors.&nbsp; Primary inductors are usually Single
                  wound, secondaries are Bifilar WITH one larger
                  diameter wire than the other(in the bifilar)&nbsp;
                  Then The bifilar is fedback to the primary of the next
                  set.&nbsp; This is regenerative feedback circuit which
                  Tesla talks about and experimented with in the
                  Colorado Spring notes.&nbsp; He said in those notes
                  that this feedback circuit causes signal that are
                  normally to "feeble" to become stronge enough to do
                  work and power motors,ect.&nbsp; Thsi is the basics of
                  the TREC.&nbsp; The whole tuner is tunable by moving
                  the inductors one within the other as they are all
                  build on different diameter tubes, this adjusts the
                  amount of transformer action, the mutual inductance,
                  and inter-capacitance fo the bifilars.&nbsp; Anyways
                  this gives you a lead point, Join the group and you
                  will learn more, I have.&nbsp; Fern...<br>

                  This is what Lawrence Rayurn says: The Tesla Radiant
                  Energy Collector, my version, does not produce free
                  energy. Sure, by your definition, it is overunity
                  because it requires no input of energy to make it self
                  start. God's creation supplies that and the TREC only
                  redirects a small stream of the energy that is already
                  there and flowing.<b><b><br>

                  </b>Suramin is a medication used to treat African
                  sleeping sickness and river blindness.[1][2] It is the
                  treatment of choice for sleeping sickness without
                  central nervous system involvement.[3] It is given by
                  injection into a vein.[4]<br>
                  <br>
                  Suramin causes a fair number of side effects.[4]
                  Common side effects include nausea, vomiting,
                  diarrhea, headache, skin tingling, and weakness.[2]
                  Sore palms of the hands and soles of the feet, trouble
                  seeing, fever, and abdominal pain may also occur.[2]
                  Severe side effects may include low blood pressure,
                  decreased level of consciousness, kidney problems, and
                  low blood cell levels.[4] It is unclear if it is safe
                  when breastfeeding.[2]<br>
                  <br>
                  Suramin was made at least as early as 1916.[5] It is
                  on the World Health Organization's List of Essential
                  Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines
                  needed in a health system.[6] In the United States it
                  can be acquired from the Center for Disease Control
                  (CDC).[3] The cost of the medication for a course of
                  treatment is about US$27.[7] In regions of the world
                  where the disease is common suramin is provided for
                  free by the World Health Organization (WHO).[8] ..<br>

                      turmeric (T) extracts assolvent media. The

                      were characterized andanalyzed. Solvent media was
                      found to have an effect on both the size and the
                      morphology of thenanoparticles, which in turn
                      effected their optical and cytotoxic properties.
                      The colony forming unit(CFU) assays were done for
                      E. coli, S. aureus and&nbsp; S. typhi in which
                      T/ZnO (~2) and P/ZnO (~3)showed a remarkable
                      effect on S. aureus&nbsp; for 100 µg/ml and nearly
                      zero for 150 µg/ml. The zone ofinhibition (ZoI)
                      was measured for S agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae and
                      S. pyogenes. The results showedthat<br>
                      S. dysgalactiae is more sensitive to

                      compoundstowardsprostate cancer cells was
                      investigated. Among the active compounds T ZnO
                      showed thehighest activity with low IC50 value
                      (37.751 µg/ml) followed by P ZnO (45.68 µg/ml)</font><b><font

                      researchers are closing in on understanding why
                      electrical storms have a positive influence on the
                      growth of some fungi. In a series of experiments,
                      Koichi Takaki at Iwate University and colleagues
                      showed that artificial lightning strikes do not
                      have to directly strike shiitake mushroom
                      cultivation beds to promote growth. Now they are
                      developing technology to use electric stimulation
                      in the production of the mushrooms, which are
                      popular in many east Asian cuisines.<br>
                      <br>
                      Bizarre as it may seem, atmospheric electricity
                      has long been known to boost the growth of living
                      things, including plants, insects and rats. In
                      1775, the priest and physicist Giovanni Battista
                      Beccaria of the University of Turin reported, “it
                      appears manifest that nature makes extensive use
                      of atmospheric electricity for promoting
                      vegetation”.<br>
                      <br>
                      David Graves at the University of California at
                      Berkeley, an expert on plasmas in food and
                      agriculture who was not involved in this mushroom
                      study, said “Historically, most people who looked
                      at it [atmospheric electricity] systematically
                      found some effect, but it can sometimes be hard to
                      reproduce, so it’s still not by any means fully
                      accepted in the community and there’s little
                      understanding of the mechanism.” However, at
                      recent plasma conferences, Graves was favourably
                      impressed by the results presented by Takaki.<br>
                      Fruiting bodies<br>
                      <br>
                      Takaki explains, “We use high voltage electric
                      shock as stimulation to change the mushroom growth
                      state from vegetative to reproductive growth of
                      fruiting bodies”. Takaki, is an expert on
                      discharge plasma and high voltage engineering and
                      aims to improve the cultivation shiitake mushrooms
                      in countries that suffer from low yields.<br>
                      <br>
                      Shiitake mushrooms are grown in hardwood logs in a
                      process that takes one year. First, branching
                      vegetative filaments called hyphae are grown in
                      the logs, which are kept in beds. Farmers then
                      submerge the logs in water for 1-2 days and then
                      beat the logs mechanically. When this is done
                      skilfully, it disrupts the interlinking hyphae,
                      moving the shiitake into its reproductive phase of
                      growth that produces the desirable mushroom caps.<br>
                      <br>
                      In Takaki’s previous studies, yield increases were
                      achieved by running a direct current through a
                      shiitake mushroom log. But Takaki still wondered –
                      why do natural electric storms indirectly
                      influenced the growth of mushrooms located miles
                      away from the lightning strikes?<br>

                      that it was not purely high-voltage electricity
                      stimulating mushroom growth, but that other
                      physical events must be triggered and ripple out
                      into the surrounding environment. To test this,
                      Takaki’s team investigated the effects of more
                      natural, indirect strikes on growth.<br>
                      <br>
                      They took logs ready for stimulation, performed a
                      24 h submersion in water, and then arranged the
                      logs 3 m offset from the lower and upper
                      electrodes of an impulse voltage generator. In an
                      electrical storm a cloud generates 3-4 strikes on
                      average, so the team programmed the same number of
                      sparks to sequentially discharge between
                      electrodes.<br>
                      <br>
                      That was day one. The team harvested mushroom caps
                      more than 50 mm in diameter on days 9, 11 and 13,
                      recording fruiting body number and size. They
                      collected approximately twice as many mushrooms on
                      logs exposed to lightning strikes 3 m away,
                      compared to mushrooms produced by the control set
                      of logs sitting 12 m away within the same
                      facility.<br>
                      <br>
                      A third set of logs were exposed to daily sets of
                      lightning strikes for a week and they produced an
                      even higher yield than those only exposed to one
                      set of strikes.<br>

                      10,000 °C,” explains Takaki. “This quick rise in
                      temperature rapidly increases the volume of the
                      air producing a shock wave that propagates to, and
                      then vibrates inside the log. This moves the

                      to simulate shock waves using sound from a
                      speaker. However, from preliminary experiments,
                      Takaki does not think the sound is loud enough to

                      </font></b><font color="#000000">Since ancient
                      times, the anomalous occurrence of mushrooms has
                      been observed in and around locations struck by
                      lightning. Based on this phenomenon, various
                      cultivation techniques using a high voltage to
                      cultivate shiitake mushroom in bed log (wood) have
                      been proposed. Undoubtedly, the fruiting capacity
                      of shiitake mushrooms is significantly promoted by
                      direct application of a high voltage to the
                      cultivation bed logs. However, mushroom bed logs
                      are rarely struck directly by lightning in the
                      natural environment. Thus, it is important to
                      devise a stimulation method that matches
                      conditions in the natural environment. In this
                      study, we performed experiments involving indirect
                      lightning strikes using a new method that mimics
                      the natural environment as closely as possible.
                      Specifically, we used the electric discharge
                      created by an impulse voltage generator to create
                      lightning but did not apply it directly to the
                      cultivation bed log. Instead, the cultivation bed
                      logs were placed a few meters away from the
                      lightning rod. Subsequently, the fruiting capacity
                      of the shiitake mushrooms with and without the
                      indirect lightning strikes was compared. The
                      experimental results indicated that, with the
                      indirect lightning strikes, the extent of shiitake
                      fruiting almost doubled compared to the case
                      without the indirect lightning strikes.
                      Furthermore, the results confirm that an increased
                      shiitake mushroom production is possible using
                      lightning strikes, even if the associated high
                      voltages are not applied directly to the bed logs.<br>

                  </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
                  </b>Psilocybin is a tryptamine-derived psychoactive
                  alkaloid found mainly in the fungal genus Psilocybe,
                  among others, and is the active ingredient in
                  so-called “magic mushrooms”. Although its notoriety
                  originates from its psychotropic properties and
                  popular use as a recreational drug, clinical trials
                  have recently recognized psilocybin as a promising
                  candidate for the treatment of various psychological
                  and neurological afflictions. In this work, we
                  demonstrate the de novo biosynthetic production of
                  psilocybin and related tryptamine derivatives in
                  Saccharomyces cerevisiae by expression of a
                  heterologous biosynthesis pathway sourced from
                  Psilocybe cubensis. Additionally, we achieve improved
                  product titers by supplementing the pathway with a
                  novel cytochrome P450 reductase from P. cubensis.
                  Further rational engineering resulted in a final
                  production strain producing 627 ± 140 mg/L of
                  psilocybin and 580 ± 276 mg/L of the dephosphorylated
                  degradation product psilocin in triplicate controlled
                  fed-batch fermentations in minimal synthetic media.
                  Pathway intermediates baeocystin, nor norbaeocystin as
                  well the dephosphorylated baeocystin degradation
                  product norpsilocin were also detected in strains
                  engineered for psilocybin production. We also
                  demonstrate the biosynthetic production of natural
                  tryptamine derivative aeruginascin as well as the
                  production of a new-to-nature tryptamine derivative
                  N-acetyl-4-hydroxytryptamine. These results lay the
                  foundation for the biotechnological production of
                  psilocybin in a controlled environment for
                  pharmaceutical applications, and provide a starting
                  point for the biosynthetic production of other
                  tryptamine derivatives of therapeutic relevance.<b><br>

                  </b><b>Overview</b><b><br>
                  </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to data from the
                  best-studied countries such as South Korea, Iceland,
                  Germany and Denmark, the overall lethality of Covid19
                  is in the lower per mille range and thus up to twenty
                  times lower than initially assumed by the WHO.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A study in Nature Medicine comes to
                  a similar conclusion even for the Chinese city of
                  Wuhan. The initially significantly higher values for
                  Wuhan were obtained because a many people with mild or
                  no symptoms were not recorded.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50% to 80% of test-positive
                  individuals remain symptom-free. Even among the 70 to
                  79 year old persons about 60% remain symptom-free,
                  many more show only mild symptoms.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The median age of the deceased in
                  most countries (including Italy) is over 80 years and
                  only about 1% of the deceased had no serious previous
                  illnesses. The age and risk profile of deaths thus
                  essentially corresponds to normal mortality.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many media reports of young and
                  healthy people dying from Covid19 have proven to be
                  false upon closer inspection. Many of these people
                  either did not die from Covid19 or they in fact had
                  serious preconditions (such as undiagnosed leukaemia).<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normal overall mortality in the US
                  is about 8000 people per day, in Germany about 2600
                  people and in Italy about 1800 people per day.
                  Influenza mortality in the US is up to 80,000, in
                  Germany and Italy up to 25,000, and in Switzerland up
                  to 1500 people per winter.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strongly increased death rates, as
                  in northern Italy, can be influenced by additional
                  risk factors such as very high air pollution and
                  legionella contamination, as well as a collapse in the
                  care of the elderly and sick due to infections, mass
                  panic and lockdown.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In countries such as Italy and
                  Spain, and to some extent Great Britain and the US, a
                  serious overload of hospitals, notably by the flu, is
                  not unusual. In addition, up to 15% of doctors and
                  nurses currently have to self-quarantine, even if they
                  develop no symptoms.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An important distinction concerns
                  the question of whether people die with or indeed from
                  coronaviruses. Autopsies show that in many cases the
                  previous illnesses were an important or decisive
                  factor, but the official figures usually do not
                  reflect this.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus in order to assess the danger
                  of the disease, the key indicator is not the often
                  mentioned number of test-positive persons and
                  deceased, but the number of persons who actually and
                  unexpectedly develop or die of pneumonia.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The often shown exponential curves
                  of “corona cases” are misleading, since the number of
                  tests also increases exponentially. In most countries,
                  the ratio of positive tests to total tests either
                  remains constant between 5% to 25% or increases rather
                  slowly.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Countries without lockdowns and
                  contact bans, such as Japan, South Korea and Sweden,
                  have not experienced a more negative course of events
                  than other countries. This might call into question
                  the effectiveness of such far-reaching measures.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to leading lung
                  specialists, invasive ventilation of Covid19 patients
                  is often counterproductive and causes additional
                  damage to the lungs. The invasive ventilation of
                  Covid19 patients is partly done out of fear of
                  spreading the virus through aerosols.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contrary to original assumptions,
                  however, the WHO determined at the end of March that
                  there is no evidence of aerosol dispersal of the
                  virus. A leading German virologist also found no
                  aerosol and no smear infections in a pilot study.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many clinics in Europe and the US
                  have been lacking patients and some have had to
                  introduce short-time work. Numerous operations and
                  therapies were cancelled by clinics, even emergency
                  patients sometimes stay at home out of fear of the
                  virus.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several media have been caught
                  trying to dramatize the situation in clinics,
                  sometimes even with manipulative pictures and videos.
                  In general, many media outlets do not question even
                  doubtful official statements and figures.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The virus test kits used
                  internationally are prone to errors. Several studies
                  have shown that even normal corona viruses can give a
                  false positive result. Moreover, the virus test
                  currently in use has not been clinically validated due
                  to time pressure.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Numerous internationally renowned
                  experts from the fields of virology, immunology and
                  epidemiology consider the measures taken to be
                  counterproductive and recommend a rapid natural
                  immunisation of the general population while
                  protecting risk groups.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of people suffering from
                  unemployment, psychological problems and domestic
                  violence as a result of the measures taken has
                  exploded in the US and worldwide. Several experts
                  believe that the measures may claim more lives than
                  the virus itself.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden
                  warned that the corona crisis is used for the massive
                  and permanent expansion of global surveillance. The
                  renowned virologist Pablo Goldschmidt spoke of a
                  “global media terror” and “totalitarian measures”.
                  Leading British virologist Professor John Oxford spoke
                  of a “media epidemic”.<br>

                  <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
                  </b><b>Introduction:</b> ‘Repurposing’ existing drugs
                  to treat COVID-19 is vital to reducing mortality and
                  controlling the pandemic. Several promising drugs have
                  been identified and are in various stages of clinical
                  trials globally. If efficacy of these drugs is
                  demonstrated, rapid, mass availability at an
                  affordable cost would be essential to ensuring equity
                  and access especially amongst low- and middle-income
                  economies.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Methods:</b> Minimum costs of production were
                  estimated from the costs of active pharmaceutical
                  ingredients using established methodology, which had
                  good predictive accuracy for medicines for hepatitis C
                  and HIV amongst others. Data were extracted from
                  global export shipment records or analysis of the
                  route of chemical synthesis. The estimated costs were
                  compared with list prices from a range of countries
                  where pricing data were available.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Results:</b> Minimum estimated costs of production
                  were US $0.93/day for remdesivir, $1.45/day for
                  favipiravir, $0.08/day for hydroxychloroquine,
                  $0.02/day for chloroquine, $0.10/day for azithromycin,
                  $0.28/day for lopinavir/ritonavir, $0.39/day for
                  sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and $1.09/day for pirfenidone.
                  Costs of production ranged between $0.30 and $31 per
                  treatment course (10–28 days). Current prices of these
                  drugs were far higher than the costs of production,
                  particularly in the US.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Conclusions:</b> Should repurposed drugs
                  demonstrate efficacy against COVID-19, they could be
                  manufactured profitably at very low costs, for much
                  less than current list prices. Estimations for the
                  minimum production costs can strengthen price
                  negotiations and help ensure affordable access to
                  vital treatment for COVID-19 at low prices globally. <br>

                    <b>by Ethan Huff</b><br>
                  </div>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;After President Donald Trump mentioned during a
                  recent press conference the potential benefits of
                  hydroxychloroquine for treating the Wuhan coronavirus
                  (COVID-19), Anthony Fauci from the National Institute
                  of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) quickly
                  piped in that the remedy supposedly isn’t proven, and
                  that people shouldn’t think of it as a “knockout
                  drug.” So why, then, did he praise this very same drug
                  back in 2013 as a treatment for the MERS coronavirus,
                  a relative of COVID-19?<br>
                  <br>
                  At the time, Barack Obama was occupying the White
                  House, and an NAIAD study conducted by a guy named
                  Darryl Falzarano found that an antiviral cocktail
                  containing hydroxychloroquine showed incredible
                  promise in vitro for preventing viral replication.
                  Fauci jumped at the chance to praise the discovery,
                  announcing that it was “particularly encouraging”
                  because these drugs are “widely available,” meaning
                  they can get into the hands of people who need them
                  quickly and easily.<br>
                  <br>
                  However, now that Trump and his administration are in
                  charge, Fauci is singing a much different tune. Rather
                  than express enthusiasm for the many cases of the
                  Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) that have already been
                  successfully treated with hydroxychloroquine, Fauci
                  felt the need to throw a wet blanket over the whole
                  thing and override Trump’s announcement in a stunning
                  display of disrespect.<br>
                  <br>
                  “You’ve got to be careful when you say ‘fairly
                  effective,'” Fauci shot back at Trump after the
                  president suggested, based on Fauci’s own statements
                  from seven years ago, that hydroxychloroquine
                  demonstrated effectiveness against SARS (severe acute
                  respiratory syndrome). “It was never done in a
                  clinical trial that compared it to anything. It was
                  given to individuals and felt that maybe it worked.”<br>
                  <br>
                  Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike
                  Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about the health
                  benefits of zinc in fighting against the Wuhan
                  coronavirus (COVID-19):<br>
                  <br>
                  In 2013, hydroxychloroquine’s benefits were “science;”
                  now they’re just “feelings,” according to Fauci<br>
                  <br>
                  Fauci couldn’t just leave it at that, however. He had
                  to go on when pressed further about Trump’s claims
                  concerning hydroxychloroquine to insist that the
                  president simply “feels optimistic” about the
                  treatment, suggesting that there isn’t any actual
                  science to back it..<br>

                      process that could clean up to 4 million masks per
                      day</b><br>
                  </div>
                  <br>
                  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
                  provided an emergency use authorization (EUA) for a
                  decontamination process provided by company Advanced
                  Sterilization Products (ASP) that could see as many as
                  4 million N95 respirators per day sterilized for
                  re-use. That’s a significant potential dent in the
                  ongoing shortage of supplies faced by medical
                  professionals and frontline workers at healthcare
                  facilities.<br>
                  <br>
                  This decontamination process would open up re-use of
                  N95 masks originally designed for single use, and it
                  uses vaporized hydrogen peroxide gas to clean the
                  respirators. ASP’s STERRAD series sterilization
                  machines, which are covered under the EUA, are in use
                  in around 6,300 hospitals already (they’re commonly
                  used for sterilizing other pieces of clinical
                  equipment, but have not previously been intended for
                  use with N95 masks) and there are around 9,930 in
                  operation across the U.S., each with the capability of
                  processing around 480 masks per day.<br>
                  <br>
                  The FDA has perviously cleared another similar system
                  for N95 decontamination: Battelle’s vaporized hydrogen
                  peroxide process. This new clearance greatly expands
                  the reach and potential volume of decontamination
                  that’s possible, and should pave the way for others to
                  follow.<br>
                  <br>
                  Duke University was early in calling for this process
                  to be used on N95 respirators after demonstrating that
                  it is safe and effective and available on a range of
                  equipment already in use in biocontainment labs and
                  other medical facilities.<br>
                  <br>
                  So far, all of these clearances are EUAs, but this
                  does seem like an area where the measures could become
                  more permanent following the pandemic in order to
                  better prepare health care systems in case of other
                  emergencies. Technologies for emergency re-use of
                  single use equipment, and other ways to extend the
                  viable life of crucial medical gear, seems like a wise
                  area of further investment and study.<br>

                  Dr. Christopher Voscopoulos, ICU medical director at
                  Southern Hills Hospital in Las Vegas, explains how the
                  ‘proning’ treatment takes pressure off the lungs by
                  turning the patient onto their stomach...<br>
                  <br>
                  "What proning is, is that normally we have patients
                  lie on their back," he explained. "When they lie on
                  their back, their heart applies pressure on the back
                  of their lungs and it closes off those lungs just a
                  little."<br>
                  <br>
                  "And, what we do is we simply turn people over and
                  they lie on their stomach. By doing that, the heart
                  falls off the lungs and opens up a little bit more of
                  the lung," he stated further. "You have to remember
                  that these are people fighting for their life. And so,
                  when we open up a little more lung, that's the
                  difference between life and death."..<br>

                  Fukushima however, it is instead about other topics
                  discussed during the hours long interview I held with
                  this engineer. Due to the extent of this interview, I
                  produced reports that were not directly related to
                  Fukushima, Here is one of these reports, and IT
                  HAPPENED. IT HAS NOW HAPPENED.<br>
                  <br>
                  IF AMERICA DOES NOT COOPERATE WITH A NEW WORLD ORDER
                  TAKEOVER, THEY ARE GOING TO STUXNET THE NUCLEAR
                  FACILITIES AND DESTROY THE UNITED STATES. THIS
                  INFORMATION WAS TRANSFERRED TO ME BY THE SAME PEOPLE
                  WHO REVEALED THAT SATANIC TEMPLE.<br>
                  <br>
                  I NAILED IT - READ THIS OLD REPORT AND WEEP FOLKS, IT
                  HAPPENED.<br>
                  <br>
                  This is a long report, here is a short summary: As
                  part of a plot to destroy the United States, the
                  original technology our nuclear facilities were
                  designed to use was banned. This technology allowed
                  nuclear fuel to be consumed completely by using it in
                  two different types of reactors. As nuclear fuel is
                  used, it's characteristics change that require it to
                  be used differently by a secondary reactor, so it can
                  be put right back in the original reactor. If you
                  can't do this, you can only use nuclear fuel to about
                  5 percent spent and then it has to go into the fuel
                  pool. The fuel pools were never designed to handle
                  more than a few spent nuclear cores and now they have,
                  on average, over 50 each. If we could have used the
                  fuel as intended, all of our nuclear facilities would
                  only have (up to) 2 cores each right now, and even if
                  all power and control was lost there would be no fuel
                  pool disaster. Now that the fuel pools are so heavily
                  overloaded with thousands of tons of 95 percent
                  un-spent fuel, if anything at all goes wrong with
                  them, they'll make Fukushima look like a party favor.<br>
                  <br>
                  America has now been threatened with this exact
                  scenario if it does not go along with the one world
                  government. <br>

                  BUSTED: Federal government BUSTED for forcing American
                  nuclear industry to become a ticking time bomb<br>
                  Americans have been told their nuclear waste must go
                  somewhere. Americans have been told their spent
                  reactor fuel needs to be stored inside a mountain in
                  the desert, where it will sit as a threat and menace
                  to the world for millions of years. Americans have
                  been told there is nothing they can do about it. But
                  what if they have been told a lie? What if that "spent
                  fuel" was not spent at all? What if a technology
                  existed which allowed the same fuel to be used over
                  and over, twenty times in fact, and expended so fully
                  that fuel rods would be safe enough to handle directly
                  out of the reactor? Think any "spent fuel pools" would
                  be full? ...<br>
                  <br>
                  During my journey of discovery in my investigation
                  into the Fukushima disaster, I interviewed an 85 year
                  old nuclear engineer who worked in the nuclear
                  industry during America's glory days, an engineer who
                  earned GE over 100 patents. He was one of the
                  engineers who designed Fukushima, so naturally when
                  conducting an investigation into such a disaster any
                  journalist would want that type of reference. He was
                  surprised when my prior study of reactor systems was
                  so thorough that he had no information about Fukushima
                  I did not already dig up, and he was very surprised
                  when I told him details about the inner workings of
                  his own reactor design he never expected anyone in the
                  media to know.<br>
                  <br>
                  When I started to think I was going to walk away with
                  nothing new, he began to talk about an entirely
                  different subject. He began his new direction in the
                  discussion with the phrase "My team succeeded in
                  closing the nuclear loop, and Carter banned our
                  miracle with an executive order."...<br>
                  <br>
                  "I started in the American nuclear program all the way
                  back at the time of the Manhattan project, and have
                  been involved in reactor design and nuclear
                  engineering my whole life. There was one answer we all
                  searched for, and it was how to close the nuclear
                  loop...<br>
                  <br>
                  After this process, which restores the fuel to it's
                  original state is complete, the fuel can go back into
                  the boiling water reactor and used as new with no
                  reprocessing - the exact same rods can be exchanged
                  between reactors.<br>
                  <br>
                  We perfected the second reactor design which used
                  liquid sodium as a coolant and the reactor ran much
                  hotter - 1100 farenheit as opposed to 550 in a boiling
                  water reactor. The liquid sodium circulated inside the
                  reactor instead of water, with the heat of the
                  reaction being removed from the system by a heat
                  exchanger which produced steam outside the reactor for
                  use in producing electricity. The temperature
                  difference and coolant characteristics in the
                  complimentary reactor facilitated the burning of the
                  isotopes, and you got to use both sides of the
                  reaction - the boiling water reactor produced
                  electricity while producing unwanted isotopes, and the
                  sodium cooled reactor produced electricity while
                  burning the unwanted isotopes out. This process could
                  be repeated 20 times, and when it was finished the
                  fuel was DEAD and no longer hazardous because all of
                  it's radiological potential was used up. It was a
                  clean energy dream come true, and Carter banned it by
                  executive order!<br>
                  <br>
                  He specifically stated that the burn down was so
                  complete that the spent fuel was safe to handle
                  directly with bare hands, and needed no special care
                  or maintenance at all, and after I questioned him
                  about exactly how safe, said you could safely sleep on
                  it. I questioned him several times, saying he must be
                  exaggerating, but he said ALL radiological potential
                  was used, and the fuel was completely inert at the end
                  of the final cycle.<br>
                  <br>
                  Many people know about the liquid sodium breeder
                  reactor developed by General Electric in the late
                  1970's but few people know the real story about this
                  reactor, which this engineer developed. To back stab
                  the public image of this reactor, it was stated that
                  it's rods would stick and that liquid sodium was too
                  dangerous to use as a coolant. But this engineer, the
                  man who developed it, stated that this media campaign
                  was a pure psy op which like many things the media and
                  government says had no truth to it at all...<br>
                  <br>
                  He then went on to lament about what a waste of money
                  it was to have the technology banned because nuclear
                  fuel is expensive and they were only able to use it to
                  about five percent of its total potential without
                  implementing this technology. He lamented the fact
                  that his life's greatest accomplishment got banned for
                  no good reason, and it was a tremendous waste of money
                  to not use the technology his team developed.
                  Electricity would have been cheap. So cheap that homes
                  would not have been heated with oil or natural gas,
                  electricity would have been the only sensible choice.
                  Furthermore, with a reduction in the price of
                  electricity by at least 10X, electric cars would have
                  quickly become a standard...<br>
                  <br>
                  So now, 40 years after the ban, America has fuel pools
                  around the country that are so full that they have
                  exceeded even the extremely generous safety margins
                  they were originally designed to have, and even modest
                  pools often have over 400 tons of highly active
                  isotope ridden "spent" fuel in them...<br>
                  <br>
                  How about that Deagel report? One way or another, they
                  are going to make it happen. And if compliance becomes
                  an issue, they are going to stuxnet torch off all
                  those fuel pools which absolutely will make the United
                  States permanently, irrevocably, a lethal wasteland. <br>

                  definitely will now. It will be posted later along
                  with that yelling British woman saying "He's not dead,
                  he was perfectly fine when the police took him a few
                  minutes ago!<br>
                  <br>
                  I think it is VERY SAFE to say that IF there is a
                  virus, the main cause of death "from the virus" is
                  politics. This is why China down played their numbers,
                  they knew the virus was not potent enough to justify
                  how many people they hauled off and incinerated.<br>
                  Remember that video where the people being taken
                  fought so hard and were in obvious perfect health?
                  THINK ABOUT IT.<br>
                  &nbsp;<br>
                  THEY ARE LYING ABOUT THE STATS. THERE PROBABLY ARE
                  VERY FEW (if any) "CORONAVIRUS DEATHS"<br>
                  Also, hospitaliations for "coronavirus" in New York
                  dropped enormously today, because rather than raid
                  another retirement community to murder it, all they
                  had available was the few people left from the last
                  raid they did. This is NOT BULLSHIT, SEE THIS,<br>

                  Countless doctors across the country are blowing the
                  whistle on "coronavirus deaths" and are stating that
                  if they don't log people as "dead from coronavirus"
                  even when they clearly did not die from the virus that
                  they face severe discipline. People that have
                  absolutely no need to be on a respirator are also
                  forced onto them because for a hospital admission FOR
                  CORONAVIRUS, (EVERY CASE) medicare automatically pays
                  $11,000 and when someone is put on a respirator,
                  Medicare automatically pays $39,000.<br>
                  <br>
                  So there's SERIOUS motivation for extreme hanky panky
                  with this, they are lying through their teeth with the
                  stats and people had damn well better take notice and
                  put this right. You can't believe stats AT ALL when
                  7,500 people die in the United States daily and there
                  are therefore LOTS of bodies to cheat the system with.
                  They can fake the "coronavirus" stats all they want

                    </b><br>
                    According to Michel Nostradamus, Mortara (in
                    northern Italy near Milan) will be struck by an
                    earthquake at Easter. England will half-sink in a
                    geological catastrophe -- perhaps a cometary
                    fragment impact?<br>
                    <br>
                    "The great Britain comprised England<br>
                    Will come by waters so high to be inundated<br>
                    The new league of Ausonia will make war<br>
                    That against them they will come to band." (C.3:70)<br>
                    <br>
                    Ausonia (near Naples) will become a center of
                    resistance against the Muslims. The sinking of
                    England (or the flooding of East Anglia at least)
                    may be caused by a great earthquake, possibly caused
                    by the impact of a comet:<br>
                    <br>
                    "The great round mountain of seven stades<br>
                    After peace, war, famine, flood<br>
                    It will roll far, sinking great countries<br>
                    Even the ancient ones, and of great foundation."
                    (C.1:69)<br>
                    <br>
                    A stade is a measure varying from about 607 to 739
                    feet; seven stades equals about 4250-5150 feet.
                    Conservatively interpreted, line 1 suggests that Mt.
                    Vesuvius, which is about that high, will erupt with
                    extreme violence. However, it is just as likely that
                    this is a warning that a comet will strike Earth.
                    Several other prophets also predicted a cometary
                    impact, i.e., Revelation 8: 8-11.<br>
                    <br>
                    "At the place where Jason had his ship built,<br>
                    There will be a flood so great and so sudden<br>
                    That one will have no place or land to fall upon,<br>
                    The waves to mount Olympian Fesulan." (C.8:16)<br>
                    <br>
                    Jason is he of Golden Fleece fame; Greece is
                    indicated here. "Fesulan" is one of Nostradamus'
                    many unsolved linguistic barbarisms, but probably
                    derives from Fesulae (now Fiesole) in central Italy,
                    which certainly would suffer also if such an
                    enormous catastrophe were to befall Greece. <br>

                          </b></b><b>...Hunger pains</b><br>
                        What does hunger do to you? Due to the ethical
                        quagmire of running experiments on this,
                        scientists have instead had to rely on the
                        experiences of those who have survived periods
                        of starvation and famine.<br>
                        <br>
                        “In the short term, there’s weight loss as you
                        metabolize your spare fat and muscle tissues,”
                        says Bradley Elliott, a physiologist at the
                        University of Westminster who studies the effect
                        of starvation in a man who went 50 days without
                        food. The human body is able to cope with
                        surprising levels of weight loss: as the body
                        loses 20% of its weight it consumes 50% less
                        energy. Body temperature drops, while lethargy
                        and apathy take hold as the body tries to
                        conserve what little energy it has. Eventually,
                        however, the organs themselves begin to waste,
                        all apart from the brain, which seems to be an
                        adaptation to protect it from famine.<br>
                        <br>
                        “Liver and kidney problems also seem to occur,”
                        says Elliot. “Blood pressure regulation is also
                        impaired, which means people can faint easily.”<br>
                        <br>
                        As the lack of minerals and vitamins take hold,
                        diseases like scurvy and pellagra emerge.
                        Children tend to be more vulnerable than adults,
                        quickly showing the signs of wasting and
                        succumbing to infectious diseases, according to
                        the World Food Programme’s Rita Bhatia when she
                        reported on the severe food shortages in North
                        Korea in the 1990s.<br>
                        <br>
                        Survival without food can depend on a person’s
                        body weight, how many calorific reserves they
                        have in their fat, and other health conditions
                        they may be suffering from. Women tend to be
                        more resilient than men. But in general, most
                        people will die if their body weight falls to
                        half of normal body mass index – which usually
                        occurs after 45-61 days without food.<br>
                        <br>
                        For those that survive, there can be lasting
                        impacts.<br>
                        <br>
                        Long term starvation can affect people’s height,
                        leading to stunting in populations who have
                        lived through famine and severe food shortages.
                        Those who were aged between one and three years
                        at the start of the Great Famine in China, which
                        saw up to 30 million people die between
                        1959-1961, were on average 2.1cm shorter as
                        adults than those who did not grow up during the
                        famine. They also had thinner arms, were 4.4%
                        lighter and on average achieve lower educational
                        attainment. Miscarriages among pregnant women go
                        up, too.<br>
                        <br>
                        ...Infants who survived the Ethiopian famine in
                        the mid-1980s were more likely to suffer illness
                        in adulthood, while other studies have shown a
                        long list of health issues, such as high blood
                        pressure, diabetes and heart disease are more
                        common in later life among children who live
                        through periods of starvation.<br>
                        <br>
                        But the impact of starvation goes beyond
                        physical health. During the Great Chinese
                        famine, labor fell by 25%, drastically affecting
                        the country’s economic output. Children who
                        survived the Ethiopian famine earned 3-8% less
                        per year over their lifetime than their
                        contemporaries.<br>
                        <br>
                        While these studies can provide some clues, they
                        fail to convey the agonizing, maddening pain of
                        real hunger.<br>
                        <br>
                        Oonagh Walsh, a professor of gender studies at
                        Glasgow Caledonian University, has found that
                        the number of people being committed to
                        psychiatric asylums rocketed during and
                        immediately after the Irish Famine between
                        1845-1851.<br>
                        <br>
                        “There was a huge rise in committals to asylums
                        from a population that was effectively halved
                        during this time,” she says. “Some of these
                        might be people seeking a decent meal they know
                        they will get at an asylum, but there was also a
                        shift in the way people thought.<br>
                        <br>
                        “People quickly became very fatalistic. The
                        famine was worst on the west coast where they
                        have access to the sea and fish. It doesn’t make
                        sense until you realise that people had sold
                        everything they had, including their nets and
                        boats. The starving population resorted to
                        trying to trap birds, eating grass, weeds, and
                        straw.”<br>

                  </div>
                  Humanity is not a virus. Covid-19 is an attack on
                  humanity. Everyone in America can test positive for
                  Covid-19 assuming they have an immune system. What
                  they're calling a test is not a test - its a scarlet
                  letter. The coronavirus is the body's exosomes. These
                  are secreted by the cells under numerous conditions.
                  Duke-trained Doctor Andrew Kaufman explains it all in
                  a concise 30-minute presentation. <b><br>

                  </b>Do you suffer from chronic lung congestion? Has
                  Bronchial Hygiene Therapy (BHT) been recommended to
                  you?<br>
                  <br>
                  Now, thanks to the Lung Flute, you can breathe easier.<br>
                  <br>
                  The Lung Flute is indicated for Positive Expiratory
                  Pressure therapy, which is an important part of BHT.
                  BHT can be used for a variety for congestive
                  conditions such as: COPD, bronchitis, pneumonia,
                  asthma, emphysema or other chronic respiratory
                  ailments.<br>
                  <br>
                  When you endure lung congestion with thick, chronic
                  mucus that is difficult to break up, breathing can be
                  a constant struggle. You may have to rely on
                  medications, inhalers, oxygen therapy or even surgery
                  to open up your airways. Everyday activities can
                  become an effort.<br>
                  <br>
                  The Lung Flute from Medical Acoustics can help.<br>
                  <br>
                  The FDA-cleared Lung Flute is the only product that
                  uses sound vibration to stimulate your body's natural
                  mucus-clearing system – effectively thinning and
                  dislodging mucus deep in the lungs so that it's easier
                  to cough up. The small, reusable, plastic device is
                  non-invasive, easy to use and drug-free – just blow
                  into the mouthpiece and the device will do the rest.<br>
                  <br>
                  Clinical tests have proven the Lung Flute's ability to
                  break up mucus in the lungs, making it equally
                  effective for both therapeutic and diagnostic use.
                  Unlike other devices, which rely on pressure and can't
                  reach deep lung mucus, the Lung Flute's technology is
                  based on low-frequency acoustic waves that are
                  produced when you blow into the flute-shaped device.<b><br>

                  <b><br>
                  </b>The invention relates to the field of preventive
                  or curative control against diseases of viral origin
                  in humans or animals.<br>
                  <br>
                  The virulicidal properties of certain metal salts,
                  such as zinc or lithium salts, are already known.<br>
                  <br>
                  Thus the publication "Effect of Zinc Ions on the
                  Synthesis of Herpes Simplex Virus DNA in infected
                  BSC-1 cells", virology 66, p. 330-335, 1975, Academic

                  UDY OLSHEVSKY and YECHIEL BECKER, describes the
                  antiviral action of zinc sulfate against cells
                  infected with the Herpes Simplex DNA virus.<br>
                  <br>
                  Also, the publication "Zinc Salts that may be
                  effective against the AIDS Virus HIV", Medical
                  Hypotheses 1988, 26, 251-253, Longman Group, W.
                  SERGIO, teaches that zinc, a broad-spectrum
                  virulicide, could be considered to combat AIDS.<br>
                  <br>
                  Nevertheless, it appeared that the high toxicity of
                  zinc salts at the doses in which they are active
                  against viruses does not allow their administration to
                  be considered in general for humans or animals. As a
                  result, the use of zinc salts generally against AIDS
                  or other viral infections has not been able to be
                  implemented since this publication...<br>
                  <br>
                  According to the invention, the metal is zinc and / or
                  lithium, known for their virulicidal properties, and
                  compatible with ascorbic acid. It has indeed been able
                  to demonstrate, surprisingly, that metals in the form
                  of ascorbate have an extremely low toxicity at doses
                  where they nevertheless have sufficient virulicidal
                  power, in particular within the meaning of the AFNOR
                  standard. Thus, ascorbate is a vector of metals in
                  general administration. And more particularly, zinc
                  ascorbate achieves a compromise which makes it
                  possible to envisage background treatments with zinc
                  salts, generally and at doses where these salts are
                  certainly virulicidal.<br>
                  <br>
                  According to the invention, in the case of zinc,
                  proportions of zinc ascorbate are used in the
                  pharmaceutical form of the composition so that the
                  blood concentration resulting after the general
                  administration is greater than 0.125 g / l, the upper
                  limit being fixed by the toxicity of zinc ascorbate.
                  Indeed, for this value, we see that the virulicidal
                  power of zinc ascorbate is total without any side or
                  toxic effect.<br>
                  <br>
                  According to the invention, in the case of lithium,
                  proportions of lithium ascorbate are used in the
                  dosage form of the composition so that the resulting
                  blood concentration is greater than 2 g / l, in
                  particular of the order of 3 g / l...<br>
                  <br>
                  XAMPLE NO 1: Zinc ascorbate was prepared by
                  salification between ascorbic acid and zinc oxide in
                  proportions of 2 moles of acid per 1 mole of oxide. 35
                  parts of ascorbic acid (2 M) are dissolved in 150
                  parts of water. 8 parts of zinc oxide (1 M) are added
                  when cold (between 0 ° C. and 300 ° C.) and away from
                  light, as its solubility is carried out, with
                  continuous stirring. The liquor obtained is
                  orange-yellow and has a pH of 4.6. The liquor is then
                  evaporated under vacuum between 400 C and 600 C to
                  obtain a light yellow powder having a molecular weight
                  of 415.61.<br>
                  <br>
                  EXAMPLE NO 2: Lithium ascorbate was prepared by the
                  action of ascorbic acid on lithium carbonate in an
                  aqueous medium protected from light. 10 parts of
                  ascorbic acid are dissolved in 50 parts of cold
                  distilled water. With stirring, 2.1 parts of lithium
                  carbonate are gradually added. After the end of the
                  reaction, the mixture is left in contact for 12 hours.
                  Evaporated under vacuum between 400 C and 600 C. An
                  orange-yellow residue of lithium ascorbate is
                  obtained...<br>
                  <br>
                  The lethal dose 50 (LD 50) was determined according to
                  the BEHRENS and KARBER method according to the
                  following formula: LD 50 = DmM - zaxb / n, where DmM
                  is the minimum lethal dose, at the average difference
                  between two successive doses, b the average number of
                  deaths at two successive doses, n the number of
                  experimental animals per batch.<br>
                  <br>
                  5 male and 5 female rats were used. The first case of
                  mortality occurred at a dose of 3 g / kg in a female
                  rat. At 4g / kg one male and 4 females died, and at 6g
                  / kg all of the rats died.<br>
                  As a result, the LD 50 for oral zinc ascorbate is 4.7
                  g / kg in the male rat and 3.6 g / kg in the female
                  rat....<br>
                  <br>
                  At 1,000 mg / kg, all animals remained alive<br>

                  The advantage of this method is the pronounced
                  odontotropic effect of the paste (i.e., the ability to
                  stimulate the formation of a substitute dentin), as
                  well as its antibacterial activity, but using this
                  method requires two visits to the dentist, which
                  lengthens the treatment period, in addition, eugenol
                  can cause an allergic reaction from the side of the
                  pulp and has an unpleasant odor. Zinc-eugenol paste is

                  [0013] Stop the growth of pathogenic microflora due to
                  the properties of chitosan agglutinate microbial
                  bodies. The mechanism of agglutination is identical to
                  the adhesion of erythrocytes polycations. The
                  universal mechanism of selective binding of chitosan
                  to polysaccharide receptors on the cell membrane of a
                  bacterial cell provides a bacteriostatic effect on
                  virtually any type of microbes. Chitosan induces the
                  binding of free microbial toxins (Bolshakov IN
                  Extracorporeal and corporal immunoaffinity sorption in
                  experimental diffuse acute peritonitis., Author's Diss
                  .. - dmn - Moscow, 2002). Strengthening the
                  antimicrobial effect of chitosan is achieved by
                  combining it with ascorbic acid by attaching an
                  additional hydrogen proton to the chitosan molecule.
                  The use of paste based on chitosan ascorbate in the
                  treatment of deep caries provides, along with
                  anti-inflammatory and bactericidal action, an
                  odontotropic effect on the pulp, resulting in the
                  deposition of a significant layer of substitute dentin
                  at the bottom of the carious cavity, which reliably
                  isolates the tooth pulp from the effects of

                  weight of 100-120 kD, zinc oxide is added in a ratio

                  treatment with 0.06% solution of chlorhexidine

                      Electrostatic Antiviral Masks: What Are Their
                      Advantages Over N95 Masks?</b><br>
                  </div>
                  <b><br>
                  </b>...The School of Mechanical and Electrical
                  Engineering at the Xi'an University of Electronic
                  Science and Technology has developed an “electrostatic
                  antiviral mask” with a special “air purifier”.
                  Associate Professor Tong Xufeng has shared information
                  about the advantages of the new mask compared to the
                  standard N95 mask.<br>
                  <br>
                  He said that viruses can’t survive in the air alone:
                  &#8203;&#8203;they spread mainly by attaching themselves to
                  particles. Therefore, the virus first needs to cling
                  to something. The diameter of such particles is
                  usually less than PM 2.5, about 1 micron.<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The advantage of the new mask is
                  mainly that it can filter out particles with a
                  diameter of less than 1 micrometre. Having absorbed
                  these particles, the mask uses rays and high-voltage
                  fields to kill viral organisms. If you use
                  conventional masks that filter PM 2.5, they don’t
                  filter out particles smaller than 2.5 microns"...<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ave increased the radiation power
                  of the original masks. The high voltage created by
                  first-generation electronic masks is more than 3000
                  volts; we have increased it by another 1000 volts.
                  Usually, ozone appears under high voltage. Its smell
                  is very unpleasant, but our new electronic masks
                  filter out ozone. Moreover, we guarantee that the
                  mask’s high voltage is not harmful for people. We take
                  this very seriously".<br>
                  <br>
                  The new masks are expected to enter the market in
                  about two months. Tong Xufeng said that they have
                  already applied to the relevant departments to certify
                  the new antiviral mask and are currently awaiting
                  verification and approval. At the same time, mass
                  production of the masks is being prepared.<br>

              <br>
              An infectious disease breaks out in a densely populated
              metropolis and is spreading rapidly, causing respiratory
              failure and death in its victims. As local containment and
              response mechanisms break down and cases multiply, it
              becomes clear that a global response -- spanning
              governments, humanitarian organizations, health agencies
              and the military -- will be required.<br>
              <br>
              That scenario is not a condensed narrative of the COVID-19
              pandemic that currently has much of the globe on lockdown.
              Rather, it's the premise of a war game run last September
              by the Naval War College (NWC) in Newport, Rhode Island.
              And its findings -- released in summary format Wednesday
              -- reveal prescient and sometimes troubling parallels to
              the real-world response effort that continues today...<br>

              the disease’s body count.<br>
              <br>
              Now that New York has become the epicenter of the pandemic
              in the United States, we are now regularly inundated on
              cable TV news with the latest pandemic statistics from the
              city. The statistics grow gloomier by the hour.<br>
              <br>
              These figures have frightened people into submission as
              state and local governments across America enact
              repressive measures they say are necessary to contain the
              virus or slow its proliferation.<br>
              <br>
              After doing everything in their power to oust President
              Donald Trump, journalists and others are now calling him a
              weakling for supposedly not doing enough, while they
              demand an unprecedented nationwide crackdown.<br>
              <br>
              he problem starts with the fact that the highly
              influential statistics from the Big Apple paint a false
              picture of what is actually happening.<br>
              <br>
              In New York City, the death of anyone who dies who tests
              positive for COVID-19 is counted as a coronavirus death.
              This is the case even if the coronavirus failed to play a
              significant role in the person’s passing or illness.<br>
              <br>
              New York City’s government isn’t the only one worldwide
              doing this.<br>
              <br>
              In an open letter to Angela Merkel, the chancellor of
              Germany, Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi, Professor Emeritus of
              Medical Microbiology at the Johannes Gutenberg University
              of Mainz, wrote:<br>
              <br>
              “[T]he mistake is being made worldwide to report
              virus-related deaths as soon as it is established that the
              virus was present at the time of death – regardless of
              other factors. This violates a basic principle of
              infectiology: only when it is certain that an agent has
              played a significant role in the disease or death may a
              diagnosis be made.”<br>
              <br>
              Infectiology, also known as infectology, is “a branch of
              medicine that deals with the diagnosis, management and
              treatment of various infectious or contagious diseases,”
              according to Medihub.<br>
              <br>
              Why do the rules of infectiology not apply to the Chinese
              virus?<br>

                  COVID-19 Deaths Have Gone Uncounted In The US: Live
                  Updates</b><br>
              </div>
              <br>
              Two reporters from the New York Times purport to have
              found evidence that health officials, often at the local
              or county level, are dramatically undercounting
              coronavirus deaths in the US. Citing information and
              documents provided by "doctors, hospital officials, public
              health experts and medical examiners," among others, the
              reporters claim that potentially thousands of deaths have
              gone uncounted, meaning the total is probably closer to
              20k - or beyond - than the roughly 10k (9,180, per JHU)
              reported so far.<br>
              <br>
              Unfortunately, since the patients have died, there will be
              few - if any - opportunities for these discrepancies to be
              rectified, if coronavirus isn't listed as a cause of
              death, something that requires a positive test.<br>
              <br>
              Given the shortage of tests around the US, living patients
              have typically been prioritized over the deceased, even as
              counting posthumous deaths is important in helping
              officials get the accurate data they need to fight the
              virus...<br>

                <b>By Yoichi Shimatsu</b><br>
                <br>
              </div>
              <b> </b>The craving for sugar, carbs in cake and donuts,
              most fruit and super-sweet GM corn, soft drinks, pizza and
              sushi is the slippery slope down to illness, disease,
              death and, worse, weakness of spirit and mental loss of
              direction. So-called "healthy" salads and vegan diets
              input hordes of microorganisms and zoonotic viruses into
              the gut. As shown in a new study out of China discloses
              that COVID-19 patients show an extremely low level of
              cholesterol inside their arteries. The deficiency is
              partly due to viral infection of the liver, which ceases
              processing fatty oils, but also can be attributed in part
              to inadequate consumption of animal fats due to the
              two-year Swine Flu pandemic that killed off the national
              hog herd. Skyrocketing prices for imported pork and beef
              reduced meat in the Chinese diet. Inadequate diet weakens
              the human immune system.<br>
              <br>
              If vegan theory was really accurate, then a reduction of
              meat consumption should have boosted Chinese health
              instead of the actual outcome of lowering immunity to
              coronvirus and flu. A daily diet of beef kept me going in
              Beijing during the unprecedented summer flu in mid-2019,
              which shut down swathes of the capital. I was there to
              video a conference on Buddhist history, carrying a heavy
              camera and big tripod for miles in intense heat and
              shooting in crowded lecture halls and rode subways but was
              not infected. Eating beef for dinner every evening and
              drinking red wine for medicinal purposes allowed me to
              sleep without fidgeting as my nutrition-boosted antibodies
              wiped out any trace of the human version of swine flu, a
              contagion unreported by a news media fixated on carbon
              emissions.<br>
              <b><br>
                The beauty of fat<br>
              </b>Cholesterol from animal fat protects arteries, thereby
              blocking viruses from penetrating into the lungs and other
              vital organs, while alcohol is an excellent internal
              disinfectant. Ancient dietary wisdom ensures health as
              opposed to the crank theories of nonsensical weight-loss
              diets that promote anorexia, which is the sure formula for
              fashionistas and models to have zero resistance to STDs
              (as compared with Kenyan sex workers) and going downhill
              with cocaine inhalation inside crowded discos. Coronavirus
              is merely the last thrill. The bubble-butt types,
              meanwhile, seem to be in good spirits as opposed to those
              grim stick figures.<br>
              <br>
              The ideal is to be moderately lean but not overweight. The
              beef revival is due to a reduction of steroids and
              antibiotics in cattle over the recent two decades, making
              red meat especially from free-range steers the nutritious
              choice once again, as during my boyhood in Kobe, the world
              capital of marbled steak, or way back in the cowboy days
              as in Wichita and Dodge City. So I'll let you in on a
              secret.<br>
              <br>
              When I was doing ecological consulting on the Tibetan
              grasslands, helping local herders who produced yak milk to
              preserve their mix of wild vegetation in the mountain
              meadows, an organic herding expert from Switzerland came
              over to advise our project. His most insightful comment
              was that the grass diet bolsters ruminants with vitamin A,
              which is why they don't need a lot of drugs or
              supplements. The positive effect of A on vision is
              established, but lesser known is how A stimulates collagen
              growth. This means beef-eating, especially the gristle as
              in the knuckles, makes for stronger artery walls and also
              helps protect your immune-response function in the
              subcutaneous "fat" immediately below the skin, the largest
              organ of the human body. Gnawing on a hundred carrots is
              not going to equal a pound of fatty beef.<br>
              <br>
              It would unethical not to warn about steak broiled rare.
              Bovine tuberculosis cells can nestle undetected in the
              folds of cattle brains, so beef should be heated to a
              minimal medium or slightly well done to prevent infection
              as in sirloin rare, which has led to an entire generation
              of business executives suffering "dementia" and
              "Altzheimer's".<br>
              <br>
              To avert medication with statins, it's important to eat
              the right kind of fat. Grain-fed cattle in feed lots tend
              to have more "soft" cholesterol inside the hard fat (the
              terms are confusing). It's best even in range steer meat
              to eat the soft fat (with "hard" cholesterol) and toss
              away the harder pieces of fat. In pork, it can be the
              opposite, since the dense subcutaneous layer next to the
              skin is excellent for vitality, whereas the greasy soft
              fat is ruinous to your waistline. Know the difference
              between good fats and fat cats, the latter like that
              ambition-oozing ignoramus Andrew Cuomo who came out
              against GM mass-production of ventilators, which is the
              starting line for national re-industrialization plus
              needed help for CoV patients. The comedian governor should
              stick to solving the in-fighting between residents and
              vacation-home owners up in the Borscht Belt in the
              Catskills...<br>
              <b><br>
                The serum trade<br>
              </b>Blood serum from "recovered" CoV patients provides the
              antibodies used in test kits, before cloned sequences are
              available from biotech labs. Over a relatively short time
              serum tends to oxidize and biochemically deteriorate. In
              the specific case of COVID-19, many of the so-called
              recoveries are probably due to failure of viral
              replication, caused by cumbersome strands of HIV and
              m.Tuberculosis complicating transcription. This means that
              many patient recoveries are due to malfunction of viral
              replication and not the result of interception by
              antibodies. As a consequence, blood serum from many, and
              possible most patients is ineffective as a treatment for
              new cases of infection.<br>
              <br>
              This flaw in an over-engineered virus, which is difficult
              to replicate, accounts for the lack of antibody response
              in Chinese-made test kits, which are therefore
              fundamentally flawed. The Netherlands has returned more
              than 600,000 test kits to Chinese manufacturers. Spain,
              Chile, Ukraine, Czech Republic and Turkey have all found
              Made in China test kits to be defective.<br>
              <br>
              The absence of antibodies also raises a medical-ethics
              issue regarding illegal sales of blood serum, as a bootleg
              "cure", being sold at high price by the Chinese mafia to
              the rich and famous, including Wall Street bankers via
              their Jewish physicians, Hollywood celebrities and top
              government officials and politicians. How are you feeling,
              Nancy? This underground trafficking in blood serum, a type
              of vampirism, is unverifiable to whether the "donor" is a
              recovered patient or an infection-killed corpse. Given the
              history of infectious diseases in China, there is no way
              of determining the presence of other viruses in the mix,
              for example HIV, since that is a component of COVID-19.
              The near-total absence of medical ethics in the American
              privatized health system is a hornet's nest of fraud,
              deception, misdiagnosis and utter lack of accountability
              along with insurance fraud. It is simply impossible for
              HHS or the CDC to track, much less probe this Pandora's
              box of medical abuse and pharmacological criminality. The
              only alternative is entrapment of dealers by law
              enforcement agencies.<br>
              <br>
              Adding injury to insult against their own people,
              high-level authorities in China are permitting the export
              of blood serum from CoV patients, as they still do for
              opioids. The sharp decline in COV cases to near zero
              indicates the disappearance of many patients who seem to
              have vanished into thin air. In standard practice, it
              takes the blood from nine (9) patients to fill a tiny vial
              with serum. Therefore the large volume of serum on the
              global black markets means that countless patients are
              being drained of all their blood to supply the
              cannibalistic cravings of the global elite. Given the
              extent of censorship in China, these illegal sales of
              human-harvested products must have official sanction, as
              in the organ-harvesting trade.<br>
              <br>
              Buyer beware, since the anti-CoV serum has no credible
              guarantee of being free of HIV or clear of other
              pathogens, no verification of authenticity from an actual
              CoV donor, no proper registration or tracing system, or
              even proof it's not just water or urine. The risks are
              enormous and the price is high. In addition, the
              shelf-life of human serum is extremely short due to
              decomposition.<br>
              <br>
              How extensive is the problem of medical abuse in the serum
              trade? A estimated 5 million residents are missing from
              Wuhan, and the disconnection of more than 22 million smart
              phones over the past two months indicates "the killing
              fields" under an untrustworthy absolutist regime, where
              the elite and medical profession maintain a conspiracy of
              silence about the hidden blood bath. China's civilization
              is a universe of glory and ethical propriety, but Chinese
              politics is a pit of murder and deception. The coronavirus
              outbreak could not have happened in a worse place, and the
              Japanese-British-Israeli perpetrators of biological
              warfare against Wuhan were well aware of this fact...<br>

              <div align="center"><b>THE WIFI KILLSHOT by J.E. Ante</b><br>
              </div>
              <b><br>
              </b>5G at 60Ghz resonates with the oxygen molecule and
              gives oxygen a reverse polarity that makes it much less
              usable to the human body. At high concentrations of 5G
              usage you get suffocation of humans at street level. And
              at lower doses you get flu like symptoms which are the
              exact same symptoms as the flu with this lowered oxygen
              uptake by the body. But the way 5G kills is much more
              interesting.<br>
              <br>
              Our bodies have trillions of parasitic organisms inside
              which feed on us and some say help us live by doing many
              useful functions. But when these bacteria, fungi, and
              parasites are subjected to any WIFI microwave radiations
              they are harmed and begin reproducing toxins in self
              defense. These organisms begin reproducing rapidly to
              ensure their survival. And so we get flu like symptoms
              from these internal parasite organisms under attack from
              WIFI microwave radiations reproducing rapidly and
              excreting toxins. This is the real illness people are
              getting not a bio-weapon coronavirus.<br>
              <br>
              2G has ten microwave frequencies assigned to it, 3G has
              ten also, 4G has five frequencies with some overlaps, but
              5G has 3000 microwave frequencies assigned to it by the
              FCC. Why so many? So 5G should really be called 297G not
              5G. So with this 5G rollout in China, Korea, Italy, Iran,
              and cruise ships we have the greatest concentrations of 5G
              usage and the greatest concentrations of illness and death
              in the world. Our internal parasites are like canaries in
              a mine and are being killed off rapidly from this 5G
              usage. When this happens too quickly the body can not get
              rid of the increased toxins and the host (you) die from
              toxemia. Our human cells are all tied together and form a
              much stronger union but our many parasitic hosts inside us
              are much more isolated within us and much more vulnerable
              to this WIFI microwave radiations. They try to survive by
              multiplying rapidly and making toxins to protect them from
              harm but it is no use and they die with 5G. And with their
              rapid death our bodies (at least of older and less healthy
              human) are overwhelmed by toxins very quickly and die from
              the combined effects of lowered oxygen uptake from 5G, and
              also from the massive overpopulation, and then die off of
              our internal biomass of germs and parasites, which creates
              overwhelming toxemia.<br>
              When the Chinese locked down the people in Wuhan they
              turned to their new 5G phones and internet connections and
              so the city was flooded with much more 5G WIFI radiations
              and made many more people fall sick and die. Many people
              even fell sick instantly at street level from oxygen
              deficiency which previously had no sickness. A massive
              cloud of 5G 60Ghz microwave radiations caused oxygen in
              the air to fall below critical levels for survival.<br>
              Yesterday all of Asia turned off their 5G and left on only
              their 3G and 4G systems to communicate so they know 5G is
              the real cause of the illnesses.<br>
              <br>
              Yesterday all of Asia turned off their 5G and left on only
              their 3G and 4G systems to communicate so they know 5G is
              the real cause of the illnesses.<br>
              <br>
              So turn off your smartphones or put them in an aluminum
              pouch until you need to use them to lessen radiation
              exposure to yourself and everyone else.<br>
              <br>
              That is the real thing you must do instead of washing your
              hands to protect others.<br>
              And if you would heal your elderly and grand parents put
              them in a Faraday cage where they will not be irradiated
              constantly by WIFI signals that are all around us
              especially in hospitals. Then their sick bodies may heal
              themselves in time as the toxemia clears from their
              bodies.<br>

              </div>
              <br>
              Back in February, a news article was published in China,
              within which can be found the following amazing statement:<br>
              <br>
              “Hydroxychloroquine is a mature immunosuppressive agent
              for clinical application. It also has anti-inflammatory,
              anti-infective, anti-viral, optical filter, anticoagulant
              effects, and has fewer adverse reactions. It is also a
              basic drug for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
              The research team conducted a clinical analysis of 178
              neocoronavirus patients admitted to the hospital from
              December 2019 and found that none of them were patients
              with systemic lupus erythematosus. Later, in consultation
              with 80 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus treated
              in the dermatology department of the hospital, they were
              found not to be infected with neocoronavirus pneumonia...<br>
              <br>
              “The identification of this new mechanism of action of CLQ
              and CLQ-OH supports the use of these repositioned drugs to
              *CURE* SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and stop the
              pandemic.”<b><br>

                <br>
              </b>After doing additional scientific research into this
              subject, it seems to me that the severity of COVID-19
              contagion in any particular person may be largely
              dependent on nitric oxide bioavailability in that person.
              Moreover, there is reason to believe that certain
              micronutrient deficiencies, such as with selenium, can
              result in increased COVID-19 disease severity that goes
              beyond what you might associate with sub-optimal nitric
              oxide bioavailability.<br>

          <div align="center">
            <div align="left">A NYC physician named Cameron Kyle-Sidell
              has posted two videos on YouTube, pleading for health
              practitioners to recognize that COVID-19 is not a
              pneumonia-like disease at all. It’s an oxygen deprivation
              condition, and the use of ventilators may be doing more
              harm than good with some patients. The ventilators
              themselves, due to the high-pressure methods they are
              running, may be damaging the lungs and leading to
              widespread harm of patients.<br>
              <br>
              Dr. Cameron Kyle-Sidell describes himself as an “ER and
              critical care doctor” for NYC. “In these nine days I have
              seen things I have never seen before,” he says. Before
              publishing his video, we confirmed that Dr. Kyle-Sidell is
              an emergency medicine physician in Brooklyn and is
              affiliated with the Maimonides Medical Center located in
              Brooklyn.<br>
              <br>
              In his video (see below), he goes on to warn the world
              that the entire approach to treating COVID-19 may be
              incorrect, and that the disease is something completely
              different from what the dogmatic medical establishment is
              claiming.<br>
              <br>
              “In treating these patients, I have witnessed medical
              phenomena that just don’t make sense in the context of
              treating a disease that is supposed to be a viral
              pneumonia,” he explains.<br>
              <br>
              He talks about how he opened a critical care using
              expecting to be treating patients with a viral pneumonia
              infection that would progress into Acute Respiratory
              Distress Syndrome (ARDS). But that the disease acted
              nothing like ARDS. “This is the paradigm that every
              hospital in the country is working under,” he warns. “And
              yet, everything I’ve seen in the last nine days, all the
              things that just don’t make sense, the patients I’m seeing
              in front of me, the lungs I’m trying to improve, have led
              me to believe that COVID-19 is not this disease, and that
              we are operating under a medical paradigm that is untrue.”<br>
              <br>
              More from Dr. Kyle-Sidell: (emphasis added)<br>
              <br>
              In short, I believe we are treating the wrong disease, and
              I fear that this misguided treatment will lead to a
              tremendous amount of harm to a great number of people in a
              very short time… I feel compelled to give this information
              out.<br>
              <br>
              COVID-19 lung disease, as far as I can see, is not a
              pneumonia and should not be treated as one. Rather, it
              appears as if some kind of viral-induced disease most
              resembling high altitude sickness. Is it as if tens of
              thousands of my fellow New Yorkers are on a plane at
              30,000 feet at the cabin pressure is slowly being let out.
              These patients are slowly being starved of oxygen.<br>
              <br>
              And while [patients] absolutely look like patients on the
              brink of death, they do not look like patients dying from
              pneumonia… I suspect that the patients I’m seeing in front
              of me, look as if a person was dropped off on the top of
              Mt. Everest without time to acclimate.<br>
              <br>
              He goes on to explain that ventilators, in some cases, may
              be doing far more harm than good.<br>
              <br>
              When we treat people with ARDS, we typically use
              ventilators to treat respiratory failure. But these
              patients’ muscles work fine. I fear that if we are using a
              false paradigm to treat a new disease, then the method
              that we program [into] the ventilator, one based on
              respiratory failure as opposed to oxygen failure, that
              this method being widely adopted … aims to increase
              pressure on the lungs in order to open them up, is
              actually doing more harm than good, and that the pressure
              we are providing to lungs, we may be providing to lungs
              that cannot take it. And that the ARDS that we are seeing,
              may be nothing more than lung injury caused by the
              ventilator.<br>
              <br>
              There are hundreds of thousands of lungs in this country
              at risk.<br>
              <br>
              In other words, the real disease appears to cause oxygen
              deprivation in victims, not pneumonia. This is critically
              important for all the obvious reasons, and it raises huge
              questions about the origins of the coronavirus and whether
              there is some additional external factor beyond the virus
              that may be causing a combined effect that results in
              severe oxygen deprivation.<br>

              Zinc oxide quantum dot nanoparticles absorb UV light but
              are optically transparent making them useful as the active
              ingredient of sunscreens. The absorption wavelength is a
              function of particle size when the particles are small.
              This synthesis involves particle growth at 65°C; samples
              removed at longer times give larger particles. The cut-off
              wavelength from the absorption spectra can be used to
              estimate the particle size.<br>
              <b>Procedure:</b><br>
              Step 1.Begin heating a large beaker of water to 65°C.<br>
              Step 2. Meanwhile, dissolve 0.10 g Zn(CH3CO2)2.H2O in 25
              mL isopropanol with heating in a fume hood. (The actual
              elapsed time shown in the movie is about 15 minutes.)<br>
              Step 3. Meanwhile, prepare an ice bath by adding water to
              ice. Place 125 mL isopropanol in a flask and chill the
              flask in the ice bath.<br>
              Step 4. When the zinc acetate solid has all dissolved, add
              that solution to the 125 mL of chilled isopropanol. Also
              obtain 15 mL of 0.050 M NaOH in isopropanol and chill the
              solution. (A stock solution may already be chilled. See
              below.)<br>
              Step 5. Slowly transfer the chilled NaOH solution to the
              chilled and rapidly stirring zinc acetate solution using a
              pasteur pipet.<br>
              Step 6. Place the flask with the mixed solution in the
              65°C water bath and start taking samples immediately.
              Record the UV spectra of each sample.<br>

                  <b>Abstract</b><br>
                  Many viruses require reduced sulfhydryl groups for
                  cell fusion and entry. Corona viruses, including
                  SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of the condition now named
                  coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19), are rich in
                  cysteine, which residues must be intact for viral
                  activity. Sulfhydryl groups are vulnerable to
                  oxidation. Ozone therapy, a very inexpensive and safe
                  modality may safely exploit this critical
                  vulnerability in many viruses, inclusive of
                  SARS-CoV-2.,,<br>
                  <b>Conclusion</b><br>
                  The world already has a most inexpensive, safe, and
                  likely effective remedy for deadly viral diseases,
                  which exploits their redox vulnerability at critical
                  membrane cysteine/tryptophan fusion sites. Ozone
                  therapy could be easily deployed worldwide, even in
                  very poor countries. With few conventional treatments
                  for viral pneumonia, this epidemic could provide
                  impetus to study ozone therapy very ethically under
                  the auspices of an institution's review board in
                  treating, with ozone therapy, seriously ill patients,
                  who might otherwise expire. Milder cases could also be
                  treated to study the ability of ozone therapy to slow
                  or halt clinical deterioration. Such study could bring
                  ozone therapy to the forefront of all-around
                  infectious disease management, providing answers to
                  our growing problems with resistant infection.
                  Governments should take notice. <br>

                </b></div>
              TEHRAN (Tasnim) – A team of European scientists may have
              found a unique solution to the plastic problem by
              discovering a common insect that can chew sizable holes in
              a plastic shopping bag within 40 minutes. <br>
              <br>
              A study by Brandon University in Manitoba, Canada, has
              found that waxworms, which normally live in beehives and
              eat wax, also can survive on polyethylene—the kind of
              plastic used in shopping bags and elsewhere.<br>
              <br>
              They owe this ability to their intestinal microbes, and
              excrete glycol after they’ve finished a meal of plastics.
              Scientists say they’re not sure yet what this glycol, a

              In the lab, 60 of the “mysterious” waxworms were able to
              eat more than 30 square centimeters of a plastic bag in
              less than a week, the researchers report....<br>

              Waxworms are the caterpillar larvae of the greater wax
              moth; the moths don’t eat a thing after they emerge from
              cocoons. “They are voracious feeders during the larval
              stages in order to build up enough nutrient reserves to
              subsist as adults,” Cassone says. “As adults, their main
              purpose is to reproduce and they only live a few days.”<br>
              <br>
              The Brandon researchers found that the worms can survive
              on a sole diet of polyethylene. And eating that much
              plastic increased the microbes in their guts, suggesting
              that the bacteria love to digest plastic. The researchers
              have even dubbed the worms as “plastivores.”...<br>

              <div align="center"><b>&nbsp;Hundreds of Chrome Extensions
                  Found Secretly Uploading Millions of Private User Data</b><br>
              </div>
              <br>
              TEHRAN (Tasnim) - A group of researchers have found that
              more than 500 browser extensions downloaded millions of
              times from Google’s Chrome Web Store surreptitiously
              uploaded private browsing data to attacker-controlled
              servers. <br>
              <br>
              The extensions were part of a long-running malvertising
              and ad-fraud scheme that was discovered by independent
              researcher Jamila Kaya. She and researchers from
              Cisco-owned Duo Security eventually identified 71 Chrome
              Web Store extensions that had more than 1.7 million
              installations. After the researchers privately reported
              their findings to Google, the company identified more than
              430 additional extensions. Google has since removed all
              known extensions.<br>
              <br>
              “In the case reported here, the Chrome extension creators
              had specifically made extensions that obfuscated the
              underlying advertising functionality from users,” Kaya and
              Duo Security Jacob Rickerd wrote in a report, Ars Technica
              reported.<br>
              <br>
              “This was done in order to connect the browser clients to
              a command and control architecture, exfiltrate private
              browsing data without the users’ knowledge, expose the
              user to risk of exploit through advertising streams, and
              attempt to evade the Chrome Web Store’s fraud detection
              mechanisms.”<br>
              <br>
              <b>A maze of redirects, malware, and more</b><br>
              The extensions were mostly presented as tools that
              provided various promotion- and advertising-as-a service
              utilities. In fact, they engaged in ad fraud and
              malvertising by shuffling infected browsers through a maze
              of sketchy domains. Each plugin first connected to a
              domain that used the same name as the plugin (e.g.:
              Mapstrek[.]com or ArcadeYum[.]com) to check for
              instructions on whether to uninstall themselves.<br>
              <br>
              The plugins then redirected browsers to one of a handful
              of hard-coded control servers to receive additional
              instructions, locations to upload data, advertisement feed
              lists, and domains for future redirects. Infected browsers
              then uploaded user data, updated plugin configurations,
              and flowed through a stream of site redirections.<br>
              <br>
              Thursday’s report continued: "The user regularly receives
              new redirector domains, as they are created in batches,
              with multiple of the earlier domains being created on the
              same day and hour. They all operate in the same way,
              receiving the signal from the host and then sending them
              to a series of ad streams, and subsequently to legitimate
              and illegitimate ads. Some of these are listed in the “End
              domains” section of the IOCs, though they are too numerous
              to list."<br>
              <br>
              Many of the redirections led to benign ads for products
              from Macy’s, Dell, and Best Buy. What made the scheme
              malicious and fraudulent was the (a) the large volume of
              ad content (as many as 30 redirects in some cases), (b)
              the deliberate concealment of most ads from end users, and
              (c) the use of the ad redirect streams to send infected
              browsers to malware and phishing sites. Two malware
              samples tied to the plugin sites were:<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ARCADEYUMGAMES.exe, which reads
              terminal service related keys and accesses potentially
              sensitive information from local browsers, and<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MapsTrek.exe, which has the ability to
              open the clipboard<br>
              <br>
              All but one of the sites used in the scheme weren’t
              previously categorized as malicious or fraudulent by
              threat intelligence services. The exception was the state
              of Missouri, which listed DTSINCE[.]com, one of the
              handful of hard-coded control servers, as a phishing site.<br>
              <br>
              The researchers found evidence that the campaign has been
              operating since at least January 2019 and grew rapidly,
              particularly from March through June. It’s possible the
              operators were active for a much longer period, possibly
              as early as 2017.<br>
              <br>
              While each of the 500 plugins appeared to be different,
              all contained almost identical source code, with the
              exception of the function names, which were unique. Kaya
              discovered the malicious plugins with the help of
              CRXcavator, a tool for assessing the security of Chrome
              extensions. It was developed by Duo Security and was made
              freely available last year. Almost none of the plugins
              have any user ratings, a trait that left the researchers
              unsure of precisely how the extensions got installed.
              Google thanked the researchers for reporting their
              findings.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Beware of extensions</b><br>
              This latest discovery comes seven months after a different
              independent researcher documented browser extensions that
              lifted browsing histories from more than 4 million
              infected machines. While the vast majority of
              installations affected Chrome users, some Firefox users
              also got swept up. Nacho Analytics, the company that
              aggregated the data and openly sold it, shut down

              ”Together with colleagues at Skaraborg Hospital, he
              evaluates the effect of electrostatic air purification,
              EAC. The method is used at a number of preschools and at
              the children's clinic at Skaraborg Hospital to clean the
              air from small particles.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scientific experimental studies show
              that this method we use to clean the air also kills
              viruses very effectively, especially if it is a little
              higher than normal humidity. It is extremely interesting
              when it comes to the corona virus because if you set up
              the air purifier in rooms where many gather at the same
              time, you can help many who do not get sick. Where many
              people gather, the humidity also rises rapidly.<br>
              <br>
              When electrons are released into the air, they, together
              with oxygen and water vapor, form hydrogen peroxide, a
              simple water-like molecule that the body uses to kill
              viruses.”<br>
