          <br>
          NY, Feb 26, AP -- The New York American in a copyrighted
          article will say tomorrow that Col. Charles A. Lindbergh or
          Maj. Thomas Lanphier has brought to New York the
          electro-magnetic motor of Lester Hendershot for purposes of
          perfection and production.<br>
          <br>
          The motor will be taken to the office of the Guggenheim Fund
          for the Promotion of Aetronatics, the paper will say.<br>
          <br>
          "Despite protestations of Lindbergh , H.K. Knight and others
          of the party that they were in New York on a pleasure jaunt
          and they positively would have nothing to do York Tuesday to

          </b>In commenting on the invention, the New York American will
          say that Hendershot said, "The engine actually makes its own
          electricity. There is a magnet which acts as a starter. From
          that point on it generates its own power. The magnet will not
          wear out under 2000 hours, nearer 3000.<br>
          <br>
          "And, contrary to reports already circulated, the motor is not
          the size of a vacuum cleaner motor. it is 28 inches long. It
          weighs 130 pounds. it has developed 45 horsepower at 1800 rpm,
          the average speed of internal combustion motors.<b><br>

            Denies Knowing Plans. Motor Inventor, However, Says He Will
            Go to New York Tuesday.<br>
            <br>
          </b>Pittsburgh, PA, Feb. 26 (AP) -- Lester J. Hendershot of
          West Elizabeth, PA, inventor of the "fuelless motor," today
          denied all knowledge of a corporation in process of formation
          by Detroit friends to exploit his creation, but made known
          that he will go to New York Tuesday to confer with Col.
          Charles Lindbergh and others prominent in the world of
          aviation.<br>
          <br>
          The model of the motor that was on display in Detroit last
          week has been sent to New York, Hendershot said.<br>
          <br>
          Going into detail regarding the machine, the inventor said it
          was developed while he was experimenting in an attempt to
          produce an improved compass and he asserted the force that
          "turns my motor is the same force that pulls the needle of a
          compass around."<br>
          <br>
          Hendershot who is a licensed pilot, started experimenting 3
          years ago when he first took up flying. The motor, he said,
          first took shape a year ago.<br>

          </b>Pittsburgh, Feb 28 -- "It works."<b><br>
            <br>
          </b>This was the reply of Lester Hendershot to published
          statements that scientists doubted the ability of his fuelless
          motor to draw power from the earth's magnetic forces
          sufficient to turn an airplane motor.<br>
          <br>
          Hendershot said he did not care to reveal the secret of his
          motor, and would not do so to "satisfy the curiosity" of
          doubters.<br>
          <br>
          Washington, Feb. 28. (INS) -- Terrestrial magnetism may be
          harnessed to create energy that will turn wheels and make
          telegraph instruments tick, a group of government scientists
          agreed today, but they turned thumbs down on the mysterious
          and much discussed "fuelless motor" invented by Lester J.
          Hendershot of Pittsburgh.<br>
          <br>
          That such a motor or generator can be used to drive airplanes
          was regarded as extremely doubtful by Dr Paul R. Heyl,
          inventor of the earth inductor compass that guided Lindbergh
          to France, and Dr. H.D. Hubbard, who has visualized apparent
          impossibilities as a camera which focuses automatically as
          does the human eye, and interplanetary transportation.<br>
          <b><br>
            Device Would Be Too Heavy<br>
            <br>
          </b>"You can't get something for nothing," declared Dr. Heyl,
          whose inductor compass operates on a principle somewhat
          similar to that of the Hendershot generator.<br>
          <br>
          "To operate an airplane requires at least 400 horsepower. A
          device that would develop that power from earth currents would
          be too heavy and cumbersome for aircraft.<br>
          <br>
          "If Hendershot's generator operates a motor or lights a light,
          the whole story of the invention has not been told. From the
          newspaper dispatches I am at a loss to understand what kind of
          a machine it is. I can conceive of no practical device that
          would develop sufficient power from earth magnetism to run an
          airplane."<b><br>
            <br>
            Principle of Compass<br>
            <br>
          </b>The earth inductor compass is based on the principle that
          the voltage of a direct current dynamo is changed by shifting
          the angle between the magnetic field and the brushes, which
          collect the current from a revolving armature. The armature is
          driven by a wind wheel, whose motion is dependent upon the
          movement of the airplane.<br>
          <br>
          While there are few "impossibles" in Dr Hubbard's vocabulary,
          he said that a "fuelless motor" that would drive an airplane
          "looks impossible."<br>
          <br>
          "It's a fact that there in the bureau, the light of the north
          star, millions of light miles away in space, has been so
          directed as to turn a small mirror," Hubbard said.<br>
          <br>
          "A device was used in the war that would detect the presence
          of a man within 50 feet by the heat given off by his face. But
          that doesn't mean that the north star's radiation would charge
          a storage battery, or that water could be boiled by the heat
          of a man's face."<br>
          <b><br>
            Effect of Currents<br>
            <br>
          </b>Hubbard explained some remarkable manifestations of the
          effect of earth currents, supposed to be the motive power of
          the new generator. In periods of sun spot maximum it has been
          found possible to operate telegraph instruments all over
          eastern United States and in England without batteries, simply
          from power generated by magnetic storms.<br>
          <br>
          In theory the magnetic storms light lights since they are
          responsible of the mysterious phenomenon of the aurora -- the
          blazing electric system of the frozen north.<br>
          <br>
          "But to say that the comparatively weak magnetic field of the
          earth, which turns the compass needle, will develop in a
          generator sufficient energy to drive an airplane motor, is too
          much, and proof of the airplane in flight must be furnished
          before the invention is taken seriously," Hubbard said.<br>
          <b><br>
            Engine Declared Chance Discovery<br>
          </b><br>
          Pittsburgh, Feb. 28 -- Lester J. Hendershot, West Elizabeth
          inventor who startled the motor industry with the announcement
          of his electromagnetic engine, really started out to devise a
          new type of compass, D. Barr Peet, his partner, said today. <br>
          <br>
          Hendershot discovered by cutting the magnetic lines of force
          he could develop a rotary motion of a premagnetized core. This
          motion could be stabilized in the manner the motor was built,
          thus contructing an engine with a predetermined number of
          revolutions per minutre.<br>
          <br>
          "A constant speed motor is one of the greatest needs of
          aviation," said Peet. "This motor can be built to any speed
          desired, and will last indefinitely. The motor Hendershot
          demonstrated in Detroit was constructed to turn over 1800 rpm,
          and developed 45 horsepower on a block test."<b><br>
            <br>
            Denies Radio Phenomena<br>
            <br>
          </b>Peet was emphatic in his denial that there was any radio
          phenomena connected with the motor. It generates no heat, he
          explained, and could only be utilized as electrical current if
          attached to a motor generator.<br>
          <br>
          The partner explained that Hendershot originally was seeking
          to develop a compass that would be more reliable than the ones
          presently used by aviators. He was trying to improve upon the
          magnetic induction compass that indicates true north.<br>
          <br>
          "Hendershot found that with a premagnetized core, he could set
          up a magnetized field that would indicate the true north, but
          after he found this, he could find no way of utilizing it in
          the compass he had set out to devise," said Peet.<b><br>
            <br>
            Developed Rotary Motion<br>
            <br>
          </b>"In continuing his experiments, Hendershot learned that by
          cutting the same line of magnetic force from north and south,
          he had an indicator of the true north. By cutting the magnetic
          field east and west he found he could develop a rotary motion.<br>
          <br>
          "Hendershot now has a motor similar to an enlarged magneto, as
          the revolving armature passes the magnetic poles of the
          magnet, current enters the end of the armature wrapping,
          coming out of the other end highly increased in voltage.<br>
          <br>
          "The magnetic core in the armature acts as a starter. From
          that point the motor creates its own energy."<br>
          <br>
          Peet, who is manager of Bettis Field, Mckeesport PA, said
          Hendershot has made application for a patent for the new type
          motor in his own name, and will not submit it under an option
          to any group.<b><br>
            <br>
            To Confer With Lindy<br>
            <br>
          </b>The partner explained, however, that Hendershot would do
          nothing with his motor without consulting the Guggenheim
          foundation and his attorney. Hendershot is scheduled to go to
          New York today to consult with Col. Charles A. Linbergh, Maj.
          Thomas G. Lanphier, noted fliers, and his attorney, Col. Henry
          Breckenridge, also Col. Lindbergh's attorney. Members of the
          Guggenheim foundation will be at the conference, Peet said.<br>
          <br>
          Peet said Hendershot was not interested in the development of
          his motor for purposes other than aviation, primarily.<br>
          <br>
          "Of course these other things, such as developing energy for
          other purposes will come later; they will have to, but for the
          time being Hendershot is interested only in the advancement of
          aviation," Peet explained.<b><br>

              weaken immune response in subsequent years… researchers
              stunned</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>A medical study conducted at the Ohio State University
          Wexner Medical Center found that women who received flu
          vaccines had a weakened immune system response in subsequent
          years.<br>
          <br>
          Lisa Christian, PhD, the lead researcher on the study,
          concluded, “Growing evidence shows that those who received a
          flu shot in the prior year have lower antibody responses in
          the current year.”<br>
          <br>
          The study proves yet again that the official narrative of the
          flu shot industry — and its complicit corporate-run media — is
          false and deliberately deceptive. Far from offering
          bulletproof protection, flu shots actually make people more
          vulnerable to influenza infections, which of course
          contributes to more people catching the flu and then falsely
          thinking they need more flu shots for “more protection.”<br>
          <br>
          Yet it is the flu shots themselves that are leading to an
          increase in influenza infections. The flu vaccine, in other
          words, perpetuates the myth that flu vaccines are needed by
          ensuring influenza spreads more rapidly than would otherwise
          occur. In effect, flu vaccines spread the very infections that
          generate more demand for flu vaccines. The structure is a
          “perfect” self-perpetuating medical hoax rooted in fake
          science and relentless media propaganda.<br>
          <br>
          People who had a 2008 flu shot experienced a 250% increase in
          influenza infections in subsequent years.<br>
          <br>
          A study published in Human &amp; Environmental Toxicology
          found that mercury-laced flu vaccines caused a 4,250 percent
          increase in fetal deaths during the 2009 flu season.<br>
          <br>
          The flu shot narrative pushed by the vaccine industry is a
          medical hoax that’s easily disproved by fact-based evidence.<br>
          <br>
          People who get flu shots will be the first to die in an actual
          global pandemic because they have been made vulnerable to
          infections.<br>

          contaminated by radiation.SOLUTION: Radioactive substance
          treatment water obtained by diluting a deuterium sulfate with
          water is brought into contact with radioactive
          substance-contaminated objects, or is applied to radioactive
          substance-contaminated ground or air, so that the deuterium
          sulfate nuclear-transforms a radioactive substance into a
          nonradioactive substance. Thus, the radioactive substance is
          reduced, and wide-area decontamination of the radioactive

          [US]; FURLONG <br>
          <b>&nbsp;<br>
          </b>An apparatus and method for separating oxides of heavy
          isotopes of hydrogen (deuterium oxide, oxides of tritium and
          mixed isotope oxides) from light water (H2O) which is
          contaminated with these heavy hydrogen isotopes such as that
          currently being discharged in cooling water from nuclear power
          plants. A central aspect of this invention includes a
          plurality or bundle of elongated hollow core fibers which are
          positioned within an elongated enclosed housing having a feed
          water inlet, an exit stream outlet, and a permeate outlet. At
          least a portion of the hollow core fibers are at least
          partially filled or packed with small beads which are
          comprised of a porous exchange resin carrying waters of
          hydration. Porosity is controlled by the degree of
          cross-linking and bead diameter of the exchange resin which is
          preferably combined with aluminum sulfate or ammonium hydride
          to form (RSO3)3Al or RSO3NH4. By passing the contaminated
          water through the bead-filled hollow core fibers within the
          housing, significant amounts of the oxides of heavy hydrogen
          isotopes remain in the hollow core fiber either combined with
          the resin beads or collected against the inside wall surfaces
          of the hollow core fibers. Some of the H2O in the contaminated
          water permeates out of the hollow core fibers for discharge
          from the permeate outlet. The water which discharges from the
          exit stream outlet is substantially lower in heavy hydrogen
          isotope content. Regeneration of the apparatus is also shown.<br>

          144 Notes is a visual representation of musical notes, where
          every note’s pitch is represented with 2 predefined colors.
          First color is the color of octave (number) that the note
          belongs to and it is represented as background color. We could
          call it “the color of approximate pitch”. The second color
          represents the exact position of the note inside that octave.
          We could call it “the color of exact pitch”. To contain all
          notes in the range of human hearing I took span of 12 octaves
          and since every octave contains 12 notes we get 144 notes with
          144 color combinations. Starting with dark hues for lower
          pitches and continuing to more warm hues for middle and higher
          pitches.<br>
          <br>
          144 Notes Algorithm (how this website app is called) is useful
          for easy understanding how musical instruments are composed,
          to compare them with each other and see different tunings of
          particular instrument. It is also useful for finding
          connections between chords, songs and also for composing
          music… Find and discover all of its potential :)<br>

            Abstract</b><br>
          A plurality of ultrasound engine whistles used in an internal
          combustion engine. The whistles may be placed inside a
          carburetor, inside a cylinder head, around an engine valve
          stem and other locations inside the engine. The whistles
          provide for greatly improved air fuel mixture prior to
          ignition. Also, the whistles allow for increased engine
          performance and acceleration, improved fuel mileage and a
          cleaner burning air fuel mixture for reduced fuel emissions
          into the environment. The ultrasound whistles include a
          whistle body having a first end portion and a second end
          portion. A whistle hole with whistle lip therearound is formed
          in the first end portion of the whistle body. The whistle hole
          has a depth in a range of 0.032 to 0.050 inches. Also, the
          whistle hole has a diameter in a range of 0.031 to 0.033
          inches. The whistles may have various lengths in a range of
          1/8 inch to 1 inch and longer depending on the application
          inside the engine. The whistles help create a greater and more
          homogenous and atomized air fuel mixture prior to ignition in
          the engine cylinder.<br>

          [...] Second, (regarding) Israel. Israel does not cease to
          issue direct threats against Lebanon, (promising) to destroy
          it completely in a next war. There is always someone there who
          stands up and says, "In the next war, we will not let but
          ruins behind us, and we will return Lebanon 100 or 200 years
          back."<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Before the [Israeli military manoeuvres] Northern Front [in
          September 2017, the largest in 20 years] and after, Israel
          continues its offensive in Syria, claiming to prevent further
          arms reaching the Resistance (Hezbollah), it continues its
          violations in Lebanese [airspace] in various ways, and works
          to push the region to war under any pretext.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Today, on the tenth day [of the Islamic month of Muharram,
          commemorating the martyrdom of Imam Hussein], I want to send a
          clear message to Israelis and Jews in Occupied Palestine and
          (anywhere) in the world. I tell them this: <br>
          <br>
          From the beginning, we in the Resistance, have declared that
          our struggle was against the occupying Zionist aggressors on
          the land of Palestine and on our Arab land, not against Jews
          as followers of a heavenly religion (recognized by Islam) or
          as a people of the Book [Torah].<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          It is the Zionist movement that exploited Judaism and Jews to
          carry a colonialist occupation project in Palestine and the
          region, serving the British a hundred years ago, and later at
          the service of US policies. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The Jews who were brought from all over the world must know
          that they are only cannon fodder in a British Western
          colonialist war against the Arab and Islamic peoples in this
          region. And today they are the fuel for projects and US
          policies that target people of the region.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          And when our peoples defend their lives, their land and honor
          in the face of Zionist gangs, they are unjustly accused of
          anti-Semitism. This (false) accusation is found in every
          corner of the world.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Today I say to Jewish scholars, their eminent personalities,
          their thinkers: Those who brought you from all over the world
          to Palestine for their own interests are ultimately working to
          your destruction. You must know it, because it is written in
          your religious books.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The current Israeli government led by Netanyahu is leading
          your people to annihilation and destruction. For he only makes
          plans for war, and only searches war.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          He has worked in the past to prevent the signing of the
          nuclear deal with Iran, and he failed. He is currently working
          with Trump to tear this agreement and to push the region to a
          new war. If Trump and Netanyahu push the region to a new war,
          this will be at your expense [Israelis], and it is you who
          will pay a very high price for the stupid policies of the head
          of your government.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          And Netanyahu is also pushing the region towards war against
          Lebanon, Syria, Gaza and the Resistance movements, under
          misleading titles and defensive excuses, for a preventive war
          as he claims.<br>
          <br>
          And here, I hope all Israelis will listen carefully to what I
          say: Netanyahu, his government and military officials did not
          correctly evalutate the magnitude this war will reach if they
          succeed to light its fires. What will be its extent, what will
          be its territory, who will participate on it, who will enter
          it... Netanyahu, his government and military officials do not
          know how this war will end if they start it.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          And I also confirm that they do not have an accurate picture
          of what awaits them if they undertake such a stupid act as
          this war. They have no clarity (of vision), nor accurate
          assessment, nor just image. If they kindle the fire of the
          coming war, (they have no idea) how far it will reach, how
          extended will be its embrace, and who will participate in it.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          That's why I now call first all Jews except the Zionists to
          detach their considerations from Zionist calculations who lead
          themselves to their final destruction. <br>
          <br>
          And I call on all those who came in occupied Palestine
          believing the promises that they would find the land of milk
          and honey to leave. I call them to leave Palestine and go back
          to the countries from which they came so that they don't
          become mere fuel in any war to which the stupid Netanyahu
          government would lead them.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          For if Netanyahu launched a war in this region, there may be
          no more time for them to leave Palestine, and there might be
          no safe place for them in occupied Palestine.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          [Audience chants: At Thy service, ô Nasrallah]<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The enemy government must know that times have changed, as he
          must know that those with whom he hopes an alliance will be a
          burden for them because they need to be to defended themselves
          (and thus cannot help anyone). <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          And the scale of the massacres committed by Israel against the
          Palestinian people and the peoples of the region, its
          partnership with Daesh and its open complicity in the project
          of partition of our region through its open and eager support
          to the secession of Kurdistan, all this will push the people
          of the region to render a capital verdict against them.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          I conclude by saying to the Israelis, the Israeli people base
          of this usurper entity: you know that what your political and
          military leaders say about Israel's ability to win a victory
          in any future war is largely composed of lies and illusions.
          What has been told you is largely made up of lies and
          illusions.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          And you know the extent of the flaws and loopholes that exist
          (in your army and society). And that's why you must not allow
          stupid and arrogant leaders to lead you into an adventure in
          which there will be perhaps the end of all things and all that
          entity. [...]<br>

          Abstract -- Countless studies showed that [60]fullerene
          (C(60)) and derivatives could have many potential biomedical
          applications. However, while several independent research
          groups showed that C(60) has no acute or sub-acute toxicity in
          various experimental models, more than 25 years after its
          discovery the in vivo fate and the chronic effects of this
          fullerene remain unknown. If the potential of C(60) and
          derivatives in the biomedical field have to be fulfilled these
          issues must be addressed. Here we show that oral
          administration of C(60) dissolved in olive oil (0.8 mg/ml) at
          reiterated doses (1.7 mg/kg of body weight) to rats not only
          does not entail chronic toxicity but it almost doubles their
          lifespan. The effects of C(60)-olive oil solutions in an
          experimental model of CCl(4) intoxication in rat strongly
          suggest that the effect on lifespan is mainly due to the
          attenuation of age-associated increases in oxidative stress.
          Pharmacokinetic studies show that dissolved C(60) is absorbed
          by the gastro-intestinal tract and eliminated in a few tens of
          hours. These results of importance in the fields of medicine
          and toxicology should open the way for the many possible -and
          waited for- biomedical applications of C(60) including cancer
          therapy, neurodegenerative disorders, and ageing.<br>

          MIT researchers are hunting for signals common to extreme

          <br>
          Extreme events, such as tsunamis or network crashes, are by
          their very nature rare. But because they occur in a wide range
          of dynamic systems – from computers to climate – they are
          also, from one perspective, ubiquitous.<br>
          <br>
          Probing for similarities between extreme events in a variety
          of arenas has led two researchers from the Department of
          Mechanical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of
          Technology, US, to uncover a deep mathematical architecture

          </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
          <br>
          Extreme events are ubiquitous in a wide range of dynamical
          systems, including turbulent fluid flows, nonlinear waves,
          large-scale networks, and biological systems. We propose a
          variational framework for probing conditions that trigger
          intermittent extreme events in high-dimensional nonlinear
          dynamical systems. We seek the triggers as the
          probabilistically feasible solutions of an appropriately
          constrained optimization problem, where the function to be
          maximized is a system observable exhibiting intermittent
          extreme bursts. The constraints are imposed to ensure the
          physical admissibility of the optimal solutions, that is,
          significant probability for their occurrence under the natural
          flow of the dynamical system. We apply the method to a
          body-forced incompressible Navier-Stokes equation, known as
          the Kolmogorov flow. We find that the intermittent bursts of
          the energy dissipation are independent of the external forcing
          and are instead caused by the spontaneous transfer of energy
          from large scales to the mean flow via nonlinear triad
          interactions. The global maximizer of the corresponding
          variational problem identifies the responsible triad, hence
          providing a precursor for the occurrence of extreme
          dissipation events. Specifically, monitoring the energy
          transfers within this triad allows us to develop a data-driven
          short-term predictor for the intermittent bursts of energy
          dissipation. We assess the performance of this predictor
          through direct numerical simulations.<br>

                Electromagnetic Weapons Could Be 'More Efficient Than

          Russia is developing radio-electronic weapons, which use a
          powerful UHF impulse capable of destroying all electronic
          equipment miles away and even changing the course of a war.<br>
          <br>
          Alexander Khrolenko (RIA Novosti) – The Listva, a remotely
          operated mine clearance vehicle capable of detecting and
          blowing up mines up to 100 meters away, is one such weapon.<br>
          <br>
          An armored vehicle equipped with a UHF emitter moves in front
          of a mobile missile system. It detects radio-controlled
          landmines planted along and away from the road using
          ground-penetrating radar and then uses ultra-high-frequency
          rays to neutralize them.<br>
          <br>
          This is a novel technique, which had never been used before.<br>
          <br>
          During a drill on Wednesday, some 20 real cellphone-controlled
          explosive devices were planted along the route of a column of
          Yars mobile ballistic missile systems. A single Listva vehicle
          spotted all of them and blew them up long before the missiles
          reached the area.<br>
          <br>
          In the next two years Russia’s Strategic Missile Forces will
          receive over 150 Listva robotic mine clearing vehicles.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Future Weapons</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          The unique radio-electronic weapons based on new physical
          principles, which were successfully tested in Russia last fall
          use mobile electromagnetic emitters to disable missile
          warheads and onboard aircraft electronics many miles away.<br>
          <br>
          The electromagnetic bombs developed by Russia can be more
          effective than nuclear weapons because they are able to
          neutralize entire armies with just one short electromagnetic
          impulse.<br>
          <br>
          Moreover, unlike already exiting electronic jammers, they can
          completely take out or seriously damage even off-line weapons
          like tanks, grounded planes and missiles in silos.<br>
          <br>
          Earlier, media reports said that Russia’s defense industry had
          come up with the Alabuga, a new electro-magnetic missile,
          which uses a powerful UHF emitter to disable all enemy
          electronics within a radius of 3.5 kilometers (2.3 miles),
          turning it into “a heap of scrap metal.”<br>
          <br>
          Blind, Deaf and Mute: Russia's New Electromagnetic Missile to
          Turn Enemy Weapons Into 'Scrap Metal'<br>
          A directed beam of waves of a particular frequency has a
          sledgehammer effect on electronic equipment knocking out
          computers and navigation systems by physically destroying
          their motherboards.<br>
          <br>
          Russia plans to install such weapons on its sixth-generation
          fighter drones because powerful UHF radiation can kill pilots.<br>
          <br>
          Radio-electronic weapons are able to jam a tank’s loading
          mechanism, blow up artillery shells inside a turret and
          destroy enemy soldiers hiding inside a bunker or taking cover
          up to 100 meters underground.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Foreign Designs</b><br>
          <br>
          The US, Israel and China are equally busy developing their own
          types of electromagnetic weapons. During Operation Desert
          Storm in Iraq in 1991, the Americans used a relatively
          primitive electronic bomb by fitting the warheads of their
          Tomahawk cruise missiles with carbon fiber.<br>
          <br>
          As a result, the missiles short-circuited the electrical lines
          of Iraqi power stations and power lines severely degrading the
          country’s vital infrastructure and air defenses.<br>
          <br>
          The Pentagon used more advanced electromagnetic weapons during
          NATO’s 1999 aggression against Yugoslavia. In the first two
          week alone, the US Air Force dropped over 400 super-heavy JDAM
          gliding bombs packed with graphite and metallic fibers and
          particles knocking out the country’s entire air defense
          control system.<br>
          <br>
          Since electromagnetic weapons are capable of pushing a nation
          back centuries, countries are now developing ever ever-new
          means of defending themselves again these fearsome weapons.<br>

          </div>
          <br>
          Russia is developing radio-electronic weapons, which use a
          powerful UHF impulse capable of destroying all electronic
          equipment miles away, a senior advisor to the deputy head of
          Radio-Electronic Technologies Concern (KRET) told Sputnik.<br>
          <br>
          Earlier, media reports said that Russia’s defense industry had
          come up with the Alabuga, a new electro-magnetic missile,
          which uses a powerful UHF emitter to disable all enemy
          electronics within a radius of 3.5 kilometers (2.3 miles),
          turning it into “a heap of scrap metal.”<br>
          <br>
          In an interview with Sputnik, Vladimir Mikheev, senior adviser
          to KRET’s chief, said that the Alabuga stands for a whole
          series of scientific research in the development of the
          radio-electronic weapons of the future.<br>
          <br>
          “The effect of such weapons may vary from ordinary
          interference that temporarily knocks out the enemy’s weapons
          systems, all the way to a complete radio-electronic
          destruction of electronic elements, motherboards, microchips
          and systems,” Mikheev explained.<br>
          <br>
          He added that all the research results were classified and the
          subject of UHF weapons was assigned a top secret
          classification.<br>
          <br>
          "All I can say is that the obtained know-how is now being used
          in the development of electromagnetic artillery shells, bombs
          and missiles, which carry a magnetic explosion generator,”
          Vladimir Mikheev said.<br>
          <br>
          “All leading world powers, including the US and China, are
          also working on this,” he added.<br>
          <br>
          The pulsed radiation generated by the UHF emitter developed as
          part of the Alabuga project is similar to that of a nuclear
          explosion, but without the radioactive component.<br>

          </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
          <br>
          Spider silk has promising mechanical properties, since it
          conjugates high strength (~1.5?GPa) and toughness (~150 J
          g-1). Here, we report the production of silk incorporating
          graphene and carbon nanotubes by spider spinning, after
          feeding spiders with the corresponding aqueous dispersions. We
          observe an increment of the mechanical properties with respect
          to pristine silk, up to a fracture strength ~5.4?GPa and a
          toughness modulus ~1570 J g-1. This approach could be extended
          to other biological systems and lead to a new class of
          artificially modified biological, or 'bionic', materials.<br>

      <br>
      Elements of the Mereon Matrix made visible for the first time on
      the CymaScope instrument<br>
      <br>
      In recent years, our research with the CymaScope has focused
      primarily on developing the CymaScope for use as a scientific
      instrument, to bring it to the point where it can accurately
      render and replicate sonic frequencies. Working to identify a
      range of applications for this new technology, we have achieved
      success in a number of areas. For example, in Oceanography we have
      made significant discoveries in dolphin language; and in
      Asteroseismology the CymaScope has made the sonic signatures of
      stars visible for the first time.<br>
      <br>
      However, we have remained aware that the governing dynamics of
      cymatic phenomena must be formally described for it to be embraced
      by mainstream scientists. In 2012, we began working with the team
      of mathematicians and scientists who, after discovering what may
      be the energetic pattern that resides at the heart of Creation,
      have spent almost two decades investigating and researching its
      application in natural and social science.<br>
      <br>
      The anecdotal perspective of this discovery was first presented in
      the book ''The Pattern'' in 1997; the Pattern is now known as
      'Mereon Trefoil Knot' that is 'tied' by the Mereon Matrix. In our
      first dialogue with the Principle Investigators of the Mereon
      Matrix, we were asked if it was possible that the CymaScope might
      render visible some of the key frequencies intuited to be related
      to this pattern. No one could have predicted just how successful
      the results of this cooperative effort would turn out. In August
      2012, in a London hotel room we met to make the first experiments.<br>
      <br>
      As we dialled one of the Mereon frequencies into the CymaScope,
      all watched expectantly to see if what one team member had
      predicted would appear. The excitement was high as it was
      acknowledged that if the CymaScope provided sufficient accuracy it
      would be a new day for Mereon and the emerging science of
      cymatics. The instrument's output showed what was predicted and
      exceeded everyone's anticipation.<br>
      <br>
      In the months that followed, together with the Mereon team, we
      began intensive explorations in our UK laboratory. The first
      milestone was imaging a cymatically tied knot, a trefoil. In
      January 2015, using the prime frequency of the Matrix, the
      geometry and topology (knots) manifest became visible in pure
      water. The results of decades of work on the Mereon Matrix and its
      confirmation by CymaScopic experiments were published in 2015 by
      renowned scientific/academic publisher, Elsevier in a
      ground-breaking book entitled: "The Mereon Matrix; Unity,
      Perspective and Paradox".<br>
      <br>
      All those interested in cymatics will benefit greatly from reading
      this book. It is an investment that is well worth the price, as
      this is the first book that presents the Cymascope and a new
      perspective on cymatics. It is essential reading for all
      cymatists, and is a book you are sure to refer to many times.<br>
      <br>
      By reading The Mereon Matrix you will learn the following about
      the CymaScope:<br>
      <br>
      1. The thought process that led from early sand-based cymatics
      experiments and the building of a rudimentary CymaScope through to
      today's advanced water-based CymaScope, developed from an
      experimental apparatus in which the human ear was used as a model.<br>
      <br>
      2. How the CymaScope's water membrane 'encodes' a given sound into
      a cymatic pattern and the parameters that affect the encoding.<br>
      <br>
      3. Insights into the future of cymatics.<br>
      <br>
      4. The CymaScope's role in imaging the Mereon Matrix, which
      scientists are suggesting is our link with the creative process at
      the heart of the Universe.<br>
      <br>
      This book is a tour de force and contains much more about
      cymatics, the emergent science that creates what some consider to
      be 'sacred geometry'. It also shows how the Mereon Matrix is being
      applied to a large number of systems, physical, mathematical,
      educational, psychological and philosophical. Fully 1/3 of the
      book applies the Matrix to astrobiology and genetics, the origin
      of the universe and you; the implications are exciting and
      staggering.<br>

      At the heart of this work is a quote by Gregory Bateson: “The
      pattern that connects is a Pattern of patterns.”<br>
      <br>
      The Mereon Trefoil is the simplest knot, a Pattern that profoundly
      connects. This knot is traced by the dynamics of complex geometric
      system known as the Mereon Matrix. Perspective is immediately
      comprehended in the six viewpoints of one know shown below. A true
      “Love Knot”, its flow is unconditional and infinite, with no
      beginning or end. Flowing from inside to out and back again, this
      rainbow path is generated by the interaction between its Context,
      a watery geomatrix that breathes and births —decidedly feminine
      qualities— and its Core, a nucleus that seeds potential and
      reflects the system's masculine nature. Their mutual attraction
      and interaction forms as a system of embedded geospheres, its
      compelling completeness invoking wonder as its changeless dynamic
      transforms all that it takes in, unity producing infinite
      diversity.<br>
      <br>
      The Mereon Matrix unites all Mother Nature’s building blocks, the
      Platonic and Kepler solids, twice, and reveals the sequential
      order in which each emerges. Those interested in alchemy will find
      it significant that connected ‘Gold’, the architecture based on
      the Golden Ratio, the ’Sacred Proportion’. Forms that are not ‘F’
      are transformed, each turning from non-golden ratio, into golden
      forms. To those who consider dynamic geometry ‘sacred’, the Mereon
      Matrix reveals why if anything is sacred, everything is sacred.<br>

      acoustic-physics researcher, John Stuart Reid, filmed at the Water
      Conference, Sofia, Bulgaria, October 2016, on the physics,
      chemistry and biology of water. The title of the talk was
      originally "The Holographic Properties of Water" and focuses on
      the CymaScope instrument and the emergent science of Cymatics,
      including significant implications for medical science and
      positing the first two laws of Cymatics.<br>

      San Diego State University professor of psychology and author Jean
      Twenge has claimed that smartphone usage is having a radical
      impact on both the behavior and mental health of U.S. teenagers.<br>
      <br>
      The arrival of the smartphone has radically changed every aspect
      of teenagers’ lives, from the nature of their social interactions
      to their mental health […] Rates of teen depression and suicide
      have skyrocketed since 2011. It’s not an exaggeration to describe
      iGen as being on the brink of the worst mental-health crisis in
      decades. Much of this deterioration can be traced to their
      phones...<br>

      technologies we use, the products we buy and the jobs we do.<br>
      <br>
      The Manual of Mathematical Magic is packed full of magical
      miracles to impress and entertain your friends. The secrets behind
      street magic, close-up and stage tricks are explained clearly with
      instructions and videos to help you perform them perfectly. Then
      you can learn about the maths behind the trick and discover how
      that same mathematics is used to power our modern world and
      numerous careers.<br>

      ...Summary: Total global temperature rise could be as much as 10°C
      or 18°F by 2021<br>
      <br>
      \summary, adding up all the warming associated with the above
      elements results in a total potential global temperature rise
      (land and ocean) of more than 10°C or 18°F in a matter of years,
      by as early as 2021, assuming that no geoengineering will take
      place over the next few years.<br>
      Accordingly, this would lead to numbers of climate-related global
      deaths in line with the prognosis below.<br>
      <br>
      The situation is dire and calls for comprehensive and effective
      action as described in the Climate Plan.<br>
