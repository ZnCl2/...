                </b><b>Abstract --</b> This paper describes a novel
                method of achieving practical hydrogen fusion. What is
                proposed is that two plasma streams of hydrogen having a
                high density and a large cross-section are fired at each
                other, head-on, at a high speed. At a certain point,
                nuclear fusion will occur. The design of this device
                allows extraction and utilisation of the heat produced.
                When protons collide at a sufficient velocity, with the
                required high plasma density and large plasma
                cross-section, some of the protons fuse into helium
                nuclei, generating heat. If the plasma density and
                cross-section are large enough, the required velocity
                can be relatively low and is technically feasible. The
                so-called Lawson Criterion describes this trade-off. The
                Maxwell-Boltzmann tail effect combined with the Quantum
                Mechanical tunnelling effect reduces the required
                velocity further to an achievable level. These plasma
                streams are accelerated to high relative velocities by a
                novel plasma acceleration device, also described in this
                article. This device also allows the stream of plasma to
                have a high enough density and cross-section, so that
                the required relative velocity of the plasma can be
                relatively low. The device consists of two plasma
                accelerators firing plasma at each other. Each of the
                accelerators consist of a tube surrounded by a large
                number of individual electro-magnetic coils, each
                connected to a power supply. The electro-magnetic field
                of each coil is varied so that a magnetic ‘pocket’ is
                created. Each pocket holds a packet of plasma. The
                magnetic fields of the coils are varied so that each
                pocket is accelerated up the tube to a high velocity,
                carrying the packet of plasma with it. These packets of
                plasma are ejected out of the tubes and fired head-on at
                each other. If these plasma packets are of sufficiently
                high relative velocity, density and cross-section,
                hydrogen fusion will occur. Plasma fusion can be
                generated continuously using this device. The heat
                generated can be utilised by injecting water into the
                location where fusion occurs, and the resultant steam
                generated can be used to generate electricity. A single
                plasma accelerator can be used to accelerate plasma to a
                high velocity, to be used by space ships or as a weapon.<b><br>

                properties and might play a role greater than we could
                imagine in our tree of life. <br>
                That is the belief shared by the advocates of a
                surprising theory called "water memory". For Prof. Luc
                Montagnier, water has the ability to reproduce the
                properties of any substance it once contained. Water
                would have the ability to retain a memory of the
                properties of the molecules.<br>

                Comment:&nbsp; Lao Mark -- I have a MBA and MSc in
                Aquaculture (fishfarming) and have worked in various
                countries visiting academical and technical facillities
                in over 50 countries in this field. Thirty years ago
                when I worked for the Tawainese Government doing
                research in fish and shrimp farming. I had the
                opportunity to work direct with local commercial farmers
                and it completely changed my view of "managing water"!
                They "cultivated the warter", "stabilized the water" ,
                used "aged water" (memory?) to mix with the water of the
                next growing cycle, transfered "good water" from a
                pond/tank to another recipient which the fish/shrimp
                were not growing well or were sick to "cure the water",
                etc. They used ancient Chinese principals and
                observations to help them to develop a "feeling for the
                water"! They even say that "you do not "grow the fish,
                you grow the water, fish is the result". I have
                published 2 articles in the subject over 20 y;ears ago
                and nobody in the scientific community gave credit to
                it. But after living daily for more than 1 year with
                these local farmers, I developed a more profound
                perception of water and I knew that would take 10, 20+
                years for the westernized&nbsp; science to start to view
                water in a different and more owesome way (like the
                ancient Chinese sages did). Now it seem the time is
                arriving..... If any one wants to contact me or receive
                a copy of my articles, pls email me at&nbsp;

                Researchers have detailed a new method to predict spikes
                in violence during times of war and terrorism.<br>
                <br>
                In a new study, researchers analyzing a total of 273
                armed conflicts and 60 terrorist campaigns identified
                patterns that appear to exist across the board,
                regardless of geography, ethnicity, and religion.<br>
                <br>
                The experts say the breakthrough could help us better
                understand the nature of human conflict.<br>
                <br>
                In the study published this month to the journal PLOS
                One, a team from Royal Holloway and George Washington
                University analyzed event-size data from nine modern
                conflicts.<br>
                <br>
                This factor is determined by the number of fatalities
                resulting from the event, such as a suicide bombing or
                air strike.<br>
                <br>
                The researchers looked at hundreds of conflicts from
                1989 to 2016, using what are known as split-sample
                techniques to predict patterns on the size distribution
                of such events in the future.<br>
                <br>
                The method pursues ‘a rather non-standard prediction
                agenda,’ the researchers explain in the paper.<br>
                <br>
                ‘For example, we never predict that an event of size x
                will occur with some probability within some spatial or
                temporal interval.<br>
                <br>
                Rather, we predict broad event-size patterns within
                known conflicts based only on data from other
                conflicts,' the authors continued.<br>
                <br>
                'We do this in pursuit of fundamental knowledge about
                how modern conflicts work.’<br>
                <br>
                And in many ways, they found the size distribution of
                violent events looked a lot alike.<br>
                <br>
                According to the team, it’s possible to predict events

                  ARE WE HEADING FOR WORLD WAR 3?<br>
                </b><br>
                Since 1823 to 2003, a 181-year period, there have been
                95 recorded wars between different countries: one every
                1.91 years on average.<br>
                <br>
                Larger wars, those with the most deaths, were far less
                common.&nbsp; <br>
                <br>
                World War One lasted between 1914 and 1918 and World War
                Two spanned from 1939 to 1945. <br>
                <br>
                The Great War (WWI) cost an estimated 21 million people
                their lives.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                <br>
                The Second World War lasted longer than the first and
                killed ab estimates 85 million people - more than the
                entire population of Germany in 2017.<br>
                <br>
                The time between, and including, these wars has been
                dubbed the 'great violence'. <br>
                <br>
                Before then there was a total of 19 large wars, one
                every 6.2 years dating back to 1823. <br>
                <br>
                After World War Two, the 'long peace' began which has
                spanned from 1945 through to present day. <br>
                <br>
                Only five major inter-state wars have taken place since
                1945. <br>
                <br>
                Major conflicts now average once every 12.8 years.<br>
                <br>
                According to research, for the statistical pattern to be
                significantly different there wouuld have to be a 205
                year gap before there is another war as large as
                WWII.&nbsp; <br>
                <br>
                Which leaves between 100 and 150 years before we will
                know if this period of peace is a statistical blip or a
                new conflict-free era.&nbsp; <br>

              <font size="+1"><b>Abstract<br>
                </b>It is still unknown whether there is some deep
                structure to modern wars and terrorist campaigns that
                could, for example, enable reliable prediction of future
                patterns of violent events. Recent war research focuses
                on size distributions of violent events, with size
                defined by the number of people killed in each event.
                Event size distributions within previously available
                datasets, for both armed conflicts and for global
                terrorism as a whole, exhibit extraordinary regularities
                that transcend specifics of time and place. These
                distributions have been well modelled by a narrow range
                of power laws that are, in turn, supported by some
                theories of violent group dynamics. We show that the
                predicted event-size patterns emerge broadly in a mass
                of new event data covering all conflicts in the world
                from 1989 to 2016. Moreover, there are similar
                regularities in the events generated by individual
                terrorist organizations, 1998—2016. The existence of
                such robust empirical patterns hints at the
                predictability of size distributions of violent events
                in future wars. We pursue this prospect using
                split-sample techniques that help us to make useful
                out-of-sample predictions. Power-law-based prediction
                systems outperform lognormal-based systems. We conclude
                that there is indeed evidence from the existing data
                that fundamental patterns do exist, and that these can
                allow prediction of size distribution of events in
                modern wars and terrorist campaigns.<br>

                A material designed by MIT chemical engineers can react
                with carbon dioxide from the air, to grow, strengthen,
                and even repair itself. The polymer, which might someday
                be used as construction or repair material or for
                protective coatings, continuously converts the
                greenhouse gas into a carbon-based material that
                reinforces itself.<br>
                <br>
                The current version of the new material is a synthetic
                gel-like substance that performs a chemical process
                similar to the way plants incorporate carbon dioxide
                from the air into their growing tissues. The material
                might, for example, be made into panels of a lightweight
                matrix that could be shipped to a construction site,
                where they would harden and solidify just from exposure
                to air and sunlight, thereby saving on the energy and
                cost of transportation.<br>
                <br>
                The finding is described in a paper in the journal
                Advanced Materials, by Professor Michael Strano, postdoc
                Seon-Yeong Kwak, and eight others at MIT and at the
                University of California at Riverside<br>
                <br>
                “This is a completely new concept in materials science,”
                says Strano, the Carbon C. Dubbs Professor of Chemical
                Engineering. “What we call carbon-fixing materials don’t
                exist yet today” outside of the biological realm, he
                says, describing materials that can transform carbon
                dioxide in the ambient air into a solid, stable form,
                using only the power of sunlight, just as plants do.<br>
                <br>
                Developing a synthetic material that not only avoids the
                use of fossil fuels for its creation, but actually
                consumes carbon dioxide from the air, has obvious
                benefits for the environment and climate, the
                researchers point out. “Imagine a synthetic material
                that could grow like trees, taking the carbon from the
                carbon dioxide and incorporating it into the material’s
                backbone,” Strano says.<br>
                <br>
                The material the team used in these initial
                proof-of-concept experiments did make use of one
                biological component — chloroplasts, the
                light-harnessing components within plant cells, which
                the researchers obtained from spinach leaves. The
                chloroplasts are not alive but catalyze the reaction of
                carbon dioxide to glucose. Isolated chloroplasts are
                quite unstable, meaning that they tend to stop
                functioning after a few hours when removed from the
                plant. In their paper, Strano and his co-workers
                demonstrate methods to significantly increase the
                catalytic lifetime of extracted chloroplasts. In ongoing
                and future work, the chloroplast is being replaced by
                catalysts that are nonbiological in origin, Strano
                explains.<br>
                <br>
                The material the researchers used, a gel matrix composed
                of a polymer made from aminopropyl methacrylamide (APMA)
                and glucose, an enzyme called glucose oxidase, and the
                chloroplasts, becomes stronger as it incorporates the
                carbon. It is not yet strong enough to be used as a
                building material, though it might function as a crack
                filling or coating material, the researchers say.<br>
                <br>
                The team has worked out methods to produce materials of
                this type by the ton, and is now focusing on optimizing
                the material’s properties. Commercial applications such
                as self-healing coatings and crack filling are
                realizable in the near term, they say, whereas
                additional advances in backbone chemistry and materials
                science are needed before construction materials and
                composites can be developed.<br>
                <br>
                One key advantage of such materials is they would be
                self-repairing upon exposure to sunlight or some indoor
                lighting, Strano says. If the surface is scratched or
                cracked, the affected area grows to fill in the gaps and
                repair the damage, without requiring any external
                action.<br>
                <br>
                While there has been widespread effort to develop
                self-healing materials that could mimic this ability of
                biological organisms, the researchers say, these have
                all required an active outside input to function.
                Heating, UV light, mechanical stress, or chemical
                treatment were needed to activate the process. By
                contrast, these materials need nothing but ambient
                light, and they incorporate mass from carbon in the
                atmosphere, which is ubiquitous.<br>
                <br>
                The material starts out as a liquid, Kwak says, adding,
                “it is exciting to watch it as it starts to grow and
                cluster” into a solid form.<br>
                <br>
                “Materials science has never produced anything like
                this,” Strano says. “These materials mimic some aspects
                of something living, even though it’s not reproducing.”
                Because the finding opens up a wide array of possible
                follow-up research, the U.S. Department of Energy is
                sponsoring a new program directed by Strano to develop
                it further.<br>
                <br>
                “Our work shows that carbon dioxide need not be purely a
                burden and a cost,” Strano says. “It is also an
                opportunity in this respect. There’s carbon everywhere.
                We build the world with carbon. Humans are made of
                carbon. Making a material that can access the abundant
                carbon all around us is a significant opportunity for
                materials science. In this way, our work is about making
                materials that are not just carbon neutral, but carbon
                negative.”<br>

                Riverside, and Tedrick Lew, Min Hao Wong, Pingwei Liu,

                When Navy SEALs carry out dives in Arctic waters, or
                when rescue teams are diving under ice-covered rivers or
                ponds, the survival time even in the best wetsuits is
                very limited — as little as tens of minutes, and the
                experience can be extremely painful at best. Finding
                ways of extending that survival time without hampering
                mobility has been a priority for the U.S. Navy and
                research divers, as a pair of MIT engineering professors
                learned during a recent program that took them to a
                variety of naval facilities.<br>
                <br>
                That visit led to a two-year collaboration that has now
                yielded a dramatic result: a simple treatment that can
                improve the survival time for a conventional wetsuit by
                a factor of three, the scientists say.<br>
                <br>
                The findings, which could be applied essentially

                Michigan State Economics Professor Mark Dr. Skidmore
                says there is a limit to money printing even when all
                the global central banks are doing it.&nbsp; Skidmore
                says, “What does it mean when a central bank is buying
                equities, or buying debt with printed money in order to
                suppress interest rates and keep this game going?&nbsp;
                I think, overall, the whole world is awash in debt, and
                it’s expanding at a rate that is unsustainable.&nbsp;
                The only way it has been sustained is that interest
                rates have been falling for 30 years.&nbsp; Now,
                interest rates are no longer falling, and we are running
                up against a constraint.&nbsp; Now, if this $21 trillion
                in “missing” federal money really represents spending
                above and beyond what the official records indicate,
                then that has huge financial implications and huge
                implications for confidence in the dollar as the reserve
                currency.&nbsp; This is an enormous priority to address
                and not just cover up and say we are all good.”<br>
                <br>
                In closing, Dr. Skidmore says, “How can you have a
                democracy if you don’t have any transparency
                whatsoever?&nbsp; Having integrity and confidence is so
                essential to the whole system, and this just puts
                everything in question. . . . We should clean this up
                and show we are legitimate. If we don’t, we are just
                shooting ourselves in the foot.”<br>

                </b>Inventor: SHAPIRO STEVEN, et al.<br>
                <br>
                The invention provides a composition for topical
                treatment of hair loss/alopecia including three natural,
                active ingredients, caffeine, saw palmetto berry
                extract, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). The
                invention also provides methods for using this
                composition to treat hair loss...<br>
                &nbsp;<br>
                <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
                [0060] For the purpose of promoting an understanding of
                the principles of the invention, reference will now be
                made to embodiments illustrated herein and specific
                language will be used to describe the same. It will
                nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the
                scope of the invention is thereby intended. Any
                alterations and further modification in the described
                compositions, methods, products, kits, and/or any
                further application of the principles of the invention
                as described herein, are contemplated as would normally
                occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention
                relates.<br>
                <br>
                [0061] The instant invention provides a topical,
                natural, and safe composition (and methods of use
                thereof) that will improve hair loss treatment,
                including treatment in men (androgenic alopecia) and
                treatment in post-menopausal women (female-pattern hair
                loss).<br>
                <br>
                [0062] A relationship between testosterone levels and
                hair loss has been well-described in the pathogenesis of
                this distressing condition. Blockers of testosterone and
                its metabolite, 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), have been
                used systematically to treat male-pattern hair loss.<br>
                <br>
                [0063] Caffeine, saw palmetto berry extract, and
                epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) have found to have
                varying effects on 5α-dihydrotestosterone through
                different mechanisms.<br>
                <br>
                [0064] Fischer (Fischer et al. Int J Dermatol.
                46(1):27-35 2007) demonstrated the effect of caffeine
                and testosterone on the proliferation of human hair
                follicles in vitro. Significant growth suppression was
                found in hair follicles treated with 5 mg/ml
                testosterone. This suppression was counteracted by
                caffeine in concentrations of 0.001% and 0.005%.
                Additionally, caffeine alone led to significant
                stimulation of hair follicle growth.<br>
                <br>
                [0065] In medical literature to date, these observations
                have not been reported with topical preparations of
                caffeine in vivo...<br>
                Although it has not been scientifically confirmed, it is
                believed that saw palmetto berry extract may block the
                5-α-reductase enzyme from converting testosterone into
                dihydroxytestosterone. See “Can Saw Palmetto Stop Hair
                Loss?” by Cathy Wong at the About.com website under
                “Alternative Medicine”; accessed on Jan. 31, 2012.<br>
                <br>
                [0068] Considering that saw palmetto berry extract has
                been used orally for its effects on testosterone and
                dihydroxytestosterone in the treatment of prostate
                disease, it is a potentially-beneficial treatment for
                alopecia (hair loss). Saw palmetto berry extract can be
                used in combination with a low concentration of caffeine
                to reduce the effects of dihydroxytestosterone and
                thereby, treat alopecia (hair loss).<br>
                <br>
                [0069] Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a natural
                polyphenolic compound found in green tea. It has been
                reported that EGCG may be useful for selectively
                inhibiting 5-α-reductase activity and several studies
                have demonstrated its effects on hair growth.<br>
                <br>
                [0070] Hiipakka (Hiipakka et al. Biochemical
                Pharmacology 63(6):1165-1176 2002) showed that
                epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) potently inhibited
                human 5-α-reductase in cell free but not in whole cell
                assays in vitro.<br>
                <br>
                [0071] Kwon (Kwon et al. Phytomedicine 14:551-555 2007)
                showed that in vitro exposure of human hair to topical
                EGCG demonstrated changes that were consistent with in
                vivo changes for cell proliferation markers in pathways
                known to participate in growth. Thus, Kwon suggested
                that EGCG stimulates human hair growth. Kwon's formula
                contained EGCG in 10% ethanol which was used in human
                volunteers. This formulation is not useful for repeated
                topical application due to the irritant and other side
                effects of the 10% ethanol.<br>
                <br>
                [0072] Esfandiari (Esfandiari et al. Journal of the
                National Medical Association 97(8):1165-1169 2005)
                showed, using a mouse model for hair loss, that mice
                given green tea in their drinking water had a 33% hair
                re-growth rate compared to mice receiving unsupplemented
                drinking water.<br>
                <br>
                [0073] Green tea extracts have not been widely
                considered as effective for topical delivery as the
                extracts rapidly degrade in aqueous solution and are
                unlikely to penetrate an intact epidermal barrier. Hsu,
                S. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology
                52(6):1049-1059 2005. Additionally, even high topical
                concentrations failed to deliver significant levels in
                preliminary studies...<br>
                <br>
                EXAMPLE 1<br>
                <br>
                [0078] The first formulation, found in to U.S. Utility
                patent application Ser. No. 11/242,207, filed on Oct. 3,
                2005, included two topical dihydroxytestosterone (DHT)
                blockers, caffeine and a saw palmetto berry extract.
                Approximately 2400 bottles were manufactured and sold
                with great patient satisfaction and return of patients
                to purchase more. Significant clinical improvement was
                observed by experienced dermatologists with this
                formulation.<br>
                <br>
                [0079] The reduction of the previous caffeine
                concentration, an increase in saw palmetto extract
                concentration, and addition of
                epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) (a potent
                naturally-occurring DHT blocker) were contemplated to
                enhance the hair growth product.<br>
                <br>
                EXAMPLE 2<br>
                <br>
                [0080] The updated formulation, found in U.S.
                Provisional Patent Application No. 61/441,063, filed on
                Feb. 9, 2011, included about 0.01 to 0.19 mg/ml of
                caffeine (about 0.001% to 0.019% weight of
                caffeine/final volume); about 0.01 to 0.2 mg/ml of saw
                palmetto berry extract (about 0.001% to 0.02% weight of
                saw palmetto berry extract/final volume); and about 75
                to 150 mg/ml epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) (about
                7.5% to 15% weight of EGCG/final volume).<br>
                <br>
                [0081] EGCG in high concentration was found not to be
                feasible due to solubility problems. The separation of
                EGCG from the solution led to reductions in
                concentration.<br>
                <br>
                EXAMPLE 3<br>
                <br>
                [0082] The current formulation, described herein,
                includes about 0.01 to 0.19 mg/ml of caffeine (about
                0.001% to 0.019% weight of caffeine/final volume); about
                0.01 to 0.2 mg/ml of saw palmetto berry extract (about
                0.001% to 0.02% weight of saw palmetto berry
                extract/final volume); and about 0.5 to 50 mg/ml
                epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) (about 0.05% to 5%
                weight of EGCG/final volume).<br>
                <br>
                [0083] The current formulation may affect local levels
                of androgenic hormones (i.e. testosterone and
                dihydroxytestosterone). Thus, it is recommended that
                this formulation be used only on men and women of
                non-childbearing potential considering that it has not
                been evaluated in women of childbearing ability.<br>
                <br>
                EXAMPLE 4<br>
                <br>
                [0084] The current formulation is commercially available
                as a shampoo. This shampoo includes the following
                ingredients: D1 water, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate,
                Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamide DEA, Dimethiconol

                Comments -- The source of the coal fly ash is in
                Middletown, Ohio. It is called SunCoke... I lived near
                Tinker for 25 years. And the one thing I've noticed is
                they are building underground. I feel the explosions and
                hear the gigantic vehicles drive underneath, many miles
                per hour (very fast). I left my house because I didn't
                feel it was safe. My house was cracking after it was
                already 40 years old. Now it starts cracking at the
                foundation with all the racket going on over there.?
                Most likely a DUMB (Deep Underground Military Base)
                there as well with all this train cars coming in...<br>

                </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
                </b>In 1891, William B. Coley injected streptococcal
                organisms into a patient with inoperable cancer. He
                thought that the infection he produced would have the
                side effect of shrinking the malignant tumor. He was
                successful, and this was one of the first examples of
                immunotherapy. Over the next forty years, as head of the
                Bone Tumor Service at Memorial Hospital in New York,
                Coley injected more than 1000 cancer patients with
                bacteria or bacterial products. These products became
                known as Coley's Toxins. He and other doctors who used
                them reported excellent results, especially in bone and
                soft-tissue sarcomas.<br>
                <br>
                Despite his reported good results, Coley's Toxins came
                under a great deal of criticism because many doctors did
                not believe his results. This criticism, along with the
                development of radiation therapy and chemotherapy,
                caused Coley's Toxins to gradually disappear from use.
                However, the modern science of immunology has shown that
                Coley's principles were correct and that some cancers
                are sensitive to an enhanced immune system. Because
                research is very active in this field, William B. Coley,
                a bone sarcoma surgeon, deserves the title "Father of
                Immunotherapy."<br>

                New evidence from cardiac researchers demonstrates that
                routine periodic fasting is good for your health, and
                your heart. The study found that fasting not only lowers
                one's risk of coronary artery disease and diabetes, but
                also causes significant changes in a person's blood
                cholesterol levels... <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;This recent study also confirmed earlier findings
                about the effects of fasting on human growth hormone
                (HGH), a metabolic protein. HGH works to protect lean
                muscle and metabolic balance, a response triggered and
                accelerated by fasting. During the 24-hour fasting
                periods, HGH increased an average of 1,300 percent in
                women, and nearly 2,000 percent in men.<br>

                Ozone therapy is a treatment used for disinfecting
                tissues and helping tissue to regenerate. Ozone is a
                negatively charged particle that naturally seeks to
                neutralize anything with a positive charge. Bacteria,
                viruses and fungus all carry a positive charge. The
                negatively-charged ozone seeks out the
                positively-charged microbes, neutralizing and destroying
                them, thus disinfecting the area. Ozone is 8,000 times
                more bactericidal than chlorine!<br>

                Impossibility @ 0:54&nbsp;&nbsp; Cavitations: Ozone gas
                and ozonated saline are used to disinfect areas of
                necrotic bone. As the by-products of ozone are oxygen
                and oxygen, there are no negative side effects from
                using ozone to disinfect tissue.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Periodontal Disease: Ozone gas and
                ozonated water are used to disinfect areas of gum
                disease. Pathogens that cause gum disease are instantly
                neutralized when they come into contact with ozone. For
                severe periodontal disease, special trays can also be
                made to routinely deliver ozone to infected areas.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tooth Decay: Ozone gas and ozonated
                water are used to disinfect teeth prior to placing a
                filling. Not only does this make the success of the
                filling more predictable, but it also decreases the
                sensitivity of the teeth treated.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TMJ: Ozone gas can be used in and
                around the jaw joint to aid in joint rehabilitation.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oral Hygiene: Ozonated water can be
                used as a mouth rinse to kill harmful bacteria.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mouth Sores: Ozonated olive oil can
                be used as a salve for cold sores, canker sores and
                other areas of infection in the mouth.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Root Canals: Although root canals are
                not recommended in our practice, should you choose to
                have root canal therapy instead of having a tooth
                extracted, having the root canal therapy done using
                ozone is HIGHLY beneficial, due to its high
                antimicrobial activity.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tooth Decay: Ozone can be used to
                treat tooth decay by removing the decay-causing bacteria
                on and around the tooth. In fact, if the cavity is not
                too deep, no restoration may be needed at all.<br>
                <br>
                Ozone therapy is a simple, inexpensive, fast and
                non-invasive treatment option.<br>

                Carbon Engineering of Canada are promoting to replace
                all fuels in any vehicle or aircraft globally with a
                fuel manufactured from carbon dioxide sucked from the
                air, hydrogen, water and (renewable) electricity.<br>
                Note they are in the fuel replacement business, not the
                electricity business, and are fearlessly going against
                the oil companies head on, they are in the game like
                Elon Musk, and are surviving, but note they are nowhere
                near Tesla’s capitalized scale just yet.<br>

                Most people have heard of the “mind/body connection” and
                are aware that emotions affect the way people act.&nbsp;
                However, few can describe how that works.&nbsp; What is
                relatively new is our understanding that emotions are
                stored in and around the body as magnetic fields.&nbsp;
                Not only do these magnetic fields cause the biochemical
                effects noted above, but they also block the flow of
                voltage in the associated muscle battery packs that
                provide the voltage necessary for organs to function and
                repair themselves.&nbsp; He will discuss the human
                body’s battery packs, wiring system, and the physics of
                how our electronic systems are affected by these
                emotions.&nbsp; In addition, he will discuss how other
                magnetic fields and scalar energy can be used to erase
                these emotions, leaving behind only memories that do not
                disrupt our health and physiology.<br>

                Dr. Jerry Tennant is board certified in ophthalmology
                and ophthalmic plastic surgery (residency, Harvard
                Medical School and Southwestern Medical School.) He was
                the director of ophthalmic plastic surgery clinic at
                Parkland Hospital in Dallas and practiced from 1965 to
                1995. He did much of the FDA study for the VISX Excimer
                laser and performed approximately 1000 surgeries in the
                United States and Europe. In addition, Dr. Tennant was
                the founder/director of the Dallas Eye Institute and one
                of the first surgeons in the US to place intraocular
                lenses in eyes after cataract surgery and taught these
                techniques around the world. He holds patents for
                medical devices including intraocular lenses and several

                It is proposed a very simple device for controlling the

                  </b></a><b>Scientists Now Know Why People Scream</b><b><br>
                </b><br>
                Normally, your brain takes a sound you hear and delivers
                it to a section of your brain dedicated to making sense
                of these sounds: What is the gender of the speaker?
                Their age? Their tone?<br>
                <br>
                Screams, however, don’t seem to follow that route.
                Instead, the team discovered that screams are sent from
                the ear to the amygdala, the brain’s fear processing
                warehouse, says Poeppel.<br>
                <br>
                “In brain imaging parts of the experiment, screams
                activate the fear circuitry of the brain,” he says. “The
                amygdala is a nucleus in the brain especially sensitive
                to information about fear.” That means screams are
                inherently considered not just sound but a trigger for
                heightened awareness.<br>

                <br>
                From these screams, Poeppel and his team mapped
                “roughness,” an acoustic description for how fast a
                sound changes in loudness. While normal speech modulates
                between 4 and 5 Hz in sound variation, screams spike
                between 30 and 150 Hz. The higher the sound variation,
                the more terrifying the scream is perceived.<br>
                <br>
                Poeppel and his team had volunteers listen to different
                alarm sounds and found people responded to alarms with
                similar variations: The more the alarms varied at higher
                rates, the more terrifying they were judged to be...<br>

                </b>Comments -- The source of the coal fly ash is in
                Middletown, Ohio. It is called SunCoke. I have been
                trying for YEARS to get someone to cover the source of
                the material and have NEVER had anyone willing to stand
                with me on the corner and bring attention to this place.
                EDIT: The steel and coal fired electricity plants ship
                the raw material to Middletown and they are cooked and
                pulverized and THEN shipped to this location and others.
                Go look at the facility and see the MOUNTAIN of the raw
                material. I TRIED to get GEW.org(Dane) to give a shit,
                but I think you know where that went.?.. A venturi
                unloader is used to unload rail cars with powders. Many
                of the rail cars are GATX powder transfer system,
                hundreds of cars are tied by flexible tubing, this
                tubing allows loading and offloading without
                disconnection from one tanker to another ... They call
                them tank trains?... <br>
                Love your research, but the building and the red piping
                you're looking at look like simply like a chiller system
                for air conditioning. In the big building, they would
                have the chillers - these are giant a/c compressors that
                require massive amounts of power - hence the switchyard
                adjacent. They create an enormous amount of heat, which
                is carried away in the water flowing through those pipes
                to the cooling tower, which is a giant evaporative
                cooler that cools the water circulating through the
                chillers. There will be another loop of water pipes
                carrying the chilled water to the areas to be air
                conditioned. The chilled water flows through radiators
                (VAV's) throughout the areas to be conditioned. Each VAV
                has a fan and ducting to direct the cold air where
                needed. Worked as the electrical foreman on a similar
                system in a hotel here in Las Vegas and that's how I
                learned about the system.?<br>
                The HAARP Report -- Thanks, but if the red pipes are
                coming from big A/C compressors, the cooling towers
                would be a few feet away, not hundreds of feet away.
                Some guys are saying the red pipes are "medium voltage
                power lines", LOL.&nbsp; Right, you need 12" of
                insulation around an 11 KV power line... Well, the
                chiller tower has input/output piping, but there are
                still the five pipes going down into the earth, which a
                normal chiller would not have. All in all, there are
                some real mysteries with this building complex. I didn't
                know there would be such an uproar over these two
                videos, I just uploaded this video to document my
                theory, not to show concrete proof. Thanks for your
                comment!? <br>
                The locations where these military aircraft tankers and
                such are taking off and landing from as far as the U.S.
                goes have been identified as Tinker USAF Base in
                Oklahoma (and there are two others in OK, Altus &amp;
                Vance) and either/or/or both Grand Forks in Emerade, N.
                Dakota &amp; Minot in Ward, N. Dakota.?<br>
                I'd say you are quite correct in your assessment of this
                facility. I am very familiar with calcite slurry
                processing, as well as other such process facilities.
                After review of your video here, I'm thinking there is
                more going on here than meets the eye. Very shady
                operation. Sketchy indeed, for an air base.?<br>
                I used google earth pro to switch through all the
                different chronographic footage of that location but it
                looks like google removed the content that you are
                showing?<br>
                I lived near Tinker for 25 years. And the one thing I've
                noticed is they are building underground. I feel the
                explosions and hear the gigantic vehicles drive
                underneath, many miles per hour (very fast). I left my
                house because I didn't feel it was safe. My house was
                cracking after it was already 40 years old. Now it
                starts cracking at the foundation with all the racket
                going on over there.?<br>
                Most likely a DUMB (Deep Underground Military Base)
                there as well with all this train cars coming in. The
                supersonic vacuum tube trams underground aren’t for
                moving heavy equipment and supplies. Just passengers
                mostly. So they would need that many trains to bring
                supplies. The coal ash processing plant makes sense and
                I can def agree with you on that. Also easy to keep an
                eye on all the people working on the High Altitude
                Stratospheric Injection programs with clearance under
                the same blanket of surveillance and access as the
                massive infrastructure of compartmentalization and
                enforcement of silence is already there for the
                underground base and whatever contractors there are
                doing labs and projects below. If only makes sense that
                they would house a facility like this not only on an
                Airforce base but especially on a base with a DUMB
                there.?<br>

                we need more talks providing solutions and that is what

                Social engineering and how even an employee with no SE

                total financial ruin to a company. These Security

                </b>In case you haven’t been following the uproar over
                the flu outbreak, you’ve missed the fact that…<br>
                <br>
                Health authorities admit this year’s flu vaccine is only
                10% effective.<br>
                <br>
                But of course, they urge you to take the vaccine
                anyway....<br>
                <br>
                Why is this year’s vaccine ineffective? Because it’s
                made using chicken eggs, and researchers have discovered
                that the flu virus—which is placed in the
                vaccine—mutates in chicken eggs.<br>
                <br>
                Therefore, by the time a person takes the flu shot, he’s
                not being protected against this year’s seasonal flu
                virus. He’s being protected against a mutated virus that
                isn’t causing the flu this year. <br>
                <br>
                This is the conventional explanation. If you think it’s
                the whole story, I have condos for sale on the moon.<br>
                <br>
                You see, vaccines have been made using chicken eggs—not
                just this year—but for the past 70 years.<br>
                <br>
                Oops.<br>
                <br>
                That would mean the flu vaccine has been ineffective for
                decades.<br>
                <br>
                Healthline.com: “The majority of flu vaccines are grown
                in chicken eggs, a method of vaccine development that’s
                been used for 70 years.”<br>
                <br>
                But wait. There’s more. Much more. I’ll break it down
                into several scandals.<br>
                <br>
                SCANDAL ONE: (I covered this the other day): Dr. Peter
                Doshi, writing in the online BMJ (British Medical
                Journal), reveals a monstrosity.<br>
                <br>
                As Doshi states, every year, hundreds of thousands of
                respiratory samples are taken from flu patients in the
                US and tested in labs. Here is the kicker: only a small
                percentage of these samples show the presence of a flu
                virus.<br>
                <br>
                This means: most of the people in America who are
                diagnosed by doctors with the flu have no flu virus in
                their bodies.<br>
                <br>
                So they don’t have the flu.<br>
                <br>
                Therefore, even if you assume the flu vaccine is useful
                and safe, it couldn’t possibly prevent all those “flu
                cases” that aren’t flu cases.<br>
                <br>
                The vaccine couldn’t possibly work.<br>
                <br>
                The vaccine isn’t designed to prevent fake flu, unless
                pigs can fly.<br>
                <br>
                Here’s the exact quote from Peter Doshi’s BMJ review,
                “Influenza: marketing vaccines by marketing disease”
                (BMJ 2013; 346:f3037):<br>
                <br>
                “…even the ideal influenza vaccine, matched perfectly to
                circulating strains of wild influenza and capable of
                stopping all influenza viruses, can only deal with a
                small part of the ‘flu’ problem because most ‘flu’
                appears to have nothing to do with influenza. Every
                year, hundreds of thousands of respiratory specimens are
                tested across the US. Of those tested, on average 16%
                are found to be influenza positive.”<br>
                <br>
                “…It’s no wonder so many people feel that ‘flu shots’
                don’t work: for most flus, they can’t.”<br>
                <br>
                Because most diagnosed cases of the flu aren’t the flu.<br>
                <br>
                So even if you’re a true believer in mainstream vaccine
                theory, you’re on the short end of the stick here.
                They’re conning your socks off.<br>
                <br>
                The basic flu symptoms—cough, fever, chills, sore
                throat, muscle aches, weakness—can be caused by a
                variety of factors that have nothing to do with a flu
                virus.<br>
                <br>
                SCANDAL TWO: In December of 2005, the British Medical
                Journal (online) published another shocking Peter Doshi
                report, which created tremors through the halls of the
                Centers for Disease Control (CDC), where “the experts”
                used to tell the press that 36,000 people in the US die
                every year from the flu.<br>
                <br>
                Here is a quote from Doshi’s report, “Are US flu death
                figures more PR than science?”(BMJ 2005; 331:1412):<br>
                <br>
                “[According to CDC statistics], ‘influenza and
                pneumonia’ took 62,034 lives in 2001—61,777 of which
                were attributable to pneumonia and 257 to flu, and in
                only 18 cases was the flu virus positively identified.”<br>
                <br>
                Boom.<br>
                <br>
                You see, the CDC has created one overall category that
                combines both flu and pneumonia deaths. Why do they do
                this? Because they disingenuously assume that the
                pneumonia deaths are complications stemming from the
                flu.<br>
                <br>
                This is an absurd assumption. Pneumonia has a number of
                causes.<br>
                <br>
                But even worse, in all the flu and pneumonia deaths,
                only 18 revealed the presence of an influenza virus.<br>
                <br>
                Therefore, the CDC could not say, with assurance, that
                more than 18 people died of influenza in 2001. Not
                36,000 deaths. 18 deaths.<br>
                <br>
                Doshi continued his assessment of published CDC
                flu-death statistics: “Between 1979 and 2001, [CDC] data
                show an average of 1348 [flu] deaths per year (range 257
                to 3006).” These figures refer to flu separated out from
                pneumonia.<br>
                <br>
                This death toll is obviously far lower than the old
                parroted 36,000 figure.<br>
                <br>
                However, when you add the sensible condition that lab
                tests have to actually find the flu virus in patients,
                the numbers of flu deaths plummet even further.<br>
                <br>
                In other words, it’s all promotion and hype.<br>
                <br>
                “Well, uh, we used to say that 36,000 people die from
                the flu every year in the US. But actually, all we can
                prove is about 20 deaths. However, we can’t admit that,
                because if we did, we’d be exposing our gigantic psyop.
                The whole campaign to scare people into getting a flu
                shot would have about the same effect as warning people
                to carry iron umbrellas, in case toasters fall out of
                upper-story windows…and, by the way, we’d be put in
                prison for fraud.”<br>
                <br>
                SCANDAL THREE: The so-called Swine Flu pandemic of 2009.
                This one is a real eye-opener. The CDC was caught with
                its pants down.<br>
                <br>
                Swine Flu was hyped to the sky by the CDC. The Agency
                was calling for all Americans to take the Swine Flu
                vaccine. Remember?<br>
                <br>
                The problem was, the CDC was concealing a very dirty
                secret.<br>
                <br>
                At the time, star CBS investigative reporter, Sharyl
                Attkisson, was working on the Swine Flu story. She
                discovered that the CDC had secretly stopped counting
                cases of the illness—while, of course, continuing to
                warn Americans about its unchecked spread.<br>
                <br>
                Understand that the CDC’s main job is counting cases and
                reporting the numbers.<br>
                <br>
                What was the Agency up to?<br>
                <br>
                Here is an excerpt from my 2014 interview with Sharyl
                Attkisson:<br>
                <br>
                Rappoport: In 2009, you spearheaded coverage of the
                so-called Swine Flu pandemic. You discovered that, in
                the summer of 2009, the Centers for Disease Control,
                ignoring their federal mandate, [secretly] stopped
                counting Swine Flu cases in America. Yet they continued
                to stir up fear about the “pandemic,” without having any
                real measure of its impact. Wasn’t that another
                investigation of yours that was shut down? Wasn’t there
                more to find out?<br>
                <b><br>
                </b>Attkisson: The implications of the story were even
                worse than that. We discovered through our FOI efforts
                that before the CDC mysteriously stopped counting Swine
                Flu cases, they had learned that almost none of the
                cases they had counted as Swine Flu was, in fact, Swine
                Flu or any sort of flu at all! The interest in the story
                from one [CBS] executive was very enthusiastic. He said
                it was “the most original story” he’d seen on the whole
                Swine Flu epidemic. But others pushed to stop it [after
                it was published on the CBS News website] and, in the
                end, no [CBS television news] broadcast wanted to touch
                it. We aired numerous stories pumping up the idea of an
                epidemic, but not the one that would shed original, new
                light on all the hype. It was fair, accurate, legally
                approved and a heck of a story. With the CDC keeping the
                true Swine Flu stats secret, it meant that many in the
                public took and gave their children an experimental
                vaccine that may not have been necessary.<br>
                <br>
                —end of interview excerpt—<br>
                <br>
                I’ll add a few details. It was routine for doctors all
                over America to send blood samples from patients they’d
                diagnosed with Swine Flu, or the “most likely” Swine Flu
                patients, to labs for testing. And overwhelmingly, those
                samples were coming back with the result: not Swine Flu,
                not any kind of flu.<br>
                <br>
                That was the big secret. That’s what the CDC was hiding.
                That’s why they stopped reporting Swine Flu case
                numbers. That’s what Attkisson had discovered. That’s
                why she was shut down.<br>
                <br>
                But it gets even worse.<br>
                <br>
                Because about three weeks after Attkisson’s findings
                were published on the CBS News website, the CDC,
                obviously in a panic, decided to double down. If one lie
                is exposed, tell an even bigger one. A much bigger one.<br>
                <br>
                Here, from a November 12, 2009, WebMD article is the
                CDC’s response: “Shockingly, 14 million to 34 million
                U.S. residents — the CDC’s best guess is 22 million —
                came down with H1N1 swine flu by Oct. 17 [2009].” (“22
                million cases of Swine Flu in US,” by Daniel J. DeNoon).<br>
                <br>
                Are your eyeballs popping? They should be.<br>
                <br>
                In the summer of 2009, the CDC secretly stops counting
                Swine Flu cases in America, because the overwhelming
                percentage of lab tests from likely Swine Flu patients
                shows no sign of Swine Flu or any other kind of flu.<br>
                <br>
                There is no Swine Flu epidemic. <br>
                <br>
                Then, the CDC estimates there are 22 MILLION cases of
                Swine Flu in the US.<br>
                <br>
                So now…when health officials begin waving red flags and
                raising alarms about a current viral flu outbreak, it
                would be more than reasonable to demand they answer
                questions about their past lies and deceptions.<br>
                <br>
                Unless you just want to take them at their word.<br>
                <br>
                If so, good luck. <b><br>

                The press is playing up two angles this winter: the
                seasonal flu vaccine may only be 10% effective; and
                there is an outbreak of flu across 37 states, at last
                count.<br>
                <br>
                Underneath these claims, something far different is
                going on.<br>
                <br>
                Dr. Peter Doshi, writing in the online BMJ (British
                Medical Journal), revealed the monstrosity.<br>
                <br>
                As Doshi states, every year, hundreds of thousands of
                respiratory samples are taken from flu patients in the
                US and tested in labs. Here is the kicker: only a small
                percentage of these samples show the presence of a flu
                virus.<br>
                <br>
                This means: most of the people in America who are
                diagnosed by doctors with the flu have no flu virus in
                their bodies.<br>
                <br>
                So they don’t have the flu.<br>
                <br>
                Therefore, even if you assume the flu vaccine is useful
                and safe, it couldn’t possibly prevent all those “flu
                cases” that aren’t flu cases.<br>
                <br>
                The vaccine couldn’t possibly work...<br>
                <br>
                The vaccine isn’t designed to prevent fake flu, unless
                pigs can fly.<br>
                <br>
                Here’s the exact quote from Peter Doshi’s BMJ review,
                “Influenza: marketing vaccines by marketing disease”
                (BMJ 2013; 346:f3037):<br>
                <br>
                “…even the ideal influenza vaccine, matched perfectly to
                circulating strains of wild influenza and capable of
                stopping all influenza viruses, can only deal with a
                small part of the ‘flu’ problem because most ‘flu’
                appears to have nothing to do with influenza. Every
                year, hundreds of thousands of respiratory specimens are
                tested across the US. Of those tested, on average 16%
                are found to be influenza positive.<br>
                <br>
                “…It’s no wonder so many people feel that ‘flu shots’
                don’t work: for most flus, they can’t.”<br>
                <br>
                Because most diagnosed cases of the flu aren’t the flu.<br>
                <br>
                So even if you’re a true believer in mainstream vaccine
                theory, you’re on the short end of the stick here.
                They’re conning your socks off.<br>
                <br>
                What are typical flu symptoms? Fever, chills, cough,
                sore throat, muscle aches, headache, fatigue. Well,
                these symptoms can be caused by a variety of
                circumstances.<br>
                <br>
                Immediately calling them flu is an unwarranted
                assumption. And as it turns out, respiratory samples
                from patients, sent to labs, are going to come back with
                no sign of the flu, in the overwhelming percentage of
                cases.<br>
                <br>
                But the mainstream press can’t report any of this.<br>
                <br>
                It would topple the flu-treatment money machine.<br>

                The CDC pledges “To base all public health decisions on
                the highest quality scientific data, openly and
                objectively derived.” But Peter Doshi argues that in the
                case of influenza vaccinations and their marketing, this
                is not so<br>
                <br>
                Promotion of influenza vaccines is one of the most
                visible and aggressive public health policies today.
                Twenty years ago, in 1990, 32 million doses of influenza
                vaccine were available in the United States. Today
                around 135 million doses of influenza vaccine annually
                enter the US market, with vaccinations administered in
                drug stores, supermarkets—even some drive-throughs. This
                enormous growth has not been fueled by popular demand
                but instead by a public health campaign that delivers a
                straightforward,
                who-in-their-right-mind-could-possibly-disagree message:
                influenza is a serious disease, we are all at risk of
                complications from influenza, the flu shot is virtually
                risk free, and vaccination saves lives. Through this
                lens, the lack of influenza vaccine availability for all
                315 million US citizens seems to border on the
                unethical. Yet across the country, mandatory influenza
                vaccination policies have cropped up, particularly in
                healthcare facilities,1 precisely because not everyone
                wants the vaccination, and compulsion appears the only
                way to achieve high vaccination rates.2 Closer
                examination of influenza vaccine policies shows that
                although proponents employ the rhetoric of science, the
                studies underlying the policy are often of low quality,
                and do not substantiate officials’ claims. The vaccine
                might be less beneficial and less safe than has been
                claimed, and the threat of influenza appears overstated.<br>
                Now we are all “at risk” of serious complications<br>
                <br>
                Influenza vaccine production has grown parallel to
                increases in the perceived need for the vaccine. In the
                US, the first recommendations for annual influenza
                vaccination were made in 1960 (table1).? Through the
                1990s, the key objective of this policy was to reduce
                excess mortality. Because most of influenza deaths
                occurred in the … <br>

                </b>In 1891, William B Coley injected streptococcal
                organisms into a patient with inoperable cancer. He
                thought that the infection he produced would have the
                side effect of shrinking the malignant tumor. He was
                successful, and this was one of the first examples of
                immunotherapy. Over the next forty years, as head of the
                Bone Tumor Service at Memorial Hospital in New York,
                Coley injected more than 1000 cancer patients with
                bacteria or bacterial products. These products became
                known as Coley's Toxins. He and other doctors who used
                them reported excellent results, especially in bone and
                soft-tissue sarcomas.<br>
                <br>
                Despite his reported good results, Coley's Toxins came
                under a great deal of criticism because many doctors did
                not believe his results. This criticism, along with the
                development of radiation therapy and chemotherapy,
                caused Coley's Toxins to gradually disappear from use.
                However, the modern science of immunology has shown that
                Coley's principles were correct and that some cancers
                are sensitive to an enhanced immune system. Because
                research is very active in this field, William B. Coley,
                a bone sarcoma surgeon, deserves the title "Father of
                Immunotherapy."<br>

                evidence from cardiac researchers demonstrates that
                routine periodic fasting is good for your health, and
                your heart. The study found that fasting not only lowers
                one's risk of coronary artery disease and diabetes, but
                also causes significant changes in a person's blood
                cholesterol levels. <br>
                <br>
                Fasting has long been associated with religious rituals,
                diets, and political protests. Now new evidence from
                cardiac researchers at the Intermountain Medical Center
                Heart Institute demonstrates that routine periodic
                fasting is also good for your health, and your heart.<br>
                <br>
                Research cardiologists at the Intermountain Medical
                Center Heart Institute are reporting that fasting not
                only lowers one's risk of coronary artery disease and
                diabetes, but also causes significant changes in a
                person's blood cholesterol levels. Both diabetes and
                elevated cholesterol are known risk factors for coronary
                heart disease.<br>
                <br>
                The discovery expands upon a 2007 Intermountain
                Healthcare study that revealed an association between
                fasting and reduced risk of coronary heart disease, the
                leading cause of death among men and women in America.
                In the new research, fasting was also found to reduce
                other cardiac risk factors, such as triglycerides,
                weight, and blood sugar levels.<br>
                <br>
                The findings were presented on April 3, at the annual
                scientific sessions of the American College of
                Cardiology in New Orleans.<br>
                <br>
                "These new findings demonstrate that our original
                discovery was not a chance event," says Dr. Benjamin D.
                Horne, PhD, MPH, director of cardiovascular and genetic
                epidemiology at the Intermountain Medical Center Heart
                Institute, and the study's principal investigator. "The
                confirmation among a new set of patients that fasting is
                associated with lower risk of these common diseases
                raises new questions about how fasting itself reduces
                risk or if it simply indicates a healthy lifestyle."<br>
                <br>
                Unlike the earlier research by the team, this new
                research recorded reactions in the body's biological
                mechanisms during the fasting period. The participants'
                low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, the "bad"
                cholesterol) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
                (HDL-C, the "good" cholesterol) both increased (by 14
                percent and 6 percent, respectively) raising their total
                cholesterol -- and catching the researchers by surprise.<br>
                <br>
                "Fasting causes hunger or stress. In response, the body
                releases more cholesterol, allowing it to utilize fat as
                a source of fuel, instead of glucose. This decreases the
                number of fat cells in the body," says Dr. Horne. "This
                is important because the fewer fat cells a body has, the
                less likely it will experience insulin resistance, or
                diabetes."<br>
                <br>
                This recent study also confirmed earlier findings about
                the effects of fasting on human growth hormone (HGH), a
                metabolic protein. HGH works to protect lean muscle and
                metabolic balance, a response triggered and accelerated
                by fasting. During the 24-hour fasting periods, HGH
                increased an average of 1,300 percent in women, and
                nearly 2,000 percent in men.<br>
                <br>
                In this most recent trial, researchers conducted two
                fasting studies of over 200 individuals -- both patients
                and healthy volunteers -- who were recruited at
                Intermountain Medical Center. A second 2011 clinical
                trial followed another 30 patients who drank only water
                and ate nothing else for 24 hours. They were also
                monitored while eating a normal diet during an
                additional 24-hour period. Blood tests and physical
                measurements were taken from all to evaluate cardiac
                risk factors, markers of metabolic risk, and other
                general health parameters.<br>
                <br>
                While the results were surprising to researchers, it's
                not time to start a fasting diet just yet. It will take
                more studies like these to fully determine the body's
                reaction to fasting and its effect on human health. Dr.
                Horne believes that fasting could one day be prescribed
                as a treatment for preventing diabetes and coronary
                heart disease.<br>
                <br>
                To help achieve the goal of expanded research, the
                Deseret Foundation (which funded the previous fasting
                studies) recently approved a new grant to evaluate many
                more metabolic factors in the blood using stored samples
                from the recent fasting clinical trial. The researchers
                will also include an additional clinical trial of
                fasting among patients who have been diagnosed with
                coronary heart disease.<br>
                <br>
                "We are very grateful for the financial support from the
                Deseret Foundation. The organization and its donors have
                made these groundbreaking studies of fasting possible,"
                added Dr. Horne.<br>

                Natural product found to reduce the level of damaged
                cells in the body, caused by aging<br>
                <br>
                Summary:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previous research showed it
                was possible to reduce the burden of damaged cells,
                termed senescent cells, and extend lifespan and improve
                health, even when treatment was initiated late in life.
                They now have shown that treatment of aged mice with the
                natural product Fisetin, found in many fruits and
                vegetables, also has significant positive effects on
                health and lifespan. <br>
                <br>
                Previous research published earlier this year in Nature
                Medicine involving University of Minnesota Medical
                School faculty Paul D. Robbins and Laura J. Niedernhofer
                and Mayo Clinic investigators James L. Kirkland and
                Tamara Tchkonia, showed it was possible to reduce the
                burden of damaged cells, termed senescent cells, and
                extend lifespan and improve health, even when treatment
                was initiated late in life. They now have shown that
                treatment of aged mice with the natural product Fisetin,
                found in many fruits and vegetables, also has
                significant positive effects on health and lifespan.<br>
                <br>
                As people age, they accumulate damaged cells. When the
                cells get to a certain level of damage they go through
                an aging process of their own, called cellular
                senescence. The cells also release inflammatory factors
                that tell the immune system to clear those damaged
                cells. A younger person's immune system is healthy and
                is able to clear the damaged cells. But as people age,
                they aren't cleared as effectively. Thus they begin to
                accumulate, cause low level inflammation and release
                enzymes that can degrade the tissue.<br>
                <br>
                Robbins and fellow researchers found a natural product,
                called Fisetin, reduces the level of these damaged cells
                in the body. They found this by treating mice towards
                the end of life with this compound and see improvement
                in health and lifespan. The paper, "Fisetin is a
                senotherapeutic that extends health and lifespan," was
                recently published in EBioMedicine.<br>
                <br>
                "These results suggest that we can extend the period of
                health, termed healthspan, even towards the end of
                life," said Robbins. "But there are still many questions
                to address, including the right dosage, for example."<br>
                <br>
                One question they can now answer, however, is why
                haven't they done this before? There were always key
                limitations when it came to figuring out how a drug will
                act on different tissues, different cells in an aging
                body. Researchers didn't have a way to identify if a
                treatment was actually attacking the particular cells
                that are senescent, until now.<br>
                <br>
                Under the guidance of Edgar Arriaga, a professor in the
                Department of Chemistry in the College of Science and
                Engineering at the University of Minnesota, the team
                used mass cytometry, or CyTOF, technology and applied it
                for the first time in aging research, which is unique to
                the University of Minnesota.<br>
                <br>
                "In addition to showing that the drug works, this is the
                first demonstration that shows the effects of the drug
                on specific subsets of these damaged cells within a
                given tissue." Robbins said.<br>

                </b><b> Abstract</b><b><br>
                </b><b> Background</b><br>
                Senescence is a tumor suppressor mechanism activated in
                stressed cells to prevent replication of damaged DNA.
                Senescent cells have been demonstrated to play a causal
                role in driving aging and age-related diseases using
                genetic and pharmacologic approaches. We previously
                demonstrated that the combination of dasatinib and the
                flavonoid quercetin is a potent senolytic improving
                numerous age-related conditions including frailty,
                osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. The goal of
                this study was to identify flavonoids with more potent
                senolytic activity.<br>
                <br>
                <b> Methods</b><b><br>
                </b><b> </b>A panel of flavonoid polyphenols was
                screened for senolytic activity using senescent murine
                and human fibroblasts, driven by oxidative and genotoxic
                stress, respectively. The top senotherapeutic flavonoid
                was tested in mice modeling a progeroid syndrome
                carrying a p16INK4a-luciferase reporter and aged
                wild-type mice to determine the effects of fisetin on
                senescence markers, age-related histopathology, disease
                markers, health span and lifespan. Human adipose tissue
                explants were used to determine if results translated.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Findings</b><b><br>
                </b><b> </b>Of the 10 flavonoids tested, fisetin was
                the most potent senolytic. Acute or intermittent
                treatment of progeroid and old mice with fisetin reduced
                senescence markers in multiple tissues, consistent with
                a hit-and-run senolytic mechanism. Fisetin reduced
                senescence in a subset of cells in murine and human
                adipose tissue, demonstrating cell-type specificity.
                Administration of fisetin to wild-type mice late in life
                restored tissue homeostasis, reduced age-related
                pathology, and extended median and maximum lifespan.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Interpretation</b><b><br>
                </b><b> </b>The natural product fisetin has
                senotherapeutic activity in mice and in human tissues.
                Late life intervention was sufficient to yield a potent
                health benefit. These characteristics suggest the
                feasibility to translation to human clinical studies.<br>

                    A team of physicists based at a lab near Rome,
                    Italy, are about to switch on an experiment that
                    could fundamentally alter our understanding of the
                    universe.<br>
                    <br>
                    Over the coming months, they’ll be collecting data
                    for a project known as PADME (short for "Positron
                    Annihilation into Dark Matter Experiment") at a
                    facility run by the National Institute of Nuclear
                    Physics. The goal? To search for a hypothetical
                    particle known as a “dark photon,” which, if
                    detected, would illuminate a mysterious “hidden”
                    realm that is thought to make up the majority of the
                    universe.<br>

                    Currently, scientists cannot explain what more than
                    95 percent of the universe consists of. As a result,
                    they have proposed the existence of hypothetical
                    “dark” forms of energy and matter to help explain
                    the vast gaps in our knowledge.<br>
                    <br>
                    “We both know an awful lot about the dark universe
                    and very little at the same time,” Ethan Brown, a
                    particle physicist from Rensselaer Polytechnic
                    Institute, told Newsweek. “Cosmology measurements
                    can tell us precisely how much dark matter and dark
                    energy exist, and astronomical measurements can even
                    tell us a lot how they behave. Yet we do not have
                    any idea what theory underlies either of them.”<br>
                    <br>
                    Because we have been unable to directly observe the
                    dark universe, or “dark sector,” there are
                    significant questions still to be resolved, such as
                    whether dark matter represents a single new particle
                    or an entire set, for example. Nevertheless,
                    physicists think that they may be able to catch a
                    glimpse of the dark sector by searching for dark
                    photons. In a sense, these elusive particles may act
                    as a kind of “portal” to this hidden realm.<br>
                    <br>
                    “One of the possibilities is that dark matter is not
                    standing in our world but in a separate place that
                    we call the dark sector, which might contain several
                    new particles—not only the dark photon, but a set of
                    particles like we have in the Standard Model of
                    particle physics,” Mauro Raggi, a researcher from
                    the Sapienza University of Rome, who is leading the
                    PADME experiments, told Newsweek.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Standard Model is our best description of the
                    five percent or so of the universe that we can see.
                    It outlines the four fundamental forces that govern
                    nature and all the known elementary particles—those
                    that are not composed of other particles.<br>
                    <br>
                    “This dark sector is basically decoupled from the
                    Standard Model sector,” he said. In this scenario,
                    dark matter particles “have no way of interacting
                    with Standard Model particles,” except if this
                    interaction is mediated by what physicists refer to
                    as a ‘messenger’ particle.”<br>
                    <br>
                    “Dark photons are one realization of the possible
                    portals that connect the dark sector to our sector,”
                    he said. “That’s the reason why we call it a
                    ‘messenger’ particle because it’s the only particle
                    that may be able to interact with both our matter
                    and dark matter.”<br>
                    <br>
                    Furthermore, dark photons could be seen to represent
                    a mysterious new “fifth fundamental force of nature”
                    that is entirely distinct from the four known forces
                    outlined by the Standard Model.<br>
                    <br>
                    Two of these forces are relatively familiar. The
                    first—gravity—causes attraction between objects with
                    mass or energy. It explains everything from how
                    planets orbit around stars to why you don’t go
                    flying off the surface of the Earth as it spins.
                    Meanwhile, the electromagnetic force is responsible
                    for keeping electrons locked to the nuclei of atoms.
                    This force plays a crucial role in determining the
                    properties of most objects in daily life. The other
                    two—the strong and weak nuclear forces—are not so
                    well known, but they're just as crucial. The strong
                    force holds atomic nuclei together, while the weak
                    force is responsible for radioactive decay.<br>
                    <br>
                    In the dark sector, however, there may be another
                    fundamental force. In fact, it’s possible that this
                    realm contains multiple undescribed forces.<br>
                    <br>
                    “At the particle physics level, we can think about
                    forces between two objects as those objects
                    exchanging particles,” Adam Martin, an assistant
                    professor of physics in the College of Science at
                    the University of Notre Dame, told Newsweek. “So, a
                    new particle in the zoo means there is another thing
                    that can be exchanged and therefore a new ‘force.'”<br>
                    <br>
                    If this new fifth force is similar to the
                    electromagnetic force that we have in the visible
                    universe then its mediator is similar to the
                    photon—the basic unit of all light (including
                    visible light, X-rays, microwaves, and the rest of
                    the electromagnetic spectrum). In this sense, dark
                    photons are hypothetical partners, or 'cousins,’ to
                    photons in the observable universe.<br>
                    <br>
                    “These ‘cousins’ are dark because if they exist, we
                    cannot see them, similar to how dark matter is also
                    dark because normal photons don't interact with it,”
                    Brown, said. “[Dark photons] exist theoretically to
                    tie up some problems that we have with the Standard
                    Model of particle physics, which works so well for
                    everything that it describes but contains
                    significant holes. This is because there’s stuff
                    that we know has to exist but we haven’t found it
                    yet. The dark photon could be one of these things.”<br>
                    <br>
                    In the more complex models of what the dark sector
                    may look like, the dark photon could be responsible
                    for the forces that act on the particles in this
                    hidden realm of the universe, according to Brown.<br>
                    <br>
                    “The dark photons could bounce off of these dark
                    sector particles the way normal photons do with
                    normal matter,” he said. “If dark photons exist, and
                    if dark matter is made up of dark sector particles,
                    then the two would be related in this way. Those are
                    a couple of big ‘ifs’, but that's why it's exciting
                    to be able to make measurements to look for dark
                    photons.”<br>
                    <br>
                    Part of the reason there is so much interest in dark
                    photons, aside from their theoretical value, is
                    that, unlike many other exotic hypothetical
                    particles, they are predicted to have a helpful
                    “signature” that scientists can look for using
                    existing technology, negating the need to custom
                    build new multi-billion dollar experiments.<br>
                    <br>
                    It is predicted that dark photons will occasionally
                    "bump" into ordinary matter and behave like an
                    ordinary photon—and the signature of this process
                    could be detected in experiments—although this may
                    happen so rarely that no one has ever seen it
                    before.<br>
                    <br>
                    In the PADME experiments, Raggi and his team will
                    use an accelerator to fire a beam of antimatter
                    particles known as positrons—which as the name
                    suggests, are positively charged—onto an extremely
                    thin diamond wafer full of negatively charged
                    electrons.<br>
                    <br>
                    Normally, this process would annihilate both the
                    positrons and the electrons, producing pure energy,
                    which is then converted into Standard Model photons.<br>
                    <br>
                    “But if you have a new dark force candidate, for
                    example, if you have dark photons, then this might
                    happen to produce not only a visible photon but a
                    dark photon,” Raggi said. “And that’s what we are
                    aiming to search for.”<br>
                    <br>
                    Because the dark photon cannot be observed directly,
                    the researchers will use an extremely precise
                    measuring instrument to compare the characteristics
                    of the visible photon to those of the positron beam.
                    Together, this information will enable them to infer
                    whether a dark photon has been created and what its
                    mass is.<br>
                    <br>
                    Several other teams around the world are searching
                    for dark photons using similar methods, but have
                    come up empty-handed so far due to the difficulty
                    involved in trying to detect them.<br>
                    <br>
                    “The idea of dark photons has been around for a long
                    time, so people certainly have looked,” Martin said.
                    “The problem with them is that there is a huge range
                    of possibilities for their mass and how strongly
                    they interact with normal matter. Without a
                    prediction of where to look, the best we can do is
                    look in as many places as possible and rule out the
                    regions where we see nothing—not a very easy task.”<br>
                    <br>
                    Essentially, this means you have to look at billions
                    of instances where you don’t see a dark photon for
                    the chance to see a single one.<br>
                    <br>
                    “Experiments are tuned to look for dark photons that
                    behave in a particular way, so they search for that
                    kind of dark photon,” Brown said. “If the mass of
                    the photon gets too big or too small, for example,
                    they can’t see it. Failure to find it means you need
                    to look somewhere else, where the dark photon would
                    behave a little bit differently.”<br>
                    <br>
                    “The dark photon could be there and we’ve just never
                    had an experiment that looked in just the right way
                    for it,” he said. “The searches go on until we cover
                    every possible way dark photons could behave, or
                    until we get lucky and discover something new.”<br>
                    <br>
                    PADME differs from previous experiments in the sense
                    that it will utilize beams of positrons, not
                    electrons. This will allow it to search in a window
                    where no one’s ever looked in before, which is why
                    there are such high hopes for it.<br>
                    <br>
                    “If the dark photon is there, they will see it,
                    there’s no question about that,” Brown said.<br>
                    <br>
                    Despite the inherent difficulties, significant
                    progress has been made in the field which will
                    inform the PADME research, Martin explains.<br>
                    <br>
                    “Saying we haven’t 'found' dark photons is the wrong
                    description,” he said. ”After lots of effort—both
                    theoretical and experimental—we’ve learned a lot
                    about what type of dark photon is still allowed.”<br>
                    <br>
                    Preliminary results from PADME are expected by the
                    beginning of 2019, while final results should be
                    ready by the end of the same year. If the team are
                    successful, there is general agreement among
                    scientists that the discovery would revolutionize
                    the field of physics.<br>
                    <br>
                    “It would be ground-breaking,” Brown said. “In
                    particle physics and physics in general, it would
                    probably be the biggest discovery of the last
                    century.”<br>
                    <br>
                    “[It] would have huge implications for physics
                    beyond the Standard Model,” he said. “We know there
                    is more than the Standard Model, but so far we
                    haven't found anything. Whatever the first discovery
                    is will completely change our understanding of the
                    fundamental nature of the universe. Dark photons
                    could well be this, and the upcoming measurements
                    will test this.”<br>
                    <br>
                    There are still many uncertainties in the quest to
                    find dark photons. There is always the possibility
                    that they don’t exist, of course. But even if they
                    do, the complexity of the dark sector is still up
                    for debate. In the simplest models, dark photons may
                    be the only new physics around. Meanwhile, dark
                    matter may just be made up of one particle and could
                    be explained by modifications to the theory of
                    gravity.<br>
                    <br>
                    The more exciting possibility, however, is to
                    imagine that dark photons do exist and that they
                    hold the key to a dark sector containing a
                    fascinating world of undiscovered particles and
                    forces.<br>
                    <br>
                    “If we can find evidence for dark photons, we would
                    have another clue to further our understanding of
                    dark matter and perhaps give us a better idea of
                    where and how to look for it,” Robert McKeown,
                    Deputy Director for Science at the Thomas Jefferson
                    National Accelerator Facility in Virginia, where
                    scientists are also searching for dark photons, told
                    Newsweek.<br>
                    <br>
                    “Until physicists can observe the particles that
                    make up dark matter, our knowledge of the universe
                    is not complete,” he said. “The conclusive
                    observation of a dark photon would give us a
                    possible window into the world of dark matter and
                    would imply new physics beyond the current Standard
                    Model of particle physics. This would be a momentous
                    and fundamental discovery.” <br>

                Theory of mind is the term given by philosophers and
                psychologists for the ability to form a predictive model
                of self and others. In this paper we focus on synthetic
                models of theory of mind. We contend firstly that such
                models — especially when tested experimentally — can
                provide useful insights into cognition, and secondly
                that artificial theory of mind can provide intelligent
                robots with powerful new capabilities, in particular
                social intelligence for human-robot interaction. This
                paper advances the hypothesis that simulation-based
                internal models offer a powerful and realisable,
                theory-driven basis for artificial theory of mind.
                Proposed as a computational model of the simulation
                theory of mind, our simulation-based internal model
                equips a robot with an internal model of itself and its
                environment, including other dynamic actors, which can
                test (i.e., simulate) the robot's next possible actions
                and hence anticipate the likely consequences of those
                actions both for itself and others. Although it falls
                far short of a full artificial theory of mind, our model
                does allow us to test several interesting scenarios: in
                some of these a robot equipped with the internal model
                interacts with other robots without an internal model,
                but acting as proxy humans; in others two robots each
                with a simulation-based internal model interact with
                each other. We outline a series of experiments which
                each demonstrate some aspect of artificial theory of
                mind...<br>

                This video was ACTUALLY made by the bad guys. The
                cameraman is filming his friend as he praises Allah and
                launches mortar rounds at American troops. Little does
                he know that new mortar tracking technology can track
                the trajectory of a hostile round and fire a retaliatory
                shot to precisely the spot from which the hostile round
                was fired. This only requires the hostile mortar to fire
                2 to 3 rounds. Count the number of mortar rounds the
                masked insurgent fires in the video. See how well it
                works. If you listen carefully you can hear the single
                round from the American artillery fired in the distance.
                It comes just after the terrorist fires his third round
                - and his fourth round drops down the tube but that's as
                far as it gets...<br>

                Before his links to the world were cut by his Ecuadorian
                hosts, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange gave an
                interview on how technological advances are changing
                humankind. He said global surveillance will soon be
                totally unavoidable.<br>
                <br>
                The interview was provided to RT by organizers of the
                World Ethical Data Forum in Barcelona. Assange, who is
                currently stranded in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London
                with no outside communication except with his legal
                team, has a pretty grim outlook on where humanity is
                going. He says it will soon be impossible for any human
                being to not be included in global databases collected
                by governments and state-like entities.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This generation being born now… is
                the last free generation. You are born and either
                immediately or within say a year you are known globally.
                Your identity in one form or another –coming as a result
                of your idiotic parents plastering your name and photos
                all over Facebook or as a result of insurance
                applications or passport applications– is known to all
                major world powers.<br>
                <br>
                “A small child now in some sense has to negotiate its
                relationship with all the major world powers… It puts us
                in a very different position. Very few technically
                capable people are able to live apart, to choose to live
                apart, to choose to go their own way,” he added. “It
                smells a bit like totalitarianism – in some way.”<br>
                <br>
                The capacity to collect and process information about
                people has been growing exponentially and will continue
                to grow fast, he stated. With advancements in applying
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) to big data, the next
                logical step is coming.<br>
                <br>
                “Look at what Google and Baidu and Tencent and Amazon
                and Facebook are doing. They are basically open-cut
                harvesting the knowledge of humankind as we express it,
                when we communicate with each other… This classical
                model, which people in academia call ‘surveillance
                capitalism’… has changed now.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s a really very important and
                severe economic change. Which is to take the
                surveillance capitalism model and transform it instead
                into a model that does not yet have a name, an ‘AI
                model’. Which is to use this vast reservoir to train
                Artificial Intelligences of different kinds. This would
                replace not only intermediary sectors –most things you
                do on the internet is in a sense more efficient
                intermediation– but to take over the transport sector,
                or create whole new sectors.<br>
                <br>
                Assange also predicted that the scale of hostile
                activities through cyberspace will see a breakout point
                as soon as AI is trained to sufficiently automate
                hacking attacks.<br>
                <br>
                “There is no border [online]. It’s 220 milliseconds from
                New York to Nairobi. Why would there ever be peace in
                such a scenario?” he said. “[Entities online] are
                creating their own borders using cryptography. But the
                size of the attack surface for any decent-sized
                organization, the number of people, different types of
                software and hardware it has to pull inside itself means
                that it is very hard to establish.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t think it’s really possible to
                come up with borders that are predictable enough and
                stable enough to eliminate conflict. Therefore, there
                will be more conflict."<br>

                The question of Jewish ancestry has been the subject of
                controversy for over two centuries and has yet to be
                resolved. The “Rhineland hypothesis” depicts Eastern
                European Jews as a “population isolate” that emerged
                from a small group of German Jews who migrated eastward
                and expanded rapidly. Alternatively, the “Khazarian
                hypothesis” suggests that Eastern European Jews
                descended from the Khazars, an amalgam of Turkic clans
                that settled the Caucasus in the early centuries CE and
                converted to Judaism in the 8th century. Mesopotamian
                and Greco–Roman Jews continuously reinforced the
                Judaized empire until the 13th century. Following the
                collapse of their empire, the Judeo–Khazars fled to
                Eastern Europe. The rise of European Jewry is therefore
                explained by the contribution of the Judeo–Khazars. Thus
                far, however, the Khazars’ contribution has been
                estimated only empirically, as the absence of
                genome-wide data from Caucasus populations precluded
                testing the Khazarian hypothesis. Recent sequencing of
                modern Caucasus populations prompted us to revisit the
                Khazarian hypothesis and compare it with the Rhineland
                hypothesis. We applied a wide range of population
                genetic analyses to compare these two hypotheses. Our
                findings support the Khazarian hypothesis and portray
                the European Jewish genome as a mosaic of Near
                Eastern-Caucasus, European, and Semitic ancestries,
                thereby consolidating previous contradictory reports of
                Jewish ancestry. We further describe a major difference
                among Caucasus populations explained by the early
                presence of Judeans in the Southern and Central
                Caucasus. Our results have important implications for
                the demographic forces that shaped the genetic diversity
                in the Caucasus and for medical studies.<br>

                Two new articles deal with political/genetic
                controversies over the origins of “the Jewish people”
                (of whom I consider myself a part for one tribal reason
                or another). Here is Israeli historian Schlomo Sand in
                Le Monde Diplomatique, writing, “Israel Deliberately
                Forgets Its History.” Sand says that the Jewish exile of
                70 AD is a myth, and “the Jews” of Europe were created
                by conversion.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there is the question of the
                exile of 70 AD. There has been no real research into
                this turning point in Jewish history, the cause of the
                diaspora. And for a simple reason: the Romans never
                exiled any nation from anywhere on the eastern seaboard
                of the Mediterranean…<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if there was no exile after 70
                AD, where did all the Jews who have populated the
                Mediterranean&nbsp; since antiquity come from? The
                smokescreen of national historiography hides an
                astonishing reality. From the Maccabean revolt of the
                mid-2nd century BC to the Bar Kokhba revolt of the 2nd
                century AD, Judaism was the most actively proselytising
                religion…<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most significant mass conversion
                occurred in the 8th century, in the massive Khazar
                kingdom between the Black and Caspian seas. The
                expansion of Judaism from the Caucasus into modern
                Ukraine created a multiplicity of communities, many of
                which retreated from the 13th century Mongol invasions
                into eastern Europe. There, with Jews from the Slavic
                lands to the south and from what is now modern&nbsp;
                Germany, they formed the basis of Yiddish culture…<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until about 1960 the complex origins
                of the Jewish people were more or less reluctantly
                acknowledged by Zionist historiography. But thereafter
                they were marginalised and finally erased from Israeli
                public memory. The Israeli forces who seized Jerusalem
                in 1967 believed themselves to be the direct descendents
                of the mythic kingdom of David rather than – God forbid
                – of Berber warriors or Khazar horsemen. The Jews
                claimed to constitute a specific ethnic group that had
                returned to Jerusalem, its capital, from 2,000 years of
                exile and wandering.<br>
                <br>
                Hillel Halkin somewhat concedes the point in Commentary,
                writing that DNA studies suggest that “Jews” owe a lot
                to intermixing of genes in eastern Europe and Asia.
                Halkin briefly sounds an enlightened note:<br>
                <br>
                Perhaps one day Israel will be become the “state of all
                its citizens”that democratic values require it to be, a
                country of Hebrew-speakingJews, Muslims, and Christians,
                all equal before the law. Although thegreat majority of
                secular Israelis do not yet subscribe to this pointof
                view, more and more will come to it if things continue
                on theirpresent course.<br>
                <br>
                As for Palestine, Schlomo Sand suggests that the
                Palestinians are the people we call “the Jews” in the
                Bible:<br>
                <br>
                Apart from enslaved prisoners, the population of Judea
                continued to live on their lands, even after the
                destruction of the second temple [in 70 AD]. Some
                converted to Christianity in the 4th century, while the
                majority embraced Islam during the 7th century Arab
                conquest.<br>
                <br>
                Most Zionist thinkers were aware of this: Yitzhak Ben
                Zvi, later president of Israel, and David Ben Gurion,
                its first prime minister, accepted it as late as 1929,
                the year of the great Palestinian revolt. Both stated on
                several occasions that the peasants of Palestine were
                the descendants of the inhabitants of ancient Judea.<br>

                I guess that’s why I’m for the right of return. Hey,
                we’re all just people. Can’t we all just get along??<br>

                Both stated on several occasions that the peasants of
                Palestine were the descendants of the inhabitants of
                ancient Judea.<br>
                <br>
                This was no acknowledgement of superior Palestinian
                claims to the land due to their indigeneity, but an
                attempt to claim that the Palestinians would therefore
                welcome the Jewish “return”. The idea was first
                developed by Ber Borochov, I think, the “Marxist
                Zionist”, and Ben-Gurion and Ben-Zvi wrote about it in
                NY in 1919, a further flight of crackpot realism, having
                spent the war in the US, trying to recruit a Jewish army
                to fight on the Ottoman side.<br>

                &nbsp;There's something mysterious coming up from the
                frozen ground in Antarctica, and it could break physics
                as we know it.<br>
                <br>
                Physicists don't know what it is exactly. But they do
                know it's some sort of cosmic ray — a high-energy
                particle that's blasted its way through space, into the
                Earth, and back out again. But the particles physicists
                know about — the collection of particles that make up
                what scientists call the Standard Model (SM) of particle
                physics — shouldn't be able to do that. Sure, there are
                low-energy neutrinos that can pierce through miles upon
                miles of rock unaffected. But high-energy neutrinos, as
                well as other high-energy particles, have "large
                cross-sections." That means that they'll almost always
                crash into something soon after zipping into the Earth
                and never make it out the other side.<br>
                <br>
                And yet, since March 2016, researchers have been
                puzzling over two events in Antarctica where cosmic rays
                did burst out from the Earth, and were detected by
                NASA's Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) — a
                balloon-borne antenna drifting over the southern
                continent.<br>
                <br>
                ANITA is designed to hunt cosmic rays from outer space,
                so the high-energy neutrino community was buzzing with
                excitement when the instrument detected particles that
                seemed to be blasting up from Earth instead of zooming
                down from space. Because cosmic rays shouldn't do that,
                scientists began to wonder whether these mysterious
                beams are made of particles never seen before.<br>
                <br>
                Since then, physicists have proposed all sorts of
                explanations for these "upward going" cosmic rays, from
                sterile neutrinos (neutrinos that rarely ever bang into
                matter) to "atypical dark matter distributions inside
                the Earth," referencing the mysterious form of matter
                that doesn't interact with light [The 18 Biggest
                Unsolved Mysteries in Physics]<br>
                <br>
                All the explanations were intriguing, and suggested that
                ANITA might have detected a particle not accounted for
                in the Standard Model. But none of the explanations
                demonstrated conclusively that something more ordinary
                couldn't have caused the signal at ANITA.<br>
                <br>
                A new paper uploaded today (Sept. 26) to the preprint
                server arXiv changes that. In it, a team of
                astrophysicists from Penn State University showed that
                there have been more upward-going high-energy particles
                than those detected during the two ANITA events. Three
                times, they wrote, IceCube (another, larger neutrino
                observatory in Antarctica) detected similar particles,
                though no one had yet connected those events to the
                mystery at ANITA. And, combining the IceCube and ANITA
                data sets, the Penn State researchers calculated that,
                whatever particle is bursting up from the Earth, it has
                much less than a 1-in-3.5 million chance of being part
                of the Standard Model. (In technical, statistical terms,
                their results had confidences of 5.8 and 7.0 sigma,
                depending on which of their calculations you're looking
                at.)<br>

                ..."It was clear from the start that if the ANITA
                anomalous events are due to particles that had
                propagated through thousands of kilometers of Earth,
                then those particles were very likely not SM particles,"
                said Mauricio Bustamante, an astrophysicist at the Niels
                Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen, who was
                not an author on the new paper...<br>

                If standard model particle created these anomalies, they
                should have been neutrinos. Researchers know that both
                because of the particles they decayed into, and because
                no other standard model particle would even have a
                fragment of a chance in a million of making it through
                the Earth.<br>
                <br>
                But neutrinos of this energy, Louis said, just shouldn't
                make it through the Earth often enough for ANITA or
                IceCube to detect. It's not how they work. But neutrino
                detectors like ANITA and IceCube don't detect neutrinos
                directly. Instead, they detect the particles that
                neutrinos decay into after smashing into Earth's
                atmosphere or Antarctic ice. And there are other events
                that can generate those particles, triggering the
                detectors. This paper strongly suggests that those
                events must have been supersymmetric, Louis said, though
                he added that more data is necessary.<br>
                <br>
                Fox and his colleagues went on to argue that the
                particles are most likely to be a sort of theoretical
                supersymmetric particle called "stau sleptons." Stau
                sleptons are supersymmetric versions of a Standard Model
                particle called the tau lepton. The "S" is for
                "supersymmetric" (really)...<br>
