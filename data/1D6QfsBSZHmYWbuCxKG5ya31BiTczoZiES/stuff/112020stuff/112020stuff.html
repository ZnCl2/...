          </b>Researchers identify positive effector behind reduced food
          intake<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Reduced food intake, known as dietary restriction, leads to a
          longer lifespan in many animals and can improve health in
          humans. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the
          positive effects of dietary restriction are still unclear.
          Researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Biology of
          Ageing have now found one possible explanation in fruit flies:
          they identified a protein named Sestrin that mediates the
          beneficial effects of dietary restriction. By increasing the
          amount of Sestrin in flies, researchers were able to extend
          their lifespan and at the same time these flies were protected
          against the lifespan-shortening effects of a protein-rich
          diet. The researchers could further show that Sestrin plays a
          key role in stem cells in the fly gut thereby improving the
          health of the fly.<br>
          <br>
          The health benefits of dietary restriction have long been
          known. Recently, it has become clear that restriction of
          certain food components, especially proteins and their
          individual building blocks, the amino acids, is more important
          for the organism's response to dietary restriction than
          general calorie reduction. On the molecular level, one
          particular well-known signalling pathway, named TOR pathway,
          is important for longevity.<br>

          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>Before Joe Biden rode the coattails of a stolen election,
          he was busy running an international pyramid scheme, using his
          power and influence as vice president to cash in on his son’s
          business deals with Chinese and Ukrainian oligarchs. According
          to tax filings, Joe Biden also ran a cancer charity pyramid
          scheme that redistributed millions of dollars to his friends
          while spending zero on cancer research.<br>
          <br>
          The Biden Cancer Initiative, founded in 2017 by Joe and Jill
          Biden, promised to “develop and drive implementation of
          solutions to accelerate progress in cancer prevention,
          detection, diagnosis, research, and care to reduce disparities
          in cancer outcomes.” Instead of providing preventative care
          and investing in research on cancer healing, the “charity”
          took large sums of money away from donors and passed it on to
          drug company executives sitting in leadership positions with
          the charity.<br>

          Brazil President Says "No" - Won't Take COVID Vaccine --
          Neither Should You!<br>
          Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro says that he will not take
          a coronavirus vaccine.&nbsp; (Neither should you)<br>
          During a press briefing broadcast live over multiple social
          media platforms, Bolsonaro said that he has already decided to
          refuse a future coronavirus vaccine.<br>
          “I’m telling you, I’m not going to take it. It’s my right,” he
          said.<br>
          The right-wing leader has repeatedly stated that Brazilians
          will not be required to be vaccinated once a Chinese
          coronavirus vaccine becomes widely available. Bolsonaro
          reiterated this at a press briefing, saying that Brazil’s
          Congress was unlikely to require Brazilians to take a future
          coronavirus vaccine.<br>
          “The [Brazilian] president also expressed skepticism about the
          effectiveness of the use of masks during the live broadcast,
          implying that there was little conclusive evidence of its
          success in curbing the transmission of the virus,” according
          to South American news site Infobae.<br>
          Bolsonaro has tested positive for the Chinese coronavirus at
          least two times. After contracting the virus for the first
          time on July 7, Bolsonaro said he initially suffered from a
          low-grade fever and mild symptoms. Announcing his positive
          diagnosis at a press conference held outside on the grounds of
          Brazil’s presidential palace, Bolsonaro stepped back and
          removed his mask to demonstrate to the public that he was
          “absolutely fine” despite the mild symptoms.<br>
          He subsequently entered a period of semi-isolation for nearly
          20 days while recovering from the virus. During this period,
          the leader continued to venture out on the grounds of the
          presidential palace to greet his supporters. A proponent of
          the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine as an
          anti-coronavirus therapy, Bolsonaro said he received the drug
          as part of his own treatment. The president announced via
          Twitter on July 25 that he had tested negative for
          coronavirus.<br>
          “I’m healed from Covid. I have antibodies, no problems. In my
          particular case, I first thank God, and secondly, the
          medication prescribed by the presidential doctor:
          hydroxychloroquine,” Bolsonaro said on July 30.<br>
          “The following day, I was already OK. If it was a coincidence
          or not, I don’t know. But it works,” the leader added.<br>

          <b>ALTERS HUMAN DNA</b><br>
          There are real issues surrounding the so-called COVID-19
          Vaccines.&nbsp; They are NOT "vaccines" in any traditional
          sense.<br>
          In the past, to create a vaccine, scientists isolated in a
          laboratory, the pathogen which causes illness.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Once isolated, scientists take the DNA "guts" out of the
          virus, and replace those "guts" with harmless yeast
          guts.&nbsp; In other words, they "recombine" the virus with
          harmless yeast guts.&nbsp; <br>
          So the outside of the virus looks like the pathogen making
          people sick, but the guts are harmless yeast.&nbsp; This is
          called a "recombinant" vaccine because they recombined the
          outer virus envelope with harmless yeast DNA guts.<br>
          They reproduce this new harmless "virus" and inject the
          harmless recombinant virus into humans.<br>
          When our body sees the outside of this "invader" it begins its
          immune response and we develop immunity to what the original
          virus LOOKED LIKE on its outside.&nbsp; <br>
          THAT is how old vaccines worked.<br>
          This new COVID-19 vaccine is nothing like the old.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          This new vaccine contains "messenger RNA"&nbsp;
          Ribo-nucleic-acid; a base level of Deoxy-ribonucleic-acid
          (DNA).&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
          It "programs" the human into whom it is injected so that
          human's DNA triggers a response to what would be COVID-19.<br>
          The trouble is, scientists don't know exactly what ELSE this
          RNA might "program" once is is let loose inside a human!<br>
          It might start re-programming OTHER aspects of human
          DNA.&nbsp; <br>
          In a horrifying possibility, once unleashed, these "messenger
          RNA" particles could turn someone from human into . . . . not
          human!<br>
          There's no way to tell.<br>
          Worse, there's no way to UN DO what this messenger RNA
          does.&nbsp; The changes are permanent and cannot be undone.<br>
          From a scientific stand point, there could be deadly results
          from this messenger RNA if it causes changes to a human that
          make it impossible for the person to live.<br>
          Almost 100% of the people who agreed to accept this vaccine in
          clinical trials, have had very strong adverse reactions to
          it.&nbsp; Some have DIED!<br>
          ALL of the animal testing of this vaccine had to be stopped
          because ALL the animals DIED.<br>
          Instead of taking this as a red flag warning, authorities
          merely "waived" the requirement for animal testing and went
          straight to human testing!!!!!!!<br>
          As stated earlier, almost 100% of those who received the
          vaccine in trials, suffered VERY STRONG adverse reactions.<br>
          That's the scientific aspect, but there's another aspect: From
          a RELIGIOUS stand point, it could alter a person so they are
          no longer recognizable as "human" by God.<br>
          The book of Revelations warns about this, and does so
          SPECIFICALLY in Revelation 18:23 --<br>
          And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee;
          and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be
          heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great
          men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations
          deceived.<br>
          We all know the Bible was translated from Hebrew / Aramaic
          into Greek, first.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is the origin of sorcery
          in Greek language: Pharmakeia (Pharmaceuticals!) (Link)<br>
          So Brazil President Balsonaro has multiple reasons for him NOT
          TAKING the vaccine.&nbsp; Now, you have those same reasons.<br>
          Do not be deceived by Pharmaceutical companies into taking a
          vaccine that alters your DNA.&nbsp; The changes it causes will
          be irreversible and could cost you literally everything.<br>

          </b>Modern microscopes used for biological imaging are
          expensive, are located in specialized laboratories and require
          highly qualified staff. To research novel, creative approaches
          to address urgent scientific issues — for example in the fight
          against infectious diseases such as Covid-19 — is thus
          primarily reserved for scientists at well-equipped research
          institutions in rich countries. A young research team from the
          Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technology (Leibniz IPHT) in
          Jena, the Friedrich Schiller University and Jena University
          Hospital wants to change this: The researchers have developed
          an optical toolbox to build microscopes for a few hundred
          euros that deliver high-resolution images comparable to
          commercial microscopes that cost a hundred to a thousand times
          more. With open-source blueprints, components from the 3D
          printer and smartphone camera, the UC2 (You. See. Too.)
          modular system can be combined specifically in the way the
          research question requires — from long-term observation of
          living organisms in the incubator to a toolbox for optics
          education...<br>

            <br>
          </b>Think outside the scope of a full microscopic setup and
          analyse it from scratch: You will find that many of such
          setups are based around 4f configurations, where focal lengths
          of adjacent lenses can be concatenated. Perfect conditions for
          unitised optical building blocks, which are the basis for our
          general optical toolbox – UC2. Following the users‘ needs, the
          modular building blocks can hold specific functions such as
          lenses, mirrors or displays to realize a wide variety of
          different setups. Basically there is no limitation to not use
          the blocks for many more applications from magnifying glasses
          to tele- and microscopes or simply just as building blocks for
          your creativity. The UC2 System is more than just the sum of
          all individual components.<br>

          <br>
          The ability of the COVID-19 agent to adhere to several
          different receptors at once made the scientists study actively
          to which other types of protein molecules the coronavirus may
          bind and how this affects the course of the disease<br>
          <br>
          Molecular biologists from China have discovered first evidence
          of the fact that the coronavirus penetrates human cells not
          only by using the "lung" ACE2 receptor but also the SR-B1
          receptors which recognize cholesterol molecules. Their
          findings were published in the Nature Metabolism journal.<br>

          "Commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection
          suggest that antibodies, peptides and small compounds
          targeting ACE2 can be used in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
          Identifying SR-B1 as a SARS-CoV-2 entry cofactor, we propose
          that drugs that target SR-B1 could act as antivirals that
          limit SARS-CoV-2 infection. As a proof of concept, we have
          shown that ITX 5601, a clinically approved inhibitor of HCV
          infection, strongly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of cultured

          brains of 45 people with psychiatric disorders and 15

            Abstract <br>
          </b>Major psychiatric disorders affect 25% of the population.
          While genetic and environmental risk factors have been
          identiﬁed, the underlying pathophysiology of conditions, such
          as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression
          remains largely unknown. Here, we show that endothelial
          associated tight junction components are differentially
          regulated at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in distinct
          neuroanatomic regions of human donor brain tissues. Previous
          studies have shown associations between BBB disruption and the
          development of psychiatric behaviours in rodents. Using
          immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR, we show that the expression
          of claudin-5 is reduced in the hippocampus of individuals
          diagnosed with major depression or schizophrenia. We also show
          that levels of tight junction mRNA transcripts, including
          claudin-5, claudin-12 and ZO-1 correlate with disease duration
          and age of onset of a range of psychiatric disorders.
          Together, these data show that BBB associated tight junction
          disruption and dysregulation is a common pathology observed
          across the major psychiatric disorders. Targeting and
          regulating tight junction protein integrity at the BBB could,
          therefore, represent a novel therapeutic strategy for these
          conditions.<b><br>

          Krabbenhoft.<br>
          <br>
          Krabbenhoft leaving after 24 years in the position appeared
          after he sent an email to the company's 50,000 staff last week
          informing them he didn't need to wear a mask because he is
          immune to COVID-19.<br>
          <br>
          'For me to wear a mask defies the efficacy and purpose of a
          mask and sends an untruthful message that I am susceptible to
          infection or could transmit it,' he wrote.<br>

          use by the general population violates every notion of serious
          infectious management that I was trained to adhere to, so some
          of this is absurd.'<br>

          He said he thinks that he is now immune to the virus for 'at

              aging process</b><br>
            <i>“We are going backwards in time,” Prof. Shai Efrati said.</i><br>
            <b>&nbsp;By MAAYAN JAFFE-HOFFMAN</b><br>

          <b><br>
          </b>Israeli scientists say they have managed to successfully
          reverse the biological aging process – using only oxygen.<br>
          Recent research led by Tel Aviv University’s Prof. Shai
          Efrati, together with a team from Shamir Medical Center, found
          that when healthy adults over the age of 64 were placed in a
          pressurized chamber and given pure oxygen for 90 minutes a
          day, five days a week for three months, not only was the aging
          process delayed - it was actually reversed.<br>
          <br>
          Specifically, the study, which is published in the
          peer-reviewed journal Aging, focused on whether the process
          could reverse two key indicators of biological aging: the
          shortening of DNA telomeres and the accumulation of resultant
          senescent cells.<br>
          A telomere is the end of a chromosome. Telomeres are made of
          repetitive sequences of non-coding DNA that serve as bumpers
          to protect the chromosome from damage during replication.
          Every time replication happens, these bumpers take a hit,
          making them shorter and shorter. Once the telomere reaches a
          certain length, the cell cannot replicate anymore, which leads
          to senescent cells: aging, malfunctioning cells that
          ultimately lead to cognitive or other age-related disabilities
          and even diseases, such as cancer.<br>
          <br>
          Some 35 adults over the age of 64 were involved in the study
          and were administered hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)
          utilizing 100% oxygen in an environmental pressure higher than
          one absolute atmospheres to enhance the amount of oxygen
          dissolved in the body's tissues. <br>
          Every 20 minutes, the participants were asked to remove their
          masks for five minutes, bringing their oxygen back to normal
          levels. However, during this period, researchers saw that
          fluctuations in the free oxygen concentration were interpreted
          at the cellular level as a lack of oxygen – rather than
          interpreting the absolute level of oxygen.<br>
          <br>
          In other words, repeated intermittent hyperoxic (increased
          oxygen level) exposures induced many of the mediators and
          cellular mechanisms that are usually induced during hypoxia
          (decreased oxygen levels) – something Efrati explained is
          called the hyperoxic-hypoxic paradox.<br>
          <br>
          “The oxygen fluctuation we generated is what is important,” he
          told The Jerusalem Post. “During this process, a state of
          oxygen shortage resulted, which caused cell
          regeneration.”&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          The practical ramifications include improvements in attention,
          information processing speed and executive functions, which
          normally decline with aging and about which more than 50% of
          people over the age of 60 express concern. According to the
          study, the changes were equivalent to how the participants’
          bodies were at the cellular level 25 years earlier.<br>
          “We are not [just] slowing the decline - we are going
          backwards in time,” Efrati said. <br>
          Efrati has been studying the aging process for a decade and
          runs the Aviv Clinics in Florida. This study, he said, is
          proof that the cellular basis for the aging process can be
          reversed, adding that it “gives hope and opens the door for a
          lot of young scientists to target aging as a reversible
          disease.” It could also enable doctors and scientists to find
          a way to monitor telomere length and develop medications that
          could help them grow back when needed.<br>
          <br>
          Will it make people live longer? <br>
          The effect’s duration is yet to be determined in the
          long-term, Efrati said. But “probably yes. We know that people
          with shorter telomeres die earlier, so it makes sense.”<br>
          One disadvantage of the study was its limited sample size.<br>
          Efrati added the experiment was conducted using a scientific,
          monitored HBOT chamber and people should not try this at home.
          He said, “There is a lot of junk out there” claiming sacs
          inflated with air are hyperbaric treatments. “This is not what
          is being used in the studies, it is not effective – and
          moreover, it could be dangerous.”<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>Understanding the emergence of novel viruses requires an
          accurate and comprehensive annotation of their genomes.
          Overlapping genes (OLGs) are common in viruses and have been
          associated with pandemics but are still widely overlooked. We
          identify and characterize ORF3d, a novel OLG in SARS-CoV-2
          that is also present in Guangxi pangolin-CoVs but not other
          closely related pangolin-CoVs or bat-CoVs. We then document
          evidence of ORF3d translation, characterize its protein
          sequence, and conduct an evolutionary analysis at three
          levels: between taxa (21 members of Severe acute respiratory
          syndrome-related coronavirus), between human hosts (3978
          SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences), and within human hosts (401
          deeply sequenced SARS-CoV-2 samples). ORF3d has been
          independently identified and shown to elicit a strong antibody
          response in COVID-19 patients. However, it has been
          misclassified as the unrelated gene ORF3b, leading to
          confusion. Our results liken ORF3d to other accessory genes in
          emerging viruses and highlight the importance of OLGs.<br>

          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>Scientists have figured out a way to perfectly beam energy
          across any room, thanks to a sci-fi like device they call an
          "anti-laser."<br>
          <br>
          The idea is simple: Just like a laser emits light particles,
          or photons, one after another in a neat and orderly row, an
          anti-laser sucks up photons one after another in reverse
          order. Researchers have long speculated that a device like
          this might make wires and charging cables a thing of the past,
          allowing people to beam energy invisibly across a room to a
          laptop or phone and power it without plugging it in. But
          though basic anti-lasers have been tested before, the real
          world isn't as neat and orderly as a laser pointed at a fixed
          receiver in a laboratory. Electronics move around, objects get
          in the way, walls reflect energy in unexpected ways. The new
          anti-laser demonstrated in this experiment accounts for all
          that, and it receives scattered energy beamed around a space
          in an unpredictable pattern — still receiving 99.996% of the
          sent power.<br>
          <br>
          The formal term for the method they used is "coherent perfect
          absorption" (CPA). CPA uses one machine to send power across
          the room, and another (the "anti-laser") to suck it back up.
          Past CPA experiments, the researchers wrote in a paper
          published Nov. 17 in the journal Nature Communications, were
          exciting but had a fundamental limitation: the direction of
          time. The experiments worked only in situations where time
          could flow as easily backward as forward, which rarely exist
          in our day-to-day lives.<br>
          <br>
          The simplest model of an anti-laser setup, involving a laser
          pointer shooting photons one after another into a receiver
          that gobbles them up, would look basically the same whether
          you played a tape of its action forward or backward: Photon
          pops out of one device, travels across space and enters the
          other device. Setups like this, in physics terms, are said to
          have "time reversal symmetry." Time-reversal symmetry only
          pops up in systems without much entropy, or the inherent
          tendency of systems to descend into disorder.<br>
          <br>
          Until now, even the most complex CPA experiments have had time
          reversal symmetry. Some were more complex than the laser
          pointer aimed at a receiver. But even complicated projects
          have that symmetry if they're set up such that the process can
          be reversed.<br>
          <br>
          (Here's an example of how a complicated event can be time
          reversal symmetric: Imagine a videotape of a hobbyist picking
          up Lego pieces from a neatly organized case and using them to
          build a model Eiffel Tower. The result would look complicated,
          but the tape would record where every piece had gone, so
          playing the tape backward would just show the hobbyist taking
          apart the pieces and organizing them again.)<br>
          <br>
          But for this new work, the researchers used magnetic fields to
          jostle the photons so aggressively that time reversal symmetry
          was lost. The process of transferring power — shooting the
          photons — was like stirring soup: It doesn't work backward.
          (Imagine trying to un-stir soup.) But the device still
          received the power.<br>
          <br>
          This "proves that the concept of CPA goes far beyond its
          initial conception as a 'time-reversed laser,'" the
          researchers wrote in their paper, suggesting it might one day
          have practical applications in the real world. That's because
          the real world isn't as neat as a time-reversible laboratory
          experiment. It's messy and unpredictable, and never
          time-reversible over the long term. For CPA to work in those
          challenging conditions, it has to be able to deal with it.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers pulled off this non-time reversed CPA in two
          experimental setups, both using microwave energy. The first
          was a "labyrinth" of wires that photons had to navigate to
          reach a receiver. The second was a small, irregular "brass
          cavity" with a receiver in the middle, which the photons
          reached after scattering and traversing the open space in the
          cavity.<br>
          <br>
          To pull this off, the researchers emitted microwaves of
          different properties, and tested which combination of
          frequencies, amplitudes and phases (three features of any
          electromagnetic wave) was most likely to land on the receiver
          and get absorbed — even after passing through the magnetic
          fields and the labyrinth or irregular open space. In each
          case, they determined an ideal "tuning" of the microwave
          emitter that caused most of the microwaves to get absorbed
          (99.999% in the labyrinth, 99.996% in the open space). In
          real-world applications (like your living room), the emitter
          would test and retest the different frequencies, amplitudes
          and phases to transfer photons to its receiver.<br>
          <br>
          There are three major potential applications of this
          technology. The first is wireless energy transfer at a
          distance, the researchers wrote. (Goodbye to plugging in your
          laptop.) Another is a sensing device that could detect subtle
          changes in any room where the photons are scattered. (Imagine
          a security camera that can feel an intruder moving through a
          room.)<br>
          <br>
          The third is a messaging system that could securely transfer
          information to a hidden receiver; signals sent over CPA could
          use the constantly-changing tuning numbers as a sort of
          password to encrypt data. Only the receiver or someone who
          knew the receiver's exact behavior from moment to moment could
          decrypt the message.<br>
          <br>
          Any such real-world uses are still a long way off. But this
          experiment shows they're at least possible, the researchers
          wrote.<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>Wavefront shaping (WFS) schemes for efficient energy
          deposition in weakly lossy targets is an ongoing challenge for
          many classical wave technologies relevant to next-generation
          telecommunications, long-range wireless power transfer, and
          electromagnetic warfare. In many circumstances these targets
          are embedded inside complicated enclosures which lack any type
          of (geometric or hidden) symmetry, such as complex networks,
          buildings, or vessels, where the hypersensitive nature of
          multiple interference paths challenges the viability of WFS
          protocols. We demonstrate the success of a general WFS scheme,
          based on coherent perfect absorption (CPA) electromagnetic
          protocols, by utilizing a network of coupled transmission
          lines with complex connectivity that enforces the absence of
          geometric symmetries. Our platform allows for control of the
          local losses inside the network and of the violation of
          time-reversal symmetry via a magnetic field; thus establishing
          CPA beyond its initial concept as the time-reversal of a laser
          cavity, while offering an opportunity for better insight into
          CPA formation via the implementation of semiclassical tools...<br>

          <b>ABSTRACT</b><b><br>
          </b>The striking differences between quantum and classical
          systems predicate disruptive quantum technologies. We peruse
          quantumness from a variety of viewpoints, concentrating on
          phase-space formulations because they can be applied beyond
          particular symmetry groups. The symmetry-transcending
          properties of the Husimi Q function make it our basic tool. In
          terms of the latter, we examine quantities such as the Wehrl
          entropy, inverse participation ratio, cumulative multipolar
          distribution, and metrological power, which are linked to the
          intrinsic properties of any quantum state. We use these
          quantities to formulate extremal principles and determine in
          this way which states are the most and least “quantum”; the
          corresponding properties and potential usefulness of each
          extremal principle are explored in detail. While the extrema
          largely coincide for continuous-variable systems, our analysis
          of spin systems shows that care must be taken when applying an
          extremal principle to new contexts.<br>

          Business owners in Buffalo, New York fed up with Cuomo’s
          authoritarian Covid lockdown orders asserted their
          Constitutional rights and kicked out sheriffs and “health
          inspectors” on Friday night.<br>
          <br>
          50 business owners gathered inside of a shuttered gym in
          Buffalo, New York Friday night when two sheriffs and a
          so-called ‘health inspector’ showed up to harass the group in
          response to an “anonymous tip.”<br>
          <br>
          The business owners shouted down and kicked out the health
          inspector and the told the sheriffs to come back with a
          warrant.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one was cited and no arrests were made,
          according to two people who attended, but video of the
          incident shows an Erie County health inspector accompanied by
          three sheriff’s deputies arriving about 20 minutes after the
          gathering began.<br>
          <br>
          “You’re on private property. You need to leave!” one of the
          business owners shouted to the health inspector.<br>
          <br>
          “This is private party! It’s private property! Go get a
          warrant! You’re not wanted here!”<br>
          <br>
          The obese sheriff began lecturing one of the business owners
          on mask wearing to which the business owner replied, “Don’t
          worry about my health! My health isn’t your concern!”<br>
          <br>
          The business owners shouted down the trespassers, “Get out!
          Get out! Get out! – We will not comply! We will not comply!”<br>
          <br>
          The brave business owners followed the sheriffs and health
          inspectors into the parking lot and told them to get off their
          property, “They’re Nazis!” one yelled. “Take your Commie sh*t
          elsewhere!” another one shouted.<br>

              Randomized Controlled Trial</b><br>
            <b>Henning Bundgaard, et al.</b><br>
          </div>
          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>Background:<br>
          Observational evidence suggests that mask wearing mitigates
          transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
          2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is uncertain if this observed association
          arises through protection of uninfected wearers (protective
          effect), via reduced transmission from infected mask wearers
          (source control), or both.<br>
          Objective:<br>
          To assess whether recommending surgical mask use outside the
          home reduces wearers' risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a
          setting where masks were uncommon and not among recommended
          public health measures.<br>
          Design:<br>
          Randomized controlled trial (DANMASK-19 [Danish Study to
          Assess Face Masks for the Protection Against COVID-19
          Infection]). (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04337541)<br>
          Setting: Denmark, April and May 2020.<br>
          Participants: Adults spending more than 3 hours per day
          outside the home without occupational mask use.<br>
          Intervention: Encouragement to follow social distancing
          measures for coronavirus disease 2019, plus either no mask
          recommendation or a recommendation to wear a mask when outside
          the home among other persons together with a supply of 50
          surgical masks and instructions for proper use.<br>
          Measurements: The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection in
          the mask wearer at 1 month by antibody testing, polymerase
          chain reaction (PCR), or hospital diagnosis. The secondary
          outcome was PCR positivity for other respiratory viruses.<br>
          Results: A total of 3030 participants were randomly assigned
          to the recommendation to wear masks, and 2994 were assigned to
          control; 4862 completed the study. Infection with SARS-CoV-2
          occurred in 42 participants recommended masks (1.8%) and 53
          control participants (2.1%). The between-group difference was
          −0.3 percentage point (95% CI, −1.2 to 0.4 percentage point; P
          = 0.38) (odds ratio, 0.82 [CI, 0.54 to 1.23]; P = 0.33).
          Multiple imputation accounting for loss to follow-up yielded
          similar results. Although the difference observed was not
          statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a
          46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection.<br>
          Limitation: Inconclusive results, missing data, variable
          adherence, patient-reported findings on home tests, no
          blinding, and no assessment of whether masks could decrease
          disease transmission from mask wearers to others.<br>
          Conclusion: The recommendation to wear surgical masks to
          supplement other public health measures did not reduce the
          SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among wearers by more than 50% in a
          community with modest infection rates, some degree of social
          distancing, and uncommon general mask use. The data were
          compatible with lesser degrees of self-protection...<br>

          Researchers from UCLA and China have found that catalase, a
          naturally occurring enzyme, holds potential as a low-cost
          therapeutic drug to treat COVID-19 symptoms and suppress the

          <br>
          Catalase is produced naturally and used by humans, animals and
          plants. Inside cells, the antioxidant enzyme kick starts the
          breakdown of hydrogen peroxide, which can be toxic, into water
          and oxygen. The enzyme is also commonly used worldwide in food

          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          The COVID‐19 pandemic has taken a significant toll on people
          worldwide, and there are currently no specific antivirus drugs
          or vaccines. Herein it is a therapeutic based on catalase, an
          antioxidant enzyme that can effectively breakdown hydrogen
          peroxide and minimize the downstream reactive oxygen species,
          which are excessively produced resulting from the infection
          and inflammatory process, is reported. Catalase assists to
          regulate production of cytokines, protect oxidative injury,
          and repress replication of SARS‐CoV‐2, as demonstrated in
          human leukocytes and alveolar epithelial cells, and rhesus
          macaques, without noticeable toxicity. Such a therapeutic can
          be readily manufactured at low cost as a potential treatment
          for COVID‐19...<br>
          <br>
          In conclusion, we have shown the anti‐inflammatory effect and
          ability of catalase to regulate cytokine production in
          leukocytes, protect alveolar cells from oxidative injury, and
          repress the replication of SARS‐CoV‐2 in rhesus macaques
          without noticeable toxicity. Moreover, it is worth noting that
          catalase is safe and commonly used as a food additive and
          dietary supplement, and that pilot‐scale manufacturing of
          n(CAT) has been successfully demonstrated. In contrast to the
          current focus on vaccines and antiviral drugs, this may
          provide an effective therapeutic solution for the pandemic, as
          well as treatment of hyperinflammation in general.<br>

          </b>Top pathologist Dr. Roger Hodkinson told government
          officials in Alberta during a zoom conference call that the
          current coronavirus crisis is “the greatest hoax ever
          perpetrated on an unsuspecting public.”<br>
          <br>
          Hodkinson’s comments were made during a discussion involving
          the Community and Public Services Committee and the clip was
          subsequently uploaded to YouTube.<br>
          <br>
          Noting that he was also an expert in virology, Hodkinson
          pointed out that his role as CEO of a biotech company that
          manufactures COVID tests means, “I might know a little bit
          about all this.”<br>

          hoax ever perpetrated on an unsuspecting public,” said
          Hodkinson.<br>
          <br>
          The doctor said that nothing could be done to stop the spread
          of the virus besides protecting older more vulnerable people
          and that the whole situation represented “politics playing
          medicine, and that’s a very dangerous game.”..<b><br>

            Abstract<br>
          </b>Fine-tuning has received much attention in physics, and it
          states that the fundamental constants of physics are finely
          tuned to precise values for a rich chemistry and life
          permittance. It has not yet been applied in a broad manner to
          molecular biology. However, in this paper we argue that
          biological systems present fine-tuning at different levels,
          e.g. functional proteins, complex biochemical machines in
          living cells, and cellular networks. This paper describes
          molecular fine-tuning, how it can be used in biology, and how
          it challenges conventional Darwinian thinking. We also discuss
          the statistical methods underpinning fine-tuning and present a
          framework for such analysis.<br>

          states in our country. We will be giving intensive training to
          these people, training not only for identifying and finding
          contacts but also in terms of how to be sensitive about doing

          <div align="center"><b>New low-consumption diesel engine
              generates less contaminating particles</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>Researchers from Valencia’s Polytechnic University (UPV)
          belonging to the CMT Institute, have taken part in the
          development of a new engine that has low consumption and high
          efficiency, and which decreases the emissions of contaminating
          particles by over 80% compared to current legal limits.<br>
          <br>
          This new engine is the main result of the European Dieper
          project, headed by Austrian multinational company AVL, and in
          which companies such as Renault, Iveco, Fiat, Continental,
          Bosch and Siemens, as well as prestigious international
          research centres such as IFP Energies Nouvelles and the
          Istituto Motori, have taken part.<br>
          <br>
          “The objective of the project was to search for the optimal
          combination of innovative and real solutions that could be
          available in the short term, thus integrating new technologies
          that make it possible to face the new challenges of road
          mobility,” says Jesús Benajes, professor and researcher at the
          CMT Institute, and coordinator of the part of the project
          linked to the thermal-fluidodynamic processes inside the
          engine.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Decrease in contaminating particles</b><br>
          <br>
          The final meeting of the project took place in Graz (Austria)
          during the last week of this past September. In the meeting,
          two demonstrator vehicles were presented: one that will
          represent the future D and E classes for passenger
          transportation, and another light commercial vehicle destined
          to transporting goods.<br>
          <br>
          “Equipped with the motor developed in the framework of the
          project, they both confirm the good results of the research we
          have conducted, both as regards fuel and the decrease in
          particles smaller than 23 nanometres that are emitted by the
          exhaust pipe,” explains Benajes.<br>
          <br>
          The key to obtaining an engine with these characteristics, as
          the researcher adds, lies in the use of variable compression
          relations, an improvement of thermal management and the
          development of new particle filters. “They are solutions that
          are available today to be integrated in the engines that will
          equip future medium and large-sized cars, as well as light
          commercial vehicles or vans,” says Benajes.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Consumption and emissions during real driving</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          In the framework of the project, Jaime Martín, professor and
          researcher at the CMT, has been in charge of reproducing the
          behaviour of the engine with computer-generated simulations.<br>
          <br>
          “One of the main challenges – explains Martín – is to optimise
          the functioning of all the engine’s systems in different
          driving situations. The post-treatment systems that decrease
          emissions are very sensitive, for example, to the temperature
          of exhaust gases, which varies greatly when driving in a city
          or on the motorway. We must ensure an optimal functioning of
          all the devices on any road, in any weather conditions and
          regardless of the type of driving.”<br>
          <br>
          The conclusions of the work were presented at the European
          “Results from road transport research in H2020 projects”
          Conference, organised by the Research and Innovation
          department of the European Commission.<br>

              Identified</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          A new study reveals the virus triggers production of
          antibodies circulating through the blood, causing clots in
          people hospitalized with the disease...<br>
          <br>
          The culprit: an autoimmune antibody that’s circulating in the
          blood, attacking the cells and triggering clots in arteries,
          veins, and microscopic vessels. Blood clots can cause
          life-threatening events like strokes. And, in COVID-19,
          microscopic clots may restrict blood flow in the lungs,
          impairing oxygen exchange.<br>
          <br>
          Outside of novel coronavirus infection, these clot-causing
          antibodies are typically seen in patients who have the
          autoimmune disease antiphospholipid syndrome. The connection
          between autoantibodies and COVID-19 was unexpected, says
          co-corresponding author Yogen Kanthi, M.D., an assistant
          professor at the Michigan Medicine Frankel Cardiovascular
          Center and a Lasker Investigator at the National Institutes of
          Health’s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.<br>
          <br>
          “In patients with COVID-19, we continue to see a relentless,
          self-amplifying cycle of inflammation and clotting in the
          body,” Kanthi says. “Now we’re learning that autoantibodies
          could be a culprit in this loop of clotting and inflammation
          that makes people who were already struggling even sicker.”...<br>

            Background: </b>Up-to-date, there is no recognized
          effective treatment or vaccine for the treatment of COVID-19
          that emphasize urgency around distinctive effective therapies.
          This study aims to evaluate the anti-parasitic medication
          efficacy "Ivermectin" plus standard care (azithromycin,
          vitamin C, Zinc, Lactoferrin &amp; Acetylcystein &amp;
          prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation if D-dimer &gt;
          1000) in the treatment of mild/moderate and severely ill cases
          with COVID 19 infection, as well as prophylaxis of health care
          and/ or household contacts in comparison to the
          Hydroxychloroquine plus standard treatment.<b><br>
            <br>
            Subject and methods:</b> 600 subjects; 400 symptomatic
          confirmed COVID-19 patients and 200 health care and household
          contacts distributed over 6 groups; Group I: 100 patients with
          Mild/Moderate COVID-19 infection received a 4-days course of
          Ivermectin plus standard of care; Group II: 100 patients with
          mild/moderate COVID-19 infection received hydroxyxholorquine
          plus standard of care; Group III: 100 patients with severe
          COVID-19 infection received Ivermectin plus standard of care;
          Group IV: 100 patients with Severe COVID-19 infection received
          hydroxyxholorquine plus standard of care. Routine laboratory
          investigations and RT-PCR were reported before and after
          initiation of treatment. Group V stick to personal protective
          equipment (PPE) plus Ivermectin 400mcg / kg to be repeated
          after one week, and Group VI stick to PPE only and both groups
          V&amp;VI were followed for two weeks.<br>
          <b><br>
            Results: </b>Patients received ivermectin reported
          substantial recovery of laboratory investigations; and
          significant reduction in RT-PCR conversion days. A substantial
          improvement and reduction in mortality rate in Ivermectin
          treated groups; group I (mild/moderate cases), (99%, and 0.0%,
          respectively) and group III (severe cases), (94%, and 2.0%,
          respectively) versus hydroxychloroquine plus standard care
          treated groups; group II (mild/moderate cases), (74% and 4%,
          respectively) and group IV (severe cases) (50% and 20%,
          respectively). Ivermectin had significantly reduced the
          incidence of infection in health care and household contacts
          up to 2% compared to 10% in non ivermectin group<br>
          <b><br>
            Conclusion: </b>Addition of Ivermectin to standard care is
          very effective drug for treatment of COVID-19 patients with
          significant reduction in mortality compared to
          Hydroxychloroquine plus standard treatment only. Early use of
          Ivermectin is very useful for controlling COVID 19 infections,
          prophylaxis and improving cytokines storm<br>

          <b><br>
            &nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; PCR tests are not designed to be used
          as a diagnostic tool as they cannot distinguish between
          inactive viruses and “live” or reproductive ones<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amplification over 35 cycles is considered
          unreliable and scientifically unjustified, yet many labs use
          45 cycles. This amplifies any tiny sequence of viral DNA that
          might be present to the point that the test reads “positive”
          even if the viral load is extremely low or the virus is
          inactive<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PCR test can also pick up the presence
          of other coronaviruses, so a positive result may simply
          indicate that you’ve recuperated from a common cold in the
          past<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Millions of people are simply carrying
          inactive viral DNA that pose no risk to anyone, yet positive
          test results are being used by the global technocracy to
          implement a brand new economic and social system based on
          draconian surveillance and totalitarian controls<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Research shows the global lockdown strategy
          harms public health to a greater degree than the virus
          itself...<br>

          Biden’s transition team defines truth as hate speech. Truth is
          what the Democrat left, military/security complex, and
          presstitutes don’t want spoken or written.&nbsp; <br>

          Richard Stengal, a former presstitute for MSNBC.<br>

          “Truth” is reserved for what serves the anti-white leftwing of
          the Democrat Party, the allied military/security complex and
          global elite. This means that no Trump supporter&nbsp; speaks

          </b>The vote theft is the opening gun of a civil war in which
          white Americans will have to fight or be relegated to third
          class citizens. The 14th amendment is also dead. Trump
          Deplorables are no longer equal under the law.&nbsp; They are
          denied free speech, but all others have free speech to
          denounce white America more harshly than Nazis are reported to
          have denounced Jews. Antifa and Black Lives Matter have begun
          the Kristallnachts. Those who tell the truth are losing the

          <br>
          The obviously stolen election is a coup against democracy and

          (i.e. the flu) with minimal mortality. Why has the whole world
          been destroyed? That I don’t know.”<br>
          <br>
          it is difficult to overstate how important this is. This man
          is the equivalent of Fauci in the US, or perhaps Dr. Deborah
          Birx. The 1.5 hour long interview below is only in Russian,
          but if you can understand it, it is well worth watching,
          because a lot of important information is covered.<br>
          <br>
          The interviewer is Ksenia Sobchak, who is very liberal - think
          of her as like a Russian Rachel Maddow. Like liberals in the
          West, she very much wants to believe the COVID situation is
          much worse than it really is. Myasnikov explains to her in
          detail why it is in fact very difficult to assign 'cause of
          death' in most cases, because there are usually several, in
          addition to a lot of other things.<br>
          <br>
          It is a great interview, in which the good doctor finally
          loses his patience and tells her its not nearly as dangerous
          as people think, and that the whole world has over-reacted. He
          also insists that the death numbers in the West are way
          over-counted.<br>
          <br>
          He's right.<br>
          <br>
          This interview is also a great example of the high level of
          journalism in Russia - this is much more genuine, open,
          exciting, and authentic than most of what is on mainstream
          media in the West. Just watch a few seconds of the intro, and
          you will get the idea.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Russia’s head of coronavirus information
          has suggested that global anxiety over the pandemic is
          misplaced, his latest controversial comment after saying that
          the infection would kill as many people as it needs to.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doctor and television presenter Alexander
          Myasnikov was appointed in April to his new role of informing
          Russians about coronavirus treatment and prevention methods
          and to battle “fake news” about Covid-19. After calling the
          country’s reported low death rate a “Russian miracle,”
          Myasnikov said last week that “those meant to die will die”
          from it.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an interview that aired Wednesday,
          Myasnikov gestured for the cameras to stop running and said
          candidly: “It’s all bullsh*t.”<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It’s all exaggerated. It’s an acute
          respiratory disease with minimal mortality,” he told
          television personality Ksenia Sobchak in the interview for her
          YouTube project.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Why has the whole world been destroyed?
          That I don’t know,” Myasnikov said, adding that he’s more
          concerned about a second wave that he claimed “we’re
          unprepared for.”<br>

          <b><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; PCR tests are not designed to be used
          as a diagnostic tool as they cannot distinguish between
          inactive viruses and “live” or reproductive ones<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amplification over 35 cycles is considered
          unreliable and scientifically unjustified, yet many labs use
          45 cycles. This amplifies any tiny sequence of viral DNA that
          might be present to the point that the test reads “positive”
          even if the viral load is extremely low or the virus is
          inactive<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PCR test can also pick up the presence
          of other coronaviruses, so a positive result may simply
          indicate that you’ve recuperated from a common cold in the
          past<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Millions of people are simply carrying
          inactive viral DNA that pose no risk to anyone, yet positive
          test results are being used by the global technocracy to
          implement a brand new economic and social system based on
          draconian surveillance and totalitarian controls<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Research shows the global lockdown strategy
          harms public health to a greater degree than the virus
          itself...<b><br>

          </b>...Three Buddhist monks focused their intention on
          commercially bottled water with the goal of improving the
          growth of seeds; bottled water from the same source served as
          an untreated control. Seeds with the following three
          variations of cryptochrome (CRY) were used: the wild type
          Arabidopsis (Columbia-4), a gain-of-function mutation
          (His-CRY2), and a loss-of function mutation (cry1/2), where
          “gain” and “loss” refer to enhanced and reduced sensitivity to
          blue light, respectively. Seeds were hydrated with treated or
          untreated water under blinded conditions, and then placed in
          random positions in an incubator. The germination process was
          repeated three times in each experiment, each time using new
          seeds, and then the entire experiment was repeated four times.<br>
          <br>
          The results of the Taiwan study showed a significant decrease
          in hypocotyl length, a significant increase in anthocyanin
          (treated mean 17.0 ± 0.31 mg, untreated mean, and a “modest”
          increase in chlorophyll...<br>
          <br>
          These outcomes conformed to the monks’ intentions because a
          decrease in hypocotyl length and increase in anthocyanin and
          chlorophyll are associated with enhanced photomorphogenic
          growth. These experiments suggest that the&nbsp; His-CRY2
          mutation of Arabidopsis may be an especially robust “detector”
          of intention.<br>

          </b>This experiment tested the hypothesis that water exposed
          to distant intentions affects the aesthetic rating of ice
          crystals formed from that water. Over three days, 1,900 people
          in Austria and Germany focused their intentions towards water
          samples located inside an electromagnetically shielded room in
          California. Water samples located near the target water, but
          unknown to the people providing intentions, acted as
          ‘‘proximal’’ controls. Other samples located outside the
          shielded room acted as distant controls. Ice drops formed from
          samples of water in the different treatment conditions were
          photographed by a technician, each image was assessed for
          aesthetic beauty by over 2,500 independent judges, and the
          resulting data were analyzed, all by individuals blind with
          respect to the underlying treatment conditions. Results
          suggested that crystal images in the intentionally treated
          condition were rated as aesthetically more beautiful than
          proximal control crystals (p &lt; 0.03, one-tailed). This
          outcome replicates the results of an earlier pilot test.<br>

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>Mentally controlled qi energy can induce crop seeds to
          sprout and root for several cm within about 20 min. The RAPD
          method was used to compare treated groups of wheat and pea
          seeds and their controls using 11 selected primers. Seven
          primers amplified polymorphisms in wheat seeds and 5 in pea
          seeds. It was thought preliminarily that qi energy changed the
          structure of a germination-correlated gene site speeding up
          expression and advancing it in time.<br>

          Steve Quayle and myself have been investigating a three-nation

          States. The deal has now expanded to NATO forces, living in
          American bases that were closed during the Bush Sr., era. The
          CSS has also learned that their is some UN involvement as
          well. The agreements have to do with ridding America's new
          Harris-Biden administration of any and all. Unfortunately, the
          interview that is presented below on this topic is a work in
          progress. The implications of this interview is frightening as
          it promises an international, state-sponsored genocidal

              About Vaccination Anti Vaccine</b><b> -- Eleanor McBean</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          During the Dark Ages, before the introduction of improved
          nutrition and sanitation, the world was intermittently visited
          with epidemics of smallpox. The cause was stubbornly ignored
          and<br>
          the seeds for more disease were sown when vaccination was
          brought into popular use. This infusion of poison injected
          into the blood stream of the masses only served to intensify
          the<br>
          disease in some cases, suppress the symptoms in others and
          create new and more serious diseases in still others. So, with
          the passing of years we have seen this misbegotten child of<br>
          ignorance grow into a Frankenstein monster of immense
          proportions that moves relentlessly forward, grinding under
          foot the multitudes that throng its path<br>
          <br>
          Through the lethal power of this poisoned needle, the simple
          zymotic (contagious) diseases of the past have been devolved
          into the horrors of the present — our terrifying and expanding
          crop of "killer diseases". Many of these strange "mystery
          diseases" that baffle the entire medical world, are the sordid
          products of vaccine poisons that disturb the chemical balance
          of the body and interfere with normal functioning.<br>
          <br>
          All these medically-made atrocities are far worse than
          smallpox or any of the other eruptive diseases that nature
          provides as a means of expelling the accumulated poison waste
          from the abused body. This interference with the balanced
          economy of nature has multiplied the&nbsp; Problems beyond the
          power of science to control.<br>
          <br>
          Our worst epidemics now are epidemics of vaccination in which
          more people are killed every year by "vaccinal diseases" than
          by the diseases that the vaccinations were supposed to combat.<br>
          <br>
          Complete freedom from disease can scarcely be found except in
          remote islands or isolated communities that have not been
          invaded by medical mischief and commercialized products. Is
          our proud civilization to be degraded, corrupted, and
          destroyed by its own inventions designed for selfish profit
          and exploitation of the race?<br>
          <br>
          Vaccination, instead of being the promised blessing to the
          world, has proved to be a curse of such sweeping devastation
          that it has caused more death and disease than war,
          pestilence, and plague combined. There is no scourge (with the
          possible exception of atomic radiation) that is more
          destructive to our nation’s health than this monument of human
          deception — this slayer of the innocent —this crippler of body
          and brain<br>

          The sequence “CTCCCTTTGTTGTGTTGT” is an 18-character primer

          <br>
          <b>Summary</b><b><br>
          </b>Radiative cooling is a passive cooling technology that
          acts by reflecting sunlight and emitting radiation in the sky
          window. Although highly desirable, full daytime sub-ambient
          radiative cooling in commercial-like single-layer
          particle-matrix paints has not been achieved. Here, we
          demonstrate full daytime sub-ambient radiative cooling in
          CaCO3-acrylic paint by using large band gap CaCO3 fillers, a
          high particle concentration of 60%, and a broad size
          distribution. Our paint shows a high solar reflectance of
          95.5% and a high normal emissivity of 0.94 in the sky window.
          Field tests show cooling power exceeding 37 W/m2 and a surface
          temperature of &gt;1.7°C below ambient at noon. A figure of
          merit RC is proposed to compare the cooling performance
          independent of weather conditions. The standard RC of our
          paint is 0.49, among the best radiative cooling performances,
          while offering the benefits of convenient paint form, low
          cost, and compatibility with commercial paint fabrication
          processes...<br>
          <br>
          CaCO3-acrylic paint with 60% volume concentration was made
          using a commercially compatible process. A mixture of
          dimethylformamide (DMF), acrylic, and particle fillers was
          left fully dried...<br>
          In summary, we have demonstrated that CaCO3-acrylic paint,
          with a high particle concentration and a broad size
          distribution, is able to achieve full daytime below-ambient
          cooling with a high standard figure of merit of 0.49. The
          intrinsic large band gap, appropriate particle size, broad
          particle size distribution, and high particle concentration
          are essential to strongly reflect the sunlight. The
          vibrational resonance peaks of the acrylic matrix provide
          strong emission in the sky window. Our radiative cooling paint
          showed a cooling performance that was among the best of the
          reported state-of-the-art approaches, while offering
          unprecedented combined benefits, including convenient paint
          form, low cost, and compatibility with commercial paint
          fabrication processes. Future studies can aim at achieving
          greater performance with thinner films by exploring materials
          and structures...<br>
          <br>
          <b>Sample Fabrication</b><b><br>
          </b>The CaCO3 particles were mixed with DMF first, followed by
          a 10-min sonication to reduce particle agglomerations. We used
          Elvacite 2028 from Lucite International as the acrylic matrix
          because of its low viscosity. The acrylic was then slowly
          added to the mixture to dissolve. The mixture was later
          degassed in a vacuum chamber to remove air bubbles introduced
          during mixing and ultrasonication. The mixture was then poured
          in a mold and dried overnight until all of the solvent was
          gone. The dried paint was released from the mold as a
          freestanding layer with a thickness of ∼400 μm.<br>

              in the brain’s EM field: the cemi field theory of
              consciousness</b><br>
            <b>Johnjoe McFadden</b><br>
          </div>
          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>A key aspect of consciousness is that it represents bound
          or integrated information, prompting an increasing conviction
          that the physical substrate of consciousness must be capable
          of encoding integrated information in the brain. However, as
          Ralph Landauer insisted, ‘information is physical’ so
          integrated information must be physically integrated. I argue
          here that nearly all examples of so-called ‘integrated
          information’, including neuronal information processing and
          conventional computing, are only temporally integrated in the
          sense that outputs are correlated with multiple inputs: the
          information integration is implemented in time, rather than
          space, and thereby cannot correspond to physically integrated
          information. I point out that only energy fields are capable
          of integrating information in space. I describe the conscious
          electromagnetic information (cemi) field theory which has
          proposed that consciousness is physically integrated, and
          causally active, information encoded in the brain’s global
          electromagnetic (EM) field. I here extend the theory to argue
          that consciousness implements algorithms in space, rather than
          time, within the brain’s EM field. I describe how the cemi
          field theory accounts for most observed features of
          consciousness and describe recent experimental support for the
          theory. I also describe several untested predictions of the
          theory and discuss its implications for the design of
          artificial consciousness. The cemi field theory proposes a
          scientific dualism that is rooted in the difference between
          matter and energy, rather than matter and spirit.<br>

          </div>
          <br>
          ...When we peel away the layer upon layer of culture from the
          human condition, we discover an extremely insecure animal
          wrestling with the knowledge of its own mortality, who is
          forced to contemplate its own tiny existence within an ancient
          and dwarfing universe.<br>
          <br>
          What else is such a creature to do but balk and then create
          concepts of good and evil based upon fear of the unknown?<br>
          <br>
          Well, for one, such a creature could evolve and then create
          technologies that bring it more into alignment with the
          unknown.<br>
          <br>
          Rather than fear, rather than balking, such a creature could
          realize that things are not based upon good and evil at all,
          but upon healthy and unhealthy.<br>
          <br>
          Here's the thing: we are all going to die...<br>
          <br>
          There's no way around that. It's how we live our life that
          matters...<br>
          <br>
          And in a universe that dictates health rather than goodness,
          it behooves us to come into alignment with the universe's
          healthy dictation. This way, goodness is health and the very
          concept of goodness itself is more conducive with the way the
          cosmos actually works rather than the way our fear-filled
          forefathers falsely imagined it works.<br>
          <br>
          Focusing on health launches us beyond good and evil. It gets
          us out of our own way...<br>
          <br>
          Caught up in the concept of good and evil, we rely too much on
          the fallible opinion of mankind. Whereas, coming into
          alignment with healthy and unhealthy, we can rely on the
          infallible dictation of universal laws.<br>
          <br>
          For example:<br>
          Universal law dictates that you need oxygen to survive.<br>
          If you breathe oxygen, you are healthy and you live.<br>

          <br>
          In major media, certain stories gain traction. The trumpets
          keep blaring for a time before they fade.<br>
          <br>
          Other stories are one-offs. A few of them strike hard. Their
          implications—if anyone stops to think about them—are powerful.
          Then…nothing.<br>
          <br>
          “Wait, aren’t you going to follow up on that? Don’t you see
          what that MEANS?”<br>
          <br>
          Apparently not, because…dead silence. “In other news, the
          governor lost his pet parakeet for an hour. His chief of staff
          found it taking a nap in a desk drawer…”<br>
          <br>
          One-offs function like teasers. You definitely want to know
          more, but you never get more.<br>
          <br>
          Over the years, I’ve tried to follow up on a few. The reporter
          or the editor has a set of standard replies: “We didn’t get
          much feedback.” “We covered it.” “It’s now old news.” “There
          wasn’t anything else to find out.”<br>
          <br>
          Oh, but there WAS.<br>
          <br>
          A few weeks ago, I ran a one-off. The analysis and commentary
          were mine, but the story was an opinion piece in the New York
          Times. The Times called it an opinion piece to soften its
          blow. I suspected it would disappear, and it did.<br>
          <br>
          Its meaning and implication were too strong. It would be a
          vast embarrassment for the White House, the Warp Speed COVID
          vaccine program, the vaccine manufacturers, the coronavirus
          task force, and vaccine researchers.<br>
          <br>
          And embarrassment would be just the beginning of their
          problem.<br>
          <br>
          So…here it is again. The vanished one-off, back in business:<br>
          <br>
          COVID vaccine clinical trials doomed to fail; fatal design
          flaw; NY Times opinion piece exposes all three major clinical
          trials. [2]<br>
          <br>
          Peter Doshi, associate editor of the medical journal BMJ, and
          Eric Topol, Scripps Research professor of molecular medicine,
          have written a devastating NY Times opinion piece about the
          ongoing COVID vaccine clinical trials.<br>
          <br>
          They expose the fatal flaw in the large Pfizer, AstraZeneca,
          and Moderna trials.<br>
          <br>
          September 22, the Times: “These Coronavirus Trials Don’t
          Answer the One Question We Need to Know” [1]:<br>
          <br>
          “If you were to approve a coronavirus vaccine, would you
          approve one that you only knew protected people only from the
          most mild form of Covid-19, or one that would prevent its
          serious complications?”<br>
          <br>
          “The answer is obvious. You would want to protect against the
          worst cases.”<br>
          <br>
          “But that’s not how the companies testing three of the leading
          coronavirus vaccine candidates, Moderna, Pfizer and
          AstraZeneca, whose U.S. trial is on hold, are approaching the
          problem.”<br>
          <br>
          “According to the protocols for their studies, which they
          released late last week, a vaccine could meet the companies’
          benchmark for success if it lowered the risk of mild Covid-19,
          but was never shown to reduce moderate or severe forms of the
          disease, or the risk of hospitalization, admissions to the
          intensive care unit or death.”<br>
          <br>
          “To say a vaccine works should mean that most people no longer
          run the risk of getting seriously sick. That’s not what these
          trials will determine.”<br>
          <br>
          This means these clinical trials are dead in the water.<br>
          <br>
          The trials are designed to show effectiveness in preventing
          mild cases of COVID, which nobody should care about, because
          mild cases naturally run their course and cause no harm. THERE
          IS NO NEED FOR A VACCINE THAT PREVENTS MILD CASES.<br>
          <br>
          There. That’s the NY Times one-off. My piece analyzing it went
          on much longer, but you get the main thrust:<br>
          <br>
          The leading vaccine clinical trials are useless, irrelevant,
          misleading, and deceptive.<br>
          <br>
          But now, it gets much worse. Because Pfizer has just announced
          their vaccine is almost ready. CNBC headline, November 9:
          “Pfizer, BioNTech say Covid vaccine is more than 90%
          effective—‘great day for science and humanity’” [3].<br>
          <br>
          And not a peep about the NY Times one-off. That’s gone, as if
          it never was.<br>
          <br>
          Trump’s coronavirus task force knows the truth. Biden’s new
          task force, waiting in the wings, knows the truth. But they
          don’t care. They’re criminals. They’d sell a car with a gas
          tank ready to explode to a customer with cash.<br>
          <br>
          But you care, because you can read and think.<br>
          <br>
          You can raise hell.<br>
          <br>
          Now, in case anyone is interested in knowing WHY the major
          clinical trials of the COVID vaccine are designed only to
          prevent mild cases of COVID, I’ll explain.<br>
          <br>
          A vaccine maker assumes that, during the course of the
          clinical trial, a few of the 30,000 volunteers are going to
          “catch COVID-19.”<br>
          <br>
          They assume this because “the virus is everywhere,” as far as
          they’re concerned. So it’ll drop down from the clouds and
          infect a few of the volunteers.<br>
          <br>
          The magic number is 150. When that number of volunteers “catch
          COVID,” everything stops. The clinical trial stops.<br>
          <br>
          At this point, the vaccine maker hopes that most of the
          volunteers who “got infected” are in the placebo group. They
          didn’t receive the real vaccine; they received the saltwater
          placebo shot.<br>
          <br>
          Then the vaccine maker can proudly say, “See? The volunteers
          who caught COVID-19? Most of them didn’t receive the vaccine.
          They weren’t protected. The volunteers who received the real
          vaccine didn’t catch COVID. The vaccine protected them.”<br>
          <br>
          Actually, the number split the vaccine makers are looking for
          is 50 and 100. If 50 people in the vaccine group catch COVID,
          and 100 in the placebo group catch COVID, the vaccine is said
          to be 50% effective. And that’s all the vaccine maker needs to
          win FDA approval for the vaccine.<br>
          <br>
          But wait. Let’s look closer at this idea of “catching COVID.”
          What are they really talking about? How do they define that?
          Claiming a volunteer in the clinical trial caught COVID adds
          up to what?<br>
          <br>
          Does it add up to a minimal definition of COVID-19—a cough, or
          chills and fever? Or does it mean a serious case—severe
          pneumonia?<br>
          <br>
          Now we come to the hidden factor, the secret, the source of
          the whole con game.<br>
          <br>
          You see, the vaccine maker starts out with 30,000 HEALTHY
          volunteers. So, if they waited for 150 of them to come down
          with severe pneumonia, a serious case of COVID, how long do
          you think that would take? Five years? Ten years?<br>
          <br>
          The vaccine maker can’t possibly wait that long.<br>
          <br>
          These 150 COVID cases the vaccine maker is looking for would
          be mild. Just a cough. Or chills and fever. That scenario
          would only take a few months to develop. And face it, chills,
          cough, and fever aren’t unique to COVID. Anyone can come down
          with those symptoms.<br>
          <br>
          THEREFORE, THE WHOLE CLINICAL TRIAL IS DESIGNED, UP FRONT, TO
          FIND 150 CASES OF MILD AND MEANINGLESS AND SELF-CURING
          “COVID.”<br>
          <br>
          About which, no one cares. No one should care.<br>
          <br>
          But, as we see, Pfizer is trumpeting their clinical trial of
          the vaccine as a landmark in human history.<br>
          <br>
          And THAT’S the story of the one-off the NY Times didn’t think
          was worth a second glance.<br>
          <br>
          Because they’re so stupid? No. They’re not that stupid.<br>
          <br>
          They’re criminals.<br>
          <br>
          And the government wants you to take the experimental COVID
          vaccine, whose “effectiveness” was designed to prevent nothing
          worth losing a night’s sleep over.<br>
          <br>
          The only worry are the adverse effects of the vaccine, about
          which I’ve written extensively. These effects include,
          depending on what’s in the vial, a permanent alteration of
          your genetic makeup, or an auto-immune cascade, in which the
          body attacks itself.<br>

              against fungi and tumors</b><br>
            <b>By Peter Moon</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          A new material with antifungal and antitumor properties has
          been developed by researchers at the Center for Development of
          Functional Materials (CDMF), one of the Research, Innovation
          and Dissemination Centers (RIDCs) supported by FAPESP. CDMF is
          hosted by the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar) in São
          Paulo State, Brazil.<br>
          <br>
          The compound was obtained from a sample of pure silver
          tungstate (α-Ag2WO4) irradiated with electrons and laser light
          in pulses lasting a few femtoseconds. A femtosecond is a
          quadrillionth of a second, the time scale of chemical
          reactions involving exchanges of electrons between atoms and
          molecules. The new material is described in an article
          published in Scientific Reports...<br>
          <br>
          “In an experiment performed in 2018, in which silver tungstate
          was irradiated with electrons, we observed under an electron
          microscope the appearance of tiny ‘hairs’ that grew on
          molecules of the material. These were nothing other than
          filaments of nanoparticles extracted from silver tungstate by
          electron irradiation,” said Elson Longo, Professor Emeritus in
          UFSCar’s Chemistry Department and CDMF’s principal
          investigator.<br>
          <br>
          “Silver is a chemical element with bactericidal properties.
          Silver tungstate also has these properties, but what we found
          most striking was that after being modified by electron
          irradiation and silver filament construction, the composite
          displayed antifungal activity that was 32 times more effective
          than before irradiation.”<br>
          <br>
          The modified composite’s antifungal activity was verified in
          Candida albicans, the fungus that causes candidiasis and
          thrush. The researchers cultured the fungus in Petri dishes.
          They already knew the minimum amount of silver tungstate
          required to eliminate the fungus and applied the same quantity
          of the modified composite to the culture. The result observed
          was similar.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers then halved the volume of the substance and
          repeated the procedure, again eliminating the fungus. They
          repeated the procedure 32 times altogether, always with
          satisfactory antifungal results, demonstrating that the
          modified composite’s antifungal properties were 32 times more
          powerful than those of the original silver tungstate.<br>
          <br>
          The composite’s antitumor action was tested in mouse bladder
          cancer cells, which were exposed for 24 hours to different
          concentrations (4.63 micrograms per milliliter, 11.58 µg/mL,
          23.16 µg/mL, and 46.31 µg/mL).<br>
          <br>
          According to Longo, the results showed a significant reduction
          in cell viability. The best result was obtained with a
          concentration of 11.58 µg/mL when bladder cancer cell
          viability fell by 80%.<br>
          <br>
          After they demonstrated the composite’s antifungal and
          antitumor properties, the researchers at CDMF and UFSCar
          investigated its safety for future use in human patients.<br>
          <br>
          Four concentrations of the irradiated silver tungstate
          composite that were above the optimal range of fungicidal
          activity (3.9 μg/mL – 31.2 μg/mL) were studied in a human
          gingival fibroblast cell line.<br>
          <br>
          After incubation for 24 hours, the composite’s effect on cell
          viability, proliferation and morphology was evaluated by
          quantitative fluorometric assay and scanning electron
          microscopy.<br>
          <br>
          “We found no statistically significant loss of cell viability
          at these concentrations compared to the control, showing that
          the composite poses no risk to human health,” Longo said.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Wave-particle duality</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          The study also achieved the important scientific milestone of
          demonstrating wave-particle duality experimentally. The
          wave-particle duality is a fundamental property of matter
          proposed in 1924 by French physicist Louis-Victor de Broglie
          (1892-1987), according to whom electrons and other discrete
          bits of matter, until then considered only to be material
          particles, could also have wave properties, depending on the
          experiment.<br>
          <br>
          “In 1929, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to de Broglie
          for the discovery that all matter can have wave properties. In
          the nine decades since, wave-particle duality has been
          observed and proven in a large number of scientific
          experiments, but until now, no one has demonstrated it
          experimentally using beams of particles [electrons in this
          case] and beams of waves [laser] to obtain identical
          alterations in compound materials,” Longo said.<br>
          <br>
          “When we realized that electron radiation produced silver
          nanoparticle filaments on silver tungstate, we decided to
          investigate whether the same result could be achieved by using
          laser light, thereby experimentally proving the wave-particle
          duality proposed by de Broglie 95 years ago.”<br>
          <br>
          The scientific literature currently points to the growing use
          of femtosecond laser radiation in material processing as a
          technique for obtaining novel compounds with highly attractive
          properties capable of driving technological advances.<br>
          <br>
          “During the electron irradiation process, structural disorder
          is introduced into the silver tungstate electrons, and this
          plays a key role in the nucleation and growth of silver
          filaments,” Longo said.<br>
          <br>
          In principle, segregating silver atoms by femtosecond laser
          radiation should occur in a similar manner but should
          theoretically be faster because a femtosecond laser pulse can
          supply maximum power in a very short amount of time.<br>
          <br>
          “Given the expected segregation speed, therefore, the
          morphology of these silver nanoparticles would theoretically
          tend to be different under electron beam and femtosecond laser
          radiation,” Longo said.<br>
          <br>
          The practical results exactly matched the theory. When
          submitted to femtosecond laser radiation, the surface of the
          silver tungstate was covered with silver nanoparticle
          filaments.<br>
          <br>
          “By doing this, we succeeded in obtaining exactly the same
          result as with electron radiation, demonstrating wave-particle
          duality in practice,” Longo said.<br>
          <br>
          A paper on this previous CDMF experiment was published in
          2018, also in Scientific Reports. “We received a
          congratulatory letter from the journal’s editor, saying this
          paper in particular was one of the 100 most read articles on
          materials science published in the journal last year.”<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>The ability to manipulate the structure and function of
          promising systems via external stimuli is emerging with the
          development of reconfigurable and programmable multifunctional
          materials. Increasing antifungal and antitumor activity
          requires novel, effective treatments to be diligently sought.
          In this work, the synthesis, characterization, and in vitro
          biological screening of pure α-Ag2WO4, irradiated with
          electrons and with non-focused and focused femtosecond laser
          beams are reported. We demonstrate, for the first time, that
          Ag nanoparticles/α-Ag2WO4 composite displays potent antifungal
          and antitumor activity. This composite had an extreme low
          inhibition concentration against Candida albicans, cause the
          modulation of α-Ag2WO4 perform the fungicidal activity more
          efficient. For tumor activity, it was found that the composite
          showed a high selectivity against the cancer cells (MB49),
          thus depleting the populations of cancer cells by necrosis and
          apoptosis, without the healthy cells (BALB/3T3) being
          affected.<br>

              Adorable Tardigrades ... and Human Cells, Too</b><br>
            <b>By Mindy Weisberger</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          ...Scientists recently deciphered a key ingredient in
          tardigrades' arsenal of superpowers, unraveling how a unique
          protein in everyone's favorite microscopic water bears acts as
          a barrier against harmful radiation...<br>
          <br>
          Some of the proteins that allow tardigrades to revive after
          being dried out are found in other organisms, but Dsup is
          exclusive to water bears. And while prior studies found that
          this protein made human cells resistant to X-ray radiation,
          the mechanisms of how Dsup did that were uncertain. <br>
          <br>
          In the new study, the researchers discovered that Dsup binds
          to a structure called chromatin, a package that holds a cell's
          long strands of DNA in a dense package, Kadonaga told Live
          Science. <br>
          <br>
          "We found it binds to chromatin. Then we asked, 'How does it
          make it resistant to X-rays?'" he said.<br>
          <br>
          When cells are bathed in X-rays, water molecules split and
          form highly reactive particles&nbsp; of oxygen and hydrogen
          called hydroxyl radicals; these radicals can damage DNA inside
          cells, according to the study. <br>
          <br>
          "We thought, 'Why don't we just see if Dsup can protect DNA
          from hydroxyl radicals?' And the answer is yes, it can,"
          Kadonaga explained. High-energy Dsup has a cloud-like
          structure; the cloud surrounds the DNA's chromatin envelope,
          blocking hydroxyl radicals and preventing them from disrupting
          cellular DNA, the researchers reported.<br>
          <br>
          "Now that we know how it worked, that's a stepping stone to
          potentially using it for practical applications," Kadonaga
          said...<br>

          <b>Highlights</b><b><br>
          </b>An evaporation-insulation cooling design inspired by
          desert animals<br>

          transparent bilayers<br>
          Cooling time increased by 400% compared with conventional
          single-layer designs<br>
          Model and figures of merit provided for various cooling
          applications<br>
          <b>Context &amp; Scale</b><b><br>
          </b>Passive thermal management strategies show a lot of
          promise to alleviate the ever-increasing global energy demand
          for cooling, which is projected to triple by 2050. Passive
          cooling also provides viable pathways for distribution and
          storage of food and pharmaceuticals in underdeveloped areas,
          given that &gt;10% of the world’s population still has no
          access to electricity. Due to the ease of implementation and
          potential high cooling powers, evaporative cooling has emerged
          as one of the most promising passive cooling solutions.
          However, state-of-the-art evaporative cooling technologies are
          largely limited by environmental heating. In this work, we
          address this critical challenge with a transparent bilayer
          made of hydrogels and aerogels, which allows for evaporative
          cooling and at the same time cuts parasitic heat gain. Our
          bilayer cooling structure can significantly increase the
          effective cooling time by 400% compared with a conventional
          single-layer design.<br>
          <b>Summary</b><b><br>
          </b>Hydrogel-based evaporative cooling, which mimics
          perspiration of mammals, provides great potential to reduce
          energy consumption for thermal regulation. Yet, environmental
          heat gain presents a critical challenge to this cooling
          strategy at sub-ambient temperatures. Herein, inspired by the
          fur layer of desert animals, we propose an
          evaporation-insulation cooling design based on hydrogels and
          aerogels. Our transparent bilayer structure relies on water
          evaporation from hydrogels through highly porous aerogels that
          are of ultralow thermal conductivity and minimize heating from
          the surroundings. Consequently, this bilayer design allows for
          optimization between the temperature drop from the ambient and
          the effective cooling time, which we demonstrated through both
          modeling and experiments. We show that our hydrogel-aerogel
          structure can extend the lifetime of the cooling package by
          400% compared with the conventional single-layer design. We
          further provide design guidelines for various cooling
          applications, including thermal regulation of food,
          pharmaceuticals, and buildings.<br>

            <b>Veselina Petrova, et al.</b><br>

          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          Adult mammalian central nervous system axons have
          intrinsically poor regenerative capacity, so axonal injury has
          permanent consequences. One approach to enhancing regeneration
          is to increase the axonal supply of growth molecules and
          organelles. We achieved this by expressing the adaptor
          molecule Protrudin which is normally found at low levels in
          non-regenerative neurons. Elevated Protrudin expression
          enabled robust central nervous system regeneration both in
          vitro in primary cortical neurons and in vivo in the injured
          adult optic nerve. Protrudin overexpression facilitated the
          accumulation of endoplasmic reticulum, integrins and Rab11
          endosomes in the distal axon, whilst removing Protrudin’s
          endoplasmic reticulum localization, kinesin-binding or
          phosphoinositide-binding properties abrogated the regenerative
          effects. These results demonstrate that Protrudin promotes
          regeneration by functioning as a scaffold to link axonal
          organelles, motors and membranes, establishing important roles
          for these cellular components in mediating regeneration in the
          adult central nervous system.<br>

          <br>
          I was born at the end of Gen X and the beginning of the
          Millennial Generation, and grew up in a middle class town.
          Life was good. Our home was modest but birthdays and Christmas
          were always generous, we went on yearly vacations, had 2 cars,
          and there was enough money for me to take dance classes and
          art lessons and be in Girl Scouts.<br>
          <br>
          My 1940s born Dad raised me to be patriotic and proud, to love
          the war bird airplanes of his era as much as he does, and to
          respect our flag and our country as a sacred thing. I grew up
          thinking that being an American was the greatest gift a person
          could have. I grew up thinking that our country was as strong,
          and honest and true as my Dad. I grew up thinking I was free.<br>
          <br>
          As an adult, I have witnessed the world I grew up in fall to
          ruin. I have watched as our currency and our economy have been
          shamelessly corrupted beyond redemption. Since we’ve been
          married, my husband and I TWICE had our meager investment
          savings gutted by the market that we were told to invest in,
          now that pensions no longer exist and we working stiffs are on
          our own. We will be working until we die, because the Social
          Security we’ve been forced to pay into has also been robbed
          from under us.<br>
          <br>
          I have watched as our elected officials enter Congress as
          ordinary folks and leaves as multi millionaires. I have
          watched my blue collar husband get up at an ungodly hour every
          day and come home with an aching back that we pray will hold
          out long enough to get him to old age in one piece. Outside of
          shoes, socks and underwear, almost everything my family wears
          was bought used. We’ve been on one vacation in 12 years.<br>
          <br>
          We don’t have cell phones, or cable, or any sort of streaming
          services, just a landline and internet. We hardly ever eat
          out. Our house is 1400 square feet, no air conditioning. I
          cook from scratch and I can and I garden and I raise chickens
          for eggs and meat and I moonlight selling things on Etsy.
          Still it is barely enough to pay the bills that go up every
          year while service quality and the longevity of goods goes
          down. What I just described is the life you can live on 60K a
          year without going into debt.<br>
          <br>
          At last calculation, when you consider all of the federal,
          state and local taxes plus registration and user fees,
          Medicare and SS payroll taxes, almost a third of what my
          family earns is stolen by the govt each year. What’s left
          doesn’t go far, just enough to cover the basics and save a
          little for when the wolf howls at the door.<br>
          <br>
          I watched as my family’s health insurance was gutted and
          destroyed. Our private market insurance, which we had to have
          because my husband’s employer is too small to have a group
          plan, was made illegal. We were left with the option of either
          buying an Obamacare plan with unaffordable deductibles and
          insanely ridiculous out of pocket maxes, or paying the very
          gov’t that destroyed our healthcare a fine for not buying the
          gov’t mandated plan that we cannot afford. We now have short
          term insurance that isn’t really insurance at all, and I live
          in fear of one of us getting injured or sick with anything I
          can’t fix from the medicine cabinet.<br>
          <br>
          I have watched as education, which was already sketchy when I
          was a kid, became an all out joke of wholly unmathematical
          math, gold stars for all, and self-loathing anti-Americanism.
          My family has taken an enormous financial hit as I stay home
          to home school our child. At least she’ll be able to do
          old-fashioned math well enough to see how much they are
          screwing her. A silver lining to every cloud, I guess.<br>
          <br>
          I’ve sat by and held my tongue as I was called deplorable and
          a bitter clinger and told that I didn’t build that. I’ve been
          called a racist and a xenophobe and a chump and even an “ugly
          folk.” I’ve been told that I have privilege, and that I have
          inherent bias because of my skin color, and that my beloved
          husband and father are part of a horrible patriarchy. Not one
          goddamn bit of that is true, but if I dare say anything about
          it, it will be used as evidence of my racism and white
          fragility.<br>
          <br>
          Raised to be a Republican, I held my nose and voted for Bush,
          the Texas-talking blue blood from Connecticut who lied us into
          2 wars and gave us the unpatriotic Patriot Act. I voted for
          McCain, the sociopathic neocon songbird “hero” that torpedoed
          the attempt to kill the Obamacare that’s killing my family
          financially. I held it again and voted for Romney, the vulture
          capitalist skunk that masquerades as a Republican while
          slithering over to the Democrat camp as often as they’ll
          tolerate his oily, loathsome presence.<br>
          <br>
          And I voted for Trump, who, if he did nothing else, at least
          gave a resounding Bronx cheer to the richly deserving smug
          hypocrites of DC. Thank you for that Mr. President, on behalf
          of all of us nobodies. God bless you for it.<br>
          <br>
          And now I have watched as people who hate me and mine and call
          for our destruction blatantly and openly stole the election
          and then gaslighted us and told us that it was honest and
          fair. I am watching as the GOP does NOTHING about it. They’re
          probably relieved that upstart Trump is gone so they can get
          back to their real jobs of lining their pockets and running
          interference for their corporate masters. I am watching as the
          media, in a manner that would make Stalin blush, is silencing
          anyone who dares question the legitimacy of this farce they
          call democracy. I know, it’s a republic, but I am so tired of
          explaining that to people I might as well give in and join
          them in ignorance.<br>
          <br>
          I will not vote again; they’ve made it abundantly clear that
          my voice doesn’t matter. Whatever irrational, suicidal lunacy
          the nanny states thinks is best is what I’ll get. What it
          decided I need is a geriatric pedophile who shouldn’t be
          charged with anything more rigorous than choosing between
          tapioca and rice pudding at the old folks home, and a casting
          couch skank who rails against racism while being a descendant
          of slave owners.<br>
          <br>
          I’m free to dismember a baby in my womb and kill it because
          “my body my choice”, but God help me if I won’t cover my face
          with a germ laden Linus-worthy security blanket or refuse let
          them inject genetically altering chemicals into my body or my
          child’s. I can be doxed, fired, shunned and destroyed for
          daring to venture that there are only 2 genders as proven by
          DNA, but a disease with a 99+% survival rate for most humans
          is a deadly pandemic worth murdering an economy over. Because
          science. Idiocracy is real, and we are living it. Dr. Lexus
          would be an improvement over Fauci.<br>
          <br>
          I am done. Don’t ask me to pledge to the flag, or salute the
          troops, or shoot fireworks on the 4th. It’s a sick, twisted,
          heartbreaking joke, this bloated, unrecognizable corpse of a
          republic that once was ours.<br>
          <br>
          I am not alone. Not sure how things continue to function when
          millions of citizens no longer feel any loyalty to or from the
          society they live in.<br>
          <br>
          I was raised to be a lady, and ladies don’t curse, but fuck
          these motherfuckers to hell and back for what they’ve done to
          me, and mine, and my country. All we Joe Blow Americans ever
          wanted was a little patch of land to raise a family, a job to
          pay the bills, and at least some illusion of freedom, and even
          that was too much for these human parasites. They want it all,
          mind, body and soul. Damn them. Damn them all.<br>

          “Mercury/thimerosal and lead (and aluminum) are extremely
          neurotoxic and cytotoxic, but their combined synergistic
          effect is much worse. A dose of mercury sufficient to kill 1%
          of tested rats, when combined with a dose of lead sufficient
          to kill less than 1% of rats, resulted in killing 100% of rats

          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          Plastics are essential in society as a widely available and
          inexpensive material. Mismanagement of personal protective
          equipment (PPE) during COVID-19 pandemic, with a monthly
          estimated use of 129 billion face masks and 65 billion gloves
          globally, is resulting in widespread environmental
          contamination. This poses a risk to public health as a vector
          for SARS-CoV-2 virus, which survives up to 3 days on plastics,
          as well as impacts to ecosystems and organisms more broadly
          functions. Concerns over the role of reusable plastics as
          vectors for SARS-CoV-2 virus contributed to the reversal of
          bans on single-use plastics, highly supported by the plastic
          industry. While not underestimating the importance of plastics
          in the prevention of COVID-19 transmission, it is imperative
          not to undermine recent progress made in the sustainable use
          of plastics. There is a need to assess alternatives that allow
          reductions of PPE and reinforce awareness on the proper public
          use and disposal. Finally, assessment of contamination and
          impacts of plastics driven by the pandemic will be required

          ...For DNs, the commission of their crimes and malefactions
          themselves are NOT the most potent source of diabolical
          satisfaction.&nbsp; No – the real rush, the “high” that they
          crave more than anything is THE GETTING AWAY WITH IT.
          Specifically, DNs luxuriate in watching other people, whether
          it be out of fear or sycophancy, pretend to not see, or better
          yet lie to cover, or even better yet, positively defend and
          justify, their crimes...<br>
          <br>
          What is going on now simultaneously with CoronaCold, the
          Masonic Burqa of Submission, and the lockdowns AND the
          obvious, open vote fraud in the 2020 election is exactly this
          – they want you to see, know, and GIVE UP. It is your giving
          up that is their ultimate psycho-fetish....<br>
          <br>
          This is why the pathological effeminacy of our culture is
          super-fuel for DN tyrants.&nbsp; They are watching you.&nbsp;
          They are watching your utter passivity, and it feeds
          them.&nbsp; The musloids are watching as the men of Europe
          literally stand and stare as they rape their women and
          children in front of them.&nbsp; The Deep State regime is
          watching you as they destroy your culture and stoke Civil War
          in front of you...<br>

              takes maiden flight of the first electric wingsuit
              designed with BMW that hits speeds of 186 miles per hour
              while soaring 10,000 feet in the air</b><br>
          </div>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Skydiver Peter Salzmann teamed up with BMW
          to design an electric wingsuit<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The system is comprised of a chest mount
          that holds two propellers<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The propellers&nbsp; deliver a power of 7.5
          kW and a speed of around 25,000 rpm<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a thruster on the left sleeve of
          the suit that provides a boost of power <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When pushed, the wingsuit hits speeds of
          186 miles per hour for five minutes <br>
          <br>
          BMW is taking passengers to new heights with the first
          electric driving system for a wingsuit that hits speeds of 186
          miles per - traditional suits only reach 62 miles per hour.<br>
          <br>
          The design is the brain child of professional skydiver Peter
          Salzmann, who worked with the German carmaker to bring the
          vision from a drawing to the first flight test.<br>
          <br>
          A chest mount is strapped to the suit that houses two carbon
          propellers that deliver a power of 7.5 kW, a speed of around
          25,000 rpm and a total output of 15 kW, which is available for
          five minutes.<br>
          <br>
          For the maiden flight, Salzmann was brought 10,000 feet into
          the air over the Alps mountain range.<br>
          <br>
          After the jump, the daredevil soared towards the direction of
          the mountain, hit a thruster on the suit and zoomed across the
          peak in steep flight.<br>
          <br>
          The idea of an electric wingsuit came to Salzmann, who is from
          Austria, in 2017, which began as sketches that turned into
          digital models and then the first prototype.<br>
          <br>
          'The very first one was made of cardboard – and I built it so
          that I could get a feel for the size of the fly unit, i.e. the
          impeller unit including the batteries and everything that goes
          with it,' explains Salzmann.'Initially we were going to put
          the propulsion unit on the back. But after the initial
          drawings and discussions with aerodynamics experts, we decided
          to move the fly unit to the front.' <br>
          <br>
          He then teamed up with BMW, which provided the necessary tools
          to create the suit and driving <br>
          <br>
          The group worked on a smaller system, about 40 inches wide,
          equipped with two five inch propellers – together it looked
          like 'a futuristic mini-submarine,' according to Slazmann.<br>
          <br>
          The chest mount is powered by a 50 volt lithium battery that
          weighs around 26 pound and also equipped with an energy
          storage unit.<br>
          <br>
          And the secret sauce of the design is the throttle attached to
          the left sleeve that provides a boost of power to hit speeds
          of 186 miles per hour...<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>Cost-effective, efficacious therapeutics are urgently
          needed against the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we used camelid
          immunization and proteomics to identify a large repertoire of
          highly potent neutralizing nanobodies (Nbs) to the SARS-CoV-2
          spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). We discovered
          Nbs with picomolar to femtomolar affinities that inhibit viral
          infection at sub-ng/ml concentration and determined a
          structure of one of the most potent in complex with RBD.
          Structural proteomics and integrative modeling revealed
          multiple distinct and non-overlapping epitopes and indicated
          an array of potential neutralization mechanisms. We
          constructed multivalent Nb constructs that achieved ultrahigh
          neutralization potency (IC50s as low as 0.058 ng/ml) and may
          prevent mutational escape. These thermostable Nbs can be
          rapidly produced in bulk from microbes and resist
          lyophilization, and aerosolization.<br>

              Medicine to Fight Against the Novel Coronavirus COVID-19</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          A story titled "Delhi-based institute claims to 'cure'
          COVID-19 through cosmic sound therapy" was forwarded to me on
          a Telegram group.&nbsp; This article aroused my interest and
          attention because I have been looking for a method of
          treatment using vibrational frequencies to breakdown the novel
          coronavirus Covid-19 through resonance effect.<br>
          <br>
          This article was written by Somrita Ghosh, and was published
          on the New Indian Express on July 4, 2020, with a subtitle
          "Vibrational frequencies of coronavirus and two enzymes were
          decoded, and since each of them have different frequencies,
          the three sound waves have been designed to deal with each of
          them."<br>
          <br>
          It writes about the promising results shown using vibrational
          frequencies for patients with the novel coronavirus Covid-19
          at the Human Energy Research Centre in India. It is said that
          the therapy is based on the ancient Vedic philosophy that "the
          entire universe is eternally in a state of subtle vibrations."
          Thus, if the vibrational frequencies of the novel coronavirus
          and its related enzymes are able to be decoded, then one can
          cause resonance effect to break their structures, as "the
          virus, which has a protein cell layer, starts vibrating and
          therefore the chemical bond breaks down. The virus cannot
          sustain beyond a certain energy level," according to the team.
          <br>
          <br>
          With volunteer patients who continued their routine
          medications, the team conducted a trial in May 2020, and
          promising results were shown.<br>
          <br>
          During the hour-long sound therapy, the patients are made to
          listen sounds with three different frequencies stage-wise.
          Each stage has a duration of seven minutes and there’s a gap
          of five minutes between each stage. Four to six sessions in a
          span of two-three days are required to complete the course.<br>
          <br>
          According to the news article, the therapy was developed by Dr
          Ramesh Vaish, Ikwan Onwuka, and Dr Harsh Rastogi...<br>
          <br>
          <b>My Research Summary And Results</b><br>
          Concerning COVID-19, I have been collecting bioinformatics
          data since December 2019. With these, I have done several
          calculations involving the Energy equations of Quantum
          Physics. Virus particles or virions are quantum entities. As
          such, they display wave-particle duality and obey the laws of
          Quantum Mechanics. The calculations were aimed at establishing
          Energy, Frequency and Vibrational relationships between
          SARS-CoV-2 and the potential therapeutic drugs.<br>
          <br>
          I have analyzed the Genome sequence of the original
          Wuhan-virus, the genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus
          obtained from the first COVID-19 patient quarantined in my
          home country. In addition, I examined the bioinformatics of
          the two major enzymes responsible for the replication and
          transcription of the virus in infected humans – the
          RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) and the Protease. Also
          included in my analyses are some of the drugs that have
          received pre-trial approval for treating COVID-19. These are:
          Remdesivir, Chloroquine, Indinavir, Indinavir Hydrate,
          Lopinavir and Favipiravir.<br>
          <br>
          The outcome of my analyses shows, for sure, that there are
          coherent Frequency and Vibrational connections between all the
          factors I evaluated. This relationship became very obvious
          when I applied the Octave rule and translated the frequencies
          into their equivalents within the 12-band chromatic scale of
          western musicology. The equal-tempered chromatic scale
          simulates quantization within the audible sound range of the
          electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
          <br>
          A very striking observation was that the frequencies of the
          protein enzymes (Polymerase and Protease) which aid
          replication and transcription of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has a
          unique harmonic relationship, musically speaking. One was a
          perfect fifth of the other. Wondering if that was mere
          coincidence, I decided to check for a similar musical
          relationship between the Polymerase and Protease of another
          well-known virus. The easy pick was HIV-1 virus and when I ran
          my frequency calculations, the same harmonic relationship
          showed up between HIV-1 polymerase and protease.<br>
          <br>
          The most pleasant surprise came when I translated the
          frequency values I got for the potential COVID-19 drugs
          (Remdesivir, Chloroquine, Indinavir, Indinavir Hydrate,
          Lopinavir, and Favipiravir) into their octave equivalents
          within the quantized chromatic scale. I found that every one
          of these drug frequencies matched the frequency of the
          protease. The only exception was the frequency of Remdesivir,
          which matched the natural frequency of SARS-CoV-2, the
          COVID-19 virion...0<br>

          <b>The Pattern</b><br>
          By matching the frequencies/quantized audio bandwidth of the
          drugs to those of the virus and its enzyme proteins, an
          interesting pattern emerges. One could see why and how these
          drugs, discounting their side-effects, might be effective
          against COVID-19.<br>
          <br>
          With the exception of Remdesivir, the frequency of all the
          drugs I analyzed fall within the quantized bandwidth of Key
          A#/Bb. This matches the bandwidth of the virus’ Protease.
          Therefore, the mechanism of action of these drugs will have
          more to do with protease inhibition, irrespective of the
          target they were originally developed for.<br>
          <br>
          None of the drugs I analyzed matched the Polymerase in
          frequency or quantized bandwidth...<br>
          <br>
          <b>The Energy-Frequency-Vibration (EFV) Model</b><br>
          Viewed from the paradigm of Energy, Frequency and Vibration,
          it is evident that the action of Remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2
          results from the affinity between its vibrational frequency
          and that of the virus particle. Likewise, the effects of the
          other drugs evaluated here can be interpreted satisfactorily
          in terms of Energy, Frequency, and Vibration.<br>
          <br>
          As an example, the mechanism of action of Remdesivir can be
          explained by the principle of RESONANCE. The drug molecules
          sets up a vibration at its natural frequency. This vibration
          induces resonance in the virus molecule since both molecules
          have the same natural frequency. As a result of induced
          resonance vibration, the virus molecule self-amplifies. If the
          induced resonance and amplification is sustained, the energy
          generated within the virus molecule pushes towards a fatal
          threshold. Beyond this threshold, the chemical bonds of the
          virus molecule are broken leading to the inactivation of the
          virus molecule.<br>
          <br>
          The same phenomenon of induced resonance explains the
          inhibition effect of the remaining drugs under study.
          Resonance, therefore, is the mechanism of action of all these
          therapeutic compounds. And resonance is a function of energy,
          frequency, and vibration.<br>
          <br>
          Scientific evidence supports the application of resonance in
          breaking of chemical bonds and inactivation of Chromosome DNA
          and RNA molecules<b> : </b><b>https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7088816</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          <b>The EFV Alternative To Drugs And Vaccines?</b><br>
          Each of the drugs (Chloroquine, Indinavir, Lopinavir,
          Favipiravir) analyzed here are made from unique combinations
          of elements. Although they all are potential treatment agents
          for COVID-19, no two of them are the same in composition. This
          clearly shows that the drugs’ effectiveness is dependent on a
          factor other than elemental composition. This secondary
          factor, which I have shown to be the natural/resonant
          frequency of the drugs, is the common working principle. In
          other words, the drugs have effects on the virus mainly
          because they vibrate at a certain frequency...<br>
          <br>
          <b>The End of COVID-19</b><br>
          I have designed three sound samples for auditory stimulation,
          based on the three target resonant frequencies. Each of these
          samples is a composite of ten pure sinusoidal tones. All ten
          tones are octave related and fall within the audio range of
          the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
          <br>
          The actual values, in Hertz, for the resonant frequencies, are
          higher than the audible range. But, I comfortably employed
          their audible octaves because of the law of Octaves. In
          dealing with sound, and any electromagnetic wave,
          frequency-wise, an octave can be used to the same effect as
          the frequency itself.<br>
          <br>
          To enhance brainwave entrainment, each of the composite
          auditory stimulus sounds is pulsed into isochronic beats. The
          frequency of the isochronic beat is a much lower octave of the
          target resonant frequency. I chose the delta brainwave region.<br>
          <br>
          These isochronic sounds are tuned to the resonant frequencies
          associated with SARS-CoV-2 Genome ID: MN908947, the
          coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Listening to these sounds
          will ENTRAIN the brain and cause it to produce a SENSORY
          EVOKED RESPONSE, which is an electrical potential mimicking
          the frequency of this sound stimulus. This electrical
          potential is propagated through the central nervous system,
          CNS, and the peripheral nervous system, PNS, to every cell in
          the human organism. Should there be SARS-CoV-2 in the body
          system, as is the case with COVID-19 victims, the virus will
          VIBRATE in RESONANCE with the incident frequency. Such
          resonance vibration causes the virus particle to
          uncontrollably absorb energy to a point where it’s chemical
          bonds are broken and the virus inactivated.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Instructions:</b><b><br>
          </b>Make sure you are well hydrated before listening to any of
          the sounds. Listen to each 7 minutes track, 3 times with 20
          minutes intervals. That means you’d spend approximately 61
          minutes on each track. Please adhere to this instruction,
          especially for first-time use. It is preferable to listen to
          headphones but not compulsory. When you are done with the
          first track, give yourself a few hours before listening to the
          second track. You don’t need to listen to all the tracks in
          one stretch. If you are not infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus,
          the sounds will target other pathogens with resonant
          frequencies close to that of SAR-CoV-2. There are no
          significant side-effects except for slight fatigue, which
          usually occurs when a large number of parasites, bacteria and
          viruses are killed in the body.<br>

          a musical equivalent of the frequencies I obtained from
          computational proteomic analysis of the genes associated with
          the SARS-CoV-2 virion. The harmony of this musical
          composition, according to my hypothesis, will further help to
          reduce the chaotic and Inflammatory activity of the virus by
          entraining the vibrational expression of the associated

          Vibrational frequencies of coronavirus and two enzymes were
          decoded, and since each of them have different frequencies,
          the three sound waves have been designed to deal with each of
          them.<br>
          <br>
          The Human Energy Research Centre — an organisation based on
          Public-Private Engagement model — in the national capital has
          claimed to have found a way to cure the COVID-19 by using an
          extraordinary sound therapy, electro-frequency vibration.<br>
          <br>
          The therapy, developed by Dr Ramesh Vaish, Ikwan Onwuka and Dr
          Harsh Rastogi, is claimed to be based on the principle derived
          from the ancient Vedic philosophy that the entire universe is
          eternally in a state of subtle vibrations called cosmic sound.
          Combining this knowledge with the principles of quantum theory
          applicable to a wave, the experts developed three sound waves.
          <br>
          <br>
          Vibrational frequencies of coronavirus and two enzymes were
          decoded, and since each of them have different frequencies,
          the three sound waves have been designed to deal with each of
          them.<br>
          <br>
          “This sound therapy is completely harmless, drug-free and does
          not have any side-effects. There is a lot of physics involved
          in this technique; it is not a medical process. The sound
          waves will attack the virus and create resonance. The virus,
          which has a protein cell layer, starts vibrating and therefore
          the chemical bond breaks down. The virus cannot sustain beyond
          a certain energy level,” said Dr Vaish.<br>
          <br>
          A trial was conducted in May on some symptomatic patients in
          home isolation, who volunteered for it. Along with the
          therapy, the patients continued their medicinal routine.
          According to Dr Vaish, the patients showed improvement within
          days.<br>
          <br>
          “After promising results, we pitched the idea to some
          hospitals to implement it on interested patients. Some private
          hospitals have agreed and one is likely to start it in two
          days,” he&nbsp; said. <br>
          <br>
          The researches claimed that since this therapy doesn’t involve
          any medical treatment and was to be provided to patients on
          voluntary basis, any approval from a regulatory authority
          wasn’t required.<br>
          <br>
          However, they claimed to have informed the Delhi government
          and received a go-ahead from health minister Satyendar Jain.<br>
          <br>
          During the hour-long therapy, the patients are made to listen
          three different sounds — including Gayatri Mantra and Maha
          Mrityunjay Mantra — stage-wise. Each stage has a duration of
          seven minutes and there’s a gap of five minutes between each
          stage. Four to six sessions in a span of two-three days are
          required to complete the course.<br>
          <br>
          They have approached the Health and AYUSH Ministries to
          implement the therapy on a regular basis and larger scale.<br>
          <br>
          “If approved, it will be the first of its kind in the world.
          We’ve come to know that a US institute is working on the same
          concept,” he said. <br>

          Chromosomes are long molecules that naturally vibrate in
          different modes and are subject to random perturbations of the
          medium. Inducing vibration at the resonance frequency may be
          sufficient to cause the inactivation of the molecule by
          breaking chemical bonds. In this study we create a
          computational model of chromosomes and analyse the
          corresponding resonance frequencies. A simplified geometry is
          proposed to mimic chromosome arms. Each is represented by
          considering an eccentric cone. Running the simulations on a
          numerical package, the natural frequency was found for various
          chromosomes, in two modes of vibrations. Results show that
          each chromosome type presents different resonance frequencies
          in a range from 1.2 kHz up to 105 kHz. Changing mass and
          length of chromosome arm in a significant manner will produce
          a change in resonant frequency, as illustrated in the
          following graphics. This behavior may be use to derive new
          therapy forms targeting the destruction of mutated
          chromosomes.<br>

              engineers at The University of Texas at Austin can pull
              water from the air and distribute it to plants</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          A new type of soil created by engineers at The University of
          Texas at Austin can pull water from the air and distribute it
          to plants, potentially expanding the map of farmable land
          around the globe to previously inhospitable places and
          reducing water use in agriculture at a time of growing
          droughts.<br>
          <br>
          The team’s atmospheric water irrigation system uses
          super-moisture-absorbent gels to capture water from the air.
          When the soil is heated to a certain temperature, the gels
          release the water, making it available to plants. When the
          soil distributes water, some of it goes back into the air,
          increasing humidity and making it easier to continue the
          harvesting cycle.<br>
          <br>
          “Enabling free-standing agriculture in areas where it’s hard
          to build up irrigation and power systems is crucial to
          liberating crop farming from the complex water supply chain as
          resources become increasingly scarce,” said Guihua Yu,
          associate professor of materials science in the Walker
          Department of Mechanical Engineering.<br>
          <br>
          Each gram of soil can extract approximately 3-4 grams of
          water. Depending on the crops, approximately 0.1 to 1 kilogram
          of the soil can provide enough water to irrigate about a
          square meter of farmland.<br>
          <br>
          The gels in the soil pull water out of the air during cooler,
          more humid periods at night. Solar heat during the day
          activates the water-containing gels to release their contents
          into soil.<br>
          <br>
          The team ran experiments on the roof of the Cockrell School’s
          Engineering Teaching Center building at UT Austin to test the
          soil. They found that the hydrogel soil was able to retain
          water better than sandy soils found in dry areas, and it
          needed far less water to grow plants.<br>
          <br>
          During a four-week experiment, the team found that its soil
          retained approximately 40% of the water quantity it started
          with. In contrast, the sandy soil had only 20% of its water
          left after just one week.<br>
          <br>
          In another experiment, the team planted radishes in both types
          of soil. The radishes in the hydrogel soil all survived a
          14-day period without any irrigation beyond an initial round
          to make sure the plants took hold. Radishes in the sandy soil
          were irrigated several times during the first four days of the
          experiment. None of the radishes in the sandy soil survived
          more than two days after the initial irrigation period.<br>
          <br>
          “Most soil is good enough to support the growth of plants,”
          said Fei Zhao, a postdoctoral researcher in Yu’s research
          group who led the study with Xingyi Zhou and Panpan Zhang.
          “It’s the water that is the main limitation, so that is why we
          wanted to develop a soil that can harvest water from the
          ambient air.”<br>
          <br>
          The water-harvesting soil is the first big application of
          technology that Yu’s group has been working on for more than
          two years. Last year, the team developed the capability to use
          gel-polymer hybrid materials that work like “super sponges,”
          extracting large amounts of water from the ambient air,
          cleaning it and quickly releasing it using solar energy.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers envision several other applications of the
          technology. It could potentially be used for cooling solar
          panels and data centers. It could expand access to drinking
          water, either through individual systems for households or
          larger systems for big groups such as workers or soldiers.<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>An atmospheric water irrigation system based on super
          moisture absorbent gels (SMAG) is developed for sustainable
          agriculture technology. The SMAG-soil can harvest water from
          the air and provide water to the plants upon solar heating
          regardless of the local accessibility to liquid water
          resources. As a benefit of this solar-powered atmospheric
          water irrigation system, agriculture can become geographically
          and hydrologically independent. Thus, crop planting in
          underdeveloped and drought areas can be liberated from the
          long-distance water and power supplies.<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>Supplying global energy demand with CO2-free technologies
          is becoming feasible thanks to the rising affordability of
          renewable resources. Hydrogen is a promising vector in the
          decarbonization of energy systems, but more efficient and
          scalable synthesis is required to enable its widespread
          deployment. Here we report contactless H2 production via water
          electrolysis mediated by the microwave-triggered redox
          activation of solid-state ionic materials at low temperatures
          (&lt;250 °C). Water was reduced via reaction with
          non-equilibrium gadolinium-doped CeO2 that was previously in
          situ electrochemically deoxygenated by the sole application of
          microwaves. The microwave-driven reduction was identified by
          an instantaneous electrical conductivity rise and O2 release.
          This process was cyclable, whereas H2 yield and energy
          efficiency were material- and power-dependent. Deoxygenation
          of low-energy molecules (H2O or CO2) led to the formation of
          energy carriers and enabled CH4 production when integrated
          with a Sabatier reactor. This method could be extended to
          other reactions such as intensified hydrocarbons synthesis or
          oxidation.<br>

              Facts About Vaccination Anti Vaccine</b><br>

              <br>
            </b></div>
          During the Dark Ages, before the introduction of improved
          nutrition and sanitation, the world was intermittently visited
          with epidemics of smallpox. The cause was stubbornly ignored
          and the seeds for more disease were sown when vaccination was
          brought into popular use. This infusion of poison injected
          into the blood stream of the masses only served to intensify
          the disease in some cases, suppress the symptoms in others and
          create new and more serious diseases in still others. So, with
          the passing of years we have seen this misbegotten child of
          ignorance grow into a Frankenstein monster of immense
          proportions that moves relentlessly forward, grinding under
          foot the multitudes that throng its path.<br>
          Through the lethal power of this poisoned needle, the simple
          zymotic (contagious) diseases of the past have been devolved
          into the horrors of the present — our terrifying and expanding
          crop of "killer diseases". Many of these strange "mystery
          diseases" that baffle the entire medical world, are the sordid
          products of vaccine poisons that disturb the chemical balance
          of the body and interfere with normal functioning.<br>
          All these medically-made atrocities are far worse than
          smallpox or any of the other eruptive diseases that nature
          provides as a means of expelling the accumulated poison waste
          from the abused body. This interference with the balanced
          economy of nature has multiplied the problems beyond the power
          of science to control.<br>
          Our worst epidemics now are epidemics of vaccination in which
          more people are killed every year by "vaccinal diseases" than
          by the diseases that the vaccinations were supposed to combat.<br>
          Complete freedom from disease can scarcely be found except in
          remote islands or isolated communities that have not been
          invaded by medical mischief and commercialized products. Is<br>
          our proud civilization to be degraded, corrupted, and
          destroyed by its own inventions designed for selfish profit
          and exploitation of the race?<br>
          Vaccination, instead of being the promised blessing to the
          world, has proved to be a curse of such sweeping devastation
          that it has caused more death and disease than war,
          pestilence, and plague combined. There is no scourge (with the
          possible exception of atomic radiation) that is more
          destructive to our nation’s health than this monument of human
          deception — this slayer of the innocent —this crippler of body
          and brain<br>

              <br>
            </b></div>
          A study involving more than 5,000 COVID-19 patients in Houston
          finds that the virus that causes the disease is accumulating
          genetic mutations, one of which may have made it more
          contagious. According to the paper published in the
          peer-reviewed journal mBIO, that mutation, called D614G, is
          located in the spike protein that pries open our cells for
          viral entry. It’s the largest peer-reviewed study of
          SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in one metropolitan region of the
          U.S. to date.<br>
          <br>
          The paper shows “the virus is mutating due to a combination of
          neutral drift — which just means random genetic changes that
          don’t help or hurt the virus — and pressure from our immune
          systems,” said Ilya Finkelstein, associate professor of
          molecular biosciences at The University of Texas at Austin and
          co-author of the study. The study was carried out by
          scientists at Houston Methodist Hospital, UT Austin and
          elsewhere.<br>
          <br>
          During the initial wave of the pandemic, 71% of the novel
          coronaviruses identified in patients in Houston had this
          mutation. When the second wave of the outbreak hit Houston
          during the summer, this variant had leaped to 99.9%
          prevalence. This mirrors a trend observed around the world. A
          study published in July based on more than 28,000 genome
          sequences found that variants carrying the D614G mutation
          became the globally dominant form of SARS-CoV-2 in about a
          month. SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that causes COVID-19....<b><br>

              genetic disease that’s killed 40% of known patients by
              attacking lungs and immune system </b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>...The disease – ‘vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked,
          autoinflammatory and somatic syndrome’ – has been dubbed
          VEXAS. It causes symptoms that include blood clots in veins,
          recurrent fevers, abnormalities in the lungs, and vacuoles –
          unusual cavity-like structures – in the myeloid cells, which
          play a crucial part in the human immune system.<br>
          <br>
          Researchers at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) came
          across the disease after analyzing the genome sequences of
          more than 2,500 people with undiagnosed inflammatory diseases.
          In comparing the data, they found that 25 adult males had
          particular mutations in the UBA1 gene, which is believed to be
          the source of VEXAS.<br>
          <br>
          “Instead of looking at clinical similarities, we were instead
          taking advantage of shared genomic similarities that could
          help us discover a completely new disease,” said Daniel
          Kastner, the scientific director of the Intramural Research
          Program at the National Human Genome Research Institute.<br>
          <br>
          The NIH reported that the new disease “can be
          life-threatening,” as 40 percent of the VEXAS patients the
          researchers studied have died. The high death toll revealed
          “the devastating consequences of the severe condition,” the
          team stated.<br>
          <br>
          Kastner told NBC News that patients with VEXAS become “really
          sick,” and “don’t respond to any treatments, from high doses
          of steroids to various chemotherapies.”<br>

              Adult-Onset Autoinflammatory Disease</b><br>
            <b>David B. Beck, et al.</b><br>
          </div>
          <b>Abstract<br>
            Background<br>
          </b>Adult-onset inflammatory syndromes often manifest with
          overlapping clinical features. Variants in ubiquitin-related
          genes, previously implicated in autoinflammatory disease, may
          define new disorders.<b><br>
            Methods<br>
          </b>We analyzed peripheral-blood exome sequence data
          independent of clinical phenotype and inheritance pattern to
          identify deleterious mutations in ubiquitin-related genes.
          Sanger sequencing, immunoblotting, immunohistochemical
          testing, flow cytometry, and transcriptome and cytokine
          profiling were performed. CRISPR-Cas9–edited zebrafish were
          used as an in vivo model to assess gene function.<b><br>
            Results<br>
          </b>We identified 25 men with somatic mutations affecting
          methionine-41 (p.Met41) in UBA1, the major E1 enzyme that
          initiates ubiquitylation. (The gene UBA1 lies on the X
          chromosome.) In such patients, an often fatal,
          treatment-refractory inflammatory syndrome develops in late
          adulthood, with fevers, cytopenias, characteristic vacuoles in
          myeloid and erythroid precursor cells, dysplastic bone marrow,
          neutrophilic cutaneous and pulmonary inflammation, chondritis,
          and vasculitis. Most of these 25 patients met clinical
          criteria for an inflammatory syndrome (relapsing
          polychondritis, Sweet’s syndrome, polyarteritis nodosa, or
          giant-cell arteritis) or a hematologic condition
          (myelodysplastic syndrome or multiple myeloma) or both.
          Mutations were found in more than half the hematopoietic stem
          cells, including peripheral-blood myeloid cells but not
          lymphocytes or fibroblasts. Mutations affecting p.Met41
          resulted in loss of the canonical cytoplasmic isoform of UBA1
          and in expression of a novel, catalytically impaired isoform
          initiated at p.Met67. Mutant peripheral-blood cells showed
          decreased ubiquitylation and activated innate immune pathways.
          Knockout of the cytoplasmic UBA1 isoform homologue in
          zebrafish caused systemic inflammation.<b><br>
            Conclusions<br>
          </b>Using a genotype-driven approach, we identified a disorder
          that connects seemingly unrelated adult-onset inflammatory
          syndromes. We named this disorder the VEXAS (vacuoles, E1
          enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome. (Funded
          by the NIH Intramural Research Programs and the EU Horizon
          2020 Research and Innovation Program.)<br>

          <b><br>
          </b>...To mimic the flight behaviour of birds, Ajanic and his
          colleagues equipped the robot with motors that allow its wings
          to fold in or out, and its tail to contract or to fan out.
          After completing the design stage, the team performed a number
          of wind tunnel tests, optimisation studies, and outdoor flight
          tests.<br>
          <br>
          When gaining height, the bio-inspired robot spreads both its
          wings and tail, and then, upon reaching top speed, the
          feather-like plates – 9 on each wing and a further 9 on the
          tail – are tucked in, thereby enhancing aerodynamics and
          providing for a more realistic flight simulation.<br>
          <br>
          For more rapid altitude adjustment, the tail can also be moved
          in all four directions. Furthermore, each wing can be expanded
          and retracted independently to increase drag. This, according
          to the team, allows the robot to use 55.4% less power when
          travelling at its optimal speed (about 9.6 m/s) than it
          otherwise would with both wings and tail fully open.<br>
          <br>
          “The morphing wing and tail structures of this design are
          insightful and novel,” said Jonathan Aitken at the University
          of Sheffield, UK, who was impressed by the robot’s ability to
          adjust its manoeuvrability mid-flight. “It offers the
          potential for unconventional flight manoeuvres, such as slow
          but controlled flight at high angles of attack”...<br>

              extends drone flight capabilities</b><br>
            <b>Enrico Ajanic, et al.</b><br>
          </div>
          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>The aerodynamic designs of winged drones are optimized for
          specific flight regimes. Large lifting surfaces provide
          maneuverability and agility but result in larger power
          consumption, and thus lower range, when flying fast compared
          with small lifting surfaces. Birds like the northern goshawk
          meet these opposing aerodynamic requirements of aggressive
          flight in dense forests and fast cruising in the open terrain
          by adapting wing and tail areas. Here, we show that this
          morphing strategy and the synergy of the two morphing surfaces
          can notably improve the agility, maneuverability, stability,
          flight speed range, and required power of a drone in different
          flight regimes by means of an avian-inspired drone. We
          characterize the drone’s flight capabilities for different
          morphing configurations in wind tunnel tests, optimization
          studies, and outdoor flight tests. These results shed light on
          the avian use of wings and tails and offer an alternative
          design principle for drones with adaptive flight capabilities.<br>

          </div>
          &nbsp;study involving more than 5,000 COVID-19 patients in
          Houston finds that the virus that causes the disease is
          accumulating genetic mutations, one of which may have made it
          more contagious. According to the paper published in the
          peer-reviewed journal mBIO, that mutation, called D614G, is
          located in the spike protein that pries open our cells for
          viral entry. It’s the largest peer-reviewed study of
          SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in one metropolitan region of the
          U.S. to date.<br>
          <br>
          The paper shows “the virus is mutating due to a combination of
          neutral drift — which just means random genetic changes that
          don’t help or hurt the virus — and pressure from our immune
          systems,” said Ilya Finkelstein, associate professor of
          molecular biosciences at The University of Texas at Austin and
          co-author of the study. The study was carried out by
          scientists at Houston Methodist Hospital, UT Austin and
          elsewhere.<b><br>
            <br>
          </b>During the initial wave of the pandemic, 71% of the novel
          coronaviruses identified in patients in Houston had this
          mutation. When the second wave of the outbreak hit Houston
          during the summer, this variant had leaped to 99.9%
          prevalence. This mirrors a trend observed around the world. A
          study published in July based on more than 28,000 genome
          sequences found that variants carrying the D614G mutation
          became the globally dominant form of SARS-CoV-2 in about a
          month. SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that causes COVID-19....<br>

              genetic disease that’s killed 40% of known patients by
              attacking lungs and immune system </b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>...The disease – ‘vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked,
          autoinflammatory and somatic syndrome’ – has been dubbed
          VEXAS. It causes symptoms that include blood clots in veins,
          recurrent fevers, abnormalities in the lungs, and vacuoles –
          unusual cavity-like structures – in the myeloid cells, which
          play a crucial part in the human immune system.<br>
          <br>
          Researchers at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) came
          across the disease after analyzing the genome sequences of
          more than 2,500 people with undiagnosed inflammatory diseases.
          In comparing the data, they found that 25 adult males had
          particular mutations in the UBA1 gene, which is believed to be
          the source of VEXAS.<br>
          <br>
          “Instead of looking at clinical similarities, we were instead
          taking advantage of shared genomic similarities that could
          help us discover a completely new disease,” said Daniel
          Kastner, the scientific director of the Intramural Research
          Program at the National Human Genome Research Institute.<br>
          <br>
          The NIH reported that the new disease “can be
          life-threatening,” as 40 percent of the VEXAS patients the
          researchers studied have died. The high death toll revealed
          “the devastating consequences of the severe condition,” the
          team stated.<br>
          <br>
          Kastner told NBC News that patients with VEXAS become “really
          sick,” and “don’t respond to any treatments, from high doses
          of steroids to various chemotherapies.”<br>

              Adult-Onset Autoinflammatory Disease</b><br>
            <b>David B. Beck, et al.</b><br>
          </div>
          <b>Abstract<br>
            Background<br>
          </b>Adult-onset inflammatory syndromes often manifest with
          overlapping clinical features. Variants in ubiquitin-related
          genes, previously implicated in autoinflammatory disease, may
          define new disorders.<br>
          <b>Methods<br>
          </b>We analyzed peripheral-blood exome sequence data
          independent of clinical phenotype and inheritance pattern to
          identify deleterious mutations in ubiquitin-related genes.
          Sanger sequencing, immunoblotting, immunohistochemical
          testing, flow cytometry, and transcriptome and cytokine
          profiling were performed. CRISPR-Cas9–edited zebrafish were
          used as an in vivo model to assess gene function.<br>
          <b>Results<br>
          </b>We identified 25 men with somatic mutations affecting
          methionine-41 (p.Met41) in UBA1, the major E1 enzyme that
          initiates ubiquitylation. (The gene UBA1 lies on the X
          chromosome.) In such patients, an often fatal,
          treatment-refractory inflammatory syndrome develops in late
          adulthood, with fevers, cytopenias, characteristic vacuoles in
          myeloid and erythroid precursor cells, dysplastic bone marrow,
          neutrophilic cutaneous and pulmonary inflammation, chondritis,
          and vasculitis. Most of these 25 patients met clinical
          criteria for an inflammatory syndrome (relapsing
          polychondritis, Sweet’s syndrome, polyarteritis nodosa, or
          giant-cell arteritis) or a hematologic condition
          (myelodysplastic syndrome or multiple myeloma) or both.
          Mutations were found in more than half the hematopoietic stem
          cells, including peripheral-blood myeloid cells but not
          lymphocytes or fibroblasts. Mutations affecting p.Met41
          resulted in loss of the canonical cytoplasmic isoform of UBA1
          and in expression of a novel, catalytically impaired isoform
          initiated at p.Met67. Mutant peripheral-blood cells showed
          decreased ubiquitylation and activated innate immune pathways.
          Knockout of the cytoplasmic UBA1 isoform homologue in
          zebrafish caused systemic inflammation.<br>
          <b>Conclusions<br>
          </b>Using a genotype-driven approach, we identified a disorder
          that connects seemingly unrelated adult-onset inflammatory
          syndromes. We named this disorder the VEXAS (vacuoles, E1
          enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome. (Funded

          </b>...To mimic the flight behaviour of birds, Ajanic and his
          colleagues equipped the robot with motors that allow its wings
          to fold in or out, and its tail to contract or to fan out.
          After completing the design stage, the team performed a number
          of wind tunnel tests, optimisation studies, and outdoor flight
          tests.<br>
          <br>
          When gaining height, the bio-inspired robot spreads both its
          wings and tail, and then, upon reaching top speed, the
          feather-like plates – 9 on each wing and a further 9 on the
          tail – are tucked in, thereby enhancing aerodynamics and
          providing for a more realistic flight simulation.<br>
          <br>
          For more rapid altitude adjustment, the tail can also be moved
          in all four directions. Furthermore, each wing can be expanded
          and retracted independently to increase drag. This, according
          to the team, allows the robot to use 55.4% less power when
          travelling at its optimal speed (about 9.6 m/s) than it
          otherwise would with both wings and tail fully open.<br>
          <br>
          “The morphing wing and tail structures of this design are
          insightful and novel,” said Jonathan Aitken at the University
          of Sheffield, UK, who was impressed by the robot’s ability to
          adjust its manoeuvrability mid-flight. “It offers the
          potential for unconventional flight manoeuvres, such as slow
          but controlled flight at high angles of attack”...<br>

              extends drone flight capabilities</b><br>
            <b>Enrico Ajanic, et al.</b><br>
          </div>
          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>The aerodynamic designs of winged drones are optimized for
          specific flight regimes. Large lifting surfaces provide
          maneuverability and agility but result in larger power
          consumption, and thus lower range, when flying fast compared
          with small lifting surfaces. Birds like the northern goshawk
          meet these opposing aerodynamic requirements of aggressive
          flight in dense forests and fast cruising in the open terrain
          by adapting wing and tail areas. Here, we show that this
          morphing strategy and the synergy of the two morphing surfaces
          can notably improve the agility, maneuverability, stability,
          flight speed range, and required power of a drone in different
          flight regimes by means of an avian-inspired drone. We
          characterize the drone’s flight capabilities for different
          morphing configurations in wind tunnel tests, optimization
          studies, and outdoor flight tests. These results shed light on
          the avian use of wings and tails and offer an alternative
          design principle for drones with adaptive flight capabilities.<br>

          </b>...Using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), the
          University of Arkansas has harvested the energy demonstrated
          by free-standing graphene as it demonstrates constant
          out-of-plane random movement. Surprisingly, they propose that
          using a single diode in the circuit to rectify the current
          would violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics but having TWO
          diodes back to back somehow overcomes that objection since it

          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          At room temperature, micron-sized sheets of freestanding
          graphene are in constant motion, even in the presence of an
          applied bias voltage. We quantify the out-of-plane movement by
          collecting the displacement current using a nearby small-area
          metal electrode and present an Ito-Langevin model for the
          motion coupled to a circuit containing diodes. Numerical
          simulations show that the system reaches thermal equilibrium
          and the average rates of heat and work provided by stochastic
          thermodynamics tend quickly to zero. However, there is power
          dissipated by the load resistor, and its time average is
          exactly equal to the power supplied by the thermal bath. The
          exact power formula is similar to Nyquist's noise power
          formula, except that the rate of change of diode resistance
          significantly boosts the output power, and the movement of the
          graphene shifts the power spectrum to lower frequencies. We
          have calculated the equilibrium average of the power by
          asymptotic and numerical methods. Excellent agreement is found

          Sure, some countries recorded noticeably more deaths in the

          especially for Italy, Spain, France, England, Belgium, the
          Netherlands and the USA. However, the hypothesis that a new,
          potentially deadly corona virus would have raged in these
          countries is already contradicted by the fact that these
          states in particular pursued a rigid lockdown policy.
          Therefore, following the logic of the virus, they should have
          had fewer deaths.<br>
          <br>
          In addition, Belgium, for example, had eight times more deaths
          (per 100,000 inhabitants) than its neighbour Germany, Spain 22
          times more than Poland, while Portugal, Spain’s direct
          neighbour, did not experience any excess mortality. But a

              chronic wasting disease</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Infectious, deformed proteins called prions, known to cause
          chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer, can be taken up by
          plants such as alfalfa, corn, and tomatoes, according to new
          research from the National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC) in
          Madison.<br>
          <br>
          The NWHC’s prion research further demonstrates that stems and
          leaves from tainted plants are infectious when injected into
          laboratory mice. Christopher Johnson, the research biologist
          who conducted the study, writes in the abstract: “Our results
          suggest that prions are taken up by plants and that
          contaminated plants may represent a previously unrecognized
          risk of human, domestic species, and wildlife exposure to
          CWD.”<br>
          <br>
          One of a class of neurological, prion-caused diseases known as
          transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, CWD affects deer by
          causing progressive loss of body condition, behavioral
          changes, excessive salivation, and death. Other prion-caused
          diseases include scrapie in sheep and goats, bovine spongiform
          encephalopathy—or mad cow disease—in cattle, and
          Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans.<br>
          <br>
          While it is thought that CWD is spread through the saliva and
          feces of deer infected with the fatal brain disease, according
          to NWHC researchers and other experts these new findings are
          significant because they reveal a previously unknown potential
          route of exposure.<br>
          <br>
          The disease has also become a pressing issue nationwide: The
          national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has
          identified chronic wasting disease in seventeen states and
          predicts it will spread to other states. CWD was discovered in
          Wisconsin’s deer herd in 2002 and has been found since the
          mid-1990s in northeastern Colorado and southeastern Wyoming.<br>
          <br>
          Courtesy of the Wisconsin Department of Natural ResourcesSoon
          after the discovery of CWD in Wisconsin, the Wisconsin
          Department of Natural Resources embarked on an aggressive
          effort to halt spread of the disease by putting in place
          additional and longer hunting seasons, requiring hunters to
          shoot a female deer before taking a buck, and hiring
          sharpshooters to kill deer.<br>
          <br>
          But the ambitious program grew unpopular with hunters and
          landowners, and the number of hunters participating in the
          state’s annual deer hunt declined. Meanwhile, the disease
          spread.<br>
          <br>
          Current reports by the DNR show that the prevalence of the
          disease has increased in all sex and age classes of deer.
          During the past eleven years, for example, agency data
          estimates the prevalence of CWD in adult males has risen from
          8–10% to more than 20%. And in adult females, the prevalence
          has grown from about 3–4% to about 9%. In a disease hot spot
          in southwestern Wisconsin, CWD prevalence has increased to 27%
          among deer two-and-a-half years or older.<br>
          <br>
          Tami Ryan, who heads the DNR’s Wildlife Health Section, says
          the agency is interested in learning more about Johnson’s
          study. Ryan would like to see more data, especially on whether
          lab animals can become infected by eating tainted plant
          material rather than just via injection.<br>
          <br>
          “I’m also interested in the contamination level,” says Ryan.
          “What is the concentration and frequency of exposure that
          would result in infection? Is this as great a risk as coming
          into contact with another infected animal? A level of risk
          assessment is necessary.” For the moment, she concludes, “I
          don’t hear alarm bells.”<br>
          <br>
          While more than 800 Wisconsin hunters who have consumed
          CWD-tainted venison show no signs of prion brain disease,
          Wisconsin Department of Health Services veterinarian James
          Kazmierczak says that a little-understood molecular species
          barrier prevents CWD prions from making people and cattle
          sick.<br>
          <br>
          But research on how prions affect humans is still ongoing. In
          2004, for example, a CDC study published in the scientific
          journal Emerging Infectious Diseases concluded that the
          transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow
          disease) to humans indicates that “the species barrier may not
          completely protect humans from animal protein diseases.”<br>
          <br>
          The article also cited lab studies in which CWD prions were
          found to infect human prion proteins. Still, the article
          concluded, “limited investigations have not identified strong
          evidence for CWD transmission to humans.”<br>
          <br>
          Another study, led by Marcelo Barria from the Mitchell Center
          for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Brain Disorders at the
          University of Texas and published in the Journal of Biological
          Chemistry in 2011, showed that CWD prions in the laboratory
          can be manipulated over generations to change and become more
          infectious to humans.<br>
          <br>
          “Our findings lead to a new view that the species barrier
          should not be seen as a static process but rather a dynamic
          biological phenomenon that can change over time when prion
          strains mature and evolve,” researchers concluded.<br>
          <br>
          NWHC researcher Christopher Johnson says he is testing whether
          animals can become infected by eating CWD-laden plant tissues,
          noting that his work will address Tami Ryan’s questions about
          the prion concentrations in plants necessary to cause
          infection.<br>
          <br>
          “We’re just scratching the surface here,” says Johnson.<br>

          </div>
          <br>
          &nbsp;The Labor Augsburg MVZ laboratory in Bavaria has blamed
          a high number of tests and time pressure after recording 58
          out of 60 false positives in a week.<br>
          <br>
          Gabriele Schoen, Managing Director of the Labor Augsburg MVZ
          laboratory, told Munich’s daily newspaper Muenchener Merkur
          that it’s not possible for them to constantly “double check”
          tests when they provided a positive result”, as they were
          under pressure and working with a “lack of equipment”.<br>
          <br>
          The laboratory was found to have wrongly diagnosed 58 out of
          60 coronavirus tests it identified as positive during a
          one-week period, after testing samples again following an
          unusual spike in confirmed cases. The false positives raise
          questions around the reliability of the results that are being
          provided in the region, as Germany weighs introducing a new
          lockdown to combat the rising number of coronavirus cases in

              with Biomembrane-Based Organic Transistors</b><br>
            <b>Claudia Lubrano, Giovanni Maria Matrone, Gennaro Iaconis,

          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          Biosensing plays vital roles in multiple fields, including
          healthcare monitoring, drug screening, disease diagnosis, and
          environmental pollution control. In recent years,
          transistor-based devices have been considered to be valid
          platforms for fast, low-cost sensing of diverse analytes.
          Without additional functionalization, however, these devices
          lack selectivity; several strategies have been developed for
          the direct immobilization of bioreceptors on the transistor
          surface to improve detection capabilities. In this scenario,
          organic transistors have gained attention for their abilities
          to be coupled to biological systems and to detect
          biomolecules. In this Perspective, we discuss recent
          developments in organic-transistor-based biosensors,
          highlighting how their coupling with artificial membranes
          provides a strategy to improve sensitivity and selectivity in
          biosensing applications. Looking at future applications, this
          class of biosensors represents a breakthrough starting point
          for implementing multimodal high-throughput screening
          platforms.<br>
