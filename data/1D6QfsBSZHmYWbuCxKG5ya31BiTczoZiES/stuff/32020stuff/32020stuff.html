                  Attach to HIV-1 virus</b><br>
                <b>By Syeda Z. Hamdani</b><br>
              </div>
              <b><br>
              </b>In the first-ever study of metal nanoparticles'
              interaction with HIV-1, silver nanoparticles of sizes
              1-10nm attached to HIV-1 and prevented the virus from
              bonding to host cells. The study, published in the Journal
              of Nanotechnology, was a joint project between the
              University of Texas, Austin and Mexico Univeristy, Nuevo
              Leon.<br>
              <br>
              "Our article opens an important avenue for research," said
              Miguel Jose Yacaman, from University of Texas, Department
              of Engineering and one of the study's authors.<br>
              <br>
              In this study, scientists mixed silver nanoparticles with
              three different capping agents: foamy carbon, poly (PVP),
              and bovine serum albumin (BSA)."Not using a capping agent
              could result in the synthesis of big crystals instead of
              nanocrystals," explained Yacaman.<br>
              <br>
              Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed the silver
              nanoparticles in the foamy carbon matrix were joined
              together, but an ultrasonic bath in deionized water
              released a significant number of nanoparticles. These
              nanoparticles were of size 16.19 (+-8.69)nm and had the
              greatest variety of shapes, such as icosahedral,
              decahedral, and elongated.<br>
              <br>
              "Because of the synthesis procedure, the foamy
              carbon-coated naoparticles are more likely to have broad
              shape distribution," said Yacaman. Scientists used the
              electron beam to release the remainder of the
              nanoparticles from the joined bundle.<br>
              <br>
              For the PVP-coated silver nanoparticles, scientists used
              glycerine as a dissolving agent. These particles were of
              size 6.53 (+-2.41). In the third preparation, scientists
              used serum albumin, the most common protein in blood
              plasma. The sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen chemicals in BSA
              stabilized the nanoparticles, which were in the range of
              3.12 (+-2.00) nm.<br>
              <br>
              Scientists studied the absorption spectra of the different
              preparations to pinpoint their shapes. "Spherical
              nanoparticles absorbed in the blue region of the spectrum,
              for example," Yacaman said.<br>
              <br>
              Also, the UV-Visible spectra graphs helped the group
              determine nanoparticle sizes. "The surface plasmon
              resonance peak wavelength increased with size," explained
              Yacaman.<br>
              <br>
              Scientists tested, in vitro, each of three silver
              nanoparticle-preparations in HIV-1 cells. Yacaman and his
              colleagues incubated the samples at 37 C. After three
              hours and 24 hours, respectively, 0% of the cells were
              living.<br>
              <br>
              The results showed that a silver nanoparticle
              concentration greater than 25 ug/mL worked more
              effectively at inhibiting HIV-1 cells. Plus, the foamy
              carbon was a slightly-better capping agent because of its
              free surface area. Size also played a role since none of
              the attached nanoparticles were greater than 10nm.<br>
              <br>
              Scientists think the nanoparticles bonded through the
              gp120 glycoprotein knobs on HIV-1, using the sulfur
              residues on the knobs. The spacing between the knobs of
              ~22nm matched the center-to-center nanoparticle spacing.<br>
              <br>
              Although this study shows silver nanoparticles may treat
              HIV-1, scientists need to research this relationship
              further. "We lack information regarding the long-term
              effects of metal nanoparticles," cautioned Yacaman.
              Scientists are forming a preventive cream for HIV-1, which
              they will test on humans.<br>
              <br>
              Scientists are also studying other uses for silver
              nanoparticles. "We're testing against other viruses and
              the 'super bug (Methicillin resistant staphylococcus
              aureus).' Our preliminary results indicate that silver
              nanoparticles can effectively attack other
              micro-organisms," Yacaman said.<br>

                  zinc?</b><br>
                <b>Zinc is no COVID-19 magic bullet, but it has shown to
                  help with other coronaviruses.</b><b><br>
                  By Todd Neff</b><br>
              </div>
              <b><br>
              </b>Calling the specific virus that is causing COVID-19
              “coronavirus” is a bit like calling the Ford Explorer “the
              SUV.” Both statements are true, but with both, one is part
              of the other. There are lots of different SUVs; there are
              lots of different coronaviruses.<br>
              <br>
              Zinc is something that will not hurt you, and there may be
              some benefit when it comes to COVID-19, like with other
              coronaviruses. Photo: Getty Images.<br>
              <br>
              Many common colds are caused by coronaviruses. Various
              scientific studies (we’ll get to those in a moment) have
              shown zinc lozenges to be effective in shortening the
              misery phase of common colds. So in the face of a
              coronavirus pandemic, here’s a big question many are
              asking: can zinc shorten the duration of – or even
              diminish the symptom load and thereby lessen the impact –
              of COVID-19?<br>
              <br>
              The answer is we don’t know yet. But to twist the analogy:
              if changing the oil helps a Jeep Grand Cherokee avoid the
              shop, it’s a good bet that doing the same will benefit the
              Ford Explorer, too.<br>
              <br>
              Dr. Ian Tullberg bears no responsibility for the above
              comparison. But as far as helping patients get over colds,
              “there’s good evidence that oral zinc works well,” the
              medical director of UCHealth Medical Group Urgent Care
              said.<br>
              <br>
              With respect to the specific coronavirus that is causing
              the pandemic now, “the problem is that this is still so
              early that we don’t have the knowledge if it works or
              not,” Tullberg said. “However, zinc is something that will
              not hurt you, and there may be some benefit.”<br>
              <br>
              Those who swear by zinc as a cold remedy know to take it
              when they first start to feel a scratchy throat. They try
              to hit it early – right when the cold’s coming on.
              Research spanning decades has shown that using zinc
              lozenges through the course of the cold does make a
              difference.<br>
              <br>
              <b>The data around Zinc and coronaviruses</b><b><br>
              </b><b> </b><br>
              A study published in 1996 shuffled 100 Cleveland Clinic
              employees who self-reported catching colds into two
              groups. Fifty took lozenges containing 13.3 milligrams of
              zinc gluconate – the dosage of today’s Cold-Eeze and other
              over-the-counter lozenges – every two hours as long as
              they had cold symptoms. Fifty others took placebo
              lozenges. The study was double-blind, so neither patients
              nor researchers knew which patients had the placebo. The
              findings: the zinc group cleared symptoms more than three
              days earlier – 4.4 days versus 7.6 days of the placebo
              group, and, until that point, suffered fewer days with
              cough, headache, hoarseness, nasal congestion, and sore
              throat (fever, muscle aches, scratchy throat and sneezing
              remained similar during the cold’s duration). Zinc has
              side effects – “bad-taste reactions” (understandable) and,
              among 20 percent of those taking zinc, nausea.<br>
              <br>
              That study wasn’t, it turned out, a fluke. A Cochrane
              review updated in 2013 summarized 18 randomized controlled
              trials involving 1,781 participants across all age groups
              found that zinc – particularly in lozenge or syrup form –
              “inhibits replication of the virus” that cause the common
              cold and shortens average duration of the common cold when
              taken within 24 hours of onset of symptoms at a dose of
              more than 75 milligrams a day.<br>
              <br>
              A 2010 study led by University of Leiden Medical
              researchers in the Netherlands sought to understand how
              zinc inhibited that replication. The team reported that
              zinc inhibits a cousin of SARS-CoV-2: SARS-CoV, the
              original SARS of the 2003 outbreak. Click through for
              details, which get into the biochemical nitty-gritty, but
              the gist is that zinc throws a wrench in the virus’s
              RNA-synthesis machine.<br>
              <br>
              Now, there are caveats with zinc. First, like everything
              else, there can be too much of a good thing – more than
              150 milligrams a day for adult. That’s about 11 lozenges;
              the recommended zinc-lozenge maximum for adults being six
              and just four for children ages 12-17 (research has shown
              younger children to not benefit from taking zinc). Second,
              zinc nasal sprays shouldn’t be used, Tullberg says. In
              2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned against
              such products because people who used them lost their
              sense of smell.<br>
              <br>
              What does that background say about the effectiveness of
              zinc and the SARS-CoV-2 now known as coronavirus? It is,
              at best, effectiveness by association. But an email that
              recently went viral as a blog post indicates that Tullberg
              is in good company with his openness to zinc lozenges as a
              way to at least try and mitigate COVID-19 flu symptoms.<br>

              <b>A virologist’s take on Zinc and COVID-19</b><b><br>
              </b><b> </b><br>
              The email was one that James A. Robb sent to friends and
              family. He is University of Colorado School of Medicine
              MD, a pathologist, and molecular virologist who, while at
              the University of California, San Diego in the 1970s, did
              pioneering work in understanding coronaviruses. He wrote:<br>
              <br>
              Stock up now with zinc lozenges. These lozenges have been
              proven to be effective in blocking coronavirus (and most
              other viruses) from multiplying in your throat and
              nasopharynx. Use as directed several times each day when
              you begin to feel ANY “cold-like” symptoms beginning. It
              is best to lie down and let the lozenge dissolve in the
              back of your throat and nasopharynx. Cold-Eeze lozenges is
              one brand available, but there are other brands available.<br>
              <br>
              Snopes.com, a website dedicated to debunking (or
              confirming) internet myths, investigated after his words
              were twisted by others and reposted with exaggerated
              claims such as zinc being a “silver bullet” against
              coronavirus. In an email to Snopes, Robb confirmed that
              he’d written the above and added, “In my experience as a
              virologist and pathologist, zinc will inhibit the
              replication of many viruses, including coronaviruses. I
              expect COVID-19 will be inhibited similarly, but I have no
              direct experimental support for this claim. I must add,
              however, that using zinc lozenges as directed by the
              manufacturer is no guarantee against being infected by the
              virus, even if it inhibits the viral replication in the
              nasopharynx.”<br>
              <br>
              In short, if coronavirus is like an SUV, zinc lozenges may
              well be something like an oil change, though we’ll need
              many more miles to really know for sure.<br>

              What an impressive finding it is and highly newsworthy. It
              is mentioned throughout the news the issue of “cytokine
              storm” and the danger this poses to people. Yet,
              incredibly, a mere wild plant and its essential oil are
              medicinal beyond all drugs, in fact, a litany of them.
              Wild oregano is a powerhouse for reducing inflammation in
              the tissues. In a number of studies it has been found to
              inhibit the source of this condition primarily through its
              actions on inflammatory markers. Actually, the mechanism
              is truly profound, because wild oregano acts on the genes
              that lead to the synthesis of these markers. Repeatedly,
              it has been shown, oregano oil and its active components,
              including carvacrol and thymol, have demonstrated great
              powers against inflammation. In fact, in some studies
              oregano oil active ingredients were able to drop COX-2
              inflammation levels by up to 80%.<br>
              <br>
              Today, there is much concern about the inflammation that
              results from overwork of the immune system or might it be
              said, overreactions. In a study on T lymphocytes done via
              cell culture it was found that the wild oregano oil active
              ingredients exhibited a specific molecular action even
              more potent than drugs. Carvacrol and thymol both
              significantly reduced tissue levels of interleukin-2. In
              fact, the reduction was massive, two-thirds in the case of
              carvacrol. This makes it more significant in this regard
              than any drug. For gamma interferon, the reduction was
              nearly 30%. This proved that the oregano oil component
              modified the activity, that is more towards normal, during
              a crisis event. Correlating this to humans aggressive
              dosing would likely reduce this further.<br>
              <br>
              In the lungs oregano oil has been found to curb reactive
              oxygen species or free radicals. This has led to in
              asthmatic patients a reduction in cytokine overload. Here,
              it largely shuts off the gene responsible for the
              immunological storm reaction. Whether in the lungs or the
              skin—or the rest of the organs—cytokines are no match for
              the powers of wild oregano.<br>
              <br>
              In another investigation the oil was found to decrease
              inflammation in skin tissue, once again an action thought
              to be due to modulating immune function. Specifically, the
              oil was found to markedly act with actions to block
              excessive cell growth, known as anti proliferative
              activity, while also greatly inhibited markers of
              inflammation. These markers included various cytokines and
              also gamma interferon. In fact, through the powers of this
              oil nearly all elements associated with toxic inflammation
              are greatly reduced, including various collagen-associated
              molecules, cancer-inducing growth factors, and enzymes—the
              ones that can do us harm.&nbsp; “Strongly inhibited” were
              among the comments made by investigators. As well, it was
              found to decisively block those specialized genes directly
              associated with inflammation. This caused them to conclude
              that oregano oil is a “promising candidate for use”
              against inflammation and cancerous changes in skin
              tissues.<br>
              <br>
              Also, to reiterate, according to Iranian investigators
              oregano compounds were found to reduce all the serious
              immune modulators. This was through a direct action on the
              genes. This led to a reduction in the excessive activity
              of T cells. The various inflammatory cytokines were
              significantly reduced,&nbsp; including the highly noxious
              tumor necrosis factor alpha. This led the researchers to
              stated that oregano oil would be useful to combat diseases
              associated with over-activity of immunity.<br>
              <br>
              Wild oregano is far from specific to the skin. It helps
              reduce inflammation all throughout the body, including
              within all internal organs. Nothing is an exception to its
              powers. Consider an investigation in artificially induced
              colitis in animals. Treatment of the colitis condition
              with oregano oil decreased levels of all pro-inflammatory
              cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha. A
              moderate dosage of oregano oil, only 1 per 1000, was
              sufficient to reduce all the key interleukin-based
              inflammation-promoters. The result was decreased mortality
              rate, combined with a better weight gain and reduced
              visible damage to colonic tissue. By influencing the
              genes, that is the production of the messenger form of
              RNA, it was concluded, oregano reverses the colitis
              pathology, a most significant finding.<br>
              <br>
              In every conceivable animal model oregano proves itself
              invaluable. For instance, as shown by Chinese
              investigators oregano-treated pigs had Escherichia coli in
              the jejunum, ileum, and colon than the control. This was
              thought to be the result of the greater inactivation of
              inflammation, once again by curbing inflammatory reactions
              through a genetic influence. Essentially, the oregano
              shuts off the potentially dangerous gene, greatly
              reducing, even eliminating, toxic markers in the
              intestines. Microscopic analysis proves that the
              intestinal membranes of oregano-treated pigs were far
              different from those in controls, far healthier, even
              healthier than normal. The fact is with the oregano
              therapy all the inflammatory cytokines, the ones capable
              of causing severe illness, where fully depressed.<br>
              <br>
              Black seed oil also offers this action. In a study in the
              Saudi Pharmaceutical Journal it was found to greatly
              alleviate airway restrictions and inflammation of the
              airways in bronchial asthma, once again through cytokine
              modulation. In yet another investigation it acted
              dramatically against the toxicity of artificially induced
              airway damage, largely by halting the immune
              system-provoked cytokine storm. This was to such a degree
              that black seed was held as a “useful” herbal medicine
              against inflammation and allergy-related lung conditions,
              including shortness of breath and asthma. Fennel and cumin
              were also found to have this action, both of which are
              found in specialized black seed oil capsules. Clearly, the
              spices have a most potent action against inflammatory
              changes in lung tissues.<br>
              <br>
              Thus, when cytokine storm is described and discussed,
              there is no need for fear. It is just an excessive
              reaction by a typically compromised immune system. To halt
              this, even prevent it, wild oregano is the answer. This
              should be consumed as the wild, whole food,
              Mediterranean-source oil, the crude herb, ideally with
              Rhus coriaria, and the juice-essence or hydrosol. All are
              readily available and make the ideal supplements for daily
              use and prevention and also for intake to support a
              healthy, balanced immune response. There is no harm taking
              such whole food supplements with other formulas or even
              drugs. Wild oregano is the number one medicine for human
              health. Take it to your major benefit, and your delight
              and joy. After all, in Greek “ora-ganos” means “delight of
              the mountains.”<br>

          New research from the University of Southampton has found that
          copper can effectively help to prevent the spread of
          respiratory viruses, which are linked to severe acute
          respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory
          syndrome (MERS).<br>
          <br>
          Animal coronaviruses that 'host jump' to humans, such as SARS
          and MERS, result in severe infections with high mortality. The
          Southampton researchers found that a closely-related human
          coronavirus - 229E - can remain infectious on common surface
          materials for several days, but is rapidly destroyed on
          copper.<br>
          <br>
          A newly-published paper in mBio - a journal of the American
          Society for Microbiology - reports that human coronavirus
          229E, which produces a range of respiratory symptoms from the
          common cold to more lethal outcomes such as pneumonia, can
          survive on surface materials including ceramic tiles, glass,
          rubber and stainless steel for at least five days. While
          human-to-human transmission is important, infections can be
          contracted by touching surfaces contaminated by respiratory
          droplets from infected individuals, or hand touching, leading
          to a wider and more rapid spread<br>
          <br>
          On copper, and a range of copper alloys - collectively termed
          'antimicrobial copper' - the coronavirus was rapidly
          inactivated (within a few minutes, for simulated fingertip
          contamination). Exposure to copper destroyed the virus
          completely and irreversibly, leading the researchers to
          conclude that antimicrobial copper surfaces could be employed
          in communal areas and at any mass gatherings to help reduce
          the spread of respiratory viruses and protect public health.<br>
          <br>
          Lead researcher Dr Sarah Warnes said: "Transmission of
          infectious diseases via contaminated surfaces is far more
          important than was originally thought, and this includes
          viruses that cause respiratory infections. This is especially
          important when the infectious dose is low and just a few virus
          particles can initiate an infection.<br>
          <br>
          "Human coronavirus, which also has ancestral links with
          bat-like viruses responsible for SARS and MERS, was found to
          be permanently and rapidly deactivated upon contact with
          copper. What's more, the viral genome and structure of the
          viral particles were destroyed, so nothing remained that could
          pass on an infection. With the lack of antiviral treatments,
          copper offers a measure that can help reduce the risk of these
          infections spreading."<br>
          <br>
          Speaking on the importance of the study, Professor Bill
          Keevil, co-author and Chair in Environmental Healthcare at the
          University of Southampton, said: "Respiratory viruses are
          responsible for more deaths, globally, than any other
          infectious agent. The evolution of new respiratory viruses,
          and the re-emergence of historic virulent strains, poses a
          significant threat to human health.<br>
          <br>
          "The rapid inactivation and irreversible destruction of the
          virus observed on copper and copper alloy surfaces suggests
          that the incorporation of copper alloy surfaces - in
          conjunction with effective cleaning regimes and good clinical
          practice - could help control transmission of these viruses."<br>
          <br>

          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>Canadian researchers launched a study Monday into the use
          of a powerful anti-inflammatory drug to reduce the risks of
          pulmonary complications and death related to the new
          coronavirus.<br>
          <br>
          Several COVID-19 patients have had severe complications from a
          surge of activated immune cells in the lungs — known as a
          “cytokine storm.”<br>
          <br>
          In a cytokine storm, the immune system overreacts and damages
          lung tissue, leading to acute respiratory distress and
          multi-organ failure.<br>
          A team led by Jean-Claude Tardif, director of the Montreal
          Heart Institute research center and professor of medicine at
          the University of Montreal, are hoping the drug colchicine
          will work to moderate the overproduction of immune cells and
          their activating compounds — called cytokines — in COVID-19
          patients.If it proves to be successful, the drug — which is
          already used to treat gout and pericarditis (inflammation of
          the heart membrane), and is readily available and inexpensive
          — could become a key tool in the pandemic fight.<br>
          <br>
          At a news conference, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced
          Can$192 million (US$132 million) in funding for vaccine
          development and production in Canada, as well as several
          partnerships with firms to accelerate clinical trials and the
          eventual production of a vaccine and treatments.<br>
          <br>
          “Once there are promising options, Canada needs the capacity
          to mass produce treatments as quickly as possible,” he said.<br>
          <br>
          Those named by the prime minister included Vancouver’s
          AbCellera, Medicago in Quebec City, and Toronto-based startup
          BlueDot, which used artificial intelligence to flag the
          COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan nine days before the World Health
          Organization, as well as the University of Saskatchewan and
          the National Research Council.<br>
          <br>
          Tardif told public broadcaster Radio-Canada that he hopes to
          know if colchicine is effective in coronavirus patients within
          three months.<br>
          <br>
          He said he became interested in its possible application as a
          COVID-19 fighter when it became clear that most children were
          resistant to the illness.<br>
          <br>
          Children typically have reduced inflammatory responses to
          colds and flus, compared to adults.<br>
          <br>
          In laboratory tests, animals whose inflammatory responses were
          blocked also lived longer after being exposed to influenza.<br>
          <br>
          The hypothesis was worked on by 125 people and Health Canada
          approved the Quebec government-funded study within 24 hours.<br>
          <br>
          According to a heart institute statement, the researchers are
          looking to recruit 6,000 Canadians with the coronavirus, for a
          clinical trial.<br>
          <br>
          But there were only 1,430 cases of COVID-19 confirmed in
          Canada as of 2200 GMT Sunday, including 20 deaths. More than
          100,000 Canadians have been tested, so far.<br>
          <br>
          Trudeau also said the government was accelerating lab tests
          for the virus, and has asked research schools across the
          country for any spare masks and ventilators, while also
          looking at the possibility of 3D printing medical supplies.<b><br>

          </b>“The innovative method of specialists at Taleqani hospital
          of Abadan on 30 coronavirus patients reduced to zero the death
          rate of patients in acute health conditions,” Deputy Head of
          Abadan University of Medical Sciences for Training and
          Research Sara Mobarak told FNA on Thursday.<br>
          <br>
          She said that the new drug-based method was first tested on 5
          patients hospitalized at an ICU ward which helped them recover
          and be moved to the general section, adding that in the second
          phase, the medicine was applied to 10 coronavirus patients in
          the ICU ward with low levels of consciousness.<br>
          <br>
          The drugs showed desirable effects on the second group of the
          patients too and the level of their consciousness increased,
          Mobarak said.<br>
          <br>
          She added that the drug combination has not been used in China
          or any other country before, noting that an essay about the
          results of the innovative application of the medicine on
          coronavirus patients in Iran will be released in scientific
          journals.<br>
          <br>
          Also, last week, officials informed that Iranian researchers
          had discovered a medicinal compound which could treat the
          damage inflicted on lungs due to coronavirus infection.<br>
          <br>
          “The new medicinal compound is not special to the coronavirus
          patients, but it treats respiratory and pulmonary diseases,”
          Chairman of the Biotechnology Development Council of Iran
          Mostafa Qaneyee said in a press conference.<br>
          <br>
          He added that the new medicinal compound can decrease the time
          a coronavirus patient needs to stay at hospital to 4 days,
          noting that 40% of Iranian patients who received the
          combination of three drugs have been discharged from hospital
          in less than 4 days.<br>
          <br>
          “In this treatment method, in addition to the protocols of the
          health ministry, the three drugs of Azithromycin, Prednisolone
          and Naproxen have been used as a compound,” Qaneyee said...<br>

              that chloroquine, a prescription medication used to treat
              malaria, also appears to be effective against the
              coronavirus. </b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          ...Here’s a promising candidate herb that prevents malaria and
          tuberculosis<br>
          <br>
          In the world of natural medicine, there are already powerful,
          well-known treatments against malaria that also happen to
          prevent tuberculosis, an aggressive infection of the
          respiratory tract. While nothing is yet proven to treat
          coronavirus, our review of herbal medicine studies and
          medicinal phytochemicals leads us to the conclusion that this
          Chinese Medicine herb may one day become known as the “natural
          cure” for coronavirus (although clinical trials are needed,
          obviously, to prove this).<br>
          <br>
          The chemical is called artemesinin, and the herb is known as
          sweet wormwood. And no, we don’t sell it. This isn’t a
          commercial promotion, it’s an effort to help save millions of
          lives using medicine that’s available right now, all around
          the world.<br>
          <br>
          Artemesinin is known for its ability to block the bacterial
          strain that causes tuberculosis, known as Mycobacterium
          tuberculosis. That doesn’t mean it prevents coronavirus, which
          is a viral infection, but it’s a strong candidate for a number
          of logical reasons.<br>
          <br>
          According to research published in the journal Phytomedicine,
          artemisinin / sweet wormwood has a “100% cure rate” for
          treating drug-resistant malaria, at least in a small trial
          involving 18 patients (all of whom were cured). As Herbs.news
          writes in this important story:<br>
          <br>
          A study led by Pamela Weathers, a professor of biology and
          biotechnology at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI),
          published in the journal Phytomedicine, describes how the
          Artemisia annua plant, commonly known as sweet wormwood or
          sweet annie, saved 18 patients with drug-resistant malaria
          from the brink of death.<br>
          <br>
          The Congolese patients, who ranged in age from 14 months to 60
          years, had all developed severe, untreatable malaria, with
          symptoms ranging from loss of consciousness, to trouble
          breathing and convulsions, among others. When they failed to
          respond to intravenous treatment with an ACT, compassionate
          doctors decided to try the dried leaves of the Artemisia annua
          plant as a last resort. After only five days of the treatment,
          all 18 patients were fully recovered, including one child who
          had been in a coma. Blood tests revealed that absolutely no
          parasites remained in their blood...<br>

              Part 13 COVID</b><br>
            <b>By Yoichi Shimatsu</b><br>
          </div>
          <b>[ Excerpt re: Chloroquine ]</b><b><br>
          </b>
          <div align="left"><b>A "cure" worse than the disease</b><br>
          </div>
          Chloroquine (Aralen), the "COV cure" touted by health
          authorities in China and being hyped in Europe and the USA as
          a proven remedy for patients, at least those who haven't been
          killed by it. Derived from the coal that Greta Thunberg wants
          to banish, CQ is a molecule from the same group as
          anti-malaria quinine.<br>
          <br>
          This panacea has known side-effects including blinding
          patients with retina damage, harming heart muscle tissue,
          scarring of the kidneys and wrecking the stomach and
          intestines, the latter being the source of uncontrolled bloody
          diarrhea, triggering the toilet paper rush. CQ earlier had a
          major role in the high death rate of malaria patients
          worldwide.<br>
          <br>
          The urban myth of younger people having far fewer deaths than
          the elderly is due to a difference in the condition of
          internal organs, which tend to be more worn and damaged in
          older individuals. CQ pushed many an oldster patient into the
          incinerator, meaning those victims were not cured but instead
          "put down" by CQ. This may be fine in the eyes of youth
          revolutionaries with the Extinction Rebellion who revile
          anyone older than 29, so let's rename the killer drug as the
          Greta Pill and their movement as the Human Extermination
          Revolt. Her loyal Gen Z followers now call COV the "boomer
          doomer" virus. So celebrate, air-heads, before trying to
          figure who's going to pay for your shopping sprees.<br>
          <br>
          The bad news for the children's crusade is that the Greta Pill
          carries long-term risks of arthritis, lupus and Sarcodoisis,
          which is an autoimmune inflammation of the lungs, internal
          organs, eyes and, gosh for you pretty Instagram influencers,
          skin discoloration. That, in brief, is what the doctors aren't
          telling you everything about the CQ cure-all, which will soon
          come to seek you.<br>
          <br>
          The last and rather grotesque drawback of chloroquine is
          rendering the internal organs and blood of deceased COV
          patients unfit for withdrawing serum and harvesting their
          organs for sale. That is a terrible waste indeed in terms of
          market economics for doctors, hospitals, crematoriums,
          transporters and others involved in the human-parts recycling
          industry. As a consequence, China being the model of
          exploitative hyper-capitalism, is a black market paradise for
          recovered patients' blood serum...<br>
          <br>
          <b>Ayurveda gold standard against COV</b><br>
          The only genuine answer is inside a natural liquid of ancient
          vintage. The potential defense against life-threatening COV
          comes from Ayurveda therapy, well, broadly defined, being
          dispensed in gallons by humped Desi cows in India. Bovine
          urine is being splashed on by Hindus as an effective shield
          against viral infection. Does that seem disgusting and
          ridiculous? Well, at least nobody gets killed for their blood
          serum, and COV infections have been rare across the densely
          populated country.<br>
          <br>
          One of the readers of rense.com on the Subcontinent urged me
          to look over Captain Ajit Vadakayil's blog on cow urine's
          active ingredient, which is nano gold colloids. At first
          impression I assumed it was some sort of superstitious
          nonsense and that I should not be taken in by a scam from the
          Rashneeshees or the Beatles' Maharishi Mahesh yogi. Then on
          second thought, based on sojourns in Thailand for herbal-based
          therapy for radioactive exposure during Fukushima research, I
          remembered that Ayurvedic herbs including
          lemongrass-citronella, kaffir lime and turmeric enabled my
          return to health from the doorstep of death, as compared with
          the total impotence of modern pharmacology against
          radioactivity. The gut reaction to overcome, however, is that
          the gold nano-particles are inside cow urine...<br>
          <br>
          These are super-bovines with tens of thousands of years of
          coexistence with nomadic tribes and later agrarian villages.
          Despite befouled water, their resistance to disease is
          astounding, indicative of a powerful immune system that
          protects the wholesome purity of their milk, usually consumed
          as yogurt or ghee butter. This is why mother cows are
          considered sacred by Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Parsi
          (Zoroastrians). Cows transfer antibodies and other biological
          defenses to their calves suckling milk, as opposed to the soy
          water fed to young cattle in the West by dairymen extracting
          every last penny to pay the grain companies and equipment
          suppliers, while still slipping into debt.<br>
          <br>
          These cows drink from natural sources like "dirty" rivers,
          lakes and wells in a barren countryside that is eroded down to
          lots of rocky outcrops, from whence the gold nano-particles
          are derived. With that memory in mind, I decided to consult a
          microbiologist adviser with a ridiculous question about the
          efficacy of nano gold. The supportive response was that he had
          done lab studies on gold nanoparticle therapy some 20 years
          ago, and yes it does live up to the claims. Gobsmacked was I
          by that revelation of gold being a virus-destroyer with Shiva
          power on a nano-dimension.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Nano-gold therapy</b><br>
          Although invisible to the naked eye, nano gold seen through a
          powerful electron microscope is not yellow or white but
          instead red or violet, due to its bonding as a salt with
          chlorine or silicon. AuCl is one of many salts of gold (like
          NaCL or sodium chloride). My adviser's research studies has
          shown that nano-colloidal gold salts can control gene
          expression in RNA and facilitate cancer drug delivery. Its
          bonding and electrical properties at the nano level defy our
          conventional assumption that gold is pure and resistant to
          chemical reactions, being symbolic of marital fidelity in the
          exchange of golden rings.<br>
          <br>
          At the micro-scale of 10 nanometers up to 40 nm, ions of gold
          have strong bonding capability along with powerful electrical
          properties. Inside your bloodstream, charged ions of gold-salt
          can organize bits of proteins into structures called ligands,
          especially when augmented with a target-detecting monoclonal
          antibody. The ligand can attract and take control over
          message-conveying proteins called cytokines. The exchange of
          signals with the cytokines enables the gold ligands to hunt
          down specific pathogens. For example, in the battle against
          hepatitis, the ligand organizes teams of cytokines to rally
          antibodies against that infectious virus. Gold ligands, in
          brief, are the magic bullet against the m.tuberculosis and HIV
          strands in COVID-19, along with the vulnerable Spike proteins
          jutting out of its membrane.<br>
          <br>
          Once the ligand reaches a cluster of viruses, the gold
          nano-particle captures the RNA strands of viruses, pinning
          these to its surface with polyvalent or multiple bonds. This
          counterattack is launched during the virus replication process
          when exposing its single-strand RNA or, alternatively, as a
          double-strand during transcription (producing a copy of
          itself).<br>
          <br>
          The capture process is completed with "passivation" though
          addition of ethylene glycol and alkyl-thiol molecules, which
          "root" the viruses preventing their escape. For 2-dimensional
          visual representation purposes, the gold orb resembles an axle
          while the RNA strands stick out like spokes of a wheel.<br>
          <br>
          Then what? That's where urine comes into play fortuitously,
          since the RNA-loaded nano particle is tiny enough to pass from
          the blood stream into the kidneys and out of the patient's
          body. Voila! No side effects or internal organ damage, a clean
          sweep. There are no apparent defensive mechanisms in the
          HIV-COV-mTB bioengineered virus capable of fleeing, repelling,
          resisting or combating the gold-salt particle. My microbiology
          adviser points out that the bio-engineered COVID-19 is clunky,
          more cumbersome and slower to replicate than SARS due to the
          spliced-in HIV and m.TB components... <br>

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>We evaluate the total probability of human extinction from
          naturally occurring processes. Such processes include risks
          that are well characterized such as asteroid impacts and
          supervolcanic eruptions, as well as risks that remain unknown.
          Using only the information that Homo sapiens has existed at
          least 200,000 years, we conclude that the probability that
          humanity goes extinct from natural causes in any given year is
          almost guaranteed to be less than one in 14,000, and likely to
          be less than one in 87,000. Using the longer track record of
          survival for our entire genus Homo produces even tighter
          bounds, with an annual probability of natural extinction
          likely below one in 870,000. These bounds are unlikely to be
          affected by possible survivorship bias in the data, and are
          consistent with mammalian extinction rates, typical hominin
          species lifespans, the frequency of well-characterized risks,
          and the frequency of mass extinctions. No similar guarantee
          can be made for risks that our ancestors did not face, such as
          anthropogenic climate change or nuclear/biological warfare.<br>

          An 81-year-old man and his two sons claim they’ve developed a
          system in their garage that allows a diesel or gasoline engine
          to run on a mix of water and alcohol — no fossil fuel
          required.<br>
          <br>
          If that sounds too good to be true, well, that’s because it
          probably is.<br>
          <br>
          A new Jerusalem Post story highlights the company the trio
          formed, MayMaan Research, and after six years of
          under-the-radar development, father Yehuda Shmueli says the
          system he and his sons created is now ready for action.<br>
          <br>
          “[W]e decided that this is the right time to expose ourselves
          and talk to people and let the world know that such a solution
          exists,” he told The Jerusalem Post.<br>
          <br>
          MayMaan’s website claims the system takes an alt-fuel made of
          70 percent water and 30 percent alcohol, such as ethanol, and
          converts it into “a powerful and clean-burning fuel within the
          engine’s combustion chamber.”<br>
          <br>
          MayMaan’s team told The Jerusalem Post that existing engine
          designs can be converted to work with this fuel through
          “simple yet sophisticated modifications” and that their fuel
          can be pumped into a vehicle just like you would gasoline.<br>
          <br>
          The fuel then supposedly powers a vehicle 60 percent more
          efficiently than gasoline at half the cost and with half the
          emissions.<br>
          <br>
          As exciting as this system sounds, both The Jerusalem Post
          story and the company’s website are extremely light on
          technical details.<br>
          <br>
          A look at a recently assigned patent for the system,
          meanwhile, notes that “the combustion chamber receives a
          mixture of air, hydrogen, and a liquid fuel consisting
          essentially of water and a flammable, preferably non-fossil,
          substance.”<br>
          <br>
          That’s a few more ingredients than MayMaan mentions in the
          story, so the team might need to head back into the garage for
          a bit more development before touting their tech as the
          cleaner, cheaper, more efficient alt-fuel of the future.<br>

            <b>R. Wordsworth, L. Kerber &amp; C. Cockell </b><br>
          </div>
          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>The low temperatures1,2 and high ultraviolet radiation
          levels3 at the surface of Mars today currently preclude the
          survival of life anywhere except perhaps in limited subsurface
          niches4. Several ideas for making the Martian surface more
          habitable have been put forward5,6,7,8, but they all involve
          massive environmental modification that will be well beyond
          human capability for the foreseeable future9. Here, we present
          a new approach to this problem. We show that widespread
          regions of the surface of Mars could be made habitable to
          photosynthetic life in the future via a solid-state analogue
          to Earth’s atmospheric greenhouse effect. Specifically, we
          demonstrate via experiments and modelling that under Martian
          environmental conditions, a 2–3&#8201;cm-thick layer of silica
          aerogel will simultaneously transmit sufficient visible light
          for photosynthesis, block hazardous ultraviolet radiation and
          raise temperatures underneath it permanently to above the
          melting point of water, without the need for any internal heat
          source. Placing silica aerogel shields over sufficiently
          ice-rich regions of the Martian surface could therefore allow
          photosynthetic life to survive there with minimal subsequent
          intervention. This regional approach to making Mars habitable
          is much more achievable than global atmospheric modification.
          In addition, it can be developed systematically, starting from
          minimal resources, and can be further tested in extreme
          environments on Earth today.<b><br>

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>What is the fastest way to heat a system which is coupled
          to a temperature controlled oven? The intuitive answer is to
          use only the hottest temperature available. However, we show
          that often it is possible to achieve an exponentially faster
          heating protocol. Surprisingly, this protocol can have a
          precooling stage—cooling the system before heating it shortens
          the heating time significantly. To demonstrate such
          improvements in many-body systems, we developed a
          projection-based method with which such protocols can be found
          in large systems, as we demonstrate on the 2D antiferromagnet
          Ising model.<b><br>

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>Carbon-based nanomaterials have exceptional properties
          that make them attractive for a variety of technological
          applications. Here, we report on the use of diamondoids
          (diamond-like, saturated hydrocarbons) as promising precursors
          for laser-induced high-pressure, high-temperature diamond
          synthesis. The lowest pressure and temperature (P-T)
          conditions that yielded diamond were 12 GPa (at ~2000 K) and
          900 K (at ~20 GPa), respectively. This represents a
          substantially reduced transformation barrier compared with
          diamond synthesis from conventional (hydro)carbon allotropes,
          owing to the similarities in the structure and full sp3
          hybridization of diamondoids and bulk diamond. At 20 GPa,
          diamondoid-to-diamond conversion occurs rapidly within &lt;19
          &#956;s. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that once
          dehydrogenated, the remaining diamondoid carbon cages
          reconstruct themselves into diamond-like structures at high
          P-T. This study is the first successful mapping of the P-T
          conditions and onset timing of the diamondoid-to-diamond
          conversion and elucidates the physical and chemical factors
          that facilitate diamond synthesis.<br>

          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>“Smallpox” (also known by the Latin names Variola or
          Variola vera ) is a disease caused by viruses (“smallpox
          viruses”) of the family poxyiridae, subfamily
          chordopoxyirinae. The lifecycle of poxviruses is complicated
          by having multiple infectious forms, with differing mechanisms
          of cell entry. It is a large virus, with a double stranded DNA
          genome of about 200 kilobases, making it more complicated than
          the smallest bacteria. The infectious dose of variola virus is
          very small, possibly only a few virions. Respiratory infection
          is characterized by non-infectious incubation and prodromal
          periods that normally last 12-14 and 2-4 days, respectively
          (McClain, D. J. (1997) “Smallpox,” In: TEXTBOOK OF MILITARY
          MEDICINE (Zatjchuk R, ed.); Washington, D.C.: Office of the
          Surgeon General, Walter Reed Medical Center; pp. 539-559).
          This non-infectious period may represent the window of
          opportunity for post-exposure treatment by a neutralizing
          monoclonal antibody product. Variola travels from the upper to
          lower respiratory tract to regional lymph nodes where it
          replicates. Asymptomatic viremia occurs on about the third or
          fourth day after infection and variola then disseminates
          systemically to other lymphoid tissues, spleen, liver, bone
          marrow and lung. A second viremia begins at about the eighth
          day. The prodromal period, which begins about day 12, is
          characterized by high fever, malaise, backache and headache.
          At this time, the virus, contained in leukocytes, localizes in
          small blood vessels of the dermis and beneath the oral and
          pharyngeal mucosa and subsequently infects adjacent cells. The
          onset of the infectious state is characterized by the
          appearance of enanthem (oropharyngeal lesions) and soon
          followed by exanthem (skin lesions) on the face, hands and
          forearms. The lesions on mucous membranes shed infected
          epithelial cells and give rise to infectious oropharyngeal
          secretions, which are the most important means of virus
          transmission to contacts. Rash spreads centrally during the
          next week to the trunk and lesions progress from macules to
          papules to pustular vesicles. Lesions display a centrifugal
          distribution and generally remain in a synchronous stage of
          development in various segments of the body. Scab formation
          occurs 10-14 days after onset of rash and scab separation
          occurs during the following 14 days. Because virus can be
          isolated from scabs, patients are considered infectious until
          all scabs separate. Smallpox has little effect on the vital
          organs in the body. Death, which generally occurs during the
          second week of illness, is usually the result of the toxemia
          associated with circulating immune complexes and soluble
          variola antigens, which leads to disseminated intravascular
          coagulation, hypotension and cardiovascular collapse.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] Person-to-person transmission of smallpox is initiated
          by the deposition of virus in the respiratory tract of the
          contact; the virus having originated from oropharyngeal
          secretions of a person with a rash. Epidemiological studies
          have implicated large-particle aerosol droplets, resuspension
          of virus particles, and droplet nuclei as possibly important
          in natural transmission of variola virus (Downie, A. W. et al.
          (1958) “The Antibody Response In Man Following Infection With
          Viruses Of The Pox Group. III. Antibody Response In Smallpox
          ,” J. Hyg. (Lond) 56(4):479-487). The large-particle aerosol
          droplets are thought to infect the upper respiratory tract,
          where as the droplet nuclei may initiate infection in the
          lower respiratory tract. A bioterrorist release of variola or
          monkeypox viruses is likely to be by droplet nuclei, and thus
          the lower respiratory tract may be a site of infection. The
          intranasal and aerosol methods of infection mimic
          large-particle droplet and droplet nuclei modes of infection,
          respectively.<br>
          <br>
          [0008] Smallpox virus infection is associated with very high
          morbidity and high overall mortality rates. The classic (or
          ordinary) form of variola major infection resulted in fatality
          rates of 30% for unvaccinated individuals and 3% for
          vaccinated individuals (McClain, D. J. (1997) “Smallpox ,” In:
          TEXTBOOK OF MILITARY MEDICINE (Zatjchuk R, ed.); Washington,
          D.C.: Office of the Surgeon General, Walter Reed Medical
          Center; pp. 539-559). Approximately 2-5% of cases presented as
          flat-type smallpox, which was associated with severe systemic
          toxicity and fatality rates of 95% for unvaccinated
          individuals and 66% for vaccinated individuals. Fewer than 3%
          of cases presented as hemorrhagic-type smallpox, which was
          uniformly fatal; death occurred before typical pox lesions
          developed. Infection with variola minor, a less virulent
          variant of the variola virus, resulted in fatality rates of 1%
          in unvaccinated individuals. Patients who recovered from
          smallpox may be left with serious sequelae, including
          extensive scarring of the skin, hearing loss or blindness or,
          more rarely, other organ damage. Smallpox was highly
          contagious; infection invariably resulted in symptomatic
          disease. The aerosolized virus was capable of spreading over
          considerable distances, and of inducing infection even at low
          viral doses.<br>
          <br>
          [0009] Smallpox was responsible for an estimated 300-500
          million deaths in the 20th century alone. In light of the
          enormous medical and social significance of the disease, a
          concerted worldwide inoculation campaign was initiated to
          eradicate smallpox. In 1979, the World Health Organization
          certified that the campaign to eliminate naturally occurring
          smallpox had been successful (Geddes, A. M. (2006) “The
          History of Smallpox ,” Clin. Dermatol. 24(3):152-157).
          Smallpox remains the sole human infectious disease to have
          been completely eradicated from nature (see, e.g., Bazin, H.
          (2000) THE ERADICATION OF SMALLPOX : EDWARD JENNER AND THE

              and a Cocktail of &#946;&#8208;Carboline Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors
              in “Magic” Mushrooms</b><br>
            <b>Felix Blei, et al.</b><br>
          </div>
          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>The psychotropic effects of Psilocybe “magic” mushrooms
          are caused by the l&#8208;tryptophan&#8208;derived alkaloid psilocybin.
          Despite their significance, the secondary metabolome of these
          fungi is poorly understood in general. Our analysis of four
          Psilocybe species identified harmane, harmine, and a range of
          other l&#8208;tryptophan&#8208;derived &#946;&#8208;carbolines as their natural
          products, which was confirmed by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy.
          Stable&#8208;isotope labeling with 13C11&#8208;l&#8208;tryptophan verified the
          &#946;&#8208;carbolines as biosynthetic products of these fungi. In
          addition, MALDI&#8208;MS imaging showed that &#946;&#8208;carbolines accumulate
          toward the hyphal apices. As potent inhibitors of monoamine
          oxidases, &#946;&#8208;carbolines are neuroactive compounds and interfere
          with psilocybin degradation. Therefore, our findings represent
          an unprecedented scenario of natural product pathways that
          diverge from the same building block and produce dissimilar
          compounds, yet contribute directly or indirectly to the same
          pharmacological effects...<br>
          <br>
          <b> Conclusions<br>
          </b>Psilocybe mushrooms produce an ayahuasca&#8208;like and
          potentially similarly synergistic set of metabolites that may
          impact upon onset and duration of their effects. Remarkably,
          both pathways originate from the same generic building block,
          l&#8208;tryptophan, yet take different routes leading to dissimilar
          compounds whose bioactivities in return contribute directly
          and indirectly to the same pharmacology (Scheme&#8197;1). This is a
          unique case in fungal chemistry and distantly related to the
          bacterium Streptomyces clavuligerus that synchronously
          produces both the &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotic cephamycin and the
          &#946;&#8208;lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid.20<br>
          <br>
          Despite the co&#8208;occurrence of 1 and MAO inhibitors in
          Psilocybe, numerous studies with pure synthetic compound have
          shown that the somatic, endocrinic, and psychotropic effects
          are the sole consequence of 1 uptake.21 Future pharmacological
          research is therefore warranted to determine to what extent
          Psilocybe &#946;&#8208;carbolines contribute to the actual psychotropic
          effects of magic mushrooms. Compounds 1 and 2 are hypothesized
          to fulfill a protective function in the mushrooms by altering
          the behavior of invertebrate predators.22 Our results
          therefore also relate to chemical ecology and may help
          understand if indoleethylamines and &#946;&#8208;carbolines co&#8208;evolved to
          fulfill and enhance the same biological function through
          addressing dissimilar targets.<b><br>

            Summary<br>
          </b>Memory consolidation can be promoted via targeted memory
          reactivation (TMR) that re-presents training cues or context
          during sleep. Whether TMR acts locally or globally on cortical
          sleep oscillations remains unknown. Here, we exploit the
          unique functional neuroanatomy of olfaction with its
          ipsilateral stimulus processing to perform local TMR in one
          brain hemisphere. Participants learned associations between
          words and locations in left or right visual fields with
          contextual odor throughout. We found lateralized event-related
          potentials during task training that indicate unihemispheric
          memory processes. During post-learning naps, odors were
          presented to one nostril in non-rapid eye movement (NREM)
          sleep. Memory for specific words processed in the cued
          hemisphere (ipsilateral to stimulated nostril) was improved
          after local TMR during sleep. Unilateral odor cues locally
          modulated slow-wave (SW) power such that regional SW power
          increase was lower in the cued hemisphere relative to the
          uncued hemisphere and negatively correlated with select
          memories for cued words. Moreover, local TMR improved
          phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between slow oscillations and
          sleep spindles specifically in the cued hemisphere. The
          effects on memory performance and cortical sleep oscillations
          were not observed when unilateral olfactory stimulation during
          sleep followed learning without contextual odor. Thus, TMR in
          human sleep transcends global action by selectively promoting
          specific memories associated with local sleep oscillations.<b><br>

          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          This article challenges the historical existence of the
          ‘Johannine community’ – a hypothesized group of ancient
          churches sharing a distinctive theological outlook. Scholars
          posit such a community to explain the similarities of John to
          1, 2 and 3 John as well as the epistles’ witness to a network
          of churches. Against this view, this article calls attention
          to evidence of literary contact between the four texts and the
          presence of dubious authorial claims in each. Taken together,
          these features cast John, 1 John, 2 John and 3 John as
          unreliable bases for historical reconstruction, whose implied
          audiences and situations are probably fabrications. The
          article proceeds to develop a new history of the Johannine
          texts. Those texts represent a chain of literary forgeries, in
          which authors of different extractions cast and recast a
          single invented character – an eyewitness to Jesus’ life – as
          the mouthpiece of different theological viewpoints.<b><br>

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>A treadmill vehicle (1) comprises a treadmill (5), a force
          transmission mechanism (14), which is arranged and configured
          for force transmission between an endless moving belt (6) of
          the treadmill and at least one treadmill-coupled vehicle wheel
          (3), and an electromotor (15) for driving movement of the
          treadmill vehicle over a ground. The treadmill vehicle is
          further characterized by an abnormality sensor (16) for
          detecting at least one abnormal operation condition of the
          treadmill vehicle (1) during operation of the electromotor
          (15), wherein said abnormal operation condition corresponds to
          a situation in which a user is unsafely walking on the endless
          moving belt or a situation in which there is no user on the
          endless moving belt, and a control circuitry (17) for
          disabling the operation of the electromotor in response to the
          abnormality sensor (16) detecting said at least one abnormal
          operation condition.<b><br>

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>Harvesting energy from the environment offers the promise
          of clean power for self-sustained systems1,2. Known
          technologies—such as solar cells, thermoelectric devices and
          mechanical generators—have specific environmental requirements
          that restrict where they can be deployed and limit their
          potential for continuous energy production3,4,5. The ubiquity
          of atmospheric moisture offers an alternative. However,
          existing moisture-based energy-harvesting technologies can
          produce only intermittent, brief (shorter than 50 seconds)
          bursts of power in the ambient environment, owing to the lack
          of a sustained conversion mechanism6,7,8,9,10,11,12. Here we
          show that thin-film devices made from nanometre-scale protein
          wires harvested from the microbe Geobacter sulfurreducens can
          generate continuous electric power in the ambient environment.
          The devices produce a sustained voltage of around 0.5 volts
          across a 7-micrometre-thick film, with a current density of
          around 17 microamperes per square centimetre. We find the
          driving force behind this energy generation to be a
          self-maintained moisture gradient that forms within the film
          when the film is exposed to the humidity that is naturally
          present in air. Connecting several devices linearly scales up
          the voltage and current to power electronics. Our results
          demonstrate the feasibility of a continuous energy-harvesting
          strategy that is less restricted by location or environmental
          conditions than other sustainable approaches.<b><br>

              Expanding wavelength range for solar energy conversion</b><br>
            <b>by Kyushu University </b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>...Sunlight comes in a spectrum, with each color having a
          different wavelength. Solar cells must absorb light of
          particular wavelengths, depending on how much energy the cell
          needs to drive the reaction. The more of the spectrum it
          captures, the more hydrogen it produces. Unfortunately, most
          cells only absorb shorter wavelengths of light, corresponding
          to the higher energy region of visible light below the red
          light domain. This means that while colors such as blue and
          green light can be used, the rest is wasted.<br>
          <br>
          Now, researchers at Kyushu University in Japan and its
          Institute for Carbon-Neutral Energy Research (I2CNER) have
          potentially solved this problem. They invented a device driven
          by near-infrared (NIR) light - the part of the spectrum,
          invisible to the naked eye, with wavelengths longer than
          visible red light. Thus, they enabled a broader spectrum of
          light, including UV, visible, and NIR, to be harvested. Their
          design cleverly exploits the chemistry of ruthenium, a heavy
          metal related to iron. Their achievement was reported in
          Angewandte Chemie International Edition.<br>
          <br>
          Particular metal-organic hybrid materials are good at
          capturing light, which helps their electrons to "jump" into
          orbitals in the organic parts of the materials attached to the
          metal center. In solar cells, this is the first step in
          producing hydrogen, since electrons are the drivers of
          chemistry. However, the jump between orbitals is usually so
          big that only UV and the higher energy region of visible light
          have enough energy to stimulate it. Red, NIR, and even longer
          IR light are simply reflected back or pass through the
          devices, and their energy remains unused.<br>
          <br>
          The Kyushu design is different. "We introduced new electron
          orbitals into the ruthenium atoms," study corresponding author
          Professor Ken Sakai explains. "It's like adding rungs to a
          ladder - now the electrons in ruthenium don't have so far to
          jump, so they can use lower energies of light such as red and
          NIR. This nearly doubles the amount of sunlight photons we can
          harvest."<br>
          <br>
          The trick is to use an organic compound - hexagonal rings of
          carbon and nitrogen - to link three metal atoms into a single
          molecule. In fact, this not only creates these new "rungs" -
          hence the ability to use red and NIR light - but also makes
          the reaction more efficient due to spatial expansion of the
          light harvesting part of the molecule. Thus, the production of
          hydrogen is accelerated.<br>
          <br>
          "It's taken decades of efforts worldwide, but we've finally
          managed to drive water reduction to evolve H2 using NIR,"
          Sakai says. "We hope this is just the beginning - the more we
          understand the chemistry, the better we can design devices to
          make clean, hydrogen-based energy storage a commercial
          reality."<br>

          </b>In order to realize artificial photosynthetic devices for

          desirable to use a wider wavelength range of light that
          extends to a lower energy region of the solar spectrum. Here
          we report a triruthenium photosensitizer
          [Ru3(dmbpy)6(&#956;&#8208;HAT)]6+ (dmbpy=4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine,
          HAT=1,4,5,8,9,12&#8208;hexaazatriphenylene), which absorbs
          near&#8208;infrared light up to 800&#8197;nm based on its metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand
          charge transfer (1MLCT) transition. Importantly,
          [Ru3(dmbpy)6(&#956;&#8208;HAT)]6+ is found to be the first example of a
          photosensitizer which can drive H2 evolution under the
          illumination of near&#8208;infrared light above 700&#8197;nm. The
          electrochemical and photochemical studies reveal that the
          reductive quenching within the ion&#8208;pair adducts of
          [Ru3(dmbpy)6(&#956;&#8208;HAT)]6+ and ascorbate anions affords a singly
          reduced form of [Ru3(dmbpy)6(&#956;&#8208;HAT)]6+, which is used as a
          reducing equivalent in the subsequent water reduction process.<b><br>

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>Materials having a high dielectric constant are needed for
          a variety of electrical applications from transistors to
          capacitors. Ferroelectric amorphous-oxide (glass) alkali-ion
          electrolytes of composition A2.99Ba0.005ClO (A = Li, Na) are
          shown by two different types of measurement and different
          consistent analyses to have extraordinarily high dielectric
          constants, varying from 109 at 25 °C to 1010 at 220 °C if the
          glass is properly conditioned. These anomalously high
          dielectric properties coexist with alkali-ion conductivities
          at 25 °C that are equivalent to those of the best
          organic-liquid electrolytes of a Li-ion cell, and cyclic
          voltammetry (CV) in a Au/glass electrolyte/Au cell is stable
          from &#8722;10 to +10 V. A model to interpret microscopically all
          the key features of the CV curves shows that the
          electric-double-layer capacitors that form at the
          gold/electrolyte interfaces in the Au/glass electrolyte/Au
          heterojunction reverse polarization at an applied voltage V =
          ±2.1 V, resulting in three almost equivalent discharging
          capacitances for a single physical capacitor from &#8722;10 to +10

          </b>Whatever the Democratic Party is infected with may be
          worse than covid-19. The symptoms presented point to a rare
          illness known as kuru. By now, we all understand that diseases
          easily jump between continents in this era of incessant air
          travel. The National Institutes of Health’s MedlinePlus
          bulletin has this to say about it:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kuru is found among people from New Guinea
          who practiced a form of cannibalism in which they ate the
          brains of dead people as part of a funeral ritual. This
          practice stopped [allegedly] in 1960, but cases of kuru were
          reported for many years afterward because the disease has a
          long incubation period…. Kuru causes brain and nervous system
          changes similar to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease… bovine
          spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also called mad cow disease.
          The main risk factor for kuru is eating human brain tissue,
          which can contain the infectious particles.<br>
          <br>
          Does this account for the public’s preoccupation with Zombies?
          Is something deeply sinister roiling in the dark interstices
          of American life? The public still doesn’t know for sure what
          was going on in the congressional SCIF chamber (Sensitive
          Compartmented Information Facility) deep in the Capitol’s
          sub-basement back in January, where Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA)
          was busy spirit-cooking impeachment testimony. Was something
          else bubbling away on his Coleman stove down there? Say, a
          fricassee of Jeffrey Epstein’s frontal lobes? Did Nancy Pelosi
          come back for seconds? Her subsequent behavior implicates
          acute kuru infection, the inappropriate laughter, slurred
          speech, tardive dyskinesia, paranoia...<b><br>

              That Works at Night</b><br>
            <b>By Andy Fell</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          What if solar cells worked at night? That’s no joke, according
          to Jeremy Munday, professor in the Department of Electrical
          and Computer Engineering at UC Davis. In fact, a specially
          designed photovoltaic cell could generate up to 50 watts of
          power per square meter under ideal conditions at night, about
          a quarter of what a conventional solar panel can generate in
          daytime, according to a concept paper by Munday and graduate
          student Tristan Deppe. The article was published in, and
          featured on the cover of, the January 2020 issue of ACS
          Photonics. <br>
          <br>
          Munday, who recently joined UC Davis from the University of
          Maryland, is developing prototypes of these nighttime solar
          cells that can generate small amounts of power. The
          researchers hope to improve the power output and efficiency of
          the devices. <br>
          <br>
          Munday said that the process is similar to the way a normal
          solar cell works, but in reverse. An object that is hot
          compared to its surroundings will radiate heat as infrared
          light. A conventional solar cell is cool compared to the sun,
          so it absorbs light. <br>
          <br>
          Space is really, really cold, so if you have a warm object and
          point it at the sky, it will radiate heat toward it. People
          have been using this phenomenon for nighttime cooling for
          hundreds of years. In the last five years, Munday said, there
          has been a lot of interest in devices that can do this during
          the daytime (by filtering out sunlight or pointing away from
          the sun). <br>
          Generating power by radiating heat<br>
          <br>
          There’s another kind of device called a thermoradiative cell
          that generates power by radiating heat to its surroundings.
          Researchers have explored using them to capture waste heat
          from engines. <br>
          <br>
          “We were thinking, what if we took one of these devices and
          put it in a warm area and pointed it at the sky,” Munday said.
          <br>
          <br>
          This thermoradiative cell pointed at the night sky would emit
          infrared light because it is warmer than outer space. <br>
          <br>
          “A regular solar cell generates power by absorbing sunlight,
          which causes a voltage to appear across the device and for
          current to flow. In these new devices, light is instead
          emitted and the current and voltage go in the opposite
          direction, but you still generate power,” Munday said. “You
          have to use different materials, but the physics is the same.”
          <br>
          <br>
          The device would work during the day as well, if you took
          steps to either block direct sunlight or pointed it away from
          the sun. Because this new type of solar cell could potentially
          operate around the clock, it is an intriguing option to
          balance the power grid over the day-night cycle.<b><br>

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>Photovoltaics possess significant potential due to the
          abundance of solar power incident on earth; however, they can
          only generate electricity during daylight hours. In order to
          produce electrical power after the sun has set, we consider an
          alternative photovoltaic concept that uses the earth as a heat
          source and the night sky as a heat sink, resulting in a
          “nighttime photovoltaic cell” that employs thermoradiative
          photovoltaics and concepts from the advancing field of
          radiative cooling. In this Perspective, we discuss the
          principles of thermoradiative photovoltaics, the theoretical
          limits of applying this concept to coupling with deep space,
          the potential of advanced radiative cooling techniques to
          enhance their performance, and a discussion of the practical
          limits, scalability, and integrability of this nighttime
          photovoltaic concept.<br>
