                    lied about the numbers of people that tested
                    positive by inflating those numbers, they lied about
                    the numbers of people that died from Covid-19 by
                    inflating those numbers by calling all deaths
                    Covid-19 deaths, and they are now lying about the
                    numbers of people that are having adverse effects
                    and dying from the Covid-19 vaccinations. If you
                    haven't gotten the mRNA Experimental Vaccinations
                    yet, you better do your own DUE DILIGENCE by doing
                    your own research first. JUST SAY NO and DO NOT
                    CONSENT to Bill Gates' FINAL SOLUTION. Once you do
                    the research, you will find out LESS PEOPLE DIED IN
                    2020 THAN THE 3 YEARS PRIOR TO 2020. There was NO

                    taxiformis inclusion based on organic matter intake.
                    Steers were fed 3 diets: high, medium, and low
                    forage total mixed ration (TMR) representing
                    life-stage diets of growing beef steers. The Low and
                    High treatments over 147 days reduced enteric CH4
                    yield 45 and 68%, respectively. However, there was
                    an interaction between TMR type and the magnitude of
                    CH4 yield reduction. Supplementing low forage TMR
                    reduced CH4 yield 69.8% (P &lt;0.01) for Low and 80%
                    (P &lt;0.01) for High treatments. Hydrogen (H2)
                    yield (g H2/DMI) increased (P &lt;0.01) 336 and 590%
                    compared to Control for the Low and High treatments,
                    respectively. Carbon dioxide (CO2) yield (g CO2/DMI)
                    increased 13.7% between Control and High treatments
                    (P = 0.03). No differences were found in ADG,
                    carcass quality, strip loin proximate analysis and
                    shear force, or consumer taste preferences. DMI
                    tended to decrease 8% (P = 0.08) in the Low
                    treatment and DMI decreased 14% (P &lt;0.01) in the
                    High treatment. Conversely, FCE tended to increase
                    7% in Low (P = 0.06) and increased 14% in High (P
                    &lt;0.01) treatment compared to Control. The
                    persistent reduction of CH4 by A. taxiformis
                    supplementation suggests that this is a viable feed
                    additive to significantly decrease the carbon
                    footprint of ruminant livestock and potentially
                    increase production efficiency.<br>

                    This invention relates to a shock wave-emitting
                    apparatus that is able to slow down the flow of time
                    in its immediate vicinity. The disclosed apparatus
                    is capable not only of slowing down clocks, but also
                    of slowing the rate of all physical processes
                    occurring in the immediate vicinity of said
                    wave-emitting apparatus...<br>
                    [0041] Based on subquantum kinetics it may be
                    concluded that greater ether wind velocities, and
                    hence greater time dilations, can be achieved by
                    increasing the voltage of the shock discharge,
                    reducing the rise-time of the shock, and increasing
                    the pulse repetition rate of the shocks. So with
                    proper engineering, this effect should be able to
                    achieve degrees of time dilation suitable for
                    application to long duration space flights...<br>

                    and electrokinetics can be traced to T. Townsend
                    Brown’s first article “How I Control Gravity”
                    (Science and Invention, 1929) with the unexplained
                    alignment of the “molecular gravitors”. Brown
                    reported that the dielectrics had high propulsive
                    force when the “differently charged elements” were
                    aligned with the voltage source. Perhaps
                    electrogravitics was also revealed in the article
                    “Gravity Nullified: Quartz Crystals Charged by High
                    Frequency Currents Lose Their Weight” which appeared
                    two years earlier in the same magazine in September
                    of 1927. The editors had a change of heart however,
                    in the following issue, they rescinded the article.
                    Much of what we know about T. T. Brown is from his
                    numerous patents and articles, reprinted
                    inElectrogravitics Systems Volume I, by this author
                    who was fortunate to correspond with him in 1981
                    when he was at the University of Florida. A sample
                    of his detailed correspondence is contained in the
                    out-of-print book, Ether-Technology: A Rational
                    Approach to Gravity-Control by Rho Sigma (1977) and
                    in the recent Defying Gravity: The Parallel Universe
                    of T. Townsend Brown, Paul Schatzkin, (2009, Embassy
                    Books). Also, a five-minute Brown-Bahnson Lab video
                    online shows many of the experimental models that
                    Brown developed toward 1960 with colleague Agnew

                    Selected clips showing vacuum chamber experiments
                    with various electrogravitic devices, demonstrating
                    successful localized gravity modification, or energy

                    'Electrogravitic Effect' was more than simply high

                    energy nuclear reactor (LENR) is provided for
                    producing thermal energy. The LENR includes first
                    and second vessels and an ignitor. The first vessel
                    defined a first chamber containing LENR fuel. The
                    second vessel disposed inside the first vessel
                    defines a second chamber containing exothermic
                    material. The ignitor initiates the exothermic
                    material by sparking. The LENR fuel reacts to
                    produce the thermal energy in response to initiation
                    heat from the exothermic material.<br>

                    The nano-diamond battery’s power comes from

                    <br>
                    The California-based startup NDB has unveiled a
                    battery that uses nuclear waste and lasts up to
                    28,000 years.<br>

                    The power of the nano-diamond battery comes from
                    radioactive isotopes used in nuclear reactors.<br>
                    <br>
                    Its radioactive core is protected by multiple layers
                    of synthetic diamonds, one of the hardest materials
                    to damage or break.<br>
                    <br>
                    The energy is absorbed in the diamond through
                    inelastic scattering, which is used to generate
                    electricity...<br>

                    effectiveness and safety of vaccines; this may
                    ultimately mean that continuing the existence — at
                    least in their current form — of five US
                    “healthcare” agencies are now in doubt: the CDC, the

                    concerning biannual recertification for quality and
                    effectiveness — meaning that that their vaccines

                    or any other activity to stop the forced vaccination

                    memory is fallible and malleable. In forensic
                    settings in particular, this poses a challenge
                    because people may falsely remember events with
                    legal implications that never actually happened.
                    Despite an urgent need for remedies, however,
                    research on whether and how rich false
                    autobiographical memories can be reversed under
                    realistic conditions (i.e., using reversal
                    strategies that can be applied in real-world
                    settings) is virtually nonexistent. The present
                    study therefore not only replicates and extends
                    previous demonstrations of false memories but,
                    crucially, documents their reversibility after the
                    fact: Employing two ecologically valid strategies,
                    we show that rich but false autobiographical
                    memories can mostly be undone. Importantly, reversal
                    was specific to false memories (i.e., did not occur
                    for true memories).<br>

                    memories of autobiographical events can create
                    enormous problems in forensic settings (e.g., false
                    accusations). While multiple studies succeeded in
                    inducing false memories in interview settings, we
                    present research trying to reverse this effect (and
                    thereby reduce the potential damage) by means of two
                    ecologically valid strategies. We first successfully
                    implanted false memories for two plausible
                    autobiographical events (suggested by the students’
                    parents, alongside two true events). Over three
                    repeated interviews, participants developed false
                    memories (measured by state-of-the-art coding) of
                    the suggested events under minimally suggestive
                    conditions (27%) and even more so using massive
                    suggestion (56%). We then used two techniques to
                    reduce false memory endorsement, source
                    sensitization (alerting interviewees to possible
                    external sources of the memories, e.g., family
                    narratives) and false memory sensitization (raising
                    the possibility of false memories being
                    inadvertently created in memory interviews,
                    delivered by a new interviewer). This reversed the
                    false memory build-up over the first three
                    interviews, returning false memory rates in both
                    suggestion conditions to the baseline levels of the
                    first interview (i.e., to ∼15% and ∼25%,
                    respectively). By comparison, true event memories
                    were endorsed at a higher level overall and less
                    affected by either the repeated interviews or the
                    sensitization techniques. In a 1-y follow-up (after
                    the original interviews and debriefing), false
                    memory rates further dropped to 5%, and participants
                    overwhelmingly rejected the false events. One strong
                    practical implication is that false memories can be
                    substantially reduced by easy-to-implement
                    techniques without causing collateral damage to true
                    memories.<br>

                    questions on the magic building material I mentioned
                    at the end. It's called arbolite. Another example of
                    crazy Soviet engineering that deserves a second
                    look. 5 buckets of wood chip to 2 kilos of cement, 2
                    kilos of stone dust (from making crushed stone),
                    just enough water to wet it through, liquid soap
                    enough to break surface tension, any one or several
                    of a number of common chemicals to bind the sugars
                    in wood that interfere with cement curing. Mix,
                    pour, tamp down. Looks ugly (but holds plaster
                    beautifully, preferably sawdust plaster with some
                    lime and just a bit of cement), has thermal
                    characteristics very close to those of solid wood, a
                    specific weight of around 0,7 (so it floats),
                    doesn't burn or rot, nothing will eat it, strong
                    enough to hold up 3 floors and a roof. Not a good
                    material for taller buildings unless a frame is
                    used. Great filler for post-beam-and-filler (e.g.,
                    Fachwerk) architecture. Except for cement the
                    materials are all free (better than free if you get
                    paid to haul them away). Can be drilled and sawed
                    easily, holds nails. Unlike brick and other types of
                    masonry, doesn't crack and can take a ridiculous
                    amount of distortion before failing. Sledgehammer
                    blows produce a dull thud and make it shrug. Great
                    stuff, highly recommended. A total redneck lifehack
                    (don't repeat that too loudly!). Email me if you
                    want to give it a try...<br>

                  </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Turbine
                  Creates Water Out Of Thin Air!<br>
                </b>RESEARCHERS AT VICI-LABS, IN COLLABORATION WITH UC
                BERKELEY AND THE NATIONAL PEACE CORPS ASSOCIATION
                (NPCA), DEVELOPED A DEVICE THAT CONDENSATES PURE WATER
                FROM THE AIR WITHOUT THE USE OF POWER OR CHEMICALS. <br>
                THE WATERSEER IS AN INEXPENSIVE, LOW-TECH AND
                LOW-MAINTENANCE CONDENSER THAT IS EXPECTED TO CREATE
                WATER SELF-SUFFICIENCY IN COMMUNITIES AROUND THE WORLD.
                <br>
                IT USES A RELATIVELY SIMPLE MECHANISM, WITH AN
                ABOVE-GROUND TURBINE THAT SPINS IN THE BREEZE, TURNING
                INTERNAL FAN-BLADES AND DIRECTING AIR DOWN INTO A
                CONDENSATION CHAMBER INSTALLED 1.8M (6 FT) UNDERGROUND.
                <br>
                THERE, THE METAL SIDES OF THE CHAMBER ARE COOLED BY
                SURROUNDING SOIL AND THESE IN TURN COOL DOWN THE WARM
                AIR INSIDE THE CHAMBER. <br>
                THIS CAUSES THE WATER VAPOR TO CONDENSATE INTO LIQUID
                WATER FLOWING DOWN INTO THE RESERVOIR. <br>
                WITH THE HELP OF A PUMP, THE POTABLE WATER CAN BE EASILY
                EXTRACTED AND COLLECTED. <br>
                DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE SIDES OF THE UNDERGROUND
                CHAMBER ARE ALWAYS COOLER THAN THE AIR, WATERSEER CAN
                COLLECT WATER DURING DAY AND NIGHT, EVEN WITH NO WIND. <br>
                UNDER OPTIMAL CONDITIONS, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IT CAN
                YIELD UP TO 42L (11 GALLONS) OF DRINKING WATER PER DAY.
                A SIMPLE, SUSTAINABLE AND SCALABLE WAY OF PROVIDING
                WATER, AT A COST OF JUST $134.<br>

                  &nbsp;UC Berkeley // Omar Yaghi // MOF 801<br>
                </b>Last October, a University of California, Berkeley,
                team headed down to the Arizona desert, plopped their
                newest prototype water harvester into the backyard of a
                tract home and started sucking water out of the air
                without any power other than sunlight.<br>
                <br>
                The successful field test of their larger,
                next-generation harvester proved what the team had
                predicted earlier in 2017: that the water harvester can
                extract drinkable water every day/night cycle at very
                low humidity and at low cost, making it ideal for people
                living in arid, water-starved areas of the world.<br>

                In fact, it was originally developed and registered as a
                rodenticide in 1984. It kills them because it elevates
                the levels of calcium in the blood, leading to acute
                kidney failure, and then death. ...<br>

                </b>This is the edited version of Mimi Nelson's live
                presentation for the Vancouver UFO Meetup group. (Part
                1)<br>
                Mimi discusses Vitko Novi's initial experiences with the
                Apunians, which took place in 1960. The Apunions are
                extraterrestrials that come from the planet Apu, and
                visited the Quechua people of the Andes on a regular
                basis. Mr. Novi says that they helped the mountain
                people in various ways including healing and giving
                spiritual teachings from their planet's philosophy of
                love, service to others and peace and justice for
                humanity. Only 100 copies of this edition of the book
                were printed in 1975 and published by Amistad.<br>

                            the bacterium. This means that we are
                            following procedures to be integrated. To
                            eradicate it it takes more than classic
                            viruses. Not only are closures needed, you
                            need to disinfect and prevent. And now there
                            is the scientific rationale for which
                            antibiotics work. We will also need a
                            vaccine against the toxins that we have
                            found and our bacteria produce, much like
                            the mechanism of diphtheria. Current
                            vaccines will not be enough. In a while we
                            will have many more variants: the Lombard,
                            Venetian, Milan and Rome variant ”.<br>
                            <br>
                            The discovery made by Carlo Brogna, Simone
                            Cristoni and the other doctors of the
                            research group with the lead partner
                            Craniomed, founded in 2018 to study
                            proteins, is sensational. Brogna anticipated
                            everything, in a completely emergency way,
                            in his book, for sale online, “Sars Cov 2,
                            The Complete Truth”, created to communicate
                            to people who do not have a medical culture
                            all the new major evidence on the virus.
                            Which among other things is immortalized
                            together with toxins while also replicating
                            in bacteria. For the whole group that
                            collaborated with Brogna it was a real
                            surprise: “before having this scientific
                            evidence, which is being approved in
                            international journals to which we are
                            providing additions to the research
                            presented, I too was following the classical
                            route”.<br>
                            <br>
                            Q: What does it mean that Sars Cov 2 is also
                            bacteriophage, i.e. it replicates its RNA
                            through bacteria?<br>
                            <br>
                            It means that he injects his own genetic
                            content into the bacterium and from there it
                            is replicated. We have absolute and
                            indisputable evidence of this with the many
                            experimental tests we have performed. We are
                            also collecting electron microscope photos.
                            Let me explain. A virus normally attacks our
                            cells, i.e. the epithelium and mucous
                            membranes. It tries to enter and replicate
                            and this induces an immune response in the
                            host. It triggers a series of biochemical
                            events to which the body responds with
                            inflammation proteins. But above our cells
                            is the microbiome, which is a layer of
                            “good” bacteria that live with us. In the
                            case of a bacteriophage virus, it does not
                            pass without first interfacing with the
                            microbiome, but also enters the bacteria. We
                            were tied to the classic concept that the
                            problem is that phages are usually ten times
                            smaller than a coronavirus! Diphtheria, for
                            example, is also a disease caused by a
                            bacterium that produces toxins because it
                            has been colonized by a phage virus.<br>

                            vaccines will not work against SARSCoV2
                            because this virus does not only replicate
                            in human cells like other viruses, this one
                            replicates through bacteria too. This is the

                            this?<br>
                            <br>
                            We at Craniomed do research on proteins. The
                            absence of taste and smell in Covid patients
                            was the subject of study and we used a very
                            fine method, mass spectrometry, to find some
                            abnormal proteins, which interfere with the
                            nerve transmission of the two senses
                            mentioned above. We have found such abnormal
                            proteins in the blood and urine in people
                            affected by COVID-19. Well, we have observed
                            the same toxins several times in the same
                            person but each time with different amino
                            acids and this has made us go back to a
                            concept of classical biology: when there are
                            defects in the production of amino acids in
                            the person, the origin of the problem is of
                            type bacterial.<br>
                            <br>
                            Q: Can you explain exactly how the evidence
                            was reached that Sars Cov 2 replicates its
                            RNA in bacteria?<br>
                            <br>
                            I will try to explain it in a simple way. We
                            did this by culturing bacteria from our
                            microbiome and the virus. First, we took the
                            fecal swab of some COVID-19 patients and
                            cultured it for up to 7.14 and 30 days,
                            seeing that the virus increased RNA
                            production. Then, we took the virus and
                            cultured it with bacteria from the fecal
                            swab of a non-sick person, seeing that it
                            was replicating here too. Finally, we took
                            the bacteria from the first experiment and
                            separated them from the virus! We grew them
                            on their own and at 30 days they kept
                            producing virions. The evidence was clear
                            and we were incredulous at what we
                            observed...<br>
                            <br>
                            Q: What consequences does this discovery
                            have on all that is being done to contain
                            it?<br>
                            <br>
                            Huge. First of all, since it is also a
                            bacteriophage, we must accept the evidence
                            that it is everywhere. Colonize sewers,
                            waters, seas. Everything (that’s why there
                            was news of the virus in the papaya or in
                            the fridge, in the Dutch or Milan sewers,
                            ed). I do not think that it is enough to
                            close everything periodically without
                            continuously disinfecting schools, public
                            places, means of transport, the streets, as
                            they did in China. Periodic disinfestation
                            should be done with pre-established and
                            coordinated protocols. Sure, the mask is
                            protection, but not enough. Contact and
                            orofecal transmission is another explanation
                            for the continuous increases in positives.
                            Furthermore, being ubiquitous and
                            replicating quickly, it is reductive to
                            speak of the Brazilian or English variant:
                            soon we will have many variants, the
                            Lombard, Lazio, then the Milanese and Roman
                            ones and then the individual ones! In short,
                            we will all have it within a few years. The
                            good thing is that we now have the rationale
                            on how to treat it early and the time factor
                            is very important. It can be treated with
                            antibiotics and avoiding some drugs but at
                            “time zero”.<br>
                            <br>
                            Q: What antibiotics? And also here what
                            evidence do you have?<br>
                            <br>
                            We tested 18 antibiotics and treated 115
                            symptomatic infected with previous
                            pathologies. Azithromycin, amoxicillin,
                            metronidazole and vancomycin work great. We
                            gave these antibiotics and probiotics
                            immediately and at “time zero”. The problem
                            with this virus is toxins. Some enhance the
                            drugs normally taken by people being treated
                            for other previous diseases. For example,
                            anti-inflammatories such as ibufrofen and
                            even paracetamol cause many problems. Let’s
                            take an example. We have the rationale that
                            bacteria produce a protein very similar to
                            phospholipase A 2, which acts on
                            inflammation and enhances pneumonia and
                            coagulation of the vascular
                            microcirculation. If we administer an
                            anti-inflammatory NSAID we will amplify this
                            effect. That is, we make pneumonia more
                            severe. Increases in coagulation,
                            neurological problems and pneumonia have
                            resulted from this toxin-drug synergy. The
                            toxin similar to conotoxin is the one that
                            is most deleterious and is the one that acts
                            on our autonomic nervous system and
                            increases the effect of our
                            neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, therefore
                            all people who take drugs such as to name a
                            few are at greater risk. ace inhibitors,
                            beta blockers, calcium channel blockers,
                            drugs for Parkinson’s, and other similar
                            diseases...<br>

                            For many years, conservatives have known
                            that military leadership has become
                            politicized. The focus shifted from combat
                            readiness to social experimentation, and the
                            left finally conquered the one institution
                            that was considered a bastion of traditional
                            American values. But Tucker Carlson has now
                            exposed that it's worse than even we

                        Professor Mark Skidmore revealed three years ago
                        there was $21 trillion in what he called
                        “Missing Money” from the Department of Defense
                        (DOD) and Housing and Urban Development
                        (HUD).&nbsp; To hide what was going on with the
                        federal books, Congress made all government
                        accounting a national security issue, making it
                        impossible to get real accounting of money “We
                        the People” pay in taxes.&nbsp; Now, even more
                        unofficial and unaccounted for cash has been
                        revealed from the DOD.&nbsp; It’s an eye popping
                        $94 trillion from the years 2017 to 2019.&nbsp;
                        So, add in the $30 trillion in official debt,
                        and that means there is at least $145 trillion
                        in overt and covert money floating around in the
                        federal government, not counting Social Security
                        and Medicare commitments.&nbsp; This story
                        sounds like a fantasy or a cartoon, but it’s
                        totally backed up with facts you will never hear
                        on the legacy media.&nbsp; Dr. Skidmore, who is
                        an expert in public budgets, explains, “In my
                        mind, it does not follow the principles laid out
                        in our Constitution in accounting for revenues
                        coming in and expenditures going out.&nbsp; It’s
                        fraudulent in my mind.”<br>
                        The entire accounting system of the federal
                        government is fraudulent?&nbsp; Dr. Skidmore
                        says, “I think it is.&nbsp; It doesn’t have any
                        integrity.&nbsp; The federal government can
                        modify the financial statements for the public,
                        and they are not going to tell you how or to
                        what degree.&nbsp; So, you get a financial
                        statement or a report that’s available to the
                        public, but it means nothing.&nbsp; What does
                        that mean?&nbsp; It’s totally fraudulent.&nbsp;
                        It’s fake.&nbsp; We are in La La Land.&nbsp; I’m
                        just a normal professor of economics who has a
                        background in budgeting, and I am just stating
                        the obvious.&nbsp; It’s not rocket
                        science.&nbsp; I am just not pretending.&nbsp; I
                        am just saying what it is.”<br>
                        What are the risks to the public?&nbsp; Skidmore
                        says, “The risks are really kind of
                        unknowable.&nbsp; The derivatives market is so
                        enormous and so complexed, and who knows if some
                        of the money that we are not able to account for
                        in the government books is pushing into a
                        quadrillion dollar derivatives market?&nbsp; We
                        don’t know that.&nbsp; It could be.&nbsp; It
                        would be small potatoes in quadrillions (in the
                        derivative market).&nbsp; It’s incomprehensible.
                        . . . My gut tells me this ends awfully with a
                        very abrupt disruption of some sort that could
                        include a transition to some sort of new
                        financial system, and potentially a much more
                        draconian system.”...</font></font></font><b><font

                        about it as a therapy, and remember, and people
                        forget this, Moderna was started as a
                        chemotherapy company for cancer, not a vaccine
                        manufacturer for SARS-COV2. If we said we’re
                        going to give people prophylactic therapy for
                        the cancer they don’t have, you’d be laughed out
                        of a room, because that’s a stupid idea. That’s
                        exactly what this is. This is a mechanical
                        device in the form of a very small packet of
                        technology that is being inserted into the human
                        system to activate the cell to become a
                        pathogen-manufacturing site.<br>
                        “And I refuse to stipulate in any conversations
                        that this is in fact a vaccine issue. The only
                        reason why the term is being used was to abuse
                        the 1905 Jacobson case that has been
                        misrepresented since it was written. And if we
                        were honest with this we would actually call it
                        what it is. It is a chemical pathogen device
                        that is actually meant to unleash a chemically
                        pathogen production action within a cell. It is
                        a medical device, not a drug, because it meets
                        the CDRH [Center for Devices and Radiological
                        Health] definition of a medical device. It is
                        not a living system, it is not a biologic system
                        [as it would be if it were a vaccine]. It is a
                        physical technology. It happens to just come in
                        the size of a molecular package.<br>
                        “So we need to be really clear on making sure we
                        don’t fall for their game, because their game is
                        if we talk about it as a vaccine then we’re
                        going to get into a vaccine conversation. But
                        this is not, by their own admission, a vaccine.
                        As a result it must be clear to everyone
                        listening that we will not fall for this failed
                        definition, just like we won’t fall for their
                        industrial-chemical definition of health,
                        because both of them are functionally flawed and
                        are an explicit violation of the legal construct
                        that is being exploited.<br>

                        color="#000000">The concept of space-time
                        crystals (STC), i.e., translational symmetry
                        breaking in time and space, was recently
                        proposed and experimentally demonstrated for
                        quantum systems. Here, we transfer this concept
                        to magnons and experimentally demonstrate a
                        driven STC at room temperature. The STC is
                        realized by strong homogeneous microwave pumping
                        of a micron-sized permalloy (Py) stripe and is
                        directly imaged by scanning transmission x-ray
                        microscopy (STXM). For a fundamental
                        understanding of the formation of the STC,
                        micromagnetic simulations are carefully adapted
                        to model the experimental findings. Beyond the
                        mere generation of a STC, we observe the
                        formation of a magnonic band structure due to
                        back folding of modes at the STC’s Brillouin
                        zone boundaries. We show interactions of magnons
                        with the STC that appear as lattice scattering,
                        which results in the generation of ultrashort
                        spin waves (SW) down to 100-nm wavelengths that
                        cannot be described by classical dispersion
                        relations for linear SW excitation. We expect
                        that room-temperature STCs will be useful to
                        investigate nonlinear wave physics, as they can
                        be easily generated and manipulated to control
                        their spatial and temporal band structures.<br>

                        that showed a link between the MMR vaccine and
                        autism. This alarming deception has contributed

                    interview, Spiro is joined by Attorney Ana Garner of
                    New Mexico. Garner represents her client Isaac
                    Legaretta, an officer at the Doña Ana County
                    Detention Center and a military veteran, who is
                    suing the county over its new policy for first
                    responders to receive the COVID-19 vaccinations or
                    face termination.&nbsp; <br>
                    Attorney Garner explains the significance of this
                    case and what is at stake, as it is the first of its
                    kind and may set a new standard for legal precedent
                    regarding mandatory vaccination. Garner says she is
                    prepared to take this case to the Supreme Court if
                    necessary. <br>
                    Spiro and Ana Garner also discuss another case of
                    her’s that is ongoing currently. A case that
                    challenges not only the Governor of New Mexico, but
                    the emergency itself.<br>

                    restrictive nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)
                    for controlling the spread of COVID‐19 are mandatory
                    stay‐at‐home and business closures. Given the
                    consequences of these policies, it is important to
                    assess their effects. We evaluate the effects on
                    epidemic case growth of more restrictive NPIs
                    (mrNPIs), above and beyond those of less‐restrictive
                    NPIs (lrNPIs).<br>

                      </strong></font></b><font color="#000000">We first
                    estimate COVID‐19 case growth in relation to any NPI
                    implementation in subnational regions of 10
                    countries: England, France, Germany, Iran, Italy,
                    Netherlands, Spain, South Korea, Sweden and the
                    United States. Using first‐difference models with
                    fixed effects, we isolate the effects of mrNPIs by
                    subtracting the combined effects of lrNPIs and
                    epidemic dynamics from all NPIs. We use case growth
                    in Sweden and South Korea, 2 countries that did not
                    implement mandatory stay‐at‐home and business
                    closures, as comparison countries for the other 8

                    any NPIs was associated with significant reductions
                    in case growth in 9 out of 10 study countries,
                    including South Korea and Sweden that implemented
                    only lrNPIs (Spain had a nonsignificant effect).
                    After subtracting the epidemic and lrNPI effects, we
                    find no clear, significant beneficial effect of
                    mrNPIs on case growth in any country. In France, for
                    example, the effect of mrNPIs was +7% (95% CI:
                    −5%‐19%) when compared with Sweden and + 13%
                    (−12%‐38%) when compared with South Korea (positive
                    means pro‐contagion). The 95% confidence intervals
                    excluded 30% declines in all 16 comparisons and 15%
                    declines in 11/16 comparisons.<br>

                    may be achievable with less‐restrictive

                    the surface of Mars, scientists on Earth have
                    developed a new nanoscale metal carbide that could

                    how researchers had found that taking two doses (24
                    hours apart) had made COVID-19 untraceable in the
                    bloodstream. It works! Every time I start getting
                    the tell-tale signs of a viral infection (runny
                    nose, fever, coughing) I take a tablet. Within about
                    10 minutes there is relief from the symptoms. After
                    the second dose the following day, I am back to
                    normal. No side effects at all.<br>

                    perhaps the first gravity shielding/modification
                    patent ever issued by the USPTO. Electrets
                    which&nbsp; are the electrostatic equivalent of
                    permanent magnets are used. Also such materials uses
                    benzene series molecules which have intrinsic
                    electron ring&nbsp; currents which are
                    superconductor like.<br>
                    <br>
                    Addendum....one of the materials...is
                    benzophenone....2 benzene rings. Material is a NLO
                    and SHG --NonLinear Optical and Second Harmonic
                    Generator. I am&nbsp; planning is a far less
                    awkward&nbsp; second youtube that will focus on a
                    self charging ot Costa Ribiero Effect-charging due
                    to the change in material properties on going from a
                    heated dielectric to a crystal. Small charging
                    effect...and gravity shield is .04 grams...which is
                    unexpected from such a low charge.<br>
                    <br>
                    Mylar Electrets are PET plastics and have a BENZENE
                    ring...which is necessary to get gravity&nbsp;
                    shielding....BUT....Mylar electrets are
                    heterocharged electrets see: Us8901943 for
                    discussion on the term. BUT is worth getting a roll
                    of electret material/ or sheets and then stacking
                    them- IT would be a great easy experiment to run. I

                    gravitational attenuating material that utilizes an
                    organic based material that has the electrons of the
                    dielectric reconfigured through the use of
                    electrostatic fields, magnetic fields, or photonic
                    or actinic radiation as to render the dielectric
                    less interactive with gravitational forces. The
                    dielectric material is a solid, homo-charged,
                    bipolar binary material having aligned dipoles and
                    made of a polymer and hydrocarbon molecules. Each of
                    the hydrocarbon molecules has at least one aromatic
                    ring and cyclic electron ring current therein. The
                    hydrocarbon molecules are benzene-series molecules,

                  </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 78% of people who have
                  been hospitalized, needed a ventilator or died from
                  Covid-19 have been overweight or obese, the Centers
                  for Disease Control and Prevention said in a new study
                  Monday.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just over 42% of the U.S.
                  population was considered obese in 2018, according to
                  the agency’s most recent statistics. Overweight is
                  defined as having a body mass index of 25 or more,
                  while obesity is defined as having a BMI of 30 or
                  more.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “As clinicians develop care plans
                  for COVID-19 patients, they should consider the risk
                  for severe outcomes in patients with higher BMIs,
                  especially or those with severe obesity,” the CDC

                the Earth doesn’t necessarily jive with the data that is
                available. In its place, the researchers propose a new
                model that includes a new layer within the inner core,
                and they say that, based on the data, it may be evidence
                of a “traumatic event” somewhere in Earth’s history....<b><br>

                </b>...Perhaps most surprising of all is the revelation
                of who is behind Deagel, and to find that answer, Whois
                was the solution. Early researchers were able to uncover
                that the person behind the website was none other than
                former government insider, Edwin Deagle.<br>
                Deagle was Undersecretary of the Air Force under
                President Bill Clinton. He later became Assistant to the
                Secretary of Defense and the Deputy Secretary of Defense
                under Clinton in 1994.<br>
                Edwin Deagle is also listed as an active member of the
                CFR.<br>
                Perhaps most telling of all is the interesting fact
                that&nbsp; Deagle is the Director for International
                Relations for the Rockefeller Foundation, one of the

                    Disclaimer</b><br>
                </b>In 2014 we published a disclaimer about the
                forecast. In six years the scenario has changed
                dramatically. This new disclaimer is meant to single out
                the situation from 2020 onwards. Talking about the
                United States and the European Union as separated
                entities no longer makes sense. Both are the Western
                block, keep printing money and will share the same fate.<br>
                After COVID we can draw two major conclusions:<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Western world success model has
                been built over societies with no resilience that can
                barely withstand any hardship, even a low intensity one.
                It was assumed but we got the full confirmation beyond
                any doubt.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The COVID crisis will be used to
                extend the life of this dying economic system through
                the so called Great Reset.<br>
                The Great Reset; like the climate change, extinction
                rebellion, planetary crisis, green revolution, shale oil
                (…) hoaxes promoted by the system; is another attempt to
                slow down dramatically the consumption of natural
                resources and therefore extend the lifetime of the
                current system. It can be effective for awhile but
                finally won’t address the bottom-line problem and will
                only delay the inevitable. The core ruling elites hope
                to stay in power which is in effect the only thing that
                really worries them.<br>
                The collapse of the Western financial system - and
                ultimately the Western civilization - has been the major
                driver in the forecast along with a confluence of crisis
                with a devastating outcome. As COVID has proven Western
                societies embracing multiculturalism and extreme
                liberalism are unable to deal with any real hardship.
                The Spanish flu one century ago represented the death of
                40-50 million people. Today the world’s population is
                four times greater with air travel in full swing which
                is by definition a super spreader. The death casualties
                in today’s World would represent 160 to 200 million in
                relative terms but more likely 300-400 million taking
                into consideration the air travel factor that did not
                exist one century ago. So far, COVID death toll is
                roughly 1 million people. It is quite likely that the
                economic crisis due to the lockdowns will cause more
                deaths than the virus worldwide<br>
                The Soviet system was less able to deliver goodies to
                the people than the Western one. Nevertheless Soviet
                society was more compact and resilient under an
                authoritarian regime. That in mind, the collapse of the
                Soviet system wiped out 10 percent of the population.
                The stark reality of diverse and multicultural Western
                societies is that a collapse will have a toll of 50 to
                80 percent depending on several factors but in general
                terms the most diverse, multicultural, indebted and
                wealthy (highest standard of living) will suffer the
                highest toll. The only glue that keeps united such
                aberrant collage from falling apart is overconsumption
                with heavy doses of bottomless degeneracy disguised as
                virtue. Nevertheless the widespread censorship, hate
                laws and contradictory signals mean that even that glue
                is not working any more. Not everybody has to die
                migration can also play a positive role in this.<br>
                The formerly known as second and third world nations are
                an unknown at this point. Their fate will depend upon
                the decisions they take in the future. Western powers
                are not going to take over them as they did in the past
                because these countries won’t be able to control their
                own cities far less likely countries that are far away.
                If they remain tied to the former World Order they will
                go down along Western powers but won’t experience the
                brutal decline of the late because they are poorer and
                not diverse enough but rather quite homogenous used to
                deal with some sort of hardship but not precisely the
                one that is coming. If they switch to China they can get
                a chance to stabilize but will depend upon the
                management of their resources.<br>
                We expected this situation to unfold and actually is
                unfolding right now with the November election
                triggering a major bomb if Trump is re-elected. If Biden
                is elected there will very bad consequences as well.
                There is a lot of bad blood in the Western societies and
                the protests, demonstrations, rioting and looting are
                only the first symptoms of what is coming. However a new
                trend is taking place overshadowing this one.<br>
                The situation between the three great powers has changed
                dramatically. The only relevant achievement of the
                Western powers during the past decade has been the
                formation of a strategic alliance, both military and
                economic, between Russia and China. Right now the
                potential partnership between Russia and the European
                Union (EU) is dead with Russia turning definitively
                towards China. That was from the beginning the most
                likely outcome. Airbus never tried to establish a real
                partnership but rather a strategy to fade away the
                Russian aerospace industry. Actually Russia and China
                have formed a new alliance to build a long haul
                airliner. Western Europe (not to mention the United
                States) was never interested in the development of
                Russia or forming anything other than a master slave
                relationship with Russia providing raw materials and
                toeing the line of the West. It was clear then and today
                is a fact.<br>
                Russia has been preparing for a major war since 2008 and
                China has been increasing her military capabilities for
                the last 20 years. Today China is not a second tier
                power compared with the United States. Both in military
                and economic terms China is at the same level and in
                some specific areas are far ahead. In the domain of
                high-tech 5G has been a success in the commercial realm
                but the Type 055 destroyer is also another breakthrough
                with the US gaining a similar capability (DDG 51 Flight
                IIII) by mid of this decade (more likely by 2030).
                Nanchang, the lead ship of the Type 055 class, was
                commissioned amid the pandemic and lockdown in China.<br>
                Six years ago the likelihood of a major war was tiny.
                Since then it has grown steadily and dramatically and
                today is by far the most likely major event in the
                2020s. The ultimate conflict can come from two ways. A
                conventional conflict involving at least two major
                powers that escalates into an open nuclear war. A second
                scenario is possible in the 2025-2030 timeframe. A
                Russian sneak first strike against the United States and
                its allies with the new S-500, strategic missile
                defenses, Yasen-M submarines, INF Zircon and Kalibr
                missiles and some new space asset playing the key role.
                The sneak first strike would involve all Russian missile
                strategic forces branches (bombers and ground-based
                missiles) at the different stages of such attack that
                would be strategic translation of what was seen in Syria
                in November 2015. There was no report that the Russian
                had such a capability of launching a high precision,
                multiple, combined arms attack at targets 2,000+
                kilometers away. Western intelligence had no clue. The
                irony is that since the end of the Cold War the United
                States has been maneuvering through NATO to achieve a
                position to execute a first strike over Russia and now
                it seems that the first strike may occur but the country
                finished would be the United States.<br>
                Another particularity of the Western system is that its
                individuals have been brainwashed to the point that the
                majority accept their moral high ground and
                technological edge as a given. This has given the rise
                of the supremacy of the emotional arguments over the
                rational ones which are ignored or deprecated. That
                mindset can play a key role in the upcoming catastrophic
                events. At least in the Soviet system the silent
                majority of the people were aware of the fallacies they
                were fed up. We can see the United States claims about
                G5 being stolen from them by China or hypersonic
                technology being stolen by Russia as the evidence that
                the Western elites are also infected by that hubris.
                Over the next decade it will become obvious that the
                West is falling behind the Russia-China block and the
                malaise might grow into desperation. Going to war might
                seem a quick and easy solution to restore the lost
                hegemony to finally find them into a France 1940 moment.
                Back then France did not have nuclear weapons to turn a
                defeat into a victory. The West might try that swap
                because the unpleasant prospect of not being Mars and
                Venus but rather a bully and his dirty bitch running
                away in fear while the rest of the world is laughing at
                them.<br>
                If there is not a dramatic change of course the world is
                going to witness the first nuclear war. The Western
                block collapse may come before, during or after the war.
                It does not matter. A nuclear war is a game with
                billions of casualties and the collapse plays in the
                hundreds of millions.<b><br>

                Arborlite -- Lots of questions on the magic building
                material I mentioned at the end. It's called arbolite.
                Another example of crazy Soviet engineering that
                deserves a second look. 5 buckets of wood chip to 2
                kilos of cement, 2 kilos of stone dust (from making
                crushed stone), just enough water to wet it through,
                liquid soap enough to break surface tension, any one or
                several of a number of common chemicals to bind the
                sugars in wood that interfere with cement curing. Mix,
                pour, tamp down. Looks ugly (but holds plaster
                beautifully, preferably sawdust plaster with some lime
                and just a bit of cement), has thermal characteristics
                very close to those of solid wood, a specific weight of
                around 0,7 (so it floats), doesn't burn or rot, nothing
                will eat it, strong enough to hold up 3 floors and a
                roof. Not a good material for taller buildings unless a
                frame is used. Great filler for post-beam-and-filler
                (e.g., Fachwerk) architecture. Except for cement the
                materials are all free (better than free if you get paid
                to haul them away). Can be drilled and sawed easily,
                holds nails. Unlike brick and other types of masonry,
                doesn't crack and can take a ridiculous amount of
                distortion before failing. Sledgehammer blows produce a
                dull thud and make it shrug. Great stuff, highly
                recommended. A total redneck lifehack (don't repeat that
                too loudly!). Email me if you want to give it a try.<b><br>

                hydrogen and oxygen - polarized magnetolysis -
                Magnetolisi polarizzata - It En<br>
                My name is Fabio Bilancioni, I would like to show a
                phenomena&nbsp; that&nbsp; I call "polarized
                magnetolysis".<br>
                After many experiments I made always with different
                conditions in order to remove external trouble elements
                and always coming to the confirmation of my theory, I
                decided to put in web what can be an important
                discovery. I hope that someone can confirm its validity
                or, on the contrary, disprove it.<br>
                I unconsciously traced what the Austrian Physicist Mr.
                Felix Ehrenhaft had already explored in the forties ,
                what he called "magnetolysis" : it consisted in the
                dissociation of the water molecule into its components,
                oxygen and hydrogen, by means of a magnetic field
                without use of electric current (like in the traditional
                electrolysis).<br>
                The variant I added to the debated results obtained by
                Ehrenhaft is the&nbsp; "interference" of an earth
                magnetic field with the one produced by permanent
                magnets placed in the following way:<br>
                1: some of them placed in circle around the container of
                distilled water,<br>
                2: some of them inside the container in contact with a
                steel sheet<br>
                3: some of them aligned outside the container.<br>
                Since the container has been placed on a floating
                platform, the aligned magnets (point 3) allowed the
                container/system to direct itself depending on the earth
                magnetic field, the same that happens with a normal
                compass.<br>
                I observed that:<br>
                - when the system directed itself in accordance with the
                earth magnetic field, a phenomena of gas bubbles started
                inside the container;<br>
                - the same phenomena stopped in every position outside
                earth magnetic field axis.<br>
                My hypothesis is that, somehow I don't know, the earth
                magnetic field interacts with the one produced by the
                permanent magnets and in this way it splits the water
                molecule into its components: oxygen and hydrogen.<br>
                Since the phenomena appears only when the containers
                directs itself in accordance with the earth poles, I
                called it "polarized magnetolysis".<br>
                I add that the liquid put into the container is
                distilled water...<b><br>

                </b>The overall range of resonant frequencies of the
                human body was found to be from 62 to 68 Hz and
                independent of mass, height and mass to height ratio...<br>
                In 1992, Bruce Taino of Taino Technology, an independent
                division of Eastern State University in Cheny,
                Washington, built the first frequency monitor in the
                world. Taino has determined that the average frequency
                of a healthy human body during the daytime is 62 to 68
                Hz.<br>
                When the frequency drops, the immune system is
                compromised. If the frequency drops to 58 Hz, cold and
                flu symptoms appear; at 55 Hz, diseases like Candida
                take hold; at 52 Hz, Epstein Bar and at 42 Hz, Cancer.
                Taino’s machine was certified as 100 percent accurate
                and is currently being used in the agricultural field
                today.”<b><br>

                  </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
                  </b></b>In Earth’s low atmosphere, hurricanes are
                destructive due to their great size, strong spiral winds
                with shears, and intense rain/precipitation. However,
                disturbances resembling hurricanes have not been
                detected in Earth’s upper atmosphere. Here, we report a
                long-lasting space hurricane in the polar ionosphere and
                magnetosphere during low solar and otherwise low
                geomagnetic activity. This hurricane shows strong
                circular horizontal plasma flow with shears, a nearly
                zero-flow center, and a coincident cyclone-shaped aurora
                caused by strong electron precipitation associated with
                intense upward magnetic field-aligned currents. Near the
                center, precipitating electrons were substantially
                accelerated to ~10 keV. The hurricane imparted large
                energy and momentum deposition into the ionosphere
                despite otherwise extremely quiet conditions. The
                observations and simulations reveal that the space
                hurricane is generated by steady high-latitude lobe
                magnetic reconnection and current continuity during a
                several hour period of northward interplanetary magnetic
                field and very low solar wind density and speed.<b><br>

                  </b><b>Story at-a-glance</b><br>
                </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A study from the National
                Institutes of Health claims wearing a moist mask is
                actually good for you because inhaling through the wet
                mask hydrates your lungs and boosts your immune system<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it’s important to realize
                that the humidity inside the mask will rapidly allow
                pathogenic bacteria to grow and multiply. This is a
                documented fact not addressed by the NIH<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Medical doctors have warned that
                bacterial pneumonia, facial rashes, fungal infections on
                the face, “mask mouth” (bad breath, tooth decay and gum
                inflammation) and candida mouth infections are all on
                the rise<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By breathing through a
                bacteria-infested mask, you risk inhaling bacteria deep
                into your lungs, and according to recent research, the
                presence of microbes in your lungs can worsen lung
                cancer pathogenesis and contribute to advanced stage
                lung cancer<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Face masks can also reduce oxygen
                intake, leading to hazardous oxygen deficiency
                (hypoxia), along with rapid accumulation of harmful
                carbon dioxide, which can have significant cognitive and
                physical impacts<b><br>

                </b>...There is an official study in Acre, Brazil that
                has doctors amazed at how fast COVID infected patients
                got better after nebulizing with 3 grams of sodium
                bicarbonate (widely available baking soda) in 100 ml of
                water administered in a nebulizer. ...<br>
                The research was carried out by the Federal University
                of Acre (Ufac) in partnership with the Oswaldo Cruz
                Foundation (Fiocruz), an organization dedicated to viral
                and vaccine research. The study was approved by the
                National Ethics and Research Commission (Cnep). The
                treatment, which seeks to improve oxygen saturation in
                the blood, has already been done in about 300 people in

                    Extracellular Vesicles Derived From Apoptotic Cells:
                    An Essential Link Between Death and Regeneration</b><b><br>
                  </b><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maojiao
                    Li, et al.</b><br>
                </b>Apoptosis is a universal and continuous event during
                tissue development, restoration, repair, and
                regeneration. Mounting evidence has demonstrated that
                apoptosis is essential for the activation of tissue
                regeneration. However, the underlying mechanism remains
                elusive. A striking development in recent years comes
                from research on extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived
                from apoptotic cells. During apoptosis, cells secrete
                vesicles of various sizes containing various components.
                Apoptotic cell-derived EVs (ApoEVs) have been found to
                transit to neighboring cells or cells in distant tissues
                through the circulation. These vesicles could act as
                containers to transmit the nucleic acid, protein, and
                lipid signals to target cells. ApoEVs have been shown to
                promote regeneration in the cardiovascular system, skin,
                bone, muscle, kidney, etc. Moreover, several specific
                signaling pathways mediating the anabolic effects of
                ApoEVs have been classified. In this review, we
                comprehensively discussed the latest findings on the
                function of ApoEVs in tissue regeneration and disease
                prevention. These findings may reveal unexpected clues
                regarding the regulatory network between cell death and
                tissue regeneration and suggest novel targets for
                regenerative medicine. The findings discussed here also
                raise the question whether and to what extent ApoEVs
                contribute to embryonic development. This question is
                all the more urgent because the exact functions of
                apoptotic events during numerous developmental processes
                are still largely unclear.<br>

                lockdown their citizens be tried for crimes against
                humanity? One prominent German lawyer, who is also
                licensed to practice law in America, thinks they should.
                And he is organizing a team of thousands of
                participating lawyers who want to prosecute a “second
                Nuremberg tribunal” against a cadre of international
                elites responsible for what he calls the “corona fraud
                scandal.”...<b><br>

                    Defeating ‘Covid’ Test Fraud: Memo to Lawyers and
                    Clients</b><br>
                </b>...If a client is told to get tested, his lawyer
                states the following: “My client needs a sworn affidavit
                from the lab declaring how many cycles will be used.” <br>
                If the lab refuses to comply, sue them.<br>
                If the lab complies, and the cycles are higher than 35,
                sue them.<br>
                We also know that test results from various labs are not
                uniform. One lab will say the patient tests positive;
                another lab will say negative. This fact has been an
                open secret in the testing community for decades.<br>
                Strategy: A lawyer has his client tested at several
                centers, in one day, in different locations, in
                different states—knowing that a different lab will
                process each test.<br>
                If the tests come back with different results, sue the
                labs.<br>
                What would happen if, say, 50 lawyers and their clients
                pursued these two strategies and sued? What would happen
                if a significant amount of publicity surrounded each
                lawyer and his client?<br>
                A breakthrough would occur. A huge number of people
                across the world would become aware that COVID PCR
                testing is rife with fraud.<br>
                Even if judges and courts refused to hear the cases, the
                publicity alone would provoke a major transformation in
                public insight....<b><br>

                    Evangelyn Rodriguez</b><b><br>
                  </b></b>Researchers at Tokushima University in Japan
                screened chaga mushrooms (Inonotus obliquus) for
                potential anti-alopecia agents. They reported their
                findings in an article published in the Journal of
                Natural Medicines.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I. obliquus is a parasitic fungus
                that grows in birch and other trees.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chaga mushrooms, which are used in
                traditional medicine, refer to the resting body
                (sclerotium) of I. obliquus.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This medicinal fungus is
                traditionally used in Mongolia to make shampoo that
                helps maintain healthy hair.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The researchers obtained five
                lanostane-type triterpenes (1-5) via bioassay-guided
                fractionation of chaga mushroom extracts.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They identified the structures of the
                triterpenes using spectroscopy.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proliferation assay using human
                follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPCs) revealed that
                four of the five triterpenes have pro-proliferative
                effects on HFDPCs.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These compounds were lanosterol (1),
                inotodiol (3), lanost-8,24-diene-3B,21-diol (4) and
                trametenolic acid (5).<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The researchers also reported that
                these lanostane-type triterpenes (1, 3, 4 and 5) were
                more potent than minoxidil, a conventional treatment for
                hair loss.<br>
                <br>
                Based on these findings, the researchers concluded that
                the lanostane-type triterpenes in chaga mushrooms are
                potent anti-alopecia agents that can be used to
                stimulate hair growth naturally.<b><br>

                  </b><b>Abstract </b><br>
                </b>The electrification of ice has been a subject of
                research since 1940, mostly in the context of charge
                generation in thunderstorms. This generation of electric
                charge is spontaneous, distinct from applying an
                external electric field to affect the diffusive growth
                of ice crystals. Here, we exploit the spontaneous
                electrification of ice to reveal a surprising phenomenon
                of jumping frost dendrites. We use side-view high-speed
                imaging to experimentally observe frost dendrites
                breaking off from mother dendrites and/or the substrate
                to jump out-of-plane toward an opposing polar liquid.
                Analytical and numerical models are then developed to
                estimate the attractive force between the frost
                dendrites and liquid, in good agreement with the
                experimental results. These models estimate the extent
                of charge separation within a growing sheet of frost,
                which is caused by mismatches in the mobilities of the
                charge carriers in ice. Our findings show that the
                unexpected jumping frost event can serve as a model
                system for resolving long-standing questions in
                atmospheric physics regarding charge separation in ice,
                while also having potential as a deicing construct.<b><br>

                </b>...A crystal is a solid whose atoms or molecules are
                regularly arranged in a particular structure. If one
                looks at the arrangement with a microscope, one
                discovers an atom or a molecule always at the same
                intervals. It is similar with space-time crystals:
                however, the recurring structure exists not only in
                space, but also in time. The smallest components are
                constantly in motion until, after a certain period, they
                arrange again into the original pattern...<br>
                <br>
                In their experiment, Gruszecki and Träger placed a strip
                of magnetic material on a microscopic antenna through
                which they sent a radio-frequency current. This
                microwave field triggered an oscillating magnetic field,
                a source of energy that stimulated the magnons in the
                strip – the quasiparticle of a spin wave. Magnetic waves
                migrated into the strip from left and right,
                spontaneously condensing into a recurring pattern in
                space and time. Unlike trivial standing waves, this
                pattern was formed before the two converging waves could
                even meet and interfere. The pattern, which regularly
                disappears and reappears on its own, must therefore be a
                quantum effect...<b><br>

                  </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
                  </b></b>The concept of space-time crystals (STC),
                i.e., translational symmetry breaking in time and space,
                was recently proposed and experimentally demonstrated
                for quantum systems. Here, we transfer this concept to
                magnons and experimentally demonstrate a driven STC at
                room temperature. The STC is realized by strong
                homogeneous microwave pumping of a micron-sized
                permalloy (Py) stripe and is directly imaged by scanning
                transmission x-ray microscopy (STXM). For a fundamental
                understanding of the formation of the STC, micromagnetic
                simulations are carefully adapted to model the
                experimental findings. Beyond the mere generation of a
                STC, we observe the formation of a magnonic band
                structure due to back folding of modes at the STC’s
                Brillouin zone boundaries. We show interactions of
                magnons with the STC that appear as lattice scattering,
                which results in the generation of ultrashort spin waves
                (SW) down to 100-nm wavelengths that cannot be described
                by classical dispersion relations for linear SW
                excitation. We expect that room-temperature STCs will be
                useful to investigate nonlinear wave physics, as they
                can be easily generated and manipulated to control their
                spatial and temporal band structures.<b><br>

                </b>In research recently published in Science Advances,
                the group reports on a method for spraying invisibly
                thin antennas, made from a type of two-dimensional,
                metallic material called MXene...<br>
                <br>
                The researchers, from the College’s Department of
                Materials Science and Engineering, report that the MXene
                titanium carbide can be dissolved in water to create an
                ink or paint. The exceptional conductivity of the
                material enables it to transmit and direct radio waves,
                even when it’s applied in a very thin coating.<br>
                <br>
                “We found that even transparent antennas with
                thicknesses of tens of nanometers were able to
                communicate efficiently,” said Asia Sarycheva, a

                Institute and Materials Science and Engineering
                Department. “By increasing the thickness up to 8
                microns, the performance of MXene antenna achieved 98
                percent of its predicted maximum value.”<br>

                  </b></b>With the development of the Internet of Things
                (IoT), the demand for thin and wearable electronic
                devices is growing quickly. The essential part of the
                IoT is communication between devices, which requires
                radio-frequency (RF) antennas. Metals are widely used
                for antennas; however, their bulkiness limits the
                fabrication of thin, lightweight, and flexible antennas.
                Recently, nanomaterials such as graphene, carbon
                nanotubes, and conductive polymers came into play.
                However, poor conductivity limits their use. We show RF
                devices for wireless communication based on metallic
                two-dimensional (2D) titanium carbide (MXene) prepared
                by a single-step spray coating. We fabricated a
                ~100-nm-thick translucent MXene antenna with a
                reflection coefficient of less than −10 dB. By
                increasing the antenna thickness to 8 μm, we achieved a
                reflection coefficient of −65 dB. We also fabricated a
                1-μm-thick MXene RF identification device tag reaching a
                reading distance of 8 m at 860 MHz. Our finding shows
                that 2D titanium carbide MXene operates below the skin
                depth of copper or other metals as well as offers an
                opportunity to produce transparent antennas. Being the
                most conductive, as well as water-dispersible, among
                solution-processed 2D materials, MXenes open new avenues
