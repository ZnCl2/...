          </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>Quantum entangled life conditions and graded states of
          consciousness in the universe are scale invariant and are
          guided by a quantum wave meta-language in a superfluid quantum
          space/ zero-point energy field that is instrumental in
          creating quantum coherent states through pilot wave resonant
          connectivity. This interacting dynamic EM field is steering
          life processes through semi- harmonic tuning of fractal
          structured water and vibrating macro-molecules such as DNA and
          hydrated proteins in the cell, including several cell types in
          the human brain. Consciousness is seen as arising through
          interaction of life systems with a holographic,
          field-receptive workspace, that is associated with the brain
          as a global supervening memory horizon, that is organized
          through toroidal geometry. Implications for a better
          understanding of the creation of first life, crucial coherent
          states in quantum biology, the impact of biofield research and
          the importance of information in the fabric of reality are
          discussed. This knowledge can be applied in improving high
          temperature superconductive properties and the dedicated
          design of innovative technology for the protection against the
          potential detrimental effects of EMF in our present world. Our
          studies show a consistent pattern of discrete EMF frequencies
          in a wide spectrum of animate and non-animate systems,
          indicating that a previously unknown biophysical principle
          seems to be revealed.<br>

              Confirmed Vaccines Can Cause Autism, So They Fired Him
              Immediately</b><br>
            <b>by Catherine J. Frompovich</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>Sharyl Attkisson, an intrepid and forthright journalist,
          formerly with CBS TV News, has been persistent in her media
          exposures regarding vaccine-caused health problems, especially
          the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), ever since she did an
          in-depth report for CBS, which the media bosses refused to
          broadcast.&nbsp; That led to Sharyl’s independent journalism
          programs, a blessing in disguise.<br>
          <br>
          Recently, Sharyl exposed that CDC’s expert vaccine witness,
          who previously debunked vaccine autism claims during Vaccinees
          Injury Masters hearings, Dr. Andrew Zimmerman, a pediatric
          neurologist, told CDC “long ago” that vaccines could cause
          Autism, but they refused to accept Zimmerman’s
          information.&nbsp; Instead, Department of Justice [DOJ]
          lawyers immediately fired him.<br>
          <br>
          According to Sharyl,<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Zimmerman declined our interview
          request and referred us to his sworn affidavit. It says: On
          June 15, 2007, he took aside the Department of Justice—or DOJ
          lawyers he worked for defending vaccines in vaccine court. He
          told them that he’d discovered “exceptions in which
          vaccinations could cause autism.” “I explained that in a
          subset of children, vaccine induced fever and immune
          stimulation did cause regressive brain disease with features
          of autism spectrum disorder.” <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I explained that in a subset of children,
          vaccine induced fever and immune stimulation did cause
          regressive brain disease with features of autism spectrum
          disorder.”&nbsp; [CJF emphasis]<br>
          <br>
          Attorney Rolf Hazelhurst, a criminal prosecutor, has a
          vaccine-damaged and autistic son, Yates, born February 11,
          2000.&nbsp; As a result of what the Hazelhurst family has gone
          through, Attorney Hazelhurst has become an avid vaccine-safety
          rights legal counsel.&nbsp; Furthermore, he had Dr. Zimmerman
          evaluate Yates.<br>
          <br>
          As a result of intensive treatment for autism, Yates is doing
          much better.<br>

          <br>
          Today we investigate one of the biggest medical controversies
          of our time: vaccines. There’s little dispute about this
          much-- vaccines save many lives, and rarely, they injure or
          kill. A special federal vaccine court has paid out billions
          for injuries from brain damage to death. But not for the form
          of brain injury we call autism. Now—we have remarkable new
          information: a respected pro-vaccine medical expert used by
          the federal government to debunk the vaccine-autism link, says
          vaccines can cause autism after all. He claims he told that to
          government officials long ago, but they kept it secret...<br>

          <br>
          A new compound which visualises and kills antibiotic-resistant
          superbugs has been discovered by scientists at the University
          of Sheffield and Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL).<br>
          <br>
          The team, led by Professor Jim Thomas, from the University of
          Sheffield’s Department of Chemistry, is testing new compounds
          developed by his PhD student Kirsty Smitten on antibiotic
          resistant gram-negative bacteria, including pathogenic E.
          coli.<br>
          <br>
          Gram-negative bacteria strains can cause infections including
          pneumonia, urinary tract infections and bloodstream
          infections. They are difficult to treat as the cell wall of
          the bacteria prevents drugs from getting into the microbe.<br>
          <br>
          Antimicrobial resistance is already responsible for 25,000
          deaths in the EU each year, and unless this rapidly emerging
          threat is addressed, it’s estimated by 2050 more than 10
          million people could die every year due to antibiotic
          resistant infections.<br>
          <br>
          Doctors have not had a new treatment for gram-negative
          bacteria in the last 50 years, and no potential drugs have
          entered clinical trials since 2010.<br>
          <br>
          The new drug compound has a range of exciting opportunities.
          As Professor Jim Thomas explains: “As the compound is
          luminescent it glows when exposed to light. This means the
          uptake and effect on bacteria can be followed by the advanced
          microscope techniques available at RAL.<br>
          <br>
          “This breakthrough could lead to vital new treatments to
          life-threatening superbugs and the growing risk posed by
          antimicrobial resistance.”<br>
          <br>
          The studies at Sheffield and RAL have shown the compound seems
          to have several modes of action, making it more difficult for
          resistance to emerge in the bacteria. The next step of the
          research will be to test it against other multi-resistant
          bacteria.<br>
          <br>
          In a recent report on antimicrobial resistant pathogens, the
          World Health Organisation put several gram-negative bacteria
          at the top of its list, stating that new treatments for these
          bacteria were ‘Priority 1 Critical’ because they cause
          infections with high death rates, are rapidly becoming
          resistant to all present treatments and are often picked up in
          hospitals.<br>
          <br>
          The research, published in the journal ACS Nano, describes the
          new compound which kills gram-negative E. coli, including a
          multidrug resistant pathogen said to be responsible for
          millions of antibiotic resistant infections worldwide
          annually.<br>

          Researchers at Tampere University have shown for the first
          time that the cerebral emboli of stroke patients contain DNA
          from oral pathogens. The research article has been published
          in the Journal of American Heart Association.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers analysed thrombus aspirates, which
          neurointerventional radiologists removed from 75 stroke
          patients as part of emergency treatment. The samples were
          studied by duplicating bacterial DNA, showing that 79 % of the
          aspirates contained DNA from bacteria that came from the
          teeth.<br>
          <br>
          The study is part of a research project at Tampere University,
          which for ten years has been investigating the effects of
          bacterial infection in the development of cardiovascular
          diseases. The research group has previously shown that the
          same odontogenic bacteria are present in the coronary artery
          stenoses of patients who have suddenly died, the thrombus
          aspirates and arterial blood of myocardial infarction
          patients, ruptured cerebral aneurysms and the thrombus
          aspirates of patients with lower limb arterial and venous
          thrombosis.<br>
          <br>
          Cerebral artery thrombosis causes 87 % of strokes. Most
          thrombi originate in carotid artery stenoses from where they
          travel to block cerebral circulation.<br>
          <br>
          The results showed that a large amount of DNA from
          streptococcus viridans -- normal bacteria in the mouth -- was
          found in cerebral thrombi compared with normal blood samples
          from the same patients. In the oral cavity, streptococci are
          harmless, but when entering circulation, they might cause,
          among other things, infections of the cardiac valves. The
          streptococcus bacteria can directly bind to various platelet
          receptors, making the patient more prone to blood clots.<br>
          <br>
          The research shows that oral health and good dental hygiene
          are of much greater importance to health than previously
          known, and that untreated dental infections can cause serious
          health damage or even death.<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b><b>Background</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Chronic infections have been reported to be risk factors for
          both coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke. DNA of oral
          bacteria, mainly from the viridans streptococci group, has
          been detected in coronary thrombus aspirates of myocardial
          infarction and cerebral aneurysms. Viridans streptococci are
          known to cause infective endocarditis and possess thrombogenic
          properties. We studied the presence of oral bacterial DNA in
          thrombus aspirates of patients with acute ischemic stroke
          treated with mechanical thrombectomy.<br>
          Methods and Results<br>
          <br>
          Thrombus aspirates and arterial blood were taken from 75
          patients (69% men; mean age, 67 years) with acute ischemic
          stroke. The presence of Streptococcus species, mainly the
          Streptococcus mitis group, belonging to viridans streptococci
          as well as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter
          actinomycetemcomitans in samples were determined using a
          quantitative polymerase chain reaction with specific primers
          and probes. The relative amount of bacterial DNA in a sample
          was determined with the comparative threshold cycle method.
          Bacterial DNA was detected in 84% (n=63) of aspired thrombi,
          and 16% (n=12) of samples were considered bacterial DNA
          negative. DNA of Streptococcus species, mainly the S mitis
          group, was found in 79% (n=59) of samples. The median relative
          amount of Streptococcus species DNA was 5.10-fold higher
          compared with the control blood samples from the same
          patients. All thrombi were negative for both P gingivalis and
          A actinomycetemcomitans.<br>
          Conclusions<br>
          <br>
          This is the first study showing the common presence of
          bacterial DNA from viridans streptococci in aspired thrombi of
          patients with acute ischemic stroke. Streptococcal bacteria,
          mostly of oral origin, may contribute to the progression and
          thrombotic events of cerebrovascular diseases.<br>

          ...For the current study, the researchers focused on three
          plant species Porcher cited for antiseptic use that grow in
          Lullwater Preserve on the Emory campus. They included two
          common hardwood trees -- the white oak (Quercus alba) and the
          tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) -- as well as a thorny,
          woody shrub commonly known as the devil's walking stick
          (Aralia spinosa).<br>
          <br>
          Samples of these three plants were gathered from campus
          specimens, based on Porcher's specifications. Extracts were
          taken from white oak bark and galls; tulip poplar leaves, root
          inner bark and branch bark; and the devil's walking stick
          leaves. The extracts were then tested on three species of
          multi-drug-resistant bacteria commonly found in wound
          infections.<br>
          <br>
          Aceinetobacter baumannii -- better known as "Iraqibacter" due
          to its association with wounded combat troops returning from
          the Iraq War -- exhibits extensive resistance to most
          first-line antibiotics. "It's emerging as a major threat for
          soldiers recovering from battle wounds and for hospitals in
          general," Quave says.<br>
          <br>
          Staphylococcus aureus is considered the most dangerous of many
          common staph bacteria and can spread from skin infections or
          medical devices through the bloodstream and infect distant
          organs. Klebsiella pneumoniae is another leading cause of
          hospital infection and can result in life-threatening cases of
          pneumonia and septic shock.<br>
          <br>
          Laboratory tests showed that extracts from the white oak and
          tulip poplar inhibited the growth of S. aureus, while the
          white oak extracts also inhibited the growth of A. baumannii
          and K. pneumoniae. Extracts from both of these plants also
          inhibited S. aureus from forming biofilms, which can act like
          a shield against antibiotics.<br>
          <br>
          Extracts from the devil's walking stick inhibited both biofilm
          formation and quorum sensing in S. aureus. Quorum sensing is a
          signaling system that staph bacteria use to manufacture toxins
          and ramp up virulence. Blocking this system essentially
          "disarms" the bacteria...<br>

          <div align="center"><b>How to enhance or suppress memories</b><br>
            <i>Stimulating different parts of the brain can dial up or
              down a specific memory's emotional oomph, study shows</i><i><br>
            </i></div>
          <br>
          What if scientists could manipulate your brain so that a
          traumatic memory lost its emotional power over your psyche?
          Steve Ramirez, a Boston University neuroscientist fascinated
          by memory, believes that a small structure in the brain could
          hold the keys to future therapeutic techniques for treating
          depression, anxiety, and PTSD, someday allowing clinicians to
          enhance positive memories or suppress negative ones.<br>
          <br>
          Inside our brains, a cashew-shaped structure called the
          hippocampus stores the sensory and emotional information that
          makes up memories, whether they be positive or negative ones.
          No two memories are exactly alike, and likewise, each memory
          we have is stored inside a unique combination of brain cells
          that contain all the environmental and emotional information
          associated with that memory. The hippocampus itself, although
          small, comprises many different subregions all working in
          tandem to recall the elements of a specific memory.<br>
          <br>
          Now, in a new paper in Current Biology, Ramirez and a team of
          collaborators have shown just how pliable memory is if you
          know which regions of the hippocampus to stimulate -- which
          could someday enable personalized treatment for people haunted
          by particularly troubling memories.<br>
          <br>
          "Many psychiatric disorders, especially PTSD, are based on the
          idea that after there's a really traumatic experience, the
          person isn't able to move on because they recall their fear
          over and over again," says Briana Chen, first author of the
          paper, who is currently a graduate researcher studying
          depression at Columbia University.<br>
          <br>
          In their study, Chen and Ramirez, the paper's senior author,
          show how traumatic memories -- such as those at the root of
          disorders like PTSD -- can become so emotionally loaded. By
          artificially activating memory cells in the bottom part of the
          brain's hippocampus, negative memories can become even more
          debilitating. In contrast, stimulating memory cells in the top
          part of the hippocampus can strip bad memories of their
          emotional oomph, making them less traumatic to remember.<br>
          <br>
          Well, at least if you're a mouse.<br>
          <br>
          Using a technique called optogenetics, Chen and Ramirez mapped
          out which cells in the hippocampus were being activated when
          male mice made new memories of positive, neutral, and negative
          experiences. A positive experience, for example, could be
          exposure to a female mouse. In contrast, a negative experience
          could be receiving a startling but mild electrical zap to the
          feet. Then, identifying which cells were part of the
          memory-making process (which they did with the help of a
          glowing green protein designed to literally light up when
          cells are activated), they were able to artificially trigger
          those specific memories again later, using laser light to
          activate the memory cells.<br>
          <br>
          Their studies reveal just how different the roles of the top
          and bottom parts of the hippocampus are. Activating the top of
          the hippocampus seems to function like effective exposure
          therapy, deadening the trauma of reliving bad memories. But
          activating the bottom part of the hippocampus can impart
          lasting fear and anxiety-related behavioral changes, hinting
          that this part of the brain could be overactive when memories
          become so emotionally charged that they are debilitating.<br>
          <br>
          That distinction, Ramirez says, is critical. He says that it
          suggests suppressing overactivity in the bottom part of the
          hippocampus could potentially be used to treat PTSD and
          anxiety disorders. It could also be the key to enhancing
          cognitive skills, "like Limitless," he says, referencing the
          2011 film starring Bradley Cooper in which the main character
          takes special pills that drastically improve his memory and
          brain function.<br>
          <br>
          "The field of memory manipulation is still young.... It sounds
          like sci-fi but this study is a sneak preview of what's to
          come in terms of our abilities to artificially enhance or
          suppress memories," says Ramirez, a BU College of Arts &amp;
          Sciences assistant professor of psychological and brain
          sciences. Although the study got its start while Chen and
          Ramirez were both doing research at Massachusetts Institute of
          Technology, its data has been the backbone of the first paper
          to come out of the new laboratory group that Ramirez
          established at BU in 2017.<br>
          <br>
          "We're a long way from being able to do this in humans, but
          the proof of concept is here," Chen says. "As Steve likes to
          say, 'never say never.' Nothing is impossible."<br>
          <br>
          "This is the first step in teasing apart what these [brain]
          regions do to these really emotional memories.... The first
          step toward translating this to people, which is the holy
          grail," says memory researcher Sheena Josselyn, a University
          of Toronto neuroscientist who was not involved in this study.
          "[Steve's] group is really unique in trying to see how the
          brain stores memories with the goal being to help people...
          they're not just playing around but doing it for a purpose."<br>
          <br>
          Although mouse brains and human brains are very different,
          Ramirez, who is also a member of the BU Center for Systems
          Neuroscience and the Center for Memory and Brain, says that
          learning how these fundamental principles play out in mice is
          helping his team map out a blueprint of how memory works in
          people. Being able to activate specific memories on demand, as
          well as targeted areas of the brain involved in memory, allows
          the researchers to see exactly what side effects come along
          with different areas of the brain being overstimulated.<br>
          <br>
          "Let's use what we're learning in mice to make predictions
          about how memory functions in humans," he says. "If we can
          create a two-way street to compare how memory works in mice
          and in humans, we can then ask specific questions [in mice]
          about how and why memories can have positive or negative
          effects on psychological health."<br>

              Dumber, Study Finds</b><br>
            <b>by Tyler Durden</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Western Europe is home to a cluster of developed economies
          that boost some of the highest standards of living in the
          world. But that could soon change. Because as Evan Horowitz
          writes on NBC News's new "Think" vertical, IQ scores in
          France, Scandinavia, Britain, Germany and even Australia are
          beginning to decline.<br>
          <br>
          The trend has been well-documented across Western Europe, and
          could soon carry over to the US as well. Which means the data
          have confirmed what millions of Americans who have watched
          cable news or logged on to twitter over the past three years
          probably already suspected: The world is getting dumber.<br>
          <br>
          And just like that, another sign of the 'Idiocracy' apocalypse
          has emerged. Though, unlike the movie, which posits that the
          population of Earth will become steadily dumber as stupid
          people outbreed their more intelligent compatriots, the cause
          of the trend in Europe has yet to be determined, because even
          the children of relatively intelligent Europeans are getting
          dumber.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Details vary from study to study and from
          place to place given the available data. IQ shortfalls in
          Norway and Denmark appear in longstanding tests of military
          conscripts, whereas information about France is based on a
          smaller sample and a different test. But the broad pattern has
          become clearer: Beginning around the turn of the 21st century,
          many of the most economically advanced nations began
          experiencing some kind of decline in IQ.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One potential explanation was
          quasi-eugenic. As in the movie "Idiocracy," it was suggested
          that average intelligence is being pulled down because
          lower-IQ families are having more children ("dysgenic
          fertility" is the technical term). Alternatively, widening
          immigration might be bringing less-intelligent newcomers to
          societies with otherwise higher IQs.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, a 2018 study of Norway has
          punctured these theories by showing that IQs are dropping not
          just across societies but within families. In other words, the
          issue is not that educated Norwegians are increasingly
          outnumbered by lower-IQ immigrants or the children of
          less-educated citizens. Even children born to high-IQ parents
          are slipping down the IQ ladder.<br>
          <br>
          Possible explanations include: The rise of smartphones and
          other devices, which have worn away at our ability to focus,
          the rise of lower-skill service work that isn't as
          intellectually stimulating and less-nutritious food.<br>
          <br>
          Whatever the cause, the trend seems to portend a decline in
          long-term productivity and economic success, factors that have
          long been correlated with IQ.<br>
          <br>
          But for now, at least, readers can find contentment in the
          knowledge that it's not just us: Everybody really is getting
          dumber. <br>

            Researchers at Tampere University have shown for the first
            time that the cerebral emboli of stroke patients contain DNA
            from oral pathogens. The research article has been published
            in the Journal of American Heart Association.<br>
            <br>
          </b>The researchers analysed thrombus aspirates, which
          neurointerventional radiologists removed from 75 stroke
          patients as part of emergency treatment. The samples were
          studied by duplicating bacterial DNA, showing that 79 % of the
          aspirates contained DNA from bacteria that came from the
          teeth.<br>
          <br>
          The study is part of a research project at Tampere University,
          which for ten years has been investigating the effects of
          bacterial infection in the development of cardiovascular
          diseases. The research group has previously shown that the
          same odontogenic bacteria are present in the coronary artery
          stenoses of patients who have suddenly died, the thrombus
          aspirates and arterial blood of myocardial infarction
          patients, ruptured cerebral aneurysms and the thrombus
          aspirates of patients with lower limb arterial and venous
          thrombosis.<br>
          <br>
          Cerebral artery thrombosis causes 87 % of strokes. Most
          thrombi originate in carotid artery stenoses from where they
          travel to block cerebral circulation.<br>
          <br>
          The results showed that a large amount of DNA from
          streptococcus viridans -- normal bacteria in the mouth -- was
          found in cerebral thrombi compared with normal blood samples
          from the same patients. In the oral cavity, streptococci are
          harmless, but when entering circulation, they might cause,
          among other things, infections of the cardiac valves. The
          streptococcus bacteria can directly bind to various platelet
          receptors, making the patient more prone to blood clots.<br>
          <br>
          The research shows that oral health and good dental hygiene
          are of much greater importance to health than previously
          known, and that untreated dental infections can cause serious
          health damage or even death.<br>

            Abstract<br>
            Background<br>
          </b>Chronic infections have been reported to be risk factors
          for both coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke. DNA of
          oral bacteria, mainly from the viridans streptococci group,
          has been detected in coronary thrombus aspirates of myocardial
          infarction and cerebral aneurysms. Viridans streptococci are
          known to cause infective endocarditis and possess thrombogenic
          properties. We studied the presence of oral bacterial DNA in
          thrombus aspirates of patients with acute ischemic stroke
          treated with mechanical thrombectomy.<b><br>
            <br>
            Methods and Results<br>
          </b>Thrombus aspirates and arterial blood were taken from 75
          patients (69% men; mean age, 67 years) with acute ischemic
          stroke. The presence of Streptococcus species, mainly the
          Streptococcus mitis group, belonging to viridans streptococci
          as well as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter
          actinomycetemcomitans in samples were determined using a
          quantitative polymerase chain reaction with specific primers
          and probes. The relative amount of bacterial DNA in a sample
          was determined with the comparative threshold cycle method.
          Bacterial DNA was detected in 84% (n=63) of aspired thrombi,
          and 16% (n=12) of samples were considered bacterial DNA
          negative. DNA of Streptococcus species, mainly the S mitis
          group, was found in 79% (n=59) of samples. The median relative
          amount of Streptococcus species DNA was 5.10-fold higher
          compared with the control blood samples from the same
          patients. All thrombi were negative for both P gingivalis and
          A actinomycetemcomitans.<br>
          <b><br>
            Conclusions<br>
          </b>This is the first study showing the common presence of
          bacterial DNA from viridans streptococci in aspired thrombi of
          patients with acute ischemic stroke. Streptococcal bacteria,
          mostly of oral origin, may contribute to the progression and
          thrombotic events of cerebrovascular diseases.<br>

              drug-resistant bacteria in lab tests</b><br>
            <b>Confederate field hospitals turned to traditional
              remedies under Union blockade</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
            Summary:<br>
          </b>A new study based on a mostly forgotten guide to medicinal
          plants, 'Resources of the Southern Fields and Forests,'
          focuses on three of the plants and shows they inhibit bacteria
          associated with wound infections. <br>
          <br>
          During the height of the Civil War, the Confederate Surgeon
          General commissioned a guide to traditional plant remedies of
          the South, as battlefield physicians faced high rates of
          infections among the wounded and shortages of conventional
          medicines. A new study of three of the plants from this guide
          -- the white oak, the tulip poplar and the devil's walking
          stick -- finds that they have antiseptic properties.<br>
          <br>
          Scientific Reports is publishing the results of the study led
          by scientists at Emory University. The results show that
          extracts from the plants have antimicrobial activity against
          one or more of a trio of dangerous species of
          multi-drug-resistant bacteria associated with wound
          infections: Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus and
          Klebsiella pneumoniae.<br>
          <br>
          "Our findings suggest that the use of these topical therapies
          may have saved some limbs, and maybe even lives, during the
          Civil War," says Cassandra Quave, senior author of the paper
          and assistant professor at Emory's Center for the Study of
          Human Health and the School of Medicine's Department of
          Dermatology.<br>
          <br>
          Quave is an ethnobotanist, studying how people use plants in
          traditional healing practices, to uncover promising candidates
          for new drugs. "Ethnobotany is essentially the science of
          survival -- how people get by when limited to what's available
          in their immediate environment," she says. "The Civil War
          guide to plant remedies is a great example of that."<br>
          <br>
          "Our research might one day benefit modern wound care, if we
          can identify which compounds are responsible for the
          antimicrobial activity," adds Micah Dettweiler, the first
          author of the paper.<br>
          <br>
          If the active ingredients are identified, "it is my hope that
          we can then [further] test these molecules in our
          world-renowned models of bacterial infection," says co-author
          Daniel Zurawski, chief of pathogenesis and virulence for the
          Wound Infections Department at the Walter Reed Army Institute
          of Research.<br>
          <br>
          "I've always been a Civil War buff," Zurawski adds. "I am also
          a firm believer in learning everything we can garner from the
          past so we can benefit now from the knowledge and wisdom of
          our ancestors."<br>
          <br>
          Additional co-authors on the paper include Ryan Reddinger,
          from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research; James Lyles,
          from the Quave lab; and Kate Nelson, from Emory School of
          Medicine's Department of Dermatology.<br>
          <br>
          Dettweiler was still an Emory undergraduate when he heard
          about the Civil War plant guide and decided to research it for
          his honors thesis. He has since graduated with a degree in
          biology and now works as a research specialist in the Quave
          lab.<br>
          <br>
          "I was surprised to learn that far more Civil War soldiers
          died from disease than in battle," he says. "I was also
          surprised at how common amputation was as a medical treatment
          for an infected wound."<br>
          <br>
          About one in 13 surviving Civil War soldiers went home with
          one or more missing limbs, according to the American
          Battlefield Trust.<br>
          <br>
          At the time of the Civil War, from 1861 to 1865, germ theory
          was in its developmental stages and only gradually beginning
          to gain acceptance. Formal medical training for physicians was
          also in its infancy. An antiseptic was simply defined as a
          tonic used to prevent "mortification of the flesh." Iodine and
          bromine were sometimes used to treat infections, according to
          the National Museum of Civil War Medicine, although the reason
          for their effectiveness was unknown.<br>
          <br>
          Other conventional medicines available at the time included
          quinine, for treating malaria, and morphine and chloroform, to
          block pain.<br>
          <br>
          Military field hospitals within the Confederacy, however, did
          not have reliable access to these medicines due to a blockade
          -- the Union Navy closely monitored the major ports of the
          South to prevent the Confederacy from trading.<br>
          <br>
          Seeking alternatives, the Confederacy commissioned Francis
          Porcher, a botanist and surgeon from South Carolina, to
          compile a book of medicinal plants of the Southern states,
          including plant remedies used by Native Americans and enslaved
          Africans. "Resources of the Southern Fields and Forests,"
          published in 1863, was a major compendium of uses for
          different plants, including a description of 37 species for
          treating gangrene and other infections. Samuel Moore, the
          Confederate Surgeon General, drew from Porcher's work to
          produce a document called "Standard supply table of the
          indigenous remedies for field service and the sick in general
          hospitals."<br>
          <br>
          For the current study, the researchers focused on three plant
          species Porcher cited for antiseptic use that grow in
          Lullwater Preserve on the Emory campus. They included two
          common hardwood trees -- the white oak (Quercus alba) and the
          tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) -- as well as a thorny,
          woody shrub commonly known as the devil's walking stick
          (Aralia spinosa).<br>
          <br>
          Samples of these three plants were gathered from campus
          specimens, based on Porcher's specifications. Extracts were
          taken from white oak bark and galls; tulip poplar leaves, root
          inner bark and branch bark; and the devil's walking stick
          leaves. The extracts were then tested on three species of
          multi-drug-resistant bacteria commonly found in wound
          infections.<br>
          <br>
          Aceinetobacter baumannii -- better known as "Iraqibacter" due
          to its association with wounded combat troops returning from
          the Iraq War -- exhibits extensive resistance to most
          first-line antibiotics. "It's emerging as a major threat for
          soldiers recovering from battle wounds and for hospitals in
          general," Quave says.<br>
          <br>
          Staphylococcus aureus is considered the most dangerous of many
          common staph bacteria and can spread from skin infections or
          medical devices through the bloodstream and infect distant
          organs. Klebsiella pneumoniae is another leading cause of
          hospital infection and can result in life-threatening cases of
          pneumonia and septic shock.<br>
          <br>
          Laboratory tests showed that extracts from the white oak and
          tulip poplar inhibited the growth of S. aureus, while the
          white oak extracts also inhibited the growth of A. baumannii
          and K. pneumoniae. Extracts from both of these plants also
          inhibited S. aureus from forming biofilms, which can act like
          a shield against antibiotics.<br>
          <br>
          Extracts from the devil's walking stick inhibited both biofilm
          formation and quorum sensing in S. aureus. Quorum sensing is a
          signaling system that staph bacteria use to manufacture toxins
          and ramp up virulence. Blocking this system essentially
          "disarms" the bacteria...<br>

          <div align="center"><b>How to enhance or suppress memories</b><br>
            <i>Stimulating different parts of the brain can dial up or
              down a specific memory's emotional oomph, study shows</i><i><br>
            </i><br>
          </div>
          What if scientists could manipulate your brain so that a
          traumatic memory lost its emotional power over your psyche?
          Steve Ramirez, a Boston University neuroscientist fascinated
          by memory, believes that a small structure in the brain could
          hold the keys to future therapeutic techniques for treating
          depression, anxiety, and PTSD, someday allowing clinicians to
          enhance positive memories or suppress negative ones.<br>
          <br>
          Inside our brains, a cashew-shaped structure called the
          hippocampus stores the sensory and emotional information that
          makes up memories, whether they be positive or negative ones.
          No two memories are exactly alike, and likewise, each memory
          we have is stored inside a unique combination of brain cells
          that contain all the environmental and emotional information
          associated with that memory. The hippocampus itself, although
          small, comprises many different subregions all working in
          tandem to recall the elements of a specific memory.<br>
          <br>
          Now, in a new paper in Current Biology, Ramirez and a team of
          collaborators have shown just how pliable memory is if you
          know which regions of the hippocampus to stimulate -- which
          could someday enable personalized treatment for people haunted
          by particularly troubling memories.<br>
          <br>
          "Many psychiatric disorders, especially PTSD, are based on the
          idea that after there's a really traumatic experience, the
          person isn't able to move on because they recall their fear
          over and over again," says Briana Chen, first author of the
          paper, who is currently a graduate researcher studying
          depression at Columbia University.<br>
          <br>
          In their study, Chen and Ramirez, the paper's senior author,
          show how traumatic memories -- such as those at the root of
          disorders like PTSD -- can become so emotionally loaded. By
          artificially activating memory cells in the bottom part of the
          brain's hippocampus, negative memories can become even more
          debilitating. In contrast, stimulating memory cells in the top
          part of the hippocampus can strip bad memories of their
          emotional oomph, making them less traumatic to remember.<br>
          <br>
          Well, at least if you're a mouse.<br>
          <br>
          Using a technique called optogenetics, Chen and Ramirez mapped
          out which cells in the hippocampus were being activated when
          male mice made new memories of positive, neutral, and negative
          experiences. A positive experience, for example, could be
          exposure to a female mouse. In contrast, a negative experience
          could be receiving a startling but mild electrical zap to the
          feet. Then, identifying which cells were part of the
          memory-making process (which they did with the help of a
          glowing green protein designed to literally light up when
          cells are activated), they were able to artificially trigger
          those specific memories again later, using laser light to
          activate the memory cells.<br>
          <br>
          Their studies reveal just how different the roles of the top
          and bottom parts of the hippocampus are. Activating the top of
          the hippocampus seems to function like effective exposure
          therapy, deadening the trauma of reliving bad memories. But
          activating the bottom part of the hippocampus can impart
          lasting fear and anxiety-related behavioral changes, hinting
          that this part of the brain could be overactive when memories
          become so emotionally charged that they are debilitating.<br>
          <br>
          That distinction, Ramirez says, is critical. He says that it
          suggests suppressing overactivity in the bottom part of the
          hippocampus could potentially be used to treat PTSD and
          anxiety disorders. It could also be the key to enhancing
          cognitive skills, "like Limitless," he says, referencing the
          2011 film starring Bradley Cooper in which the main character
          takes special pills that drastically improve his memory and
          brain function.<br>
          <br>
          "The field of memory manipulation is still young.... It sounds
          like sci-fi but this study is a sneak preview of what's to
          come in terms of our abilities to artificially enhance or
          suppress memories," says Ramirez, a BU College of Arts &amp;
          Sciences assistant professor of psychological and brain
          sciences. Although the study got its start while Chen and
          Ramirez were both doing research at Massachusetts Institute of
          Technology, its data has been the backbone of the first paper
          to come out of the new laboratory group that Ramirez
          established at BU in 2017.<br>
          <br>
          "We're a long way from being able to do this in humans, but
          the proof of concept is here," Chen says. "As Steve likes to
          say, 'never say never.' Nothing is impossible."<br>
          <br>
          "This is the first step in teasing apart what these [brain]
          regions do to these really emotional memories.... The first
          step toward translating this to people, which is the holy
          grail," says memory researcher Sheena Josselyn, a University
          of Toronto neuroscientist who was not involved in this study.
          "[Steve's] group is really unique in trying to see how the
          brain stores memories with the goal being to help people...
          they're not just playing around but doing it for a purpose."<br>
          <br>
          Although mouse brains and human brains are very different,
          Ramirez, who is also a member of the BU Center for Systems
          Neuroscience and the Center for Memory and Brain, says that
          learning how these fundamental principles play out in mice is
          helping his team map out a blueprint of how memory works in
          people. Being able to activate specific memories on demand, as
          well as targeted areas of the brain involved in memory, allows
          the researchers to see exactly what side effects come along
          with different areas of the brain being overstimulated.<br>
          <br>
          "Let's use what we're learning in mice to make predictions
          about how memory functions in humans," he says. "If we can
          create a two-way street to compare how memory works in mice
          and in humans, we can then ask specific questions [in mice]
          about how and why memories can have positive or negative
          effects on psychological health."<br>

              Dumber, Study Finds</b><br>
            <b>by Tyler Durden</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>Western Europe is home to a cluster of developed economies
          that boost some of the highest standards of living in the
          world. But that could soon change. Because as Evan Horowitz
          writes on NBC News's new "Think" vertical, IQ scores in
          France, Scandinavia, Britain, Germany and even Australia are
          beginning to decline.<br>
          <br>
          The trend has been well-documented across Western Europe, and
          could soon carry over to the US as well. Which means the data
          have confirmed what millions of Americans who have watched
          cable news or logged on to twitter over the past three years
          probably already suspected: The world is getting dumber.<br>
          <br>
          And just like that, another sign of the 'Idiocracy' apocalypse
          has emerged. Though, unlike the movie, which posits that the
          population of Earth will become steadily dumber as stupid
          people outbreed their more intelligent compatriots, the cause
          of the trend in Europe has yet to be determined, because even
          the children of relatively intelligent Europeans are getting
          dumber.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Details vary from study to study and from
          place to place given the available data. IQ shortfalls in
          Norway and Denmark appear in longstanding tests of military
          conscripts, whereas information about France is based on a
          smaller sample and a different test. But the broad pattern has
          become clearer: Beginning around the turn of the 21st century,
          many of the most economically advanced nations began
          experiencing some kind of decline in IQ.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One potential explanation was
          quasi-eugenic. As in the movie "Idiocracy," it was suggested
          that average intelligence is being pulled down because
          lower-IQ families are having more children ("dysgenic
          fertility" is the technical term). Alternatively, widening
          immigration might be bringing less-intelligent newcomers to
          societies with otherwise higher IQs.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, a 2018 study of Norway has
          punctured these theories by showing that IQs are dropping not
          just across societies but within families. In other words, the
          issue is not that educated Norwegians are increasingly
          outnumbered by lower-IQ immigrants or the children of
          less-educated citizens. Even children born to high-IQ parents
          are slipping down the IQ ladder.<br>
          <br>
          Possible explanations include: The rise of smartphones and
          other devices, which have worn away at our ability to focus,
          the rise of lower-skill service work that isn't as
          intellectually stimulating and less-nutritious food.<br>
          <br>
          Whatever the cause, the trend seems to portend a decline in
          long-term productivity and economic success, factors that have
          long been correlated with IQ.<br>
          <br>
          But for now, at least, readers can find contentment in the
          knowledge that it's not just us: Everybody really is getting
          dumber. <br>
