                      professor in Tennessee.<br>
                      <br>
                      Hadhi says Christians are “shirk” and “evil” and
                      Muslims can take their property.<br>
                      <br>
                      This prominent Muslim tells his supporters are
                      “filthy” and “impure.”<br>
                      <br>
                      Cofda reported:<br>
                      <br>
                      "Yasir Qadhi (aka Abu Ammaar Yasir Kazi) is an
                      American imam and college professor who is
                      described by a 2011 New York Times Magazine essay
                      as “one of the most influential conservative
                      clerics in American Islam.”<br>
                      <br>
                      "In his sermon/lecture in the YouTube audio below,
                      Qadhi begins by calling Christians “shirk” for
                      being “polythesists” who believe in the Triune God
                      (three persons in one God), instead of Islam’s
                      “monotheist” god Allah.<br>
                      <br>
                      "Then Qadhi really steps up his verbal abuse. He
                      says, since “there is no deity worthy of worship
                      except Allah wuzza wuzza,” Christians are “by
                      necessity and by definition … the most evil of all
                      evils.” Like all “unbelievers” and “polytheists,”
                      Christians are “filthy.” They are “najusa” (feces,
                      urine) — “a filthy impure dirty substance.”<br>
                      <br>
                      "Qadhi declares that the prophet Mohammad — and by
                      extension all Muslims — “has been commanded to do
                      jihad.”<br>
                      <br>
                      "What is jihad?<br>
                      <br>
                      "Jihad “is a means to establish monotheism on the
                      land.” The prophet had said, “I have been
                      commanded to fight the people until they” convert
                      to Islam. But “if they don’t [convert to Islam,]
                      their life and property are halal [free for the
                      taking] for the Muslims.”<br>

                      color="#000000">The Finnish government is getting
                      serious about the idea of a national basic income.
                      It has commissioned KELA, the national social
                      insurance provider, to study the concept,
                      calculate the costs, and run an experiment in 2017
                      to judge the feasibility of rolling it out across
                      the country. If, eventually, the government were
                      to approve of such a plan, Finland could scrap all
                      existing benefits and instead hand out a monthly
                      stipend to everyone. According to some reports,
                      the monthly payment could be €800 ($870).<br>
                      <br>
                      Whereas several Dutch cities will introduce basic
                      income next year and Switzerland is holding a
                      referendum on the subject, there is strongest
                      political and public support for the idea in
                      Finland.<br>
                      <br>
                      A poll commissioned by KELA showed that 69%
                      support (link in Finnish) a basic income plan.
                      Prime minister Juha Sipilä is in favor of the idea
                      and he’s backed by most of the major political
                      parties. “For me, a basic income means simplifying
                      the social security system,” he says.<br>
                      <br>
                      But for those outside Finland, the plan raises two
                      obvious questions: Why is this a good idea, and
                      how will it work?<br>
                      <br>
                      It may sound counterintuitive, but the proposal is
                      meant to tackle unemployment. Finland’s
                      unemployment rate is at a 15-year high and a basic
                      income would allow people to take on low-paying
                      jobs without personal cost. At the moment, a
                      temporary job results in lower welfare benefits,
                      which can lead to an overall drop in income.<br>
                      <br>
                      Previous experiments have shown that universal
                      basic income can have a positive effect. Everyone
                      in the Canadian town of Dauphin was given a
                      stipend from 1974 to 1979, and though there was a
                      drop in working hours, this was mainly because men
                      spent more time in school and women took longer
                      maternity leaves. Meanwhile, when thousands of
                      unemployed people in Uganda were given
                      unsupervised grants of twice their monthly income,
                      working hours increased by 17% and earnings
                      increased by 38%.<br>
                      <br>
                      One of the major downsides, of course, is the cost
                      of handing out money to so many people. Liisa
                      Hyssälä, director general of KELA, has said that
                      the plan will save the government millions. But,
                      as Bloomberg calculated, giving €800 of basic
                      income to the population of 5.4 million every
                      month would cost €52.2 billion a year. Finland
                      only plans to give the basic income to adults, not
                      every citizen, but with around 4.9 million adults
                      in Finland, this would still cost €46.7 billion
                      per year. The government expects to have €49.1
                      billion in revenue in 2016.<br>
                      <br>
                      Another serious consideration is that some people
                      may be worse off under the plan. As a proposal
                      hasn’t been published yet, it’s not yet known
                      exactly who might lose out. But those who
                      currently receive housing support or disability
                      benefits could conceivably end up with less under
                      national basic income, since the plan calls for
                      scrapping existing benefits. And as national basic
                      income would only give a monthly allowance to
                      adults, a single mother of three could struggle to
                      support herself compared to, for example, a
                      neighbor with the same government support but no
                      children and a part-time job.<br>
                      <br>
                      Finally, this raises the question of whether it’s
                      really fair to give a relatively better off
                      individual the same amount of welfare as someone
                      who’s truly struggling. Finland’s constitution
                      insists that all citizens must be equal, though,
                      of course, equality can be interpreted in many
                      different ways. So far, there’s no definitive
                      answer as to whether national basic income will
                      create a more or less equal society.<br>
                      <br>
                      Correction (Dec. 5): An earlier version of this
                      article questioned whether it was fair for
                      millionaires to get the same level of welfare as
                      those who are struggling. As wealthier people
                      still pay tax, a millionaire would technically get
                      €800 per month but would not get net support from
                      the government. The article also cited
                      non-seasonally adjusted unemployment data, which
                      has been changed to the seasonally adjusted
                      figures, and stated the cost of providing basic
                      income for every citizen rather than every adult.<br>
                      <br>
                      Correction (Dec. 8): An earlier version of this
                      article did not explain that KELA is conducting a
                      study to explore the possibility of a implementing
                      a basic income program. There is no government
                      plan to introduce a basic income for all adults at
                      this time.</font></small></big></font></small></big></font><b><font

                      Baba Vanga, a famous Bulgarian prophetess, died 13
                      years back, on August 11, 1996.<br>
                      <br>
                      The people, who were close to Vanga, can still
                      tell a lot of interesting stories about the
                      legendary mystic.<br>
                      Vanga’s niece, Krasimira Stoyanova said that Vanga
                      could contact the dead. The prophetess herself
                      said once that she could sense their presence by
                      the burning of the tip of her tongue. Then a kind
                      of a cloud would envelop her brain. While Vanga
                      was contacting the dead she seemed to be absent
                      from this world.<br>
                      <br>
                      Vanga would mentally ask questions to the souls of
                      the dead, and they would answer. If the spirits
                      had no answers, she heard some remote voice that
                      came to the aid. The voice sounded as if she was
                      speaking to someone on the phone. The stranger
                      spoke either very loudly or so softly, that she
                      had to repeat her questions.<br>
                      As for contacting extraterrestrial civilizations,
                      Krasimira said that she had preserved a list of
                      questions, which Vanga answered concerning the
                      aliens. Bellow are a few excerpts from it:<br>
                      <br>
                      “Will humans contact with brothers in mind from
                      other civilizations?”<br>
                      <br>
                      “Yes. In 200 years.”<br>
                      <br>
                      As for contacting extraterrestrial civilizations,
                      Krasimira said that she had preserved a list of
                      questions, which Vanga answered concerning the
                      aliens. Bellow are a few excerpts from it:<br>
                      <br>
                      “Will humans contact with brothers in mind from
                      other civilizations?”<br>
                      <br>
                      “Yes. In 200 years.”<br>
                      <br>
                      “Is it true that alien spaceships visit Earth?”<br>
                      <br>
                      “It is true.”<br>
                      <br>
                      “Where do they come from?”<br>
                      <br>
                      “They come from the planet, which in their
                      language is called Vamfim. It is the third planet
                      from the Earth. They say that they prepare a great
                      event but do not give any details of it.”<br>
                      <br>
                      About one year prior to her death rumours about
                      the arrival of extraterrestrial beings began to
                      ooze. A number of Bulgarian newspapers even
                      revealed the date, when it was going to happen,
                      although it did not. Several weeks later Vanga
                      invited her good friend, a journalist, Boyka
                      Tsvetkova. Bellow are some of the notes from her
                      writing pad.<br>
                      <br>
                      Vanga: “Do you remember the clamor about the
                      aliens?”<br>
                      <br>
                      Boyka: “I remember but they did not arrive.”<br>
                      <br>
                      Vanga: “They arrived, but last night, I noticed
                      them standing at my door, beautiful, well-shaped.”<br>
                      <br>
                      Boyka: “Were you frightened?”<br>
                      <br>
                      Vanga: “Why would I? We had a nice conversation
                      and off they went.<br>
                      <br>
                      Boyka: “Did anyone else saw them?”<br>
                      <br>
                      Vanga: “Who else could see them if they visited
                      me? Vitka (Vanga’s helpmate) might have seen
                      them.”<br>
                      <br>
                      Unfortunately, Boyka did not ask, what the aliens
                      had come for.<br>
                      <br>
                      At the beginning of 1993 the prophetess predicted
                      that the USSR would revive during the first
                      quarter of the XXI century, and that Bulgaria
                      would be a part of it. Many people capable of
                      changing the world will be born in Russia,
                      according to Vanga.<br>
                      <br>
                      In 1994 she predicted: “A day will come and cancer
                      will be chained in iron! A cure, which shall cure
                      people from this illness, must contain the iron,
                      because this element is decreasing in the human
                      organism.”<br>
                      <br>
                      She also considered that “In the future a drug (as
                      in cure) will be discovered, which is very needed
                      for the recovery of human health. It will be made
                      from the hormones of horses, dogs and turtles. The
                      horse is strong, the dog is resistant, and the
                      turtle lives long,” she said.<br>
                      <br>
                      Shortly before her death Vanga suddenly pronounced
                      the following mysterious words:<br>
                      <br>
                      “The time of miracles will come and science will
                      make major discoveries in the field of the
                      non-material. Until 1990 we will witness the
                      amazing archaeological discoveries that will
                      radically change our knowledge about the world.”</font></small></big></font></small></big></font><b><font

                      An important and a serious question, “Does Allah
                      of Islam, allow Muslims in the Quran, to eat human
                      flesh?”<br>
                      <br>
                      The answer is very clearly, “Yes”.<br>
                      <br>
                      Read the following two verses in the Quran,<br>
                      <br>
                      (1) Quran (2: 173): “He hath only forbidden you
                      dead meat, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and
                      that on which any other name hath been invoked
                      besides that of Allah. But if one is forced by
                      necessity, without wilful disobedience, nor
                      transgressing due limits,- then is he guiltless.
                      For Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful” (Surah
                      The Cow 2:173).<br>
                      <br>
                      (2) Quran (16: 115): “He has only forbidden you
                      dead meat, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and
                      any (food) over which the name of other than Allah
                      has been invoked. But if one is forced by
                      necessity, without wilful disobedience, nor
                      transgressing due limits,- then Allah is
                      Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” (Surah The Bee
                      16:115).<br>

                      Bin Ahmad Ben Abi Bakr Farag Al-Ansari Al-Kortoby
                      who died in the Islamic year 671. It is published

                      <br>
                      He said in page 3, “In the name of Allah the
                      merciful and compassionate, this book is published

                      El-Araby, Cairo”.<br>
                      <br>
                      He continues, “This edition is corrected, edited
                      and certified by the “Council of Islamic Research
                      of Al-Azhar”, who published it in 9 November,
                      1988, 29 Rabie I of the Islamic year 1409.<br>
                      <br>
                      In page 716 in volume 1, Al-Kortoby gives these
                      comments, “If one is in dire need and found a dead
                      body of an animal, a swine, or of human, he might
                      eat the dead animal because it as “Halal” (lawful
                      or permissible), but not the body of a swine or a
                      human”. There is a light prevention and a strong
                      prevention, and these are the rules, such as one
                      hates to have sexual relation with his sister, but
                      can have a sexual relation with a foreigner
                      because it is lawful for him. This is the
                      condition for theses rules. Eating the flesh of a
                      human is not allowed.<br>
                      <br>
                      Yet the scholars Ahmad and Dawoud protested by
                      saying that prophet Mohammad said, “Breaking the
                      bones of a dead body is like breaking the bones of
                      a live body. Al-Shafie said, “One may eat the
                      flesh of a human body. It is not allowed to kill a
                      Muslim nor a free non-Muslim under Muslim rule
                      (because he is useful for the society), nor a
                      prisoner because he belongs to other Muslims. But
                      you may kill an enemy fighter or an adulterer and
                      eat his body”.<br>
                      <br>
                      Dawoud slandered Al-Mozny by addressing Al-Mozny
                      saying, “You allowed eating the flesh of the
                      prophets”. Ibn Sharie responded also to Al-Mozny
                      by saying, “You allowed killing the prophets and
                      did not allow eating the flesh of the infidels”.<br>
                      <br>
                      &nbsp;Ibn Al-Araby said, “The proper thing for me
                      is not to eat human flesh unless the person makes
                      sure that this act saves him from starving to
                      death and Allah knows best”.<br>

                      study, to appear in the Fall 2014 issue of the
                      academic journal Perspectives on Politics, finds
                      that the U.S. is no democracy, but instead an
                      oligarchy, meaning profoundly corrupt, so that the
                      answer to the study’s opening question, "Who
                      governs? Who really rules?" in this country, is: <br>
                      <br>
                      "Despite the seemingly strong empirical support in
                      previous studies for theories of majoritarian
                      democracy, our analyses suggest that majorities of
                      the American public actually have little influence
                      over the policies our government adopts. Americans
                      do enjoy many features central to democratic
                      governance, such as regular elections, freedom of
                      speech and association, and a widespread (if still
                      contested) franchise. But, ..." and then they go
                      on to say, it's not true, and that, "America's
                      claims to being a democratic society are seriously
                      threatened" by the findings in this, the
                      first-ever comprehensive scientific study of the
                      subject, which shows that there is instead "the
                      nearly total failure of 'median voter' and other
                      Majoritarian Electoral Democracy theories [of
                      America]. When the preferences of economic elites
                      and the stands of organized interest groups are
                      controlled for, the preferences of the average
                      American appear to have only a minuscule,
                      near-zero, statistically non-significant impact
                      upon public policy."<br>
                      <br>
                      To put it short: The United States is no
                      democracy, but actually an oligarchy.<br>
                      <br>
                      The authors of this historically important study
                      are Martin Gilens and Benjamin I. Page, and their
                      article is titled "Testing Theories of American
                      Politics." The authors clarify that the data
                      available are probably under-representing the
                      actual extent of control of the U.S. by the

                      theories do rather well in our analysis, even
                      though our findings probably understate the
                      political influence of elites. Our measure of the
                      preferences of wealthy or elite Americans – though
                      useful, and the best we could generate for a large
                      set of policy cases – is probably less consistent
                      with the relevant preferences than are our
                      measures of the views of ordinary citizens or the
                      alignments of engaged interest groups. Yet we
                      found substantial estimated effects even when
                      using this imperfect measure. The real-world
                      impact of elites upon public policy may be still
                      greater."<br>
                      <br>
                      Nonetheless, this is the first-ever scientific
                      study of the question of whether the U.S. is a
                      democracy. "Until recently it has not been
                      possible to test these contrasting theoretical
                      predictions [that U.S. policymaking operates as a
                      democracy, versus as an oligarchy, versus as some
                      mixture of the two] against each other within a
                      single statistical model. This paper reports on an
                      effort to do so, using a unique data set that
                      includes measures of the key variables for 1,779
                      policy issues." That’s an enormous number of
                      policy-issues studied.<br>
                      <br>
                      What the authors are able to find, despite the
                      deficiencies of the data, is important: the
                      first-ever scientific analysis of whether the U.S.
                      is a democracy, or is instead an oligarchy, or
                      some combination of the two. The clear finding is
                      that the U.S. is an oligarchy, no democratic
                      country, at all. American democracy is a sham, no
                      matter how much it's pumped by the oligarchs who
                      run the country (and who control the nation's
                      "news" media). The U.S., in other words, is
                      basically similar to Russia or most other dubious
                      "electoral" "democratic" countries. We weren't
                      formerly, but we clearly are now. Today, after
                      this exhaustive analysis of the data, “the
                      preferences of the average American appear to have
                      only a minuscule, near-zero, statistically
                      non-significant impact upon public policy.” That's
                      it, in a nutshell.</font></small></big></font></small></big></font><b><font

                      traditions in the study of American politics—which
                      can be characterized as theories of Majoritarian
                      Electoral Democracy, Economic-Elite Domination,
                      and two types of interest-group pluralism,
                      Majoritarian Pluralism and Biased Pluralism—offers
                      different predictions about which sets of actors
                      have how much influence over public policy:
                      average citizens; economic elites; and organized
                      interest groups, mass-based or business-oriented.<br>
                      <br>
                      A great deal of empirical research speaks to the
                      policy influence of one or another set of actors,
                      but until recently it has not been possible to
                      test these contrasting theoretical predictions
                      against each other within a single statistical
                      model. We report on an effort to do so, using a
                      unique data set that includes measures of the key
                      variables for 1,779 policy issues.<br>
                      <br>
                      Multivariate analysis indicates that economic
                      elites and organized groups representing business
                      interests have substantial independent impacts on
                      U.S. government policy, while average citizens and
                      mass-based interest groups have little or no
                      independent influence. The results provide
                      substantial support for theories of Economic-Elite
                      Domination and for theories of Biased Pluralism,
                      but not for theories of Majoritarian Electoral
                      Democracy or Majoritarian Pluralism.</font></small></big></font></small></big></font><b><font

                      several newly identified compounds that can mimic
                      the life-extending effect of a starvation diet,

                      Calorie restriction, a reduction in calorie intake
                      without malnutrition, has been found to slow down
                      the ageing process in several animal models from
                      worms to mammals, and developing drugs that can
                      reproduce this effect, without the side effects,
                      could have widespread human applications.<br>
                      <br>
                      Now, using complex genetic data analysis and
                      testing, scientists have shown for the first time
                      that allantoin, which is found in botanical
                      extracts of the comfrey plant and is an ingredient
                      of many anti-ageing creams, can mimic the effect
                      of calorie restriction and increase lifespan in
                      worms by more than 20%.<br>

                      have health benefits in humans and, while more
                      work is necessary, our findings could potentially
                      result in human therapies for age-related

                      restriction mimetic compounds, the team made use
                      of existing molecular signatures from human cells
                      treated with a variety of small-molecule drugs.<br>
                      Using pattern-matching algorithms to make
                      connections between drug compounds and calorie
                      restriction effects, eleven potential compounds
                      were identified. Five of these were then tested in
                      nematode worms.<br>
                      <br>
                      The researchers found that worms treated with
                      allantoin, rapamycin, trichostatin A and LY-294002
                      not only lived longer, but also stayed healthier
                      longer. Additionally, when the same compounds were
                      tested in mutant worms they extended lifespan in a
                      way expected from calorie restriction. Further
                      molecular analysis of allantoin suggests it acts
                      by a different mechanism from rapamycin, a
                      well-known longevity drug.<br>

                      work said: “Testing anti-aging interventions in
                      humans is not practical, so developing
                      computational methods to predict longevity drugs
                      is of great use.<br>
                      <br>
                      “We have shown so far that our compounds work in
                      worms, but studies in mammalian models are now
                      necessary. The next step for us is to understand
                      the mechanisms by which allantoin extends
                      lifespan, as this could reveal new longevity

                      reduction in calorie intake without malnutrition,
                      retards aging in several animal models from worms
                      to mammals. Developing CR mimetics, compounds that
                      reproduce the longevity benefits of CR without its
                      side effects, is of widespread interest. Here, we
                      employed the Connectivity Map to identify drugs
                      with overlapping gene expression profiles with CR.
                      Eleven statistically significant compounds were
                      predicted as CR mimetics using this bioinformatics
                      approach. We then tested rapamycin, allantoin,
                      trichostatin A, LY-294002 and geldanamycin in
                      Caenorhabditis elegans. An increase in lifespan
                      and healthspan was observed for all drugs except
                      geldanamycin when fed to wild-type worms, but no
                      lifespan effects were observed in eat-2 mutant
                      worms, a genetic model of CR, suggesting that
                      life-extending effects may be acting via
                      CR-related mechanisms. We also treated daf-16
                      worms with rapamycin, allantoin or trichostatin A,
                      and a lifespan extension was observed, suggesting
                      that these drugs act via DAF-16-independent
                      mechanisms, as would be expected from CR mimetics.
                      Supporting this idea, an analysis of predictive
                      targets of the drugs extending lifespan indicates
                      various genes within CR and longevity networks. We
                      also assessed the transcriptional profile of worms
                      treated with either rapamycin or allantoin and
                      found that both drugs use several specific
                      pathways that do not overlap, indicating different
                      modes of action for each compound. The current
                      work validates the capabilities of this
                      bioinformatic drug repositioning method in the
                      context of longevity and reveals new putative CR
                      mimetics that warrant further studies.<br>

                      Scientists have discovered a chemical that
                      destroys toxic plaques which build up in the brain
                      in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease.<br>
                      <br>
                      Preliminary tests found that when added to
                      drinking water, the compound cleared amyloid beta
                      plaques from the brains of mice with
                      Alzheimer’s-like symptoms, and restored their
                      cognitive function to normal.<br>
                      <br>
                      The work is at a very early stage, but raises
                      hopes for drugs that can prevent the accumulation
                      of amyloid plaques and potentially halt the
                      progression of the disease. Amyloid plaques are
                      one of the first hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease
                      and are thought to contribute to neurodegeneration
                      by killing off brain cells.<br>
                      <br>
                      Researchers in Korea discovered the chemical,
                      EPPS, while screening a variety of molecules for
                      their effects on amyloid plaques. In the latest
                      study, they added the substance to the drinking
                      water of mice that had symptoms of Alzheimer’s
                      disease. They found that administering EPPS for a
                      week improved how well mice performed on maze
                      tests, and cleared amyloid plaques from the
                      animals’ brains.<br>
                      <br>
                      “Our findings clearly support the view that
                      aggregated amyloid-beta is the pathological
                      culprit of Alzheimer’s disease,” said YoungSoo
                      Kim, who led the team at the Korea Institute of
                      Science and Technology in Seoul.<br>
                      <br>
                      The study used mice that had amyloid plaques
                      injected into their brains. The animals suffered
                      cognitive impairments as a result, but they did
                      not develop the kind of widespread brain damage
                      seen in Alzheimer’s patients which would not be
                      reversed by removing amyloid plaques.<br>
                      <br>
                      “I do not believe EPPS or other amyloid clearing
                      drug candidates will make Alzheimer patients
                      recover their damaged brains,” said Kim, whose
                      study appears in Nature Communications. “However,
                      I strongly believe these drug candidates will halt
                      the neurodegeneration and rescue patients from
                      death.”<br>
                      <br>
                      Far more work will be needed to prove that EPPS or
                      related compounds have the potential to improve
                      dementia in humans. The compound’s toxicity in
                      humans is so far unknown. Kim said none of the
                      mice in the latest study experienced bad side
                      effects. The chemical, he adds, is very similar to
                      taurine, an amino acid found in Red Bull and other
                      energy drinks.<br>
                      <br>
                      Extensive studies are also be needed to
                      investigate whether the compound is effective in
                      humans. Many compounds that look encouraging in
                      mouse studies turn out to have no effect in
                      people, or even make the disease worse.<br>
                      <br>
                      Kim agrees that much more work lies ahead, but he
                      believes that drugs which destroy amyloid plaques
                      could benefit Alzheimer’s patients if they can be
                      given early enough in the course of the disease.
                      The plaques build up over a decade or more before
                      Alzheimer’s patients develop serious damage and
                      suffer mental impairments.<br>
                      <br>
                      Teams elsewhere have taken steps towards drugs
                      that remove amyloid plaques. One approach is to
                      design antibodies that bind to and then break them
                      down.<br>
                      <br>
                      James Pickett, head of research at the leading
                      dementia charity, Alzheimer’s Society said: “While
                      new insights into potential ways to treat
                      Alzheimer’s disease are welcome, in this case,
                      it’s too early to say if this will one day benefit
                      people living with Alzheimer’s. This study has
                      found a new chemical that could help to clear some
                      forms of amyloid, the toxic protein that is a
                      hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. However, so far
                      this has only been shown in mice, which do not
                      fully replicate several of the important changes
                      that we see in the brains and behaviours of people
                      with dementia.<br>
                      <br>
                      “We are working to increase our understanding of
                      Alzheimer’s disease all the time, and there are
                      already a number of drugs in clinical testing that
                      are targeted against amyloid. We hope that new
                      findings will one day translate into real
                      treatments for people living with dementia.”<br>

                      characterized by the transition of amyloid-β (Aβ)
                      monomers into toxic oligomers and plaques. Given
                      that Aβ abnormality typically precedes the
                      development of clinical symptoms, an agent capable
                      of disaggregating existing Aβ aggregates may be
                      advantageous. Here we report that a small
                      molecule,
                      4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulphonic
                      acid (EPPS), binds to Aβ aggregates and converts
                      them into monomers. The oral administration of
                      EPPS substantially reduces hippocampus-dependent
                      behavioural deficits, brain Aβ oligomer and plaque
                      deposits, glial γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release
                      and brain inflammation in an Aβ-overexpressing,
                      APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model when initiated
                      after the development of severe AD-like
                      phenotypes. The ability of EPPS to rescue Aβ
                      aggregation and behavioural deficits provides
                      strong support for the view that the accumulation
                      of Aβ is an important mechanism underlying AD.<br>

              preparing hydrogen by decomposing water</b></big><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;LIANG ZHENHAI; LIU XIAN; LIU
        ZHIPING; DU HAIYAN; YANG HUIMIN; DAI HONGYAN; YANG TAILAI +<br>
        <br>
        The invention relates to the preparation of a photoelectric
        catalytic membrane for preparing hydrogen by decomposing water.
        The preparation method comprises the steps of mixing sodium
        cellulose acetate or sodium carboxymethyl cellulose with
        polyvinylpyrrolidone; heating by distilled water, and stirring
        for dissolving; spreading the product on a flat glass plate, and
        drying to form a membrane; crosslinking by heavy metal ions;
        soaking in solution containing anion groups, and drying at the
        room temperature to obtain a thin membrane; evenly dispersing
        oxyhalide bismuth catalyst in absolute ethyl alcohol under
        ultrasonic oscillation, pouring the mixed solution onto the
        surface of the thin membrane, and drying by air; mixing chitosan
        and polyvinylpyrrolidone, and dispersing the mixture; heating by
        acetic acid water solution, and stirring for dissolving; feeding
        an aldehyde crosslinking agent for crosslinking, and then
        pouring the product onto the oxyhalide bismuth thin membrane to
        obtain the photoelectric catalytic membrane. The photoelectric
        catalytic membrane is used for preparing the hydrogen by
        decomposing water, and is capable of effectively separating
        photoproduction electron holes; the hydrogen production quantum
        efficiency reaches up to 90-96%, the hydrogen purity reaches up
        to 99-99.9%, and 15-40% of energy consumption can be saved, so
        that a new way is provided for preparing hydrogen by decomposing
        water through photoelectrocatalysis.<br>

        The Web Bot is an internet prophetic computer program that
        predicts or forecasts future events on a global scale. It is
        actually the Asymmetric Language Trend Analysis Report, commonly
        known as The Web Bot. The Web Bot is the brainchild of Clif
        High, a reclusive genius with a strong background on linguistics
        and human behavioral studies. Clif High has a patent on
        computer-assisted reading technology which allows reading from
        computer screens at up to 2000 words per minute. Reaching into
        other areas of hidden potential within language use by humans,
        he has been developing a system of software internet agents
        (like search engines use) and other proprietary processing
        methods to predict future events. The software project, begun in
        1997, captures near-real-time changes in language patterns
        within internet discussions. Then, employing radical linguistic
        techniques of his own devising, he develops a model which
        anticipates future events with some seeming accuracy. The
        processing has, at its core, a method of assigning emotional
        values to complex content and time carry-values to predict
        changes in future behavior based on how people are using
        language now. Since June 2001 when the work projected a major
        'tipping point', that is a 'life-changing event' with aspects of
        'military and accident' that would forever change the way we
        live to occur inside 90 days, the web bot project has continued
        to give archetype descriptors of future events such as the
        anthrax attack in Washington, the crash of American 587, the
        Columbia disaster, the Northeast Power outage, the Banda Aceh
        earthquake and most recently the flooding of the Red River. As a
        continuing project, reports are offered from the extracted
        archetype information at his web site, www.halfpasthuman. If
        even a fraction of the global human population is latently
        psychic, then there is the possibility that an anomalous,
        systematic collective human mental power may be potentially
        suggesting (whether they know it or not) events that may occur
        in the future. Even a small fraction of psychic individuals
        constitutes a large number of people on the planet today. If
        even a small percentage of the global population (now @ 7
        Billion Human Beings) is even subconsciously suggesting in
        random conversations across the internet the potentiality of
        future events, then an enormous data set of emotionally-laden,
        suggestive language, is being created every second of every day
        as human beings converse with each other. How often have you had
        a thought, then had a confirmation almost directly afterwards?
        Eg: You think of a friend, and immediately that friend texts
        you, or calls you. Or, you have a sense of an event occurring,
        just to have it happen immediately afterwards. You are not alone
        when these events ARE happening, and those events may have more
        meaning than you know. These synchronicities, although
        unexplainable to Western Scientists before the advent of Quantum
        Mechanics, were often played off as "coincidence" or
        "chance"...but, the reoccurring nature of these events all
        across humanity suggest otherwise. Remember, just because our
        Western Science cannot explain it, does not mean it does not
        exist. Therefore, human beings, even if only a small portion and
        even if only by an unknown latent ability, may be inherently
        psychic, and that many of them, in concert, could potentially be
        forecasting events (great and small) that would be intrinsically

        The magazine The Economist published an issue named “The World
        in 2015”. On the cover are odd images :&nbsp; A mushroom cloud,
        the Federal Reserve in a game called “Panic” and much more.<br>
        <br>
        I wouldn’t normally dedicate an entire article analyzing the
        cover of a publication, but this isn’t any publication. It is
        The Economist and it is directly related to the world elite. It
        is partly owned by the Rothschild banking family of England and
        its editor-in-chief, John Micklethwait, attended several times
        to the Bilderberg Conference – the secretive meeting where the
        world’s most powerful figures from the world of politics,
        finance business and media discuss global policies. The outcome
        of those meetings is totally secret. It is therefore safe to say
        that the people at The Economist know things that most people
        don’t. For this reason, its “2015 prediction” cover is rather
        puzzling.<br>
        <br>
        The bleak and sinister cover features political figures,
        fictional characters and pop culture icons that will surely make
        the news in 2015. However, most importantly, it also includes
        several drawings that are extremely symbolic and allude to
        important elements of the elite’s Agenda. Here’s the cover :<br>

        </div>
        <br>
        December 2015 – CATANIA, Italy – Mount Etna in Italy has ignited
        the skies over Italy with a remarkable display of fire and
        lightning. Sicily’s tallest peak and active volcano erupted into
        life after two years of silence early on Thursday, (Friday NZT).
        The eruption lasted less than an hour but scientists said it was
        among the most violent eruptions from the volcano in the past
        two decades.<br>
        <br>
        The Washington Post reported that the intense eruption sent ash
        3 km into the sky and caused a “dirty thunderstorm” – when
        lightning is caused by static electricity produced in a volcanic
        plume. The phenomenon was also captured in Chile earlier this
        year. –Stuff NZ<br>

          <br>
          <b>Catherine J. Frompovich</b><br>
        </div>
        <b> </b><br>
        The other day I received an email with the subject line
        “Redacted/gutted Bill of Rights.” Boy, did that get my
        attention, especially since I consider myself to be somewhat of
        a constitutional admirer and scholar.<br>
        <br>
        As I read that email, the original Bill of Rights were listed
        and each Right that the person, who did the ‘redacting’ thought
        had been gutted from citizens, was superimposed with red font
        text. The provision(s) by which each Right was interpreted to be
        obliterated or gutted was typed in red.<br>
        <br>
        The more I read, the more I realized that we, as a Nation,
        certainly are in more trouble than we realize if
        apparently-informed citizens are thinking that way. The person,
        unknown to me as it was a forward, obviously was learned in the
        law! As a result, I had to rethink my assessment of what was
        posted in the email, since things really are getting squirrely.
        Should we be questioning what role “political correctness” may
        be fueling problems? [10]<br>
        <br>
        Furthermore, what is the U.S. Supreme Court doing to preserve
        constitutional rights? Don’t we seem to have a SCOTUS that is
        pop-culture oriented, rather than historically resolute?<br>
        <br>
        The redacted Bill of Rights wouldn’t leave me alone because the
        person who prepared it apparently was hitting more home runs
        rather than striking out. So, I thought I’d ask my readers what
        you think about the Bill of Rights being gutted.<br>
        <br>
        Below I’ve listed all ten original Rights ratified December 15,
        1791. The “father, author and key champion of the Bill of
        Rights,” James Madison, understood the problems with government,
        especially oppressive ones, from which the colonies had freed
        themselves. Why would anyone want to live under an oppressive
        government? Madison has always been a hero of mine; I liked his
        higher-consciousness “style.”<br>
        <br>
        Furthermore, I’ve underlined those parts of each Right that the
        unknown person redacted in black ink, and I have typed in
        italics script what that person feels was the mechanism by which
        the Right(s) had been gutted and, ostensibly, no longer apply to
        USA citizens or its revered Constitution, which some claim is an
        obsolete and outdated document. Nothing could be further from
        the facts. It’s needed now more than ever, in my opinion. Since
        when have oppressive governments been banned from the face of
        the earth? We don’t need one—nor want one—in the United States
        of America, I contend. How about you?<br>
        <br>
        Question: 224 years (Dec. 9, 2015) almost to the date of
        ratification, I feel compelled to ask this question: Do we want
        to lose our Constitutional rights so valiantly fought for by our
        forefathers and foremothers in favor of often-misguided and
        often-biased “political correctness”?<br>

        days of the Fukushima accident that Fukushima had melted down …
        but failed to tell the public.<br>

        "The fuel pools and rods at Fukushima appear to have “boiled”,
        caught fire and/or exploded soon after the earthquake knocked
        out power systems. <br>

        Now, a declassified report written by the U.S. Nuclear

        fuel in unit 2 released to the atmosphere, (2) 50% of the total
        spent fuel from unit 3 was released to the atmosphere, and (3)
        100% of the total spent fuel was released to the atmosphere from
        unit 4.<br>

        NARAC is the the U.S. National Atmospheric Release Advisory
        Center, located at the University of California’s Lawrence

        services that map the probable spread of hazardous material
        accidentally or intentionally released into the atmosphere“.<br>
        <br>
        The fuel pools at Units 3 and 4 contained enormous amounts of
        radiation.<br>
        <br>
        For example, there was “more cesium in that [Unit 4] fuel pool

        </b><b> Abstract</b><b><br>
        </b><b> </b><br>
        The roots, stems, leaves, and vascular circuitry of higher
        plants are responsible for conveying the chemical signals that
        regulate growth and functions. From a certain perspective, these
        features are analogous to the contacts, interconnections,
        devices, and wires of discrete and integrated electronic
        circuits. Although many attempts have been made to augment plant
        function with electroactive materials, plants’ “circuitry” has
        never been directly merged with electronics. We report analog
        and digital organic electronic circuits and devices manufactured
        in living plants. The four key components of a circuit have been
        achieved using the xylem, leaves, veins, and signals of the
        plant as the template and integral part of the circuit elements
        and functions. With integrated and distributed electronics in
        plants, one can envisage a range of applications including
        precision recording and regulation of physiology, energy
        harvesting from photosynthesis, and alternatives to genetic
        modification for plant optimization.<br>

            </big><br>
          </b></div>
        Scientists and amateur astronomers have long been fascinated by
        the possibility of a "Planet X" at the edge of the solar system
        that may explain some apparent anomalies in the orbits of
        planets such as Neptune and Uranus. However, in recent years,
        astronomers have largely ruled out the possibility of a large,
        unseen planet far beyond the orbit of Pluto.<br>
        <br>
        Research groups from Sweden and Mexico have now submitted
        pre-prints of two research papers to arXiv (here and here) that
        claim to have discovered a massive object at the edge of the
        solar system. Using observations from the Atacama Large
        Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Chile during 2014 and 2015,
        the astronomers spied "a new blackbody point source" that
        appears to be moving in conjunction with the Alpha Centauri star
        system, about 4.3 light years from Earth.<br>
        <br>
        The authors do not believe the new object is part of the Alpha
        Centuari system, however, because if it were that far away, such
        a star would have been bright enough to be seen before. Rather,
        they offer several explanations for the object, which one of the
        research teams named "Gna." Perhaps most notably, they suggest a
        "Super Earth" at a distance of about 300 astronomical units (AU)
        from the Sun, or about six times further than Pluto is at its
        aphelion. Another explanation is a "super-cool" brown dwarf (too
        big to be a planet, too small to be a star) at about 20,000 AU
        from the Sun.<br>
        <br>
        The Giant Magellan Telescope is one of three large telescopes
        under development.<br>
        <br>
        "Simple arguments convince us that this object cannot be an
        ordinary star. We argue that the object is most likely part of
        the solar system, in prograde motion, albeit at a distance too
        far to be detectable at other wavelengths," the authors of one
        paper, uploaded on December 8, 2015, to arXiv, conclude.<br>
        <br>
        As word of the new research papers spread through the planetary
        science community on Wednesday, they were greeted largely with
        skepticism.<br>
        <br>
        In a series of tweets, Mike Brown, a prominent planetary
        scientist at the California Institute of Technology who
        specializes in the outer solar system, said, "Fun fact: if it is
        true that ALMA accidentally discovered a massive outer solar
        system object in its tiny tiny tiny field of view that would
        suggest that there are something like 200,000 Earth sized
        planets in the outer solar system. Which, um, no. Even better: I
        just realized that this many Earth-sized planets existing would
        destabilize the entire solar system and we would all die."<br>
        <br>
        Other scientists noted that observations with NASA's Wide-field
        Infrared Survey Explorer, which has expressly searched the outer
        solar system for large planets, have ruled out the possibility
        of a planet the size of Saturn or larger out to 10,000 AU, and a
        Jupiter-sized planet out to 26,000 AU.<br>
        <br>
        As with all pre-prints, the new papers have yet to undergo
        scientific peer review. The new data may be the result of some
        sort of image artifacts in the ALMA data, or there may well be
        some other less sensational explanation for what these
        scientists have seen. This is how science at the frontier often
        proceeds.<br>

        The understanding of the formation of stellar and planetary
        systems requires the understanding of the structure and dynamics
        of their outmost regions, where large bodies are not expected to
        form. Serendipitous searches for Sedna-like objects allows the
        observation of regions that are normally not surveyed. The
        Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is
        particularly sensitive to point sources and it presents
        currently the only means to detect Sedna-like objects far beyond
        their perihelia. ALMA observations 10 months apart revealed a
        new blackbody point source that is apparently comoving with α
        Cen B. We exclude that source to be a sub-/stellar member of the
        α Centauri system, but argue that it is either an extreme TNO, a
        Super-Earth or a very cool brown dwarf in the outer realm of the
        solar system. <br>

        The unprecedented sensitivity of the Atacama Large
        millimeter/submillimeter array (ALMA) is providing many new
        discoveries. Several of these are serendipitous to the original
        goal of the observations. We report the discovery of previously
        unknown continuum sources, or a single fast moving new source,
        in our ALMA observations. Here we aim to determine the nature of
        the detections. The detections, at &gt;5.8σ in the image plane
        and &gt;14σ in the (u,v)−plane, were made in two epochs of ALMA
        observations of a 25 arc second region around the asymptotic
        giant branch star W Aql in the continuum around 345 GHz. At a
        third epoch, covering 50x50 arcseconds, the source(s) were not
        seen. We have investigated if the detections could be spurious,
        if they could constitute a population of variable background
        sources, or if the observations revealed a fast moving single
        object. Based on our analysis, we conclude that a single object
        (with a flux of ∼3.0 mJy) exhibiting a large proper motion (∼87
        arcsec/yr) is the most likely explanation. Until the nature of
        the source becomes clear, we have named it Gna. Unless there are
        yet unknown, but significant, issues with ALMA observations, we
        have detected a previously unknown objects in our solar system.
        Based on proper motion analysis we find that, if it is
        gravitationally bound, Gna is currently located at 12−25 AU
        distance and has a size of ∼220−880 km. Alternatively it is a
        much larger, planet-sized, object, gravitationally unbound, and
        located within ∼4000 AU, or beyond (out to ∼0.3~pc) if it is
        strongly variable. Our observations highlight the power of ALMA
        in detecting possible solar system objects, but also show how
        multiple epoch observations are crucial to identify what are
        otherwise probably assumed to be extra-galactic sources. <br>

        MIT physicists have been testing a light-emitting diode that has
        an electrical efficiency of more than 100 percent. You may ask,
        "Wouldn't that mean it breaks the first law of thermodynamics?"
        The answer, happily, is no.<br>
        <br>
        The LED produces 69 picowatts of light using 30 picowatts of
        power, giving it an efficiency of 230 percent. That means it
        operates above "unity efficiency" -- putting it into a category
        normally occupied by perpetual motion machines.<br>
        <br>
        However, while MIT's diode puts out more than twice as much
        energy in photons as it's fed in electrons, it doesn't violate
        the conservation of energy because it appears to draw in heat
        energy from its surroundings instead. When it gets more than 100
        percent electrically-efficient, it begins to cool down, stealing
        energy from its environment to convert into more photons.<br>
        <br>
        In slightly more detail, the researchers chose an LED with a
        small band gap, and applied smaller and smaller voltages. Every
        time the voltage was halved, the electrical power was reduced by
        a factor of four, but the light power emitted only dropped by a
        factor of two. The extra energy came instead from lattice
        vibrations.<br>
        <br>
        The scientists involved have detailed their discovery in a paper
        published in Physical Review Letters, saying: "Experiments
        directly confirm for the first time that this behaviour
        continues beyond the conventional limit of unity
        electrical-to-optical power conversion efficiency."<br>
        <br>
        69 picowatts of light, of course, is a very small amount -- so
        you're not likely to be able to read in bed with one of these
        LEDs. However, it could have applications in low-power
        electronics, acting as a thermodynamic heat engine but with fast
        electrical control.<br>
        <br>
        Updated 13 August, 2012: A previous version of this article
        suggeted that MIT built the LED. It was actually built by the
        Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute in St. Petersburg.<br>

        </b><b> Abstract</b><b><br>
        </b><b> </b><br>
        A heated semiconductor light-emitting diode at low forward bias
        voltage V&lt;kBT/q is shown to use electrical work to pump heat
        from the lattice to the photon field. Here the rates of both
        radiative and nonradiative recombination have contributions at
        linear order in V. As a result the device’s wall-plug (i.e.,
        power conversion) efficiency is inversely proportional to its
        output power and diverges as V approaches zero. Experiments
        directly confirm for the first time that this behavior continues
        beyond the conventional limit of unity electrical-to-optical
        power conversion efficiency.<br>

        </div>
        <b> </b><br>
        Contrary to conventional wisdom, which holds that light-emitting
        diodes (LEDs) should be cooled to increase efficiency, the LEDs
        disclosed herein are heated to increase efficiency. Heating an
        LED operating at low forward bias voltage (e.g., V&lt;kBT/q) can
        be accomplished by injecting phonons generated by non-radiative
        recombination back into the LED's semiconductor lattice. This
        raises the temperature of the LED's active rejection, resulting
        in thermally assisted injection of holes and carriers into the
        LED's active region. This phonon recycling or thermo-electric
        pumping process can be promoted by heating the LED with an
        external source (e.g., exhaust gases or waste heat from other
        electrical components). It can also be achieved via internal
        heat generation, e.g., by thermally insulating the LED's diode
        structure to prevent (rather than promote) heat dissipation. In
        other words, trapping heat generated by the LED within the LED
        increases LED efficiency under certain bias conditions.<br>

              Tanks to Become ‘Invisible’, Grenade-Proof</b><br>
          </big></div>
        <br>
        A unique material developed by Russian engineers effectively
        protects armored vehicles against antitank grenades while
        simultaneously making them invisible to enemy radar, Russian
        media wrote on Saturday.<br>
        <br>
        The Mantle, developed by the Institute of Steel, which is part
        of the Tractor Factories Concern, consists of a screen with
        dynamic protection elements, which is placed 50 millimeters to
        1,500 millimeters ahead of the protected object, Novosti VPK
        defense website reported.<br>
        <br>
        When hit by an antitank grenade the screen’s low-density surface
        prevents it from blowing up with its discreet protective
        elements destroying the grenade fuse’s electrical circuit.<br>
        <br>
        Simultaneously, the Mantle partially destroys the grenade’s
        cumulative element. As a result, when hitting the tank’s main
        armor, the grenade either fails to explode or its armor-piercing
        ability is significantly undermined.<br>
        <br>
        As to the Mantle’s stealth capability, it makes tanks and
        infantry fighting vehicles six times less visible to enemy radar
        and three times less detectible in the infrared spectrum.<br>
        <br>
        The Mantle is installed and uninstalled in a matter of just a
        few minutes and requires no additional training.<br>

        </b> <i>Leaked ISIS documents have revealed an astonishing
          level of bureaucracy</i><i><br>
        </i><i> ISIS has created departments for health, education and
          its economy</i><i><br>
        </i><i> It reveals the effort made to turn the territory under
          its control into a state</i><i><br>
        </i><i> An overarching administration memo reveals the need for
          a constitution</i><i><br>
        </i><i> It also reveals three types of military camps for
          children and adult fighters</i><i><br>
        </i><i> One of these is a 15-day 'refresher' course designed for
          hardened veterans</i><br>
        <br>
        Leaked internal documents have laid bare a staggeringly
        sophisticated level of administration imposed by ISIS in a bid
        to turn its self-declared caliphate into a legitimate state.<br>
        <br>
        The terrorists have created departments to administer over the
        health, education and the treasury sectors, while it also holds
        15-day annual refresher courses for its veteran soldiers.<br>
        <br>
        The majority of the revelations come in a 24-page memo, shown to
        The Guardian, which was published in the months after the group
        announced its caliphate in mid-2014.<br>
        <br>
        Leaked documents have revealed the remarkable scale of
        administration ISIS is using in its bid to become a fully
        fledged state<br>
        <br>
        Leaked documents have revealed the remarkable scale of
        administration ISIS is using in its bid to become a fully
        fledged state<br>
        <br>
        Pictured are a group of fighters at an ISIS training camp in
        Afghanistan, where the group is said to have wrested control
        from the Taliban<br>
        <br>
        A leaked internal ISIS memo (pictured) has been used as a
        blueprint for the foundations of terrorists' civil society<br>
        <br>
        The 24-page document was titled Principles in the Administration
        of the Islamic State<br>
        <br>
        Ambitious: The 24-page document was titled Principles in the
        Administration of the Islamic State<br>
        <br>
        Other details emerge in hundreds of documents translated by
        Aymenn al-Tamimi, a 23-year-old researcher in Cardiff.<br>
        <br>
        The primary document - named Principles in the Administration of
        the Islamic State - was written as a base text to train groups
        of civil servants.<br>
        <br>
        It says: 'The state requires an Islamic system of life, a
        Qur’anic constitution and a system to implement it.<br>
        <br>
        'There must not be suppression of the role of qualifications,
        skills of expertise and the training of the current generation
        on administering the state.'<br>
        <br>
        This includes how to run the health system, which now has its
        own department and is controlled by installing ISIS
        administrators in senior positions at hospitals.<br>
        <br>
        Perhaps most interestingly, the blueprint shows ISIS always
        intended to train child soldiers in warfare.<br>
        <br>
        The documents reveal child soldiers will be trained to use
        weaponry, with those children who excel selected for security
        assignments, such as manning checkpoints and joining patrols.<br>
        <br>
        Propaganda footage released of such training camps show young
        boys being made to run, climb and crawl through a treacherous
        assault courses.<br>
        <br>
        Armed with rocket launchers and AK47s, the so-called 'cubs of
        the caliphate' are also forced to pose under the notorious black
        flag used by ISIS.<br>
        <br>
        Experts previously spoken to by MailOnline suggest that by
        hijacking their education - and minds - from an early age, ISIS
        can mould these children into loyal fanatics who are willing to
        die defending the state.<br>
        <br>
        The leaked document also shows there are two other types of
        military camps - this includes 15-day refresher courses for its
        battlefield veterans, and introduction camps in which new
        fighters are trained in warfare as well as Islamic teachings…<br>

        A Buddhist monk led a major assassination plot, known as the
        League of Blood Incident in 1932 Japan. In the 1970s Laotian and
        Thai Buddhists took up arms against communists, declaring that
        it was not karmically wrong to do so. From 1983 to 2009,
        Buddhist monks sanctioned aggression against the Liberation
        Tigers of Tamil Eelam in the Sri Lankan Civil War. Since 1992,
        one of the major militias fighting the Myanmar government, the
        Democratic Karen Buddhist Army, has been led or under the
        influence of a monk named U Thuzana. In 1995, the Japanese
        cultic terrorist group Aum Shinrikyo justified their release of
        Sarin gas on the Japanese subway system by claiming that they
        were liberating less enlightened beings in accordance with
        tantric Buddhist teachings. And as recently as 2004 and 2008,
        respectively, Thai monasteries became militant bases in the
        conflict between local Muslims and Buddhists and Chinese
        officials claimed to have found weapons caches in Tibetan
        temples…<br>

          <br>
          <i>Astrophysicists find Jupiter likely bumped giant planet
            from solar system</i><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div align="left"> It's like something out of an interplanetary
          chess game. Astrophysicists at the University of Toronto have
          found that a close encounter with Jupiter about four billion
          years ago may have resulted in another planet's ejection from
          the Solar System altogether.<br>
          <br>
          The existence of a fifth giant gas planet at the time of the
          Solar System's formation -- in addition to Jupiter, Saturn,
          Uranus and Neptune that we know of today -- was first proposed
          in 2011. But if it did exist, how did it get pushed out?<br>
          <br>
          For years, scientists have suspected the ouster was either
          Saturn or Jupiter.<br>
          <br>
          "Our evidence points to Jupiter," said Ryan Cloutier, a PhD
          candidate in U of T's Department of Astronomy &amp;
          Astrophysics and lead author of a new study published in The
          Astrophysical Journal.<br>
          <br>
          Planet ejections occur as a result of a close planetary
          encounter in which one of the objects accelerates so much that
          it breaks free from the massive gravitational pull of the Sun.
          However, earlier studies which proposed that giant planets
          could possibly eject one another did not consider the effect
          such violent encounters would have on minor bodies, such as
          the known moons of the giant planets, and their orbits.<br>
          <br>
          So Cloutier and his colleagues turned their attention to moons
          and orbits, developing computer simulations based on the
          modern-day trajectories of Callisto and lapetus, the regular
          moons orbiting around Jupiter and Saturn respectively. They
          then measured the likelihood of each one producing its current
          orbit in the event that its host planet was responsible for
          ejecting the hypothetical planet, an incident which would have
          caused significant disturbance to each moon's original orbit.<br>
          <br>
          "Ultimately, we found that Jupiter is capable of ejecting the
          fifth giant planet while retaining a moon with the orbit of
          Callisto," said Cloutier, who is also a graduate fellow at the
          Centre for Planetary Sciences at the University of Toronto at
          Scarborough. "On the other hand, it would have been very
          difficult for Saturn to do so because Iapetus would have been
          excessively unsettled, resulting in an orbit that is difficult
          to reconcile with its current trajectory."<br>

          (Sahar) ~ The Syrian General Mohammad Issa, one of the top

          France‘s aircraft carrier directly if he dares to approach the
          Syrian coast.<br>

          “The announcement made by France to involve the nuclear

          “These strikes target Syrian oil wells and all this is done
          without the approval of Damascus government, which for us

      A new RNA test of blood platelets can be used to detect, classify
      and pinpoint the location of cancer by analysing a sample
      equivalent to one drop of blood. Using this new method for
      blood-based RNA tests of blood platelets, researchers have been
      able to identify cancer with 96 per cent accuracy. This according
      to a study at Umeå University in Sweden recently published in the
      journal Cancer Cell.<br>
      <br>
      "Being able to detect cancer at an early stage is vital. We have
      studied how a whole new blood-based method of biopsy can be used
      to detect cancer, which in the future renders an invasive cell
      tissue sample unnecessary in diagnosing lung cancer, for instance.
      In the study, nearly all forms of cancer were identified, which
      proves that blood-based biopsies have an immense potential to
      improve early detection of cancer," according to Jonas Nilsson,
      cancer researcher at Umeå University and co-author of the article.<br>
      <br>
      In the study, researchers from Umeå University, in collaborations
      with researchers from the Netherlands and the US, have
      investigated how a new method of blood-based RNA tests of the part
      of the blood called platelets could be used in detecting and
      classifying cancer.<br>
      <br>
      The results show that blood platelets could constitute a complete
      and easily accessible blood-based source for sampling and hence be
      used in diagnosing cancer as well as in the choice of treatment
      method.<br>
      <br>
      Blood samples from 283 individuals were studied of which 228
      people had some form of cancer and 55 showed no evidence of
      cancer. By comparing the blood samples RNA profiles, researchers
      could identify the presence of cancer with an accuracy of 96 per
      cent among patients. Among the 39 patients in the study in which
      an early detection of cancer had been made, 100 per cent of the
      cases could be identified and classified.<br>
      <br>
      In follow-up tests using the same method, researchers could
      identify the origin of tumours with a so far unsurpassed accuracy
      of 71 per cent in patients with diagnosed cancer in the lung,
      breast, pancreas, brain, liver, colon and rectum. The samples
      could also be sorted in subdivisions depending on molecular
      differences in the cancer form, which can be of great use in the
      choice of treatment method.<br>

      Out of a 'haystack' of 40,000 genes from three different
      organisms, scientists at ETH Zurich and a research consortium in
      Jena have found genes that are involved in physical ageing. If you

      One of these genes proved to be particularly influential: the
      bcat-1 gene. "When we blocked the effect of this gene, it
      significantly extended the mean lifespan of the nematode by up to
      25 percent," says Ristow….<br>

            Make Diamond at Room Temperature</b></big><br>
        <br>
        <b>Jay Naraya, Matt Shipman</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Researchers from North Carolina State University have discovered a
      new phase of solid carbon, called Q-carbon, which is distinct from
      the known phases of graphite and diamond. They have also developed
      a technique for using Q-carbon to make diamond-related structures
      at room temperature and at ambient atmospheric pressure in air.<br>
      <br>
      Phases are distinct forms of the same material. Graphite is one of
      the solid phases of carbon; diamond is another.<br>
      <br>
      “We’ve now created a third solid phase of carbon,” says Jay
      Narayan, the John C. Fan Distinguished Chair Professor of
      Materials Science and Engineering at NC State and lead author of
      three papers describing the work. “The only place it may be found
      in the natural world would be possibly in the core of some
      planets.”<br>
      <br>
      Q-carbon has some unusual characteristics. For one thing, it is
      ferromagnetic – which other solid forms of carbon are not.<br>
      <br>
      “We didn’t even think that was possible,” Narayan says.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, Q-carbon is harder than diamond, and glows when
      exposed to even low levels of energy.<br>
      <br>
      “Q-carbon’s strength and low work-function – its willingness to
      release electrons – make it very promising for developing new
      electronic display technologies,” Narayan says.<br>
      <br>
      But Q-carbon can also be used to create a variety of
      single-crystal diamond objects. To understand that, you have to
      understand the process for creating Q-carbon.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers start with a substrate, such as such as sapphire,
      glass or a plastic polymer. The substrate is then coated with
      amorphous carbon – elemental carbon that, unlike graphite or
      diamond, does not have a regular, well-defined crystalline
      structure. The carbon is then hit with a single laser pulse
      lasting approximately 200 nanoseconds. During this pulse, the
      temperature of the carbon is raised to 4,000 Kelvin (or around
      3,727 degrees Celsius) and then rapidly cooled. This operation
      takes place at one atmosphere – the same pressure as the
      surrounding air.<br>
      <br>
      The end result is a film of Q-carbon, and researchers can control
      the process to make films between 20 nanometers and 500 nanometers
      thick.<br>
      <br>
      By using different substrates and changing the duration of the
      laser pulse, the researchers can also control how quickly the
      carbon cools. By changing the rate of cooling, they are able to
      create diamond structures within the Q-carbon.<br>
      <br>
      “We can create diamond nanoneedles or microneedles, nanodots, or
      large-area diamond films, with applications for drug delivery,
      industrial processes and for creating high-temperature switches
      and power electronics,” Narayan says. “These diamond objects have
      a single-crystalline structure, making them stronger than
      polycrystalline materials. And it is all done at room temperature
      and at ambient atmosphere – we’re basically using a laser like the
      ones used for laser eye surgery. So, not only does this allow us
      to develop new applications, but the process itself is relatively
      inexpensive.”<br>
      <br>
      And, if researchers want to convert more of the Q-carbon to
      diamond, they can simply repeat the laser-pulse/cooling process.<br>
      <br>
      If Q-carbon is harder than diamond, why would someone want to make
      diamond nanodots instead of Q-carbon ones? Because we still have a
      lot to learn about this new material.<br>

      “We can make Q-carbon films, and we’re learning its properties,
      but we are still in the early stages of understanding how to
      manipulate it,” Narayan says. “We know a lot about diamond, so we

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      We report the discovery of a new phase of carbon (referred to as
      Q-carbon) and address fundamental issues related to direct
      conversion of carbon into diamond at ambient temperatures and
      pressures in air without any need for catalyst and presence of
      hydrogen. The Q-carbon is formed as result of quenching from super
      undercooled state by using high-power nanosecond laser pulses. We
      discuss the equilibrium phase diagram (P vs. T) of carbon and show
      that by rapid quenching kinetics can shift thermodynamic
      graphite/diamond/liquid carbon triple point from 5000 K/12 GPa to
      super undercooled carbon at atmospheric pressure in air. It is
      shown that nanosecond laser heating of diamond-like
      amorphouscarbon on sapphire, glass, and polymer substrates can be
      confined to melt carbon in a super undercooled state. By quenching
      the carbon from the super undercooled state, we have created a new
      state of carbon (Q-carbon) from which nanodiamond, microdiamond,
      microneedles, and single-crystal thin films are formed depending
      upon the nucleation and growth times allowed for diamond
      formation. The Q-carbon quenched from liquid is a new state of
      solid carbon with a higher mass density than amorphouscarbon and a
      mixture of mostly fourfold sp3 (75%–85%) with the rest being
      threefold sp2 bonded carbon (with distinct entropy). It is
      expected to have new and improved mechanical hardness, electrical
      conductivity, chemical, and physical properties, including
      room-temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM) and enhanced field
      emission. Here we present interesting results on RTFM, enhanced
      electrical conductivity and surface potential of Q-carbon to
      emphasize its unique properties. The Q-carbon exhibits robust bulk
      ferromagnetism with estimated Curie temperature of about 500 K and
      saturation magnetization value of 20 emu g−1. From the Q-carbon,
      diamond phase is nucleated and a variety of micro- and
      nanostructures and large-area single-crystal diamond sheets are
      grown by allowing growth times as needed. Subsequent laser pulses
      can be used to grow nanodiamond into microdiamond and nucleate
      other nanostructures of diamond on the top of existing
      microdiamond and create novel nanostructured materials. The
      microstructural details provide insights into the mechanism of
      formation of nanodiamond, microdiamond, nanoneedles, microneedles,
      and single-crystal thin films. This process allows
      carbon-to-diamond conversion and formation of useful
      nanostructures and microstructures at ambient temperatures in air
      at atmospheric pressure on practical and heat-sensitive substrates
      in a controlled way without need for any catalysts and hydrogen to
      stabilize sp3 bonding for diamond formation.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      We report on fundamental discovery of conversion of amorphous
      carbon into diamond by irradiating amorphous carbon films with
      nanosecond lasers at room-temperature in air at atmospheric
      pressure. We can create diamond in the form of nanodiamond (size
      range &lt;100 nm) and microdiamond (&gt;100 nm). Nanosecond laser
      pulses are used to melt amorphous diamondlike carbon and create a
      highly undercooled state, from which various forms of diamond can
      be formed upon cooling. The quenching from the super undercooled
      state results in nucleation of nanodiamond. It is found that
      microdiamonds grow out of highly undercooled state of carbon, with
      nanodiamond acting as seed crystals.<br>

      Disclosed is a method for the development of diamond thin films on
      a non-diamond substrate. The method comprises implanting carbon
      ions in a lattice-plane matched or lattice matched substrate. The
      implanted region of the substrate is then annealed to produce a
      diamond thin film on the non-diamond substrate. Also disclosed are
      the diamond thin films on non-diamond lattice-plane matched
      substrates produced by this method. Preferred substrates are
      lattice and plane matched to diamond such as copper, a preferred
      implanting method is ion implantation, and a preferred annealing

      In Fairewinds’ latest update of the ongoing nuclear catastrophe at
      Fukushima Daiichi, Chief Engineer Arnie Gundersen presents two
      reports that confirm the direct link of numerous cancers in Japan
      to the triple meltdown. Based upon data from Japanese medical
      professionals and utility owner of the meltdown site, Tokyo
      Electric Power Company (TEPCO), Arnie concludes that heavy
      radioactive discharges will be the cause of enormous spikes in
      cancer in Japan.<br>
      <br>
      TEPCO’s press release confirms the leukemia diagnosis for a TEPCO
      worker due to his ongoing exposure during the last four years to
      radiation from the Fukushima Daiichi triple meltdown. Sadly,
      during the early months of the Fukushima Daiichi emergency, most
      TEPCO workers did not wear the required dosimeters required to
      measure each employee’s exposure to radiation, which has made
      accurate assessment of the radiation doses received by TEPCO
      employees impossible.<br>
      <br>
      The second report, provided by esteemed Japanese medical
      professionals, reveals that the incidence of thyroid cancer is
      approximately 230 times higher than normal in the Fukushima
      Prefecture.&nbsp; This disturbing number for the people of Japan
      is solely due to the Fukushima Daiichi disaster and the ongoing
      radioactivity emanating from the decimated nuclear site...<br>

            Nervous system manipulation by electromagnetic fields from

      </div>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Abstract -- Physiological effects have been observed in a human
      subject in response to stimulation of the skin with weak
      electromagnetic fields that are pulsed with certain frequencies
      near ½ Hz or 2.4 Hz, such as to excite a sensory resonance. Many
      computer monitors and TV tubes, when displaying pulsed images,
      emit pulsed electromagnetic fields of sufficient amplitudes to
      cause such excitation. It is therefore possible to manipulate the
      nervous system of a subject by pulsing images displayed on a
      nearby computer monitor or TV set. For the latter, the image
      pulsing may be embedded in the program material, or it may be
      overlaid by modulating a video stream, either as an RF signal or
      as a video signal. The image displayed on a computer monitor may
      be pulsed effectively by a simple computer program. For certain
      monitors, pulsed electromagnetic fields capable of exciting
      sensory resonances in nearby subjects may be generated even as the
      displayed images are pulsed with subliminal intensity.<br>

      not go into the regular info stream, but goes out of that and out
      of band, then is encrypted and undetected.<br>

      Harvard and MIT scientists are challenging the conventional wisdom
      about light, and they didn’t need to go to a galaxy far, far away
      to do it.<br>
      <br>
      Working with colleagues at the Harvard-MIT Center for Ultracold
      Atoms, a group led by Harvard Professor of Physics Mikhail Lukin
      and MIT Professor of Physics Vladan Vuletic have managed to coax
      photons into binding together to form molecules – a state of
      matter that, until recently, had been purely theoretical. The work
      is described in a September 25 paper in Nature.<br>
      <br>
      The discovery, Lukin said, runs contrary to decades of accepted
      wisdom about the nature of light. Photons have long been described
      as massless particles which don’t interact with each other – shine
      two laser beams at each other, he said, and they simply pass
      through one another.<br>
      <br>
      “Photonic molecules,” however, behave less like traditional lasers
      and more like something you might find in science fiction – the
      light saber.<br>
      <br>
      “Most of the properties of light we know about originate from the
      fact that photons are massless, and that they do not interact with
      each other,” Lukin said. “What we have done is create a special
      type of medium in which photons interact with each other so
      strongly that they begin to act as though they have mass, and they
      bind together to form molecules. This type of photonic bound state
      has been discussed theoretically for quite a while, but until now
      it hadn’t been observed.<br>
      <br>
      “It’s not an in-apt analogy to compare this to light sabers,”
      Lukin added. “When these photons interact with each other, they’re
      pushing against and deflect each other. The physics of what’s
      happening in these molecules is similar to what we see in the
      movies.”<br>
      <br>
      To get the normally-massless photons to bind to each other, Lukin
      and colleagues, including Harvard post-doctoral fellow Ofer
      Fisterberg, former Harvard doctoral student Alexey Gorshkov and
      MIT graduate students Thibault Peyronel and Qiu Liang couldn’t
      rely on something like the Force – they instead turned to a set of
      more extreme conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers began by pumped rubidium atoms into a vacuum chamber,
      then used lasers to cool the cloud of atoms to just a few degrees
      above absolute zero. Using extremely weak laser pulses, they then
      fired single photons into the cloud of atoms.<br>
      <br>
      As the photons enter the cloud of cold atoms, Lukin said, its
      energy excites atoms along its path, causing the photon to slow
      dramatically. As the photon moves through the cloud, that energy
      is handed off from atom to atom, and eventually exits the cloud
      with the photon.<br>
      <br>
      “When the photon exits the medium, its identity is preserved,”
      Lukin said. “It’s the same effect we see with refraction of light
      in a water glass. The light enters the water, it hands off part of
      its energy to the medium, and inside it exists as light and matter
      coupled together, but when it exits, it’s still light. The process
      that takes place is the same it’s just a bit more extreme – the
      light is slowed considerably, and a lot more energy is given away
      than during refraction.”<br>
      <br>
      When Lukin and colleagues fired two photons into the cloud, they
      were surprised to see them exit together, as a single molecule.<br>
      <br>
      The reason they form the never-before-seen molecules?<br>
      <br>
      An effect called a Rydberg blockade, Lukin said, which states that
      when an atom is excited, nearby atoms cannot be excited to the
      same degree. In practice, the effect means that as two photons
      enter the atomic cloud, the first excites an atom, but must move
      forward before the second photon can excite nearby atoms.<br>
      <br>
      The result, he said, is that the two photons push and pull each
      other through the cloud as their energy is handed off from one
      atom to the next.<br>
      <br>
      “It’s a photonic interaction that’s mediated by the atomic
      interaction,” Lukin said. “That makes these two photons behave
      like a molecule, and when they exit the medium they’re much more
      likely to do so together than as single photons.”<br>
      <br>
      While the effect is unusual, it does have some practical
      applications as well.<br>
      <br>
      “We do this for fun, and because we’re pushing the frontiers of
      science,” Lukin said. “But it feeds into the bigger picture of
      what we’re doing because photons remain the best possible means to
      carry quantum information. The handicap, though, has been that
      photons don’t interact with each other.”<br>
      <br>
      To build a quantum computer, he explained, researchers need to
      build a system that can preserve quantum information, and process
      it using quantum logic operations. The challenge, however, is that
      quantum logic requires interactions between individual quanta so
      that quantum systems can be switched to perform information
      processing.<br>
      <br>
      “What we demonstrate with this process allows us to do that,”
      Lukin said. “Before we make a useful, practical quantum switch or
      photonic logic gate we have to improve the performance, so it’s
      still at the proof-of-concept level, but this is an important
      step. The physical principles we’ve established here are
      important.”<br>
      <br>
      The system could even be useful in classical computing, Lukin
      said, considering the power-dissipation challenges chip-makers now
      face. A number of companies – including IBM – have worked to
      develop systems that rely on optical routers that convert light
      signals into electrical signals, but those systems face their own
      hurdles.<br>
      <br>
      Lukin also suggested that the system might one day even be used to
      create complex three-dimensional structures – such as crystals –
      wholly out of light.<br>
      <br>
      “What it will be useful for we don’t know yet, but it’s a new
      state of matter, so we are hopeful that new applications may
      emerge as we continue to investigate these photonic molecules’
      properties,” he said.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>New Solar Power Material Converts 90
            Percent of Captured Light into Heat </b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A multidisciplinary engineering team at the University of
      California, San Diego developed a new nanoparticle-based material
      for concentrating solar power plants designed to absorb and
      convert to heat more than 90 percent of the sunlight it captures.<br>
      <br>
      The new material can also withstand temperatures greater than 700
      degrees Celsius and survive many years outdoors in spite of
      exposure to air and humidity. Their work, funded by the U.S.
      Department of Energy’s SunShot program, was published recently in
      two separate articles in the journal Nano Energy.<br>
      <br>
      By contrast, current solar absorber material functions at lower
      temperatures and needs to be overhauled almost every year for high
      temperature operations.<br>
      <br>
      “We wanted to create a material that absorbs sunlight that doesn’t
      let any of it escape. We want the black hole of sunlight,” said
      Sungho Jin, a professor in the department of Mechanical and
      Aerospace Engineering at UC San Diego Jacobs School of
      Engineering. Jin, along with professor Zhaowei Liu of the
      department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Mechanical
      Engineering professor Renkun Chen, developed the Silicon
      boride-coated nanoshell material. They are all experts in
      functional materials engineering.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Multi Scale Structures</b><br>
      <br>
      The novel material features a “multiscale” surface created by
      using particles of many sizes ranging from 10 nanometers to 10
      micrometers. The multiscale structures can trap and absorb light
      which contributes to the material’s high efficiency when operated
      at higher temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      Concentrating solar power (CSP) is an emerging alternative clean
      energy market that produces approximately 3.5 gigawatts worth of
      power at power plants around the globe—enough to power more than 2
      million homes, with additional construction in progress to provide
      as much as 20 gigawatts of power in coming years. One of the
      technology’s attractions is that it can be used to retrofit
      existing power plants that use coal or fossil fuels because it
      uses the same process to generate electricity from steam.<br>
      <br>
      Traditional power plants burn coal or fossil fuels to create heat
      that evaporates water into steam. The steam turns a giant turbine
      that generates electricity from spinning magnets and conductor
      wire coils. CSP power plants create the steam needed to turn the
      turbine by using sunlight to heat molten salt. The molten salt can
      also be stored in thermal storage tanks overnight where it can
      continue to generate steam and electricity, 24 hours a day if
      desired, a significant advantage over photovoltaic systems that
      stop producing energy with the sunset.<br>
      <br>
      One of the most common types of CSP systems uses more than 100,000
      reflective mirrors to aim sunlight at a tower that has been spray
      painted with a light absorbing black paint material. The material
      is designed to maximize sun light absorption and minimize the loss
      of light that would naturally emit from the surface in the form of
      infrared radiation.<br>

      <br>
      The UC San Diego team’s combined expertise was used to develop,
      optimize and characterize a new material for this type of system
      over the past three years.&nbsp; Researchers included a group of
      UC San Diego graduate students in materials science and
      engineering, Justin Taekyoung Kim, Bryan VanSaders, and Jaeyun
      Moon, who recently joined the faculty of the University of Nevada,
      Las Vegas. The synthesized nanoshell material is spray-painted in
      Chen’s lab onto a metal substrate for thermal and mechanical
      testing. The material’s ability to absorb sunlight is measured in
      Liu’s optics laboratory using a unique set of instruments that
      takes spectral measurements from visible light to infrared.<br>
      <br>
      Current CSP plants are shut down about once a year to chip off the
      degraded sunlight absorbing material and reapply a new coating,
      which means no power generation while a replacement coating is
      applied and cured. That is why DOE’s SunShot program (DE-EE005802)
      challenged and supported UC San Diego research teams to come up
      with a material with a substantially longer life cycle, in
      addition to the higher operating temperature for enhanced energy
      conversion efficiency. The UC San Diego research team is aiming
      for many years of usage life, a feat they believe they are close
      to achieving.<br>
      <br>
      Modeled after President Kennedy’s moon landing program that
      inspired widespread interest in science and space exploration,
      then-Energy Secretary Steven P. Chu launched the Sunshot
      Initiative in 2010 with the goal of making solar power cost
      competitive with other means of producing electricity by 2020.<br>

        </b><b>SOLAR ENERGY ABSORBING COATINGS AND METHODS OF
          FABRICATION</b><b><br>
        </b></div>
      <br>
      Methods, systems, and devices are disclosed for fabricating and
      implementing optically absorbing coatings. In one aspect, an
      optically selective coating includes a substrate formed of a solar
      energy absorbing material, and a nanostructure material formed
      over the substrate as a coating capable of absorbing solar energy
      in a selected spectrum and reflecting the solar energy in another
      selected spectrum. A concentrating solar power (CSP) system
      includes heat transfer fluids (HTFs); thermal energy storage
      system (TES); and solar receivers in communication with HTFs and
      including a light absorbing coating layer based on cobalt oxide
      nanoparticles...<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0004] Nanotechnology provides techniques or processes for
      fabricating structures, devices, and systems with features at a
      molecular or atomic scale, e.g., structures in a range of one to
      hundreds of nanometers in some applications. For example,
      nano-scale devices can be configured to sizes similar to some
      large molecules, e.g., biomolecules such as enzymes. Nano-sized
      materials used to create a nanostructure, nanodevice, or a
      nanosystem can exhibit various unique properties, e.g., including
      optical properties, that are not present in the same materials at
      larger dimensions and such unique properties can be exploited for
      a wide range of applications.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      [0005] Techniques, systems, devices and materials are disclosed
      for solar-absorbing coatings with ultra-high optical performance,
      including highly-scalable, low-cost fabrication processes to
      manufacture the solar energy-absorbing coatings of the disclosed
      technology. In some implementations, the coatings include
      nanoparticles (NPs) of black oxides deposited on high-temperature
      metal alloy surfaces, e.g., which can be in the form of standalone
      NPs or NPs embedded in a dielectric ceramic matrix.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The systems, devices and techniques disclosed in this
      patent document provide for synthesized C03O4black oxide
      nanoparticles using a facile hydrothermal process and novel
      designs and fabrication processes of light-absorbing coating
      structure for high-temperature CSP systems. By introducing
      sacrificial polymer fillers into the nanopowder-based coating
      slurry, the surface texturing can be successfully obtained and the
      optical performance can be enhanced, as measured by a high figure
      of merit of 88.2%. For high temperature durability, a long-term
      aging test can be performed to show that the light-trapping
      structure remains intact after 750°C exposure in air for 1,000
      hours. Consequently, the FOM shows negligible change after the
      1,000-hour exposure. The textured C03O4coating is a promising
      candidate for solar absorbing in next-generation high-temperature
      CSP systems. The C03O4layer can easily be spray-coated in a manner
      suitable for large-scale CSP receiver applications...<br>

      Abstract -- The present invention proposes a permanent and
      prosperous solution to both human global warming (.about.0.26 to
      0.74.degree. F.) as well as natural global warming (.about.7 to
      9.degree. F.). It simultaneously employs all three of the physical
      laws to thermostatically regulate Earth: Macro solar energy
      reflection; sequestration of absorbed solar energy; and, enhanced
      infrared radiation from Earth. Temporal and spatial macro aerosol
      water evaporation is employed to triple-cool Earth’s surface, by
      way of: 1. Low-altitude atmospheric and oceanic vapor-cooling
      and/or macro storage of artificial snow; 2. Automatic ascension of
      lightweight water vapors to high-altitudes for enhanced
      water-phase-change infrared radiation from Earth, and; 3.
      Increased cloud coverage to reflect more incoming solar energy.
      Deep subterranean, high temperature, high pressure, permanent
      sequestration of macro quantities of absorbed solar energy assists
      terrestrial surface-cooling, but also duals as retrievable long
      term solar-energy-storage to power macro evaporators–without
      requiring conventional fossil or nuclear sources. The present
      invention has other applications such as: 1. dramatically enhanced
      space-conditioning efficiency if combined with
      potable-water-patent U.S. Pat. No. 6,688,129.sup.1, and; 2.
      long-term macro solar energy storage for totally reliable,
      boundless solar-electric power. However, the principal objective,
      by far, is the stabilization of glacial-melting and
      glacial-growth, in order to permanently stabilize the oceans at
      their present levels to preserve our vital global seaports. This
      document endorses both human (AGW or, anthropogenic global
      warming) and ancient natural global warming processes...<br>

      The world desperately needs a new inexpensive reliable safe energy
      source-an energy source that can eliminate our dependence on
      foreign oil. The energy source described in this little book is
      just such a new energy source. The author has found the secrets of
      unlocking the E = mc2 energy in any matter. Reactor fuel need not
      be Uranium, Plutonium, or Hydrogen. It could be sand, water, air,
      garbage, toxic chemicals, or high level radioactive wastes-just to
      get rid of them. A little bit of fuel goes an extremely long way.
      The type of reactor that can do all these things is the Electrino
      Fusion Power Reactor. Electrinos are a better fit in particle
      physics than quarks, and more symmetric. Electrinos have the
      interesting property that they can fuse to become new
      particles-but each time they do so, they switch from matter to
      antimatter, or vice versa. We take advantage of this phenomenon to
      annihilate any matter to obtain energy for electricity generation.
      Some of the discoveries in this book are as old as 1983. Some came
      in 1995. Others came in 2004. The discovery, however, that made
      the EFP Reactor efficient enough to be self-sustaining and viable
      did not come until October 2007. The principle reactions, however,
      were not understood until July, 2008. Thus the EFP Reactor is a
      new discovery. The EFP Reactor, however, is not a single source of
      energy. Two kinds of energy sources are required in EFP Reactors.
      One type of energy produced is entropy energy for electricity
      production. The other type of energy produced with the reactor is
      positive order energy. This type of energy is necessary to make
      the accelerators 100% efficient and keep the irradiated electric
      panels from degrading with the strong radiation.<br>

        <b>by Dave Mihlovic</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      …In a recent study published in Science, a team of researchers
      from Weill Cornell Medicine, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Tufts
      Medical Center, Harvard Medical School and The Johns Hopkins
      Kimmel Cancer Center found that high doses of vitamin C -- roughly
      equivalent to the levels found in 300 oranges -- impaired the
      growth of mutant colorectal tumors in cultured cells and mice. The
      findings could lead to the development of new natural treatments
      and provide critical insights into who would most benefit from
      them…<br>
      <br>
      In an oxygen-rich environment such as human arteries, a fraction
      of vitamin C, also called ascorbic acid, becomes oxidized and is
      transformed into a new compound called dehydroascorbic acid (DHA).
      Scientists have known for some time that a specific membrane
      protein, known as glucose transporter GLUT1, enables both glucose
      and DHA to enter cells -- an activity not afforded to ascorbic
      acid. But it was less clear what DHA does once inside the cells.<br>
      <br>
      In the study, investigators show that DHA acts like a Trojan
      horse. Once inside, natural antioxidants inside the cancer cell
      attempt to convert the DHA back to ascorbic acid; in the process,
      these antioxidants are depleted and the cell dies from oxidative
      stress.<br>
      <br>
      "While many normal cells also express GLUT1, KRAS-mutant and
      BRAF-mutant cancer cells typically have much higher levels since
      they require a high rate of glucose uptake in order to survive and
      grow," Dr. Cantley said. "Also, KRAS and BRAF mutant cells produce
      more reactive oxygen species than normal cells and therefore need
      more antioxidants in order to survive. This combination of
      characteristics makes these cancer cells far more vulnerable to
      DHA than normal cells or other types of cancer cells."...<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      More than half of human colorectal cancers (CRCs) carry either
      KRAS or BRAF mutations, and are often refractory to approved
      targeted therapies. We report that cultured CRC cells harboring
      KRAS or BRAF mutations are selectively killed when exposed to high
      levels of vitamin C. This effect is due to increased uptake of the
      oxidized form of vitamin C, dehydroascorbate (DHA), via the GLUT1
      glucose transporter. Increased DHA uptake causes oxidative stress
      as intracellular DHA is reduced to vitamin C, depleting
      glutathione. Thus, ROS accumulates and inactivates glyceraldehyde
      3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Inhibiting GAPDH in highly
      glycolytic KRAS or BRAF mutant cells leads to an energetic crisis
      and cell death not seen in KRAS and BRAF wild-type cells.
      High-dose vitamin C impaired tumor growth in Apc/KrasG12D mutant
      mice. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for exploring
      the therapeutic use of vitamin C for CRCs with KRAS or BRAF
      mutations.<br>

        <b>Method for preparation of periodic waveguide optical gratings
          on lithium niobate crystal</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A method for preparation of periodic waveguide optical gratings in
      a lithium niobate substrate through two-time titanium diffusion.
      The periodic waveguide optical gratings are prepared in the
      lithium niobate substrate of lithium niobate through two-time
      titanium diffusion. Two modes of two-time titanium diffusion are
      provided, wherein according to the first mode, a grating structure
      with periodic changing of the refractive index is formed in the
      lithium niobate substrate through the first time of titanium
      diffusion, and a single-mode strip-shaped waveguide structure is
      formed in the lithium niobate substrate through the second time of
      titanium diffusion; according to the second mode, the single-mode
      strip-shaped waveguide structure is formed in the lithium niobate
      substrate through the first time of titanium diffusion, and the
      grating structure with periodic changing of the refractive index
      is formed in the lithium niobate substrate through the second time
      of titanium diffusion. The periodic waveguide optical gratings are
      formed in the lithium niobate substrate through the first time of
      titanium diffusion and the second time of titanium diffusion. The
      method has the advantages that the preparation method is simple
      and easy to operate, the precision of the prepared gratings is
      high, the period of the gratings can be correspondingly adjusted
      as needed, the cost is low, and popularization and application are
      facilitated.<br>

      We Americans are obsessed with rule-following and the law to the
      point of ignorance. We think of rules and laws as something from
      on high that must not be broken. We don’t believe we are free to
      ignore the law, even if it kills us to obey it. We quite literally
      accept the notion that the law is what is supreme and the law is
      what is noble and that it is the law that must be defended at all
      costs. We give our lives to protect the law.<br>
      <br>
      The fact is, that makes no sense. At all. Where do I begin?<br>
      <br>
      The law can’t be supreme, only our lives can hold supreme meaning.
      Laws cannot be noble, only people can be noble. The law doesn’t
      need to be defended, because it can’t be harmed; in fact, it
      doesn’t even exist except inside people’s heads. People need to be
      defended, because we can be harmed, we can cease to exist. And
      because we are irreplaceable and life is sacred, we need to take
      steps to defend and protect life. Therefore, giving our lives to
      defend something that can’t be harmed makes no sense. What is the
      law for if it is not to protect and defend our lives?<br>
      <br>
      Here are a couple of obvious basics about laws, which will
      probably not come as any surprise. In the first place, the law and
      the rules are nothing more than words. They are words written on
      paper or posted on signs. The words do not come from on high, or
      from beyond, nor are they eternal and immutable. They are not by
      any means guaranteed to be fair, or right, or moral, or correct,
      and there is no legal obligation for them to be any of those
      things….<br>
      <br>
      &amp;c...<br>
      <br>
      … The law has become so far removed from the average citizen that
      it has become a monster. It consumes us in our ignorance. Because
      the law and those who “uphold” it are both self-concerned and
      self-worshiping, there is little doubt that our current system of
      so-called law and order, our system of justice, is only concerned
      with it’s own power and continued control over the public and very
      little else.<br>
      <br>
      We are always right to challenge the law anytime we see it working
      in contradiction to simple truth and justice, and sadly, it often
      does just that. The bottom line is that our system of laws is no
      more real or valid or powerful than we decide to let it be, and
      although it would claim to have power over us, it does not and
      cannot, there is no mechanism or proof of any such thing. We can
      walk away from it any time we like and just blow it off.<br>
      <br>
      We can say, “You are invalid and we are no longer interested in
      playing your stupid power games that control us and our lives and
      are patently unfair. Leave us alone, you are nothing. We are
      better off without you.” We can indeed turn and walk away anytime,
      and that is the truth, the natural law, our birthright, something
      that cannot be changed. It is the reality of human law.<br>
      <br>
      It is always up to us what our own laws are, and it is always up
      to us whether or not to accept them, obey them, abide by them or
      have anything to do with them. The only power human law has is the
      power we give it. And the power we give it can also be taken away,
      by us.<br>
      <br>
      That is the reality of power, and the fact is that reality has
      been subverted and propagandized by very clever, very devious,
      very evil people who have sold us the notion that they must have
      power over us to keep us safe. That is always a lie. No one can
      keep us safe. If you think that through, you’ll realize the truth
      of it. Fear is the tool that enslaves us. And nonexistent power is
      what keeps us beneath those who feed off of us and deprive us of
      natural justice..<br>

        </big><br>
        <b>by</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Paul Craig Roberts</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The re-enserfment of Western peoples is taking place on several
      levels. One about which I have been writing for more than a decade
      comes from the offshoring of jobs. Americans, for example, have a
      shrinking participation in the production of the goods and
      services that are marketed to them.<br>
      <br>
      On another level we are experiencing the financialization of the
      Western economy about which Michael Hudson is the leading expert
      (Killing The Host). Financialization is the process of removing
      any public presence in the economy and converting the economic
      surplus into interest payments to the financial sector.<br>
      <br>
      These two developments deprive people of economic prospects. A
      third development deprives them of political rights. The
      Trans-Pacific and Trans-Atlantic Partnerships eliminate political
      sovereignty and turn governance over to global corporations.<br>
      <br>
      These so called “trade partnerships” have nothing to do with
      trade. These agreements negotiated in secrecy grant immunity to
      corporations from the laws of the countries in which they do
      business. This is achieved by declaring any interference by
      existing and prospective laws and regulations on corporate profits
      as restraints on trade for which corporations can sue and fine
      “sovereign” governments. For example, the ban in France and other
      counries on GMO products would be negated by the Trans-Atlantic
      Partnership. Democracy is simply replaced by corporate rule.<br>
      <br>
      I have been meaning to write about this at length. However,
      others, such as Chris Hedges, are doing a good job of explaining
      the power grab that eliminates representative government.<br>
      <br>
      <a
href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/1/The-Most-Brazen-Corporate-by-Chris-Hedges-American-Hypocrisy_Americans-For-Prosperity_Corporate-Citizenship_Corporate-Crime-151107-882.html"

      <br>
      The corporations are buying power cheaply. They bought the entire
      US House of Representatives for just under $200 million. This is
      what the corporations paid Congress to go along with “Fast Track,”
      which permits the corporations’ agent, the US Trade
      Representative, to negotiate in secret without congressional input
      or oversight. <br>
      <br>
      <a
href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/Almost-200-Million-Donate-by-Paola-Casale-Banking_Congress_Control_Corporations-150620-523.html"
        "><b>http://www.opednews.com/articles/Almost-200-Million-Donate-by-Paola-Casale-Banking_Congress_Control_Corporations-150620-523.html</b><b><br>
        </b></a><br>
      In other words, a US corporate agent deals with corporate agents
      in the countries that will comprise the “partnership,” and this
      handful of well-bribed people draw up an agreement that supplants
      law with the interests of corporations. No one negotiating the
      partnership represents the peoples’ or public’s interests. The
      governments of the partnership countries get to vote the deal up
      or down, and they will be well paid to vote for the agreement.<br>
      <br>
      Once these partnerships are in effect, government itself is
      privatized. There is no longer any point in legislatures,
      presidents, prime ministers, judges. Corporate tribunals decide
      law and court rulings.<br>
      <br>
      It is likely that these “partnerships” will have unintended
      consequences. For example, Russia and China are not part of the
      arrangements, and neither are Iran, Brazil, India, and South
      Africa, although seperately the Indian government appears to have
      been purchased by American agribusiness and is in the process of
      destroying its self-sufficient food production system. These
      countries will be the repositories for national sovereignty and
      public control while freedom and democracy are extinguished in the
      West and the West’s Asian vassals.<br>
      <br>
      Violent revolution throughout the West and the complete
      elimination of the One Percent is another possible outcome. Once,
      for example, the French people discover that they have lost all
      control over their diet to Monsanto and American agribusiness, the
      members of the French government that delivered France into
      dietary bondage to toxic foods are likely to be killed in the
      streets.<br>
      <br>
      Events of this sort are possible throughout the West as peoples
      discover that they have lost all control over every aspect of
      their lives and that their only choice is revolution or death.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>THERE HAS BEEN A CREEPY DEVELOPMENT WITH
          FACEBOOK</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Get off Facebook NOW, and NEVER hit anyone elses profile or click
      a like again, EVER, Facebook is now BANNED for anyone with an
      ounce of awareness<br>
      <br>
      Via a bug Facebook installs when you visit their web site or click
      a like, even if you have no account with facebook Facebook can
      keep on monitoring visitors permanently forever after, including
      all phone numbers, PASSWORDS TO OTHER WEB SITES, every site you
      ever visit ever again, and more.<br>
      <br>
      There has been a new development with Facebook. Facebook now
      plants a bug on your computer that hands them your phone numbers,
      browsing history, and tracks all future history as well as all
      photos and anything else you do on your computer if you ever hit
      the web site or ever click a like, even if you have no facebook
      account. Facebook has gone full hostile, AVOID FACEBOOK LIKE THE
      PLAGUE.<br>
      <br>
      How do I know this? Easy, Belgium ordered them to stop doing it,
      and published the court case.<br>
      <br>
      A court in Belgium has ordered Facebook to stop tracking the
      country's Internet users who are not members of the US-based
      social networking website.<br>
      <br>
      "Today the judge... ordered the social network Facebook to stop
      tracking and registering Internet usage by people who surf the
      Internet in Belgium within the 48 hours which follow this
      statement," the court said on Monday.<br>
      <br>
      The ruling follows a case lodged in June by the Belgian Privacy
      Commission, which said Facebook indiscriminately tracks Internet
      users when they click "like" or "share" on the website, or when
      they visit Facebook pages even if they do not have accounts with
      the website, according to the court.<br>
      <br>
      "If Facebook ignores this order it must pay a fine of 250,000
      euros (269,000 dollars) a day to the Belgian Privacy Commission,"
      the court noted.<br>
      <br>
      It also said the networking site uses a special cookie called
      "datr" that lodges on Internet users' device to track their
      activities.<br>
      <br>
      Datr provides Facebook with access to an amazing amount of user's
      personal information, such as the Internet protocol (IP) address
      of the computer, browsing data, outside login information, phone
      numbers, AND MORE. What can be defined as "more?" Well, More than
      IP address, browsing data, login information to other web sites,
      and phone numbers has GOT TO mean your photos, anything you type,
      EVERYTHING because that is the only way it could be more than
      log-ins to other web sites and your phone numbers! FACEPLANT IS
      MALWARE ON STEROIDS, AND YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO SIGN UP OR INSTALL
      ANYTHING, ONE HIT TO FACEPLANT GETS YOU NAILED.<br>
      <br>
      The Belgian court also said "this is personal data, which
      according to Belgian law, Facebook can only use if the Internet
      user expressly gives their consent, as Belgian privacy law
      dictates."<br>
      <br>
      In response, Facebook said it would appeal against the decision,
      emphasizing that the cookie was safe.<br>
      <br>
      "We've used the datr cookie for more than five years to keep
      Facebook secure for 1.5 billion people around the world," the
      website's spokesman said in a statement emailed to AFP.<br>
      <br>
      LET ME DEFINE HOW FACEBOOK DEFINES SECURE AND SAFE: "OUTSIDE LOG
      IN INFORMATION" MEANS WEB SITES OTHER THAN FACEBOOK. HOW "SECURE"
      OR "SAFE" IS IT FOR FACEBOOK TO GET YOUR GMAIL, PAYPAL, AND OTHER
      LOG INS WHEN THERE IS NO CONCEIVABLE WAY THEY WOULD WANT THEM IF
      THEY DID NOT INTEND TO USE THEM?<br>
      <br>
      Despite Paypal log ins being encrypted, all it takes is a
      keylogger to hand over the data, outside the encryption stream. If
      Faceplant is so invasive they deserve your Yahoo, Gmail, and other
      "outside" log in data, what is stopping them from logging
      everything, and I MEAN EVERYTHING?<br>
      <br>
      Yeah, the cookie (which is malware by a different name if it can
      do all of that) is "safe" for the Jewish community, which can then
      obviously use it as a gateway to rape everything on your computer
      and anything you have on the web wholesale. That is the only way
      "more" than "outside log ins and phone numbers" can possibly be
      "more". Got a skydrive? Faceplant is IN! Got an online bank
      account? Faceplant is IN! Got a web site you administer? Faceplant
      is in there too, they have gone five steps over the line and off
      the cliff, DITCH THEM OR IT WILL BE DOOM, FACEPLANT IS THE NSA
      WITH NO CHECK AND BALANCE WHATSOEVER.<br>
      <br>
      I hate to say it, but Facebook could probably even censor other
      web sites via that "cookie!" If they are that invasive, Facebook
      could do it ALL if they have THAT MUCH access to your computer.<br>
      <br>
      And this court case in Belgium is very real, it happened, this is
      not a guess, an uncle story, or any sort of fiction. Most likely
      the only way to make sure Facebook is gone for good is to wipe
      your hard drive and start over, and NEVER hit that site again or
      ever even click a "like" EVER AGAIN. I am confident Faceplant is
      way too filthy to get rid of just by "deleting cookies",<br>
      If they set something up that can get your phone numbers and log
      in data to other web sites and more just because you visited their
      site with no account at all, well, that is a hell of a lot more
      than just a cookie, that is the most virulent auto-installing
      malware on the planet and if they can install that type of program
      on your computer automatically without you knowing it, they can
      plant any "evidence" they want on your computer as well, NO IFS OR
      BUTS.<br>
      <br>
      And guess what? Google is a percentage of that evil. You see, if
      you get an android phone, Google continuously tracks your location
      and keeps the record permanently. And Google does hand the
      information over when asked. And Google has a fine habit of
      keeping track of android phone after android phone and linking the
      history as you change phones, and always has, as it turns out,
      everything since 2009 (the beginning of Android) has been
      permanently stored at Google, every phone number dialed, every
      place you ever went, everything you bought or scanned, ALL OF IT.
      Who needs the NSA? Google and Faceplant have done the job for
      them!...<br>

            Allowed In Public Office</b></big><br>

        <b>by <br>
          <br>
          David M. Dodge</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      In the winter of 1983, archival research expert David Dodge, and
      former Baltimore police investigator Tom Dunn, were searching for
      evidence of government corruption in public records stored in the
      Belfast Library on the coast of Maine.<br>
      <br>
      By chance, they discovered the library’s oldest authentic copy of
      the Constitution of the United States (printed in 1825). Both men
      were stunned to see this document included a 13th Amendment that
      no longer appears on current copies of the Constitution. Moreover,
      after studying the Amendment’s language and historical context,
      they realized the principle intent of this “missing” 13th
      Amendment was to prohibit lawyers from serving in government. So
      began a seven year, nationwide search for the truth surrounding
      the most bizarre Constitutional puzzle in American history — the
      unlawful removal of a ratified Amendment from the Constitution of
      the United States.<br>
      <br>
      Since 1983, Dodge and Dunn have uncovered additional copies of the
      Constitution with the “missing” 13th Amendment printed in at least
      eighteen separate publications by ten different states and
      territories over four decades from 1822 to 1860. In June of this
      year (1991), Dodge uncovered the evidence that this missing 13th
      Amendment had indeed been lawfully ratified by the state of
      Virginia and was therefore an authentic Amendment to the American
      Constitution. If the evidence is correct and no logical errors
      have been made, a 13th Amendment restricting lawyers from serving
      in government was ratified in 1819 and removed from the U.S.
      Constitution during the tumult of the Civil War. Since the
      Amendment was never lawfully repealed, it is still the Law today.
      The implications are enormous.<br>
      <br>
      The story of this “missing” Amendment is complex and at times
      confusing because the political issues and vocabulary of the
      American Revolution were different from our own. However, there
      are essentially two issues: What does the Amendment mean? and, Was
      the Amendment ratified? Before we consider the issue of
      ratification, we should first understand the Amendment’s meaning
      and consequent current relevance.<br>
      <br>
      <b>MEANING of the 13th Amendment</b><br>
      <br>
      The “missing” 13th Amendment to the Constitution of the United
      States reads as follows:<br>
      <br>
      “If any citizen of the United States shall accept, claim, receive,
      or retain any title of nobility or honour, or shall without the
      consent of Congress, accept and retain any present, pension,
      office, or emolument of any kind whatever, from any emperor, king,
      prince, or foreign power, such person shall cease to be a citizen
      of the United States, and shall be incapable of holding any office
      of trust or profit under them, or either of them.”<br>
      <br>
      At the first reading, the meaning of this 13th Amendment (also
      called the “title of nobility” Amendment) seems obscure;
      unimportant. The references to “nobility,” “honour,” “emperor,”
      “king,” and “prince,” lead us to dismiss this Amendment as a petty
      post-revolution act of spite directed against the British
      monarchy. The U.S. modern world of Lady Di and Prince Charles,
      make anti-royalist sentiments seem so archaic and quaint, that the
      Amendment can be ignored.<br>
      <br>
      Not so. Consider some evidence of its historical significance:
      First, “titles of nobility” were prohibited in both Article VI of
      the Articles of Confederation (1777) and in Article I, Sections 9
      and 10 of the Constitution of the United States (1787);<br>
      <br>
      Second, although already prohibited by the Constitution, an
      additional “title of nobility” amendment was proposed in 1789,
      again in 1810, and according to Dodge, finally ratified in 1819.
      Clearly, the founding fathers saw such a serious threat in “titles
      of nobility” and “honors” that anyone receiving them would forfeit
      their citizenship. Since the government prohibited “titles of
      nobility” several times over four decades, and went through the
      amending process (even though “titles of nobility” were already
      prohibited by the Constitution), it’s obvious that the Amendment
      carried much more significance for our founding fathers than is
      readily apparent today...<br>

      Enough facts are in to paint a very clear picture now.<br>
      <br>
      The histories of the supposed shooters may be fabricated. This is
      because when the reporters ransacked the house, they "found" this
      ID on the left here, notice how "Revenue" is spelled. There is no
      reason to have a fake ID like this, this is supposed to be a state
      work ID and if she did not actually have that job, there would be
      no purpose in having any ID for it at all. So this ID was forged,
      probably by the media and/or whoever staged this false flag.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="fakeid.jpg" height="218"
          width="315"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The lawyer that got assigned to this case ended up being a huge
      problem for the false flag crew because he ended up being a good
      guy. And he spilled a key piece of evidence on national television
      - that both shooters were found behind the back seat of the SUV
      shot to pieces and already in handcuffs. So this opens a huge can
      of worms that blows a lot of secrets, the story HAS TO go like
      this now:<br>
      <br>
      The couple was hunted down as they were out and about together,
      murdered, and stuffed in the back of the SUV behind the rear seat.
      Subsequently (and there is no other way this could happen) the
      SUV, which was completely modern and full drive by wire, was then
      remote control driven and the police shot it full of holes until a
      bullet cut a wire somewhere and it stopped. The police reported
      the couple was in full combat gear, but in reality the wife (who
      was the only one shown after the police shot up the SUV) was in
      shorts, high heels, and a short bare tummy blouse.<br>
      <br>
      So the story about combat gear is a lie, and because the couple
      were already handcuffed, the story about "brandishing weapons and
      shooting at police" was also a lie, which is subsequently proven
      by the fact that the windows were rolled up when shot out.<br>
      <br>
      THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT FOR BUSTING THIS ENTIRE
      RUSE : In ALL photos and video, the windows of the SUV are rolled
      up yet shot out. Yet the police claimed they were receiving fire
      from assault rifles from this vehicle. If this couple was using
      assault rifles, they would not have been able to fire them through
      closed windows because the barrels are too long, it is impossible
      to be in a car and point one out the side with the windows rolled
      up because there simply is not enough room in a car to do that.
      And no one is stupid enough to try to shoot a gun in an enclosed
      chamber like a car with the windows rolled up, the back blast
      would be severe. The fact they were up in all photos is cold proof
      no bullets were ever fired from this SUV, all the bullet damage is
      from police.<br>
      <br>
      So now we have a fake ID, an impossible shooting scene (they did
      not shoot from the vehicle as police claimed even if they were not
      found dead behind the back seat already in handcuffs) and because
      they were behind the back seat in handcuffs, we also are FORCED TO
      have a story about a remote controlled vehicle being shown on the
      news. There is absolutely no other way this can happen. And the
      fact reporters and neighbors were allowed into the home so soon
      afterward, before any real investigation could be completed, is
      the icing on the cake, if this was real this would have never
      happened, NEVER, IN ANYONE'S LIFE...<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Murdered Holistic Doctors Had
            Discovered Autism/Cancer-Causing Enzyme Intentionally Being
            Added to All Vaccines</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      So apparently the holistic doctors who were all being killed in
      Florida had found out via their research that the nagalase enzyme
      protein is INTENTIONALLY being added to the population via
      immunizations. Nagalase STOPS vitamin D from binding to the Gc
      protein. This completely strips a human being’s body of it’s
      natural ability to kill cancer cells. Nagalase is a protein that’s
      also created by all cancer cells. This protein is also found in
      very high concentrations in autistic children. And they’re PUTTING
      it in our vaccines!! This prevents the body from utilizing the
      Vitamin D necessary to fight cancer and prevent autism. Nagalese
      disables the immune system. It’s also known to cause Type 2
      Diabetes. So basically…they weren’t killing these doctors because
      they had found the cure to cancer or were successfully treating
      autism… they’re killing them because these Dr’s had been
      researching and had the evidence that the vaccines they’re
      injecting our precious children with are CAUSING our current
      cancer and autism crisis!! And that it’s obviously being done
      knowingly and on purpose! The doctors they killed in Florida had
      been collaborating and were getting ready to go public with the
      information.<br>
      <br>
      Depopulation 101..add poison to vaccines…make it law that all
      children must be injected to attend school. Slow kill methods.
      They think they’re being fair w/ their “survival of the fittest”
      method . Only the best genes survive? These ppl have no souls.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Ted Broer breaks the above info (about the nagalese) in this
      clip. He explains it much better than I do. The clip is short
      (from his July 25th Hagmann &amp; Hagmann interview) but it’s a
      MUST listen. Dr Ted Broer broke it on The Hagmann &amp; Hagmann
      Report and it took them a whole hour just to get him on air b/c
      their 3 hour show was brought down and every line they tried to
      use kept disconnecting..and then their servers were brought down.
      They asked a bunch of ppl to pray against the attack and then
      finally got him on a secured line..and so a full hour into the
      show they were finally back on the air and connected to Dr Broer
      and the first thing he said was “I am in no way suicidal.” He was
      super nervous holding onto this info…afraid he’d be taken out
      Hastings style before he got a chance to say it publicly. So
      listen to this short clip of him breaking the story. It’s a 19 min
      clip but the most important info is heard within the first 10 min.
      It is def some of the most important news Ive ever heard. And it
      needs to go viral.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Purpose</b><br>
      <br>
      To determine the contents of chicken nuggets from 2 national food
      chains.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background</b><br>
      <br>
      Chicken nuggets have become a major component of the American
      diet. We sought to determine the current composition of this
      highly processed food.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Methods</b><br>
      <br>
      Randomly selected nuggets from 2 different national fast food
      chains were fixed in formalin, sectioned and stained for
      microscopic analysis.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><br>
      <br>
      Striated muscle (chicken meat) was not the predominate component
      in either nugget. Fat was present in equal or greater quantities
      along with epithelium, bone, nerve, and connective tissue.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusion</b><br>
      <br>
      Chicken nuggets are mostly fat, and their name is a misnomer.<br>

      Dr. Rick D. deShazo, professor of medicine and pediatrics, has
      grandkids who, like most kids, LOVE chicken nuggets.<br>
      <br>
      He wanted to know what really makes them addictively tasty. He
      used an unusual method not commonly used on food - staining,
      fixing and microscopic analysis by a pathologist.<br>
      <br>
      After seeing the results of two random nuggets from two fast-food
      chains, he said, "I was FLOORED."<br>

      I wrote the first three parts of this article back in September
      and planned to finish it in early October, but life intervened and
      truthfully I don’t think I was ready to confront how bad things
      will likely get as this Fourth Turning moves into the violent,
      chaotic war stage just over the horizon. The developments in the
      Middle East, Europe, U.S., China and across the globe in the last
      months have confirmed my belief war drums are beating louder,
      global war beckons, and much bloodshed will be the result. Fourth
      Turnings proceed at their own pace within the 20 to 25 year crisis
      framework, but there is one guarantee – they never de-intensify as
      they progress. Just as Winter gets colder, stormier and more
      bitter as you proceed from December through February, Fourth
      Turnings get nastier, grimmer, more perilous, with our way of life
      hanging in the balance.<br>
      <br>
      In Part 1 of this article I discussed the catalyst spark which
      ignited this Fourth Turning and the seemingly delayed regeneracy.
      In Part 2 I pondered possible Grey Champion prophet generation
      leaders who could arise during the regeneracy. In Part 3 I focused
      on the economic channel of distress which is likely to be the
      primary driving force in the next phase of this Crisis. In Part 4
      I will assess the social and cultural channels of distress
      dividing the nation, Part 5 the technological, ecological,
      political, military channels of distress likely to burst forth
      with the molten ingredients of this Fourth Turning, and finally in
      Part 6 our rendezvous with destiny, with potential climaxes to
      this Winter of our discontent.<br>
      <br>
      The road ahead will be distressful for everyone living in the
      U.S., as we experience the horrors of war, economic collapse,
      civil chaos, political upheaval, and the tearing of society’s
      social fabric. The pain and suffering being experienced across the
      globe today will not bypass the people of the United States.
      Winter has arrived and lethal storms are gathering in the
      distance. Don’t think you can escape. You can prepare, but this
      Crisis will reshape our society for better or worse, and you
      cannot sidestep the consequences or cruel environment we must
      survive.<br>
      <br>
      “Reflect on what happens when a terrible winter blizzard strikes.
      You hear the weather warning but probably fail to act on it. The
      sky darkens. Then the storm hits with full fury, and the air is a
      howling whiteness. One by one, your links to the machine age break
      down. Electricity flickers out, cutting off the TV. Batteries
      fade, cutting off the radio. Phones go dead. Roads become
      impossible, and cars get stuck. Food supplies dwindle. Day to day
      vestiges of modern civilization – bank machines, mutual funds,
      mass retailers, computers, satellites, airplanes, governments –
      all recede into irrelevance. Picture yourself and your loved ones
      in the midst of a howling blizzard that lasts several years. Think
      about what you would need, who could help you, and why your fate
      might matter to anybody other than yourself. That is how to plan
      for a saecular winter. Don’t think you can escape the Fourth
      Turning. History warns that a Crisis will reshape the basic social
      and economic environment that you now take for granted.” – Strauss
      &amp; Howe – The Fourth Turning<br>
      Social Distress<br>
      <br>
      The vast and growing Grand Canyon sized gap between the haves and
      have nots, and the societal implications of an elitist
      uber-wealthy minority capturing the levers of our economic,
      financial, and political systems, using that control to further
      enrich themselves at the expense of the isolated working class,
      can be clearly understood by following the dialogue between three
      billionaires chatting on stage at a conference thrown by a
      convicted Wall Street criminal.<br>
      <br>
      Sheryl Sandberg: “Yeah, so let’s follow up on a bunch of the
      things we were talking about. Let’s start with income inequality.”<br>
      <br>
      Hank Paulson: “Ok, well.. income inequality. I think this is
      something we’ve all thought about. You know I was working on that
      topic when I was still at Goldman Sachs..”<br>
      <br>
      Robert Rubin: “In which direction? You were working on increasing
      it.”<br>
      <br>
      Hank Paulson then bursts out laughing: “Yeah! We were making it
      wider!”<br>
      <br>
      Paulson and Rubin spent vast portions of their lives working for
      the vampire squid on the face of America – Goldman Sachs. This
      firm represents everything wrong with our social order, as they
      use all means (legal or illegal) to enrich themselves, whether it
      be back stabbing clients, double crossing partners, eviscerating
      vulnerable competitors, robbing the poor, rigging markets, buying
      influence, placing executives in the highest levels of government,
      or screwing the taxpayer when their risky gambles blow up the
      world. Paulson and Rubin are the perfect representatives of the
      .1% ruling class who protect their interests and the interests of
      their crony capitalist colleagues at all costs. They truly believe
      they are shrewder, more astute, cleverer, deserving of the
      billions they have absconded through rigging the markets, should
      be running the country behind the scenes, and merit the worship of
      the lowly peasantry.<br>
      <br>
      The gap between the richest 1% and the bottom 90% has never been
      wider in history. The previous largest gap occurred in 1929, at
      the start of the last Fourth Turning. When the real median
      household income hasn’t advanced in the last 26 years and men’s
      real wages are where they were in 1971, while CEOs of S&amp;P 500
      companies make 331 times their workers and Wall Street hedge fund
      managers make billions while paying no taxes, you have building
      anger, disillusionment and calls for retribution.<br>
      <br>
      Some people are waking up to the fact the Ben Bernanke led Federal
      Reserve and the Hank Paulson/Tim Geithner led Treasury saved their
      buddies on Wall Street while throwing the people on Main Street
      under the bus. When Wall Street’s leveraged risk bets pay off,
      they reap all the riches – as is happening today. When their
      colossal wagers go bad, the propaganda about systematic failure is
      rolled out and the American people are stuck with the losses. The
      goal has always been to revive the stock market and make sure the
      Wall Street banks continue to generate billions in profits, while
      leaving the taxpayer on the hook for their failed bets.<br>
      <br>
      The OWS and Tea Party were both grass roots initiated movements as
      a societal response to the distress created by Wall Street and
      their government crony cohorts. The Wall Street banks colluded
      with DHS and captured politicians of both parties to crush OWS and
      subvert the Tea Party. The Deep State’s success in squashing
      dissent from what they considered the lowly peasants has only been
      temporarily papered over by the $10 trillion of debt issued to
      keep the masses sedated, deluded and ignorant about the true
      nature of the ongoing crisis. The storyline about the 1% is
      misleading, as many people in the 1% are small business owners,
      doctors, and professional workers. The true story is the
      exponential wealth increase of the .1% over the last 35 years as
      the financialization of the economy has enriched psychopathic,
      highly educated men who produce nothing but misery, debt, and
      ultimately social unrest.<br>
      <br>
      Decomposing the 1% reveals the top .1% increasing their share of
      the national wealth from less than 9% in 1980 to over 21% today.
      These are the corporate CEO’s buying back their company stock at
      all-time highs in order to boost their stock based compensation,
      Wall Street executives who committed the largest control fraud in
      world history while unabashedly flaunting laws &amp; regulations,
      hedge fund managers who manipulate and rig the markets while
      paying no taxes on their billion dollar profits, and billionaire
      cronies who profit from the military industrial complex and sick
      care complex by paying off politicians to write laws in their
      favor and funnel government contracts to them. The sacking and
      pillaging of the nation’s wealth by psychopaths who are never
      satisfied with their current vast level of riches, power and
      control, exposes itself in the tremendous recovery on Wall Street
      and the ongoing depression on Main Street.<br>
      <br>
      A simmering rage is bubbling below the surface as 20% of American
      households rely on food stamps to survive, the percentage of
      Americans in the labor force stands at a four decade low, real
      household income remains stagnant at 1988 levels, corporate
      profits have reached record levels while corporations continue to
      fire Americans – shipping their jobs overseas, and the six
      mega-corporations representing the mainstream media cover up the
      truth, mislead the public with propaganda, while celebrating the
      .1% as saviors of our economy. There is nothing more volatile to
      societal stability than millions of unemployed men, growing angry
      and resentful towards the ruling class for their lot in life.<br>
      <br>
      The vast gulf between the haves and have nots will fuel further
      violence between the classes, as our fraying society is already
      seething with anger between races, religions, political parties,
      and genders. The increasingly brutal police state, militarization
      of local police forces, shaking down of citizens through fines,
      and unlawful surveillance of our electronic communications, will
      lead to a backlash against police.<br>
      <br>
      The Black Lives Matter movement, begun after a number of police
      brutality incidents against black men, has been hijacked by
      politically motived race baiters and is exacerbating tensions
      between blacks and whites. The false storyline perpetuated by the
      media disregards the fact blacks, who represent 13% of the
      population, commit 22% of all violent crimes and 93% of black
      shooting victims are shot by other blacks. The white population,
      abiding by laws, is getting sick of being blamed for the gun
      violence and lawlessness in liberal ghetto bastions like Chicago,
      Detroit, Baltimore, St. Louis and Philadelphia.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cultural Distress</b><br>
      <br>
      Even though the vast majority of gun related crimes happen in
      urban ghettos and the much publicized mass shootings are committed
      by mentally deranged young men on psychotropic drugs, liberal
      control freak politicians use scare tactics and misinformation in
      their effort to grab the guns of law abiding Americans living in
      rural regions. It is the elitist hypocrite politicians living on
      the coasts, protected by armed guards, who want to eviscerate the
      2nd Amendment, and think it is fine for the 4th Amendment to be
      disregarded by police thugs across the land. Disarming the
      citizenry is essential to implementing a dictatorial regime. The
      race wars have intensified, as the Black Lives Matter meme has
      spread to college campuses in Missouri and in the hallowed Ivy
      League at Yale and Princeton.<br>
      <br>
      The bullying tactics of the pampered participation trophy
      generation of entitled millennials, being misled by social justice
      warrior ideologues, is fueling a backlash by older generations who
      studied, worked hard, obtained useful college degrees, repaid
      their student loans, and didn’t use race, gender, or
      micro-aggressions as excuses when they failed. College campuses,
      which once championed free speech and free thought, have now
      become bastions of censorship, left wing ideology, suppression of
      opinion, shouting down of dissent, thought control, and subduing
      the rights of the majority for the benefit of an outraged minority
      who resort to violent rhetoric to achieve their outcomes.<br>
      <br>
      Institutions of higher education have become nothing more than
      glorified daycare centers for kids who never grew up, learned
      personal responsibility, or developed critical thinking skills.
      The feckless college faculty and administrators have allowed
      financial considerations to override learning, as the curriculum
      has been dumbed down to meet the degraded capabilities of their
      high self-esteem/low intelligence students. The reality of an
      increasingly brutal economic environment and high likelihood of
      war is about to crash headlong into the coddled, pampered, parent
      protected, iGadget, facebook worlds of millions of millennials.<br>
      <br>
      They will be nothing but cannon fodder for the Deep State unless
      they develop a backbone, start thinking critically about what is
      happening in this world, start dealing with reality, stop trusting
      the government to save them, and make a stand against the
      corporate fascist tyranny consuming our nation. The Peter Pan
      Syndrome, where people with the body of an adult but the mind of a
      child, increasingly dominate the landscape, as a larger number of
      supposed adults exhibit emotionally immature behaviors. The
      self-neutering of young men is the result of twelve years of
      feminist social engineering in government controlled public
      schools. The wussificiation is complete.<br>
      <br>
      The combination of social justice warriors, pushing agendas
      completely out of step with mainstream Americans, and a dying
      legacy media providing infotainment disguised as news, fuels
      further cultural distress from coast to coast. With liberalism
      rampant and dominant on the coasts and conservatism governing the
      heartland, the cultural divide in the country is a gaping chasm.
      Average Americans trying to live their lives, pay their bills, and
      raise families have no strong opinions about gay marriage, men
      dressing like women, or other deviant behavior performed by
      consenting adults in the privacy of their own households. But when
      the liberal media, social justice warriors, and Hollywood elites
      shove the “right” to gay marriage, the crucifying of people for
      their religious beliefs, the “courage” of a man pretending to be a
      woman, and the glorification of abhorrent behavior, down the
      throats of Americans trying to mind their own business, an
      unforeseen backlash is inevitable.<br>
      <br>
      The war on the traditional family unit, white males, societal
      norms, common decency, and community standards has gone too far
      and the pushback from common decent middle class folks has begun.
      It is a proven fact that households with married parents are on
      average wealthier, raise kids who do better in school, can
      withstand economic setbacks better, and have been the backbone of
      this country since its inception. The feminist belief that women
      can raise children without men has proven to be a disaster.<br>
      <br>
      With the percentage of married households plunging from over 70%
      in 1970 to under 50% today, an ominous tipping point has been
      reached. Rather than address this truly disastrous problem, the
      radical feminists and race baiters carry on their culture wars.
      The social justice warriors, prodded by the liberal media and
      agenda driven ideologues, are offended by free speech, white
      people, men, married couples, religious freedom, having to repay
      loans, gun owners, capitalism, carbon dioxide, meat, yoga and
      anyone who dares to disagree with their antagonistic, bombastic,
      vacuous nonsense.<br>
      <br>
      Shockingly, they aren’t offended by the tattooed, pierced freaks
      roaming the streets, angry because no one will hire them. They
      aren’t offended by the millions of willfully ignorant, low class
      army of lazy Obama voters who feel entitled to free housing, free
      medical care, free food, free phones, and free education at the
      expense of the working middle class. They aren’t offended by the
      70% of black babies born out of wedlock and black men shirking
      their responsibilities as fathers. They aren’t offended by the
      rampant criminality and murder rates in the Democrat controlled
      urban ghettos, created by the welfare policies implemented over
      the last 50 years.<br>
      <br>
      They aren’t offended by 93% of black murders being committed by
      blacks. They aren’t offended by a president droning wedding
      parties and bombing hospitals, while fighting undeclared wars in
      foreign lands. They aren’t offended by the widespread Medicare,
      SSDI, and food stamp fraud, costing taxpayers billions per year.
      Normal people living normal lives are sick and tired of the
      hypocritical, hollow horseshit rubbed in their faces by a dying
      legacy media and agenda driven social networks on a daily basis.
      The foolishness and lunacy of these feckless feeble minded
      warriors against normalcy will be exposed when confronted by the
      harsh reality of a Fourth Turning.<br>
      <br>
      The rise of Donald Trump and Ben Carson in the early polls for
      Republican presidential candidate is being fueled by a rising
      anger and discontent with the corporate media promoting offensive
      social agendas, the flaunting of the Constitution by a president
      ruling by executive order, a GOP establishment corrupted by power
      and unanswerable to their constituents, the disinterest of
      politicians in both parties in securing our porous southern
      borders from foreign invasion by illegal hordes. Now the
      repercussions of Obama ignoring the threats of Islamic extremism
      and allowing tens of thousands of undocumented Syrian refugees to
      flood into the country immediately overwhelming our insolvent
      welfare system and refusing to assimilate into our culture as they
      worship at mosques where they are taught to hate everything about
      American culture, is further fueling a political backlash.<br>
      <br>
      As Aldous Huxley realized six decades ago, the truth is
      unimportant to those controlling the “free” press and shallow
      distractions will keep the masses occupied while the controllers
      achieve their goals.<br>
      <br>
      “In regard to propaganda the early advocates of universal literacy
      and a free press envisaged only two possibilities: the propaganda
      might be true, or it might be false. They did not foresee what in
      fact has happened, above all in our Western capitalist democracies
      — the development of a vast mass communications industry,
      concerned in the main neither with the true nor the false, but
      with the unreal, the more or less totally irrelevant. In a word,
      they failed to take into account man’s almost infinite appetite
      for distractions.” – Aldous Huxley, 1958, in the article The
      Capitalist Free Press<br>
      <br>
      The media will use their standard propaganda techniques of showing
      crying women and children to tug at the heartstrings of a naïve,
      unaware populace to allow refugees from a conflict created by the
      U.S. in Syria to come into our country. You know the tired
      rhetoric – give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses
      yearning to breathe free. But this is a Fourth Turning where the
      harsh reality crashes headlong into rhetoric, memes, and
      storylines.<br>
      <br>
      Whether the U.S. government is responsible or not for creating the
      wave of Islamic radicals practicing their warped religious beliefs
      across the globe by committing murder against innocent people, the
      fact remains that only Muslims are waging this war against
      non-believers. There are no Catholics, Baptists, Lutherans, Jews,
      Buddhists, or atheists spreading their religious beliefs by
      committing acts of terror or waging war. A religious war is
      brewing and the consequences will be far reaching and bloody for
      those practicing Islam. There may be only a small minority of
      radical jihadists, but the silence of the majority speaks volumes
      to non-Muslims around the world.<br>
      <br>
      As this Fourth Turning continues to intensify, the bowing down to
      political correctness and agendas of social justice warrior bigots
      by traditional minded Americans is going to stop. The pushback may
      be violent, as the aggressive tactics of these free speech hating
      fascists is met with armed confrontation they aren’t anticipating.
      These “warriors” aren’t exactly the Hero generation who did the
      heavy lifting during the last Fourth Turning. Privileged,
      entitled, ignorant millennials bullying weak kneed college
      professors and milquetoast administrators on the campuses of
      liberal arts colleges isn’t exactly storming the beaches of
      Normandy or battling through the jungles on Guadalcanal.<br>
      <br>
      When confronted with Americans who have seen their standard of
      living falling for the last twenty five years and are sick and
      tired of hearing drivel about white privilege, black lives matter,
      safe spaces, gay and transgender “rights”, micro-aggressions, rape
      culture, misogyny, $15 minimum wage, and a myriad of other
      offenses against feminism, these easily offended “warriors” will
      piss their pants. These trivialities will seem so quaint when they
      are confronted with an angry guy with a gun on the streets or when
      they are told to report for duty as we wage war with Russia and
      China. The foolishness of the culture wars will become strikingly
      apparent when economic collapse and life or death choices confront
      our special snowflake generation.<br>

      Nigerians Are Building Fireproof, Bulletproof, And Eco-Friendly
      Homes With Plastic Bottles And Mud - See more at:
http://www.thinkinghumanity.com/2015/11/nigerians-are-building-fireproof-and-eco-friendly-homes-with-plastic-bottles-and-mud.html#sthash.28TRXbbK.dpuf<br>
      <br>
      These colorful homes are bulletproof, fireproof, and can withstand
      earthquakes. They also maintain a comfortable temperature, produce
      zero carbon emissions, and are powered by solar and methane gas
      from recycled waste…<br>
      <br>
      o create a two-bedroom bottle house, workers fill plastic bottles
      with sand and then hold them together using mud and cement. This
      forms a solid wall that is stronger than cinder blocks…<br>
      <br>
      At least Nigeria isn’t as wasteful as the United States, which
      discards 130 million bottles per day. That’s 47 billion bottles
      every year – nearly 80% of which end up in the landfill.<br>
      <br>
      If the United States were to save these bottles and repurpose them
      into houses like folks in Nigeria are doing, 9,257 houses could be
      built per day. That is nearly 3.4 million houses a year, reports
      Off Grid World. With 3.5 million people living on the streets in
      the U.S., is this the solution needed to remedy the homelessness
      crisis?<br>

      When it comes to the problems of the world, stupidity is not the
      cause. In fact, it’s a lack of stupidity that’s the issue.<br>
      <br>
      Yep, it might sound strange…<br>
      <br>
      But today, we’re going to make the case for stupidity.<br>
      <br>
      Our argument is we need more… not less… stupidity embedded into
      our social structure.<br>
      <br>
      That’s right…<br>
      <br>
      Only massive amounts of dumbness, dear LFT patron, will save us
      from ourselves...<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      -- Earlier this week, you might recall, we talked about chaos
      theory — and how it could lead to a more enlightened economic
      future.<br>
      <br>
      The paradox of what chaos theory is uncovering is something our
      esteemed classical liberals knew all along…<br>
      <br>
      Unfettered chaos (see: freedom) has an infinitely complex “hidden
      order” with the potential to create more peace, prosperity, and
      opportunity than any form of controlled chaos (see: government
      intervention) ever could.<br>
      <br>
      The reason why is simple…<br>
      <br>
      We say this, of course, with our tongue fixed firmly in our cheek:
      Humans are stupid. You. Me. All of us. It’s just a fact of life.
      We make mistakes. We fail to see the bigger picture. We think in
      linear terms for nonlinear problems. Our thoughts lack the
      dimensions necessary to understand life’s complexities in their
      rawest form.<br>
      <br>
      And only the most irrational — and destructive — humans believe
      they are smart enough to save the world.<br>
      <br>
      Economists A.O. Hirschman and Charles E. Lindblom spilled much ink
      on man’s limited ability to solve problems. Especially in terms of
      government policy.<br>
      <br>
      Complex policies, they said, are always doomed to fail due to
      conflicting values, inadequate information, and complexity far
      beyond our intellectual capacities.<br>
      <br>
      One man or woman — or even a group of men and women — is too dumb
      to solve far-reaching problems. This is why Lindblom described
      policymaking as “disjointed incrementalism” and “muddling
      thought.”<br>
      <br>
      Nature doesn’t accomplish awe-inspiring feats through a few tiny
      brains in a boardroom planning out the lives of billions of
      sentient beings. Instead, it does so through bit-by-bit baby steps
      of unplanned changes.<br>
      <br>
      Central planners, as has been shown time and time again, are only
      competent at creating bad chaos — the type that destroys
      indiscriminately (and sometimes discriminately), regardless of
      productivity and value to the world-at-large.<br>
      <br>
      Destructive chaos is what happens when external controls overpower
      the internal mechanics of autonomous systems, throwing them out of
      whack. Which is, mind you, what every alphabet agency in the
      federal government is doing (inadvertently or otherwise) as you
      read these words...<br>
      <br>
      “Although unrecognized by the general public,” L.K. Samuels writes
      in his book In Defense of Chaos, “command-based systems are
      constantly at war [with] most members of society. This perpetual
      political warfare represents the opaque barricade that separates
      the governed from the governing, and accounts for the strife over
      who will be assigned the role of superior or subordinate.<br>
      <br>
      “Because the two are diametrically opposed to each other’s sphere
      of self-interest, conflict will affect every course of action.
      Like a drunken teenager in a fast sports car, the political
      adherents don’t care as much about direction as about commanding
      the steering wheel.<br>
      <br>
      “Usually indifferent, most members of society merely seek a free
      ride, but they often find themselves at destinations not of their
      choosing. This divergence is inherent in myopic systems that are
      consistently inconsistent.<br>
      <br>
      “One reason is that it is impossible for a monopolistic structure
      to impose actions on any two individuals that will generate an
      equal outcome — inevitably, one will benefit more, and one will
      suffer more. Over time, citizen alienation tends to increase,
      especially when politicos tighten their obsessive-compulsive grip
      on the steering wheel.”<br>
      <br>
      -- Which brings us to why we need more stupidity in power… not
      less.<br>
      <br>
      The more freedom we have as stupid individuals to act in our own
      self-interest, the more our actions will tend to benefit the
      whole.<br>
      <br>
      How do we know this?<br>
      <br>
      Because the Universe is composed of self-organizing, complex
      systems. And the most successful systems operate autonomously, a
      process known as autopoiesis.<br>
      <br>
      Systems benefit the whole when each self-determined individual
      unit is free to respond to its environment by evolving and
      adapting to individual external challenges.<br>
      <br>
      When we are free to better our own lives, we tend to better the
      lives of others in the process.<br>
      <br>
      Complex systems, consequently, operate in a state of
      disequilibrium. They are awash with unknown factors, microscopic
      interactions, and unforeseeable forces. Making top-down control
      impossible, unneeded, and, indeed… unnecessary.<br>
      <br>
      “In a sociopolitical context,” L.K. Samuels writes, “this means
      that individual agents of society are more likely to facilitate
      greater cohesion and coordination on their own, than when
      operating in a fixed, governed whole.”<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, decentralized systems are not the byproduct of nature’s
      success — they are the very cause.<br>
      <br>
      Brain researchers, to give one example, constantly hit a wall with
      what they call the “homunculus problem.”<br>
      <br>
      “… there seems to be nobody — no homunculus — inside our brain who
      does the thinking,” Jesper Hoffmeyer, a biosemitic researcher at
      the University of Copenhagen says, “there just is no central
      processor to control the activities of the mind.”<br>
      <br>
      --You’ve heard us say it over and over — the centralized model is
      going to be thrown out of the window.<br>
      <br>
      Due in large part to the rush of technology, the pace of
      decentralization is outstripping the government’s ability to keep
      up.<br>
      <br>
      Christian Jacob, head of the Evolutionary and Swarm Design (ESD)
      Research Group at the University of Calgary made a massive
      understatement, we believe, when he said:<br>
      <br>
      “For some types of applications, a collection of small, simple
      agents with limited intelligence, local decision-making
      capability, and a communication path to nearby peers can
      outperform a large centralized processor.<br>
      <br>
      “Moreover,” Jacobs went on, explaining why decentralization will
      prevail, “a decentralized system has several important advantages
      over a centralized one, most notably robustness and flexibility.”<br>
      <br>
      Best part? We as individuals don’t need to understand all of it.
      We can stay stupid, do our part by pursuing our own happiness, and
      let the rest take care of itself.<br>
      <br>
      “The surest way to smartness,” founder of Wired, Kevin Kelly,
      writes in his book, New Rules For the New Economy, “is through
      massive dumbness.”<br>
      <br>
      We just need to set free the “stupid” units and let magic happen.<br>
      <br>
      Or else, we’ll continue to read stories like this one from the
      Washington Examiner…<br>
      <br>
      --“Until recently,” the article reads, “the insurance giants saw
      Obamacare as a cash cow.<br>
      <br>
      “They are now finding the law’s insurance marketplaces to be
      sickly quagmires causing billions in losses.”<br>
      <br>
      Didn’t see that one coming.<br>
      <br>
      And here’s the punchline…<br>
      <br>
      “In response, the Obamacare insiders — the wealthy and powerful
      operatives who alternate between top government jobs and top
      industry jobs — are hustling to find more bailout money for
      insurers.”<br>
      <br>
      Surprise.<br>
      <br>
      Yes, this is a result of stupidity. But to fix this problem, we
      say, we need less government and… yes… more stupidity.<br>
      <br>
      [Ed. note: If you’re a regular sufferer of our daily missives,
      you’ll recall we recently took a trip to the Cayman Islands in
      search of a better healthcare system. Well… we found it. Tomorrow,
      we’ll embark upon another quest for something else entirely. And
      when we find it, you’ll be the first to know.]<br>
      <br>
      Stay stupid,<br>
