      <div align="center"><b>Fountain of youth? Study finds new
          anti-ageing compound in plant</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      &nbsp;In Japan, the slightly bitter leaves of the Ashitaba plant
      have long been considered healthy, and a new study has found the
      traditional belief may have good scientific grounds.<br>
      <br>
      A natural substance in the plant appears to induce a key process
      that helps remove the "cellular garbage" that can build up as
      cells age and cause a range of diseases and disorders.<br>
      <br>
      "It is always nice to find a scientific rationale for traditional
      medical folk tales," said Frank Madeo, a professor at the
      University of Graz's Institute of Molecular Biosciences, in
      Austria.<br>
      <br>
      Madeo, who helped lead the research, said the substance known as
      4,4'-dimethoxychalcone or DMC, which occurs naturally in Ashitaba
      plants, induces a process called autophagy.<br>
      <br>
      "This is a cleansing and recycling process," he told AFP. It
      removes "superfluous material, especially cellular garbage like
      aggregated proteins."<br>
      <br>
      That "cleaning" process is key to sustained good health as the
      body ages. When cells fail to promptly and efficiently remove
      damaged parts, they can build up and that can lead to diseases
      including cancer.<br>
      <br>
      There are already a handful of compounds known to scientists that
      work to stimulate the cleaning process. Fasting also appears to
      naturally encourage cells to undertake spring cleaning.<br>
      <br>
      But in a bid to expand the field of compounds able to protect
      cells and turn back the hands of time, the team of researchers
      turned to a class of substances called flavonoids.<br>
      <br>
      Many flavonoids have already been shown to have a range of
      beneficial effects, ranging from anti-inflammatory properties to
      protecting against brain degeneration and cancer.<br>
      <br>
      The team reasoned that they might find flavonoids that could also
      help prevent destructive ageing in cells.<br>
      <br>
      They screened 180 compounds representing various subcategories of
      flavonoids, looking for candidates that might have the natural
      ability to "counteract age-related cell demise."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cell-protective capacity -</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      After initial screening, they settled on DMC and started by
      testing how the substance affected yeast cells.<br>
      <br>
      They discovered it was indeed helping to protect the yeast cells
      from the effects of ageing, and that the substance performed as
      well or even better than some existing compounds prized for their
      cell-protective capacity like resveratrol, which occurs in grape
      skin, among other places.<br>
      <br>
      The team then tested DMC's effect on cells in both worms and fruit
      flies -- common test subjects in medical research.<br>
      <br>
      "Remarkably, chronic DMC treatment... prolonged the median
      lifespan of both model organisms by approximately 20 percent," the
      study published Wednesday in the Nature Communications journal
      says.<br>
      <br>
      Additional tests showed the compound helped protect cells in mice
      hearts through the autophagy process, and even protected against a
      kind of liver damage caused by ethanol intoxication.<br>
      <br>
      The team also tested DMC's effect on several types of human cells
      and found that there too the substance worked to slow ageing.<br>
      <br>
      "The experiments indicate that the effects of DMC might be
      transferable to humans, although we have to be cautious and wait
      for real clinical trials," said Madeo.<br>
      <br>
      The research is still in the early stages and Madeo said next
      steps will include testing whether the positive effects of DMC in
      mice hearts extend more broadly to protect mice against ageing and
      age-related diseases.<br>
      <br>
      "Eventually, clinical trials on humans are needed," he added.<br>

      the whistle on CNN's fraud for governments is gone over thoroughly
      and then video of her actually talking about it is shown. She

      Facts don't matter, it is whatever whoever pays CNN to say that
      gets presented and published. They are a for-pay propaganda

          Hallmarks by Partial Reprogramming</b><br>
        <b>Alejandro Ocampo, et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Highlights</b><b><br>
      </b>Partial reprogramming erases cellular markers of aging in
      mouse and human cells<br>
      Induction of OSKM in progeria mice ameliorates signs of aging and
      extends lifespan<br>
      In vivo reprogramming improves regeneration in 12-month-old
      wild-type mice<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary</b><b><br>
      </b>Aging is the major risk factor for many human diseases. In
      vitro studies have demonstrated that cellular reprogramming to
      pluripotency reverses cellular age, but alteration of the aging
      process through reprogramming has not been directly demonstrated
      in vivo. Here, we report that partial reprogramming by short-term
      cyclic expression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OSKM)
      ameliorates cellular and physiological hallmarks of aging and
      prolongs lifespan in a mouse model of premature aging. Similarly,
      expression of OSKM in vivo improves recovery from metabolic
      disease and muscle injury in older wild-type mice. The
      amelioration of age-associated phenotypes by epigenetic remodeling
      during cellular reprogramming highlights the role of epigenetic
      dysregulation as a driver of mammalian aging. Establishing in vivo
      platforms to modulate age-associated epigenetic marks may provide
      further insights into the biology of aging.<br>

          in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <b>Study Description</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Brief Summary:</b><b><br>
      </b>Diabetes mellitus is the most common metabolic disorder
      worldwide. Some herbs are traditionally used in treatment of type
      2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Urtica Dioica (UD) or stinging nettle
      is traditionally used in Morocco, Turkey, Brasil, Jordan and with
      much frequency in northern Iran.<br>
      <br>
      Studies on animal models along with in vitro studies has shown
      hypoglycemic effect for aqueous extract of UD.<br>
      <br>
      This study aimed to investigate hypoglycemic effects of UD tea
      bags in patients with T2DM on glycemic control, insulin
      sensitivity, along with its effects on lipid profile (LP), blood
      pressure (BP), liver, and kidney function.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Detailed Description:</b><b><br>
      </b>The study will be performed under randomized, double-blind,
      placebo controlled, and case-control design. The object of this
      study is patients with T2DM. Patients are randomly assigned to
      start with placebo tea bags (3 tea bags as 2-gram tea bag steamed
      in boiling water for 20 minutes: mixture of bran powder which is
      already boiled in water twice plus spinach powder) in control
      groups and UD tea bags (3 tea bags as 2-gram tea bag steamed in
      boiling water for 20 minutes) in patients with T2DM for two
      months. Every two weeks, fasting glucose, postprandial glucose
      after a standard breakfast, serum insulin, lipids, alanine amino
      transferase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), creatinine
      (to calculate GFR), along with blood pressure will be measured.<br>
      <br>
      To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Randomized
      Clinical Trial.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>35 Mind Blowing Facts About America That
          Previous Generations Of Americans Never Would Have Believed</b><br>
      </div>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The only thing that seems to be constant in our society is change,
      and today America is changing at a pace that is more rapid than we
      have ever seen before.&nbsp; But is that a good thing or a bad
      thing? <br>
      <br>
      For a moment, I would like for you to imagine what it would be
      like for a group of average Americans from 1919 to suddenly be
      transported to our time.&nbsp; How do you think that they would
      feel about what we have become?&nbsp; Certainly they would be
      absolutely amazed by our advanced technology, but beyond that they
      would almost certainly have very strong opinions about the current
      state of our society.&nbsp; Similarly, if any of us were suddenly
      transported 100 years into the future, I am sure that we would be
      completely and utterly shocked by how things had changed.&nbsp;
      The decisions that we make today are going to echo long into the
      future, and if we make very bad decisions there might not be a
      future for our country at all.<br>
      <br>
      The following are 35 mind blowing facts about America that
      previous generations of Americans never would have believed…<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #1 Approximately one-fourth of the entire
      global prison population is in the United States.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #2 By the time an American child reaches the
      age of 18, that child will have seen approximately 40,000 murders
      on television.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #3 The average U.S. adult “logs 6 hours, 43
      minutes of total screen time daily”.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #4 Approximately 96 percent of all Americans
      use the Internet.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #5 According to the American Road and
      Transportation Builders Association, nearly 56,000 bridges in the
      United States are currently “structurally deficient”.&nbsp; What
      makes that number even more chilling is the fact that vehicles
      cross those bridges a total of 185 million times a day.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #6 In more than half of all U.S. states, the
      highest paid public employee in the state is a football coach.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #7 The Pentagon has more square footage of
      office space than any other office building in the entire world.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #8 The state of Alaska is 429 times larger than
      the state of Rhode Island.&nbsp; But Rhode Island has a
      significantly larger population than Alaska does.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #9 Alaska has a longer coastline than all of
      the other 49 U.S. states put together.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #10 The city of Juneau, Alaska is about 3,000
      square miles in size. It is actually larger than the entire state
      of Delaware.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #11 The average age of America’s dams is now 52
      years.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #12 The average supermarket in the United
      States wastes about 3,000 pounds of food each year.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #13 There are more than 75 million dogs in the
      United States, and that number is constantly growing.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #14 Montana has three times as many cows as it
      does people.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #15 The grizzly bear is the official state
      animal of California. But no grizzly bears have been seen in the
      state since 1922.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #16 The only place in the United States where
      coffee is grown commercially is in Hawaii.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #17 More than 2 million Americans work for
      Wal-Mart.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #18 Half of all American workers make less than
      $30,533 a year.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #19 According to one recent survey, 37 percent
      of all Americans eat fast food every 24 hours.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #20 One study found that one-third of all
      American teenagers haven’t read a single book in the past year.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #21 Almost one-third of all Millennials are
      still living with their parents.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #22 The suicide rate in the United States has
      risen by 33 percent since 1999.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #23 Women have earned at least 57 percent of
      all bachelor’s degrees in the United States for 18 years in a row.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #24 If the U.S. health care system was a
      country, it would have the fifth largest GDPon the entire planet.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #25 America does not have a single airport that
      is considered to be in the top 25 in the world.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #26 Today, a million Americans are living in
      their RVS, and that number is rising with each passing year.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #27 More than 100 churches in the United States
      are dying every single week.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #28 The original name of the city of Atlanta
      was “Terminus“.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #29 There are three towns in the United States
      that have the name “Santa Claus“.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #30 There is actually a town in Michigan called
      “Hell“, and during the recent polar vortex it actually froze over.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #31 Almost one-third of all land in the United
      States is owned by the federal government.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #32 More than 27 million acres of U.S. farmland
      is owned by foreigners.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #33 Congestion on our highways costs Americans
      approximately 101 billion dollars a year in wasted fuel and time.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #34 According to Bloomberg, it is being
      projected “that by 2025, shortfalls in infrastructure investment
      will subtract as much as $3.9 trillion from U.S. gross domestic
      product.”<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #35 In 1980, the U.S. national debt had just
      surpassed the one trillion dollar mark.&nbsp; In 2019, we are
      about to surpass the 22 trillion dollar mark with no end in sight.<br>
      <br>
      These days, just about everyone that tries to step forward and
      shake up the system is slapped with heavy criticism.<br>
      <br>
      But at least they are trying to do something.<br>
      <br>
      Holding an important position does not make you a leader.&nbsp;
      Rather, being a leader is about having a positive vision for the
      future and doing whatever you can to achieve that vision.<br>
      <br>
      We have way too many “leaders” out there that are simply filling
      seats.&nbsp; Our country is literally falling apart at the seams,
      and all they can think about is protecting their careers.<br>
      <br>
      America desperately needs change, but unfortunately we have very
      few change agents.&nbsp; So we continue to steamroll toward our
      date with destiny, and time is not on our side.<br>

        </div>
        <br>
        Sep Wudy the Farmer's Farmhand 20th Century<br>
        Lived in Bavaria a few miles from the border. Died in the First
        World War<br>
        <br>
        "As Sepp was called up to war [World War I] he said he wouldn't
        come back because he has to die in ice and snow. As it happened,
        he perished during the world war in the Dolomites. This is not
        the last war (1st world war), Sepp said, because then soon there
        will be another, and only after that the last one comes. This
        last one is more terrible than the other one. If you could see
        it, you would be able to talk to your cousin in Vienna from your
        own house, and if you needed him rapidly, he could be with you
        within one hour...<br>
        <br>
        The cause will be, that the people do not recognize the devil
        anymore, because he is dressed beautifully and promises
        everything to them. I also do not understand those that have no
        modesty at all, and they become more and more worse and godless,
        so that it must come to it, and, as already mentioned, it will
        be like one hundred years ago...<br>
        With the faith it goes downhill, and everything is rotated.
        Nobody knows about it. The upper ones already believe nothing at
        all, the lower ones will be made crazy. In the church they play
        dance music, and the parson will sing to it. Then they also
        dance, but outside there wil be a celestial sign, which
        announces the beginning of the large mischief...<br>
        <br>
        This is not the last war (1st world war) he said, because then
        soon there will be another, and only then the last one comes.
        One becomes more terrible than the other one. However what do I
        say? It does not concern you but tell it to your children and
        grandchildren. They will have to face with it and will
        experience the whole story...<br>
        <br>
        But outside there will be a celestial sign, which announces the
        beginning of the large mischief. There will be a shine in the
        north, like never seen before, and then the fire will be
        everywhere...<br>
        <br>
        The bohemian forrest will once be destroyed like straw barn.
        Don't run away when the gray birds are flying. If you see this,
        know that the end is near and it has already begun. It will then
        be like one hundred years ago. So much the people are thrown
        back and with this they will be punished for their
        wantonness....<br>
        <br>
        You have the meal in front of you and are not allowed to eat it,
        because it brings you the death, and you have the water and may
        not drink it, because it would also mean your death. From the
        Osser (mountain at the Bavarian-Bohemian boundary) there will
        still be a water source, there you can drink. The air devours
        into the skin such as poison. Put on all dresses you have and
        don't even let the tip of your nose uncovered. Place yourself
        into a hole and wait till it is all over, it will not last long,
        or look for a cave in the mountains. When you loose hair, it has
        gotten you. Take a Kronwittbirl (?) into the mouth, this will
        help, and please drink no milk for at least eight weeks....<br>
        <br>
        The end is near, and it has already begun. It will then be like
        one hundred years ago. So much the people are thrown back and
        with this they will be punished for their wantonness. It will be
        bad, and the later born ones at first have to annew learn
        writing and reading. The cause will be that the people do not
        recognize the Devil anymore, because he is dressed beautifully
        and promises everything to them. <br>
        "When no owl cries any more and the hares come to the house and
        collapse, then go away from the water and don't mow grass. In
        these times there will be no more border against Bavaria, but
        the border will be I cannot say." [Ed. comment: Wudy lived in
        Bohemia, few miles away from the border to Bavaria. This border
        doesn't exist anymore since the Czechs joined the European
        Union.)<b><br>

        </b>The war will break out in the southeast, but that is only a
        ruse. Thus the opposition is to be misled; Russia long prepared
        its plan of attack. Each Russian officer has the movement order
        already in the bag and waits only for the word. First, the main
        thrust is effected against Sweden and is directed then against
        Norway and Denmark ...<br>
        At the same time sections of the Russian army will advance by
        West Prussia, Saxonia and Thuringia to the Rhine, in order to
        gain control of Calais and the Channel coast. In the south the
        Russian army will join the Yugoslav army. Their armies will
        confederate to break in to Greece and Italy. The Holy Father
        must flee. He must flee fast, in order to escape the blood bath.
        Cardinals fall and bishops too are victims. Then they will try
        to advance by Spain and France to the Atlantic coast in order to
        unite with the army fighting in the north and to complete the
        military encirclement of the European mainland. The third
        Russian army, which task it is to occupy the left blank areas
        ... will be used no more, because the army is disturbed in its
        advance due to the revolutions in the south and is in rapid
        dissolution, while a great monarch determined by God will attack
        the army in the north at the Niederrhein and overpower it with
        the most modern weapons. In Saxonia, where the back-flooding
        army places itself again to the battle, it will be struck and
        destroyed. Thus the war is terminated in Germany. The remainder
        of Russia's staggering armies will be pursued deep into the
        internal parts of Russia and wiped out.<br>

          compound kills cancer cells</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A new compound based on Iridium, a rare metal which landed in the
      Gulf of Mexico 66 M years ago, hooked onto albumin, a protein in
      blood, can attack the nucleus of cancerous cells when switched on
      by light, University of Warwick researchers have found.<br>
      <br>
      The treatment of cancer using light, called Photodynamic therapy,
      is based on chemical compounds called photosensitizers, which can
      be switched on by light to produce oxidising species, able to kill
      cancer cells. Clinicians can activate these compounds selectively
      where the tumour is (using optical fibres) thus killing cancer
      cells and leaving healthy cells intact.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks to the special chemical coating they used, the Warwick
      group was able to hook up Iridium to the blood protein Albumin,
      which then glowed very brightly so they could track its passage
      into cancer cells, where it converted the cells' own oxygen to a
      lethal form which killed them.<br>
      <br>
      Not only is the newly formed molecule an excellent
      photosensitiser, but Albumin is able to deliver it into the
      nucleus inside cancer cells. The dormant compound can then be
      switched on by light irradiation and destroy the cancer cells from
      their very centre.<br>
      <br>
      The bright luminescence of the iridium photosensitiser allowed its
      accumulation in the nucleus of tumour cells and its activation
      leading to the cancer cell death to be followed in real time using
      a microscope.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Peter Sadler, from the Department of Chemistry at the
      University of Warwick comments:<br>
      <br>
      "It is amazing that this large protein can penetrate into cancer
      cells and deliver iridium which can kill them selectively on
      activation with visible light. If this technology can be
      translated into the clinic, it might be effective against
      resistant cancers and reduce the side effects of chemotherapy"<br>
      <br>
      Dr Cinzia Imberti, from the University of Warwick comments:<br>
      <br>
      "It is fascinating how albumin can deliver our photosensitiser so
      specifically to the nucleus. We are at a very early stage, but we
      are looking forward to see where the preclinical development of
      this new compound can lead."<br>
      <br>
      "Our team is not only extremely multidisciplinary, including
      biologists, chemists and pharmacists, but also highly
      international, including young researchers from China, India and
      Italy supported by Royal Society Newton and Sir Henry Wellcome
      Fellowships."<br>

          Conjugate for Photodynamic Cancer Therapy</b><br>
        <b>Dr. Pingyu Zhang, et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      An organoiridium–albumin bioconjugate (Ir1-HSA) was synthesized by
      reaction of a pendant maleimide ligand with human serum albumin.
      The phosphorescence of Ir1-HSA was enhanced significantly compared
      to parent complex Ir1. The long phosphorescence lifetime and high
      1O2 quantum yield of Ir1-HSA are highly favorable properties for
      photodynamic therapy. Ir1-HSA mainly accumulated in the nucleus of
      living cancer cells and showed remarkable photocytotoxicity
      against a range of cancer cell lines and tumor spheroids (light
      IC50; 0.8–5 µm, photo-cytotoxicity index PI=40–60), while
      remaining non-toxic to normal cells and normal cell spheroids,
      even after photo-irradiation. This nucleus-targeting
      organoiridium-albumin is a strong candidate photosensitizer for
      anticancer photodynamic therapy.<br>

      The invention belongs to the technical field of medicine and
      particularly relates to a novel four-nuclear iridium complex as
      well as a preparation method and an application thereof. The
      four-nuclear iridium complex has very strong fluorescence, singlet
      oxygen is produced under light, and the four-nuclear iridium
      complex has higher fluorescence and singlet oxygen quantum yield
      than a mononuclear iridium complex. In a dark environment, the
      four-nuclear iridium complex has toxicity for tumor cells, but has
      very high cytotoxicity for tumor cells under light, so that the
      four-nuclear iridium complex can be applied to PDT (photodynamic
      therapy).<br>

          turned into clean fuels, other products</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The United Nations estimates that more than 8 million tons of
      plastics flow into the oceans each year. A new chemical conversion
      process could transform the world's polyolefin waste, a form of
      plastic, into useful products, such as clean fuels and other
      items.<br>
      <br>
      "Our strategy is to create a driving force for recycling by
      converting polyolefin waste into a wide range of valuable
      products, including polymers, naphtha (a mixture of hydrocarbons),
      or clean fuels," said Linda Wang, the Maxine Spencer Nichols
      Professor in the Davidson School of Chemical Engineering at Purdue
      University and leader of the research team developing this
      technology. "Our conversion technology has the potential to boost
      the profits of the recycling industry and shrink the world's
      plastic waste stock."<br>
      <br>
      Wang, Kai Jin, a graduate student, and Wan-Ting (Grace) Chen, a
      postdoctoral researcher at Purdue, are the inventors of the
      technology, which can convert more than 90 percent of polyolefin
      waste into many different products, including pure polymers,
      naphtha, fuels, or monomers. The team is collaborating with Gozdem
      Kilaz, an assistant professor in the School of Engineering
      Technology, and her doctoral research assistant, Petr Vozka, in
      the Fuel Laboratory of Renewable Energy of the School of
      Engineering Technology, to optimize the conversion process to
      produce high-quality gasoline or diesel fuels.<br>
      <br>
      The conversion process incorporates selective extraction and
      hydrothermal liquefaction. Once the plastic is converted into
      naphtha, it can be used as a feedstock for other chemicals or
      further separated into specialty solvents or other products. The
      clean fuels derived from the polyolefin waste generated each year
      can satisfy 4 percent of the annual demand for gasoline or diesel
      fuels. Some results of Wang's study were published Jan. 29 in ACS
      Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering.<br>
      <br>
      Wang became inspired to create this technology after reading about
      the plastic waste pollution of the oceans, ground water, and the
      environment. Of all the plastics produced over the past 65 years
      (8.3 billion tons), about 12 percent have been incinerated and
      only 9 percent have been recycled. The remaining 79 percent have
      gone into landfills or the oceans. The World Economic Forum
      predicts that by 2050 the oceans will hold more plastic waste than
      fish if the waste continues to be dumped into bodies of water.<br>
      <br>
      Wang said the technology could convert up to 90 percent of the
      polyolefin plastic.<br>
      <br>
      "Plastic waste disposal, whether recycled or thrown away, does not
      mean the end of the story," Wang said. "These plastics degrade
      slowly and release toxic microplastics and chemicals into the land
      and the water. This is a catastrophe, because once these
      pollutants are in the oceans, they are impossible to retrieve
      completely."<br>
      <br>
      The work aligns with Purdue's Giant Leaps celebration,
      acknowledging the global advancements in sustainability as part of
      Purdue's 150th anniversary. This is one of the four themes of the
      yearlong celebration's Ideas Festival, designed to showcase Purdue
      as an intellectual center solving real-world issues.<br>
      <br>
      Wang said she hopes her technology will stimulate the recycling
      industry to reduce the rapidly rising amount of plastic waste. She
      and her team are looking for investors or partners to assist with
      demonstrating this technology at a commercial scale.<br>

      Foundation's Office of Technology Commercialization.<br>

      In this study, model PP was converted into oil using supercritical
      water at 380–500 °C and 23 MPa over a reaction time of 0.5–6 h. Up
      to 91 wt % of model PP was converted into oil at 425 °C with a 2–4
      h reaction time or at 450 °C with a 0.5–1 h reaction time. Higher
      reaction temperatures (&gt;450 °C) or longer reaction times (&gt;4
      h) led to more gas products. The oil products consisted of
      olefins, paraffins, cyclics, and aromatics. About 80–90 wt % of
      the oil components had the same boiling point range as naphtha
      (25–200 °C) and heating values of 48–49 MJ/kg. Reaction pathways
      for converting model PP into oil under the tested conditions were
      proposed. Preliminary analyses indicate that this conversion
      process is net-energy positive and potentially has a higher energy
      efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions than incineration
      and mechanical recycling. The oil derived from PP has the
      potential to be used as gasoline blendstocks or feedstocks for
      other chemicals.<br>

      </b><b>Summary</b><br>
      Antibiotics, though remarkably useful, can also cause certain
      adverse effects. We detected that<b> treatment of adult mice with
        antibiotics decreases hippocampal neurogenesis and memory
        retention. </b>Reconstitution with normal gut flora (SPF) did
      not completely reverse the deficits in neurogenesis unless the
      mice also had access to a running wheel or received probiotics. In
      parallel to an increase in neurogenesis and memory retention, both
      SPF-reconstituted mice that ran and mice supplemented with
      probiotics exhibited higher numbers of Ly6Chi monocytes in the
      brain than antibiotic-treated mice. Elimination of Ly6Chi
      monocytes by antibody depletion or the use of knockout mice
      resulted in decreased neurogenesis, whereas adoptive transfer of
      Ly6Chi monocytes rescued neurogenesis after antibiotic treatment.
      We propose that the rescue of neurogenesis and behavior deficits
      in antibiotic-treated mice by exercise and probiotics is partially
      mediated by Ly6Chi monocytes.<br>

          toes in major regenerative breakthrough </b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Researchers have concluded a “transformational” study in which,
      for the first time, they have successfully regenerated joint as
      well as bone tissue in amputated mice, a step which holds great
      promise for human limb regeneration.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists at Texas A&amp;M University were able to artificially
      stimulate growth in damaged or amputated limbs of neonatal mice,
      using just two proteins: BMP2 and BMP9.<br>
      <br>
      “These studies provide evidence that treatment of growth factors
      can be used to engineer a regeneration response from a
      non-regenerating amputation wound,”explain the researchers in
      their paper.<br>
      <br>
      Their new research indicates joint regrowth, a level of complexity
      hitherto unforeseen, which provides a critical step towards one
      day replacing human limbs. The scientists were attempting to
      recreate behavior typically displayed by reptilian cells in
      mammalian cells.<br>
      <br>
      Cancer-fighting nanomeds can do more harm than good, new research
      says Cancer-fighting nanomeds can do more harm than good, new
      research says<br>
      <br>
      “Our study is transformational,” Ken Muneoka from Texas A&amp;M
      University, told New Scientist. “They can do it, they just don't
      do it,” he adds. “So, we have to figure out what's constraining
      them."<br>
      <br>
      Bone regrowth has been achieved before, but without the additional
      protein, the bones would just heal over as normal rather than
      growing joint and cartilage tissue. Over 60 percent of the mice’s
      bone stumps formed a layer of cartilage within three days.<br>
      <br>
      While admittedly just a small step, the research could ultimately
      provide breakthroughs in treatments for disorders like
      osteoarthritis as it would allow for replacement of cartilage from
      a person’s own cells rather than relying on transplants.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      “These findings provide further support for the view that cells of
      a non-regenerative mammalian amputation wound retain the
      positional information necessary to re-build structures removed by
      amputation,” the researchers concluded.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>A major goal of regenerative medicine is to stimulate tissue
      regeneration after traumatic injury. We previously discovered that
      treating digit amputation wounds with BMP2 in neonatal mice
      stimulates endochondral ossification to regenerate the stump bone.
      Here we show that treating the amputation wound with BMP9
      stimulates regeneration of a synovial joint that forms an
      articulation with the stump bone. Regenerated structures include a
      skeletal element lined with articular cartilage and a synovial
      cavity, and we demonstrate that this response requires the Prg4
      gene. Combining BMP2 and BMP9 treatments in sequence stimulates
      the regeneration of bone and joint. These studies provide evidence
      that treatment of growth factors can be used to engineer a
      regeneration response from a non-regenerating amputation wound...<br>

          birth control</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      For decades, women have shouldered most of the burden of
      contraception. However, long-term use of female birth control
      pills could increase the risk for side effects such as blood clots
      or breast cancer. Now, inspired by colorful layered cocktails,
      researchers have developed a medium-term, reversible male
      contraceptive. They report their results in the journal ACS Nano.<br>
      <br>
      Common forms of male contraception are either short-term (condoms)
      or long-term (vasectomy). However, condoms can fail, and
      vasectomies, while effective, are not often reversible. Xiaolei
      Wang and colleagues wanted to devise a medium-term, reversible
      form of male contraception. They drew inspiration from cocktails,
      such as the Galaxy, that bartenders make by layering colorful
      liquids in a glass. If the beverage is stirred or heated, the
      layers combine into a uniform liquid. Wang and colleagues wondered
      if they could use a similar approach to inject layers of materials
      to block the vas deferens, the duct that conveys sperm from the
      testicle to the urethra. Applying heat would cause the layers to
      mix, breaking them down and "unplugging the pipeline."<br>
      <br>
      The team tested their approach in male rats. They sequentially
      injected four layers of materials into the vas deferens: a
      hydrogel that forms a physical barrier to sperm; gold
      nanoparticles, which heat up when irradiated with near-infrared
      light; ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), a chemical that
      breaks down the hydrogel and also kills sperm; and finally,
      another layer of gold nanoparticles. The injected materials kept
      the rats from impregnating females for more than 2 months.
      However, when the researchers shone a near-infrared lamp on the
      rats for a few minutes, the layers mixed and dissolved, allowing
      the animals to produce offspring. The researchers say that while
      this pilot experiment is promising, more research is needed to
      verify the safety of the materials.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>'Inkjet' solar panels poised to
          revolutionise green energy</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      hat if one day all buildings could be equipped with windows and
      facades that satisfy the structure's every energy need, whether
      rain or shine?<br>
      <br>
      That sustainability dream is today one step closer to becoming a
      reality thanks to Polish physicist and businesswoman Olga
      Malinkiewicz.<br>
      <br>
      The 36-year-old has developed a novel inkjet processing method for
      perovskites -- a new generation of cheaper solar cells -- that
      makes it possible to produce solar panels under lower
      temperatures, thus sharply reducing costs.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, perovskite technology is on track to revolutionise access
      to solar power for all, given its surprising physical properties,
      some experts say.<br>
      <br>
      "In our opinion, perovskite solar cells have the potential to
      address the world energy poverty," said Mohammad Khaja
      Nazeeruddin, a professor at Switzerland's Federal Institue of
      Technology Lausanne, an institution on the cutting-edge of solar
      energy research.<br>
      <br>
      Solar panels coated with the mineral are light, flexible,
      efficient, inexpensive and come in varying hues and degrees of
      transparency.<br>
      <br>
      They can easily be fixed to almost any surface -- be it laptop,
      car, drone, spacecraft or building -- to produce electricity,
      including in the shade or indoors.<br>
      <br>
      Though the excitement is new, perovskite has been known to science
      since at least the 1830s, when it was first identified by German
      mineralogist Gustav Rose while prospecting in the Ural mountains
      and named after Russian mineralogist Lev Perovski.<br>
      <br>
      In the following decades, synthesising the atomic structure of
      perovskite became easier.<br>
      <br>
      But it was not until 2009 that Japanese researcher Tsutomu
      Miyasaka discovered that perovskites can be used to form
      photovoltaic solar cells.<br>
      <br>
      - 'Bull's eye' -<br>
      <br>
      Initially the process was complicated and required ultra high
      temperatures, so only materials that could withstand extreme heat
      -- like glass -- could be coated with perovskite cells.<br>
      <br>
      This is where Malinkiewicz comes in.<br>
      <br>
      In 2013, while still a PhD student at the University of Valencia
      in Spain, she figured out a way to coat flexible foil with
      perovskites using an evaporation method.<br>
      <br>
      Later, she developed an inkjet printing procedure that lowered
      production costs enough to make mass production economically
      feasible.<br>
      <br>
      "That was a bull's eye. Now high temperatures are no longer
      required to coat things with a photovoltaic layer," Malinkiewicz
      told AFP. They panels can easily be fixed to almost any surface<br>
      <br>
      Her discovery quickly earned her an article in the journal Nature
      and media attention, as well as the Photonics21 Student Innovation
      award in a competition organised by the European Commission.<br>
      <br>
      The Polish edition of the MIT Technology Review also selected her
      as one of its Innovators Under 35 in 2015.<br>
      <br>
      She went on to cofound the company Saule Technologies -- named
      after the Baltic goddess of the sun -- along with two Polish
      businessmen.<br>
      <br>
      They had to assemble all their laboratory equipment from scratch,
      before multimillionaire Japanese investor Hideo Sawada came on
      board.<br>
      <br>
      The company now has an ultra-modern laboratory with an
      international team of young experts and is building an
      industrial-scale production site.<br>
      <br>
      "This will be the world's first production line using this
      technology. Its capacity will reach 40,000 square metres of panels
      by the end of the year and 180,000 square metres the following
      year," Malinkiewicz said at her lab.<br>
      <br>
      "But that's just a drop in the bucket in terms of demand."<br>
      <br>
      Eventually, compact production lines could easily be installed
      everywhere, according to demand, to manufacture perovskite solar
      panels that are made to measure.<br>
      <br>
      - Self-sufficient buildings -<br>
      <br>
      The Swedish construction group Skanska is testing the cutting-edge
      panels on the facade of one of its buildings in Warsaw.<br>
      <br>
      It also inked a licencing partnership with Saule in December for
      the exclusive right to incorporate the company's solar cell
      technology in its projects in Europe, the United States and
      Canada.<br>
      <br>
      "Perovskite technology is bringing us closer to the goal of energy
      self-sufficient buildings," said Adam Targowski, sustainability
      manager at Skanska.<br>
      <br>
      "Perovskites have proven successful even on surfaces that receive
      little sunlight. We can apply them pretty much everywhere," he
      told AFP.<br>
      <br>
      "More or less transparent, the panels also respond to design
      requirements. Thanks to their flexibility and varying tints,
      there's no need to add any extra architectural elements."<br>
      <br>
      A standard panel of around 1.3 square metres, at a projected cost
      of 50 euros ($57), would supply a day's worth of energy to an
      office workstation, according to current estimates.<br>
      <br>
      Malinkiewicz insists that the initial cost of her products will be
      comparable to conventional solar panels.<br>
      <br>
      Perovskite technology is also being tested on a hotel in Japan,
      near the city of Nagasaki.<br>
      <br>
      Plans are also afoot for the pilot production of perovskite panels
      in Valais, Switzerland and in Germany under the wings of the
      Oxford Photovoltaics venture.<br>
      <br>
      "The potential of the technology is clearly enormous," Assaad
      Razzouk, the CEO of Singapore-based Sindicatum Rewable Energy, a
      developer and operator of clean energy projects in Asia, told AFP.<br>
      <br>

      </div>
      <br>
      Father Kosmas Aitolos was born in 1714 in the Greek village Megalo
      Dendro (Big Tree) in the region of Aitolia. He studied in Mount
      Athos, in “Athonias School”, and later he became a monk in
      Philotheou Monastery.&nbsp; Because of the lack of education in
      most of the population, especially in the remote areas of Greece,
      Father Kosmas was “forced” to live Athos and begin missionary
      tours in the villages with the aim of educating the poor people.
      This way he would also be able to help people understand the
      Scriptures better. In a period of six years he managed to
      establish 250 schools as well as charities and rural churches.<br>
      <br>
      On August 24, 1779 he was executed at Kolkondas, Fier District,
      near the mouth of the Seman river (in present day Albania) by the
      Ottoman authorities. There were no formal charges against him.<br>
      <br>
      He was recognized as a saint by the Patriarchate of Constantinople
      Athenagoras in 1961.<br>
      <br>
      St. Kosmas received from God the gift of prophecy. He seems to
      have foreseen everything. He predicted the future of the world, he
      warned of the great cataclysms which await us in our Apocalyptic
      times but also he foretold the new technological developments.<br>
      <br>
      Some of them became reality and others are about to be fulfilled.<br>
      <br>
      In the following quotes several of his prophecies are presented.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PROPHECIES AND SAYINGS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      You will see people flying in the sky like blackbirds and hurling
      fire on the earth. Those alive then will run to the graves and
      shout: “Come out, you who are dead, and let us who are living in.”<br>
      <br>
      The cause of the general war will come from Dalmatia. Austria will
      be dismembered first and then Turkey.<br>
      <br>
      That which is desired [i.e., freedom] will come in the third
      generation. Your grandchildren will see it.<br>
      <br>
      France will liberate Greece, [while] Italy (will liberate) Epiros.<br>
      <br>
      The villages of the plain will suffer destruction, while people at
      the foot of (Mount) Kissavo will go to sleep slaves and will
      awaken free.<br>
      <br>
      The time will come when your enemies will take away from you even
      the ashes from your fires, but don’t give up your faith as others
      will do.<br>
      <br>
      The red hats [ie., the French] will come here [Kephallenia], and
      then the English for fifty-four years, and then this place will
      become Roman [i.e., Greek Orthodox].<br>
      <br>
      The time will come when people will speak from one far place to
      another, for example, from Constantinople to Russia, as though
      they were in adjoining rooms.<br>
      <br>
      A time will come when the harmony that exists now be­tween clergy
      and laymen will not be.<br>
      <br>
      The time will come when the devil will make his turns with his
      pumpkin.<br>
      <br>
      They will put a tax on chickens and on windows.<br>
      <br>
      Clergymen will become worse and more impious than everyone.<br>
      <br>
      There will come a time when your enemies will even take away from
      you the ashes from your fire, but do not deny your faith, as
      others may do.<br>
      <br>
      People will become impoverished because they will have no love for
      trees.<br>
      <br>
      You will see in the plain a carriage without horses which will run
      faster than a rabbit.<br>
      <br>
      The rich will become poor and the poor will die.<br>
      <br>
      The time will come when the Romans [i.e., the Greek Orthodox] will
      fight among themselves. I recommend harmony and love.<br>
      <br>
      A foreign army will come. It will believe in Christ, but it will
      not speak the (Greek) language.<br>
      <br>
      After the general war, the wolf will live with the lamb.<br>
      <br>
      People will become poor because they will become lazy.<br>
      <br>
      They will seek to take you as soldiers, but they will not do so in
      time.<br>
      <br>
      The Turks will learn the secret three days sooner than the
      Christians.<br>
      <br>
      When you hear that the war has started from below (the south),
      then it will be near.<br>
      <br>
      If the war starts from below (the south), you will suffer little.
      If it starts from above (the north), you will be destroyed.<br>
      <br>
      The crags and the pits will be full of people.<br>
      <br>
      It will come quickly. And either the ox will be in the field or
      the horse on the threshing floor.<br>
      <br>
      It is sad for me to say it to you: today, tomorrow we will endure
      thirst and great hunger such that we would give thousands of gold
      coins but still will not find a little bread.<br>
      <br>
      After the war, a man will have to run half an hour to find another
      human being to join him in fellowship.<br>
      <br>
      They will ask for your rifles. Retain two. Give one and keep the
      other. A single rifle will save a hundred souls.<br>
      <br>
      Out of schools will come things which your mind can’t imagine.<br>
      <br>
      Have a cross on your forehead so that they know that you are
      Christian.<br>
      <br>
      There will come a time when your enemies will even take away from
      you the ashes from your fire, but do not deny your faith, as
      others may do.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Bamboo cable, comparable to steel in
          tensile strength was being used at minimum 2000 years ago.</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Marco Polo&nbsp; described how the Chinese used and manufactured
      bamboo cables for towing boats.<br>
      <br>
      Engineers experimenting for the Whangpoo Conservancy Board found
      out that these twisted and plaited bamboo cables were made with
      material taken from the outer layer of the bamboo (which was only
      1/8 inch or 3 mm thick). They estimated that the working stress
      was about 20,000 pounds per square inch, which was of the same
      order as normally taken by steel wires of the same size.<br>
      <br>
      The breakages were very few with bamboo cables. Moreover, while
      hempen ropes lose some 25 percent of their strength when wet, the
      tensile strength of plaited bamboo cables increases about 20
      percent when they are fully saturated with water. Bamboo cables
      were available in lengths up to a quarter mile.<br>
      <br>
      Bamboo cables were the earliest structural element in the history
      of engineering to be used for suspension bridges, which originated
      in western China and the Himalayas.<br>
      <br>
      Primitive bridges made of bamboo cables droop across gorges with
      one end fixed lower than the other. Bamboo tubes greased with yak
      butter slide down the cables, with a cradle hanging from them in
      which people and animals side. Of great strength, a bamboo cable
      of 2 inch diameter could support 4 ton, these ancient bridges
      spanned distances up to 76 meters without central supports.<br>
      <br>
      Later on, various designs combined whole bamboo culms, woven
      slats, and cables braided of workable species such as Gigantochloa
      apus, which was a favorite for bridges in Java.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Anlan Bridge</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The remarkable Anlan bridge on the Min River in China was first
      constructed around 300 AD. Historians consider this bridge one of
      the engineering marvels of the ancient world.<br>
      <br>
      Bamboo cables have a tensile strength of up to 26,000 pounds per
      square inch, while hemp rope can only carry a stress of 8,000
      pounds.<br>
      <br>
      The Anlan suspension bridge spans the 1,000-foot wide Min River,
      is 9 feet wide, and was built entirely of bamboo cables resting on
      seven supports fixed equidistant in the bed of the stream. The
      floor of the bridge rested across 10 bamboo cables, each 21 inches
      in circumference, and five similar cables on each side form the
      rails.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the silica-containing outer surface is very resistant to
      wear, e.g., against rock surfaces, which is naturally important
      both in towing and bridge cables.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      Scientists have created a solar cell device that is significantly
      more efficient than conventional photovoltaic cells.<br>
      <br>
      For the first time, scientists have produced a photovoltaic (PV)
      cell with a conversion efficiency of 40.7 percent, the U.S.
      Department of Energy (DOE) reported on December 7. The
      collaboration of DOE and Spectrolab, Inc. (a subsidiary of Boeing)
      led to the achievement of a decades-long goal: to break the
      40-percent efficiency barrier on solar cell devices. “We are eager
      to see this accomplishment translate into the marketplace as soon
      as possible,” Alexander Karsner, assistant secretary for energy
      efficiency and renewable energy at DOE, said.<br>
      <br>
      The breakthrough cell was developed using a structure called a
      “multi-junction solar cell.” In this type of device, individual PV
      cells are made of layers, and each layer captures a portion of the
      sunlight reaching the cell. This allows the unit to capture energy
      from a greater range of the solar spectrum, leading to higher
      efficiency. According to Dr. Richard King, a principal
      investigator at Spectrolab, “The excellent performance of these
      materials hints at still higher efficiency in future solar cells.”<br>
      <br>
      According to Spectrolab, the highly efficient units allow for the
      use of fewer cells overall to achieve the same power output as
      conventional silicon cells. As a result, the technology may allow
      for lower PV system installation costs, at $3 per watt, and
      electricity production costs of $0.08–$0.10 cents per
      kilowatt-hour. The acheivement has the greater potential of
      helping to reduce the U.S. reliance on imported oil and increase
      national energy security, DOE’s Karsner notes. <br>

          in Pacific Ocean </b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      LOS ANGELES—A floating device sent to corral a swirling island of
      trash between California and Hawaii has not swept up any plastic
      waste—but the young innovator behind the project said on Dec. 17,
      that a fix was in the works.<br>
      <br>
      Boyan Slat, 24, who launched the Pacific Ocean cleanup project,
      said the speed of the solar-powered barrier isn’t allowing it to
      hold on to the plastic it catches.<br>
      <br>
      “Sometimes the system actually moves slightly slower than the
      plastic, which of course you don’t want because then you have a
      chance of losing t<br>
      <br>
      he plastic again,” Slat said in an interview with The Associated
      Press.<br>
      <br>
      A crew of engineers will reach the U-shaped boom on Dec. 18, and
      will work for the next few weeks to widen its span so that it
      catches more wind and waves to help it go faster, he said.<br>
      <br>
      A ship towed the 2,000-foot barrier in September from San
      Francisco to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch—an island of trash
      twice the size of Texas. It has been in place since the end of
      October, Slat said.<br>
      <br>
      The plastic barrier with a tapered 10-foot-deep screen is intended
      to act like a coastline, trapping some of the 1.8 trillion pieces
      of plastic that scientists estimate are swirling in the patch
      while allowing marine life to safely swim beneath it.<br>
      <br>
      So far the giant floating device, launched three months ago to
      collect plastic in the Pacific garbage patch has not been
      successful. But the Ocean Cleanup’s founder said, with changes,
      he’s confident it’ll still work.<br>
      <br>
      Slat said he is not deterred by the setback because engineers
      expected to make tweaks to the system...<br>

      <div align="center"><b>FEMA DIRECTOR CALLS CITIZENS “CATTLE”</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      During a government shutdown that furloughed hundreds of thousands
      of workers, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
      continued operating and quietly received a $400,000,000 budget
      increase to further its insidious agenda to enslave or eradicate a
      majority of the population. At an agency meeting last Tuesday,
      FEMA Director Brock Long told regional subordinates that citizens
      who question the agency’s mission are “nothing more than cattle”
      and must be treated as hostile combatants.<br>
      <br>
      He cited a recent disturbance in fire-stricken Paradise, CA; local
      subversives, he said, protested FEMA’s presence by forming a human
      blockade to prevent agents from unlawfully trespassing on private
      property or entering the charred remains of scorched homes and
      businesses. A group of approximately twenty-five persons held
      protest signs reading “FEMA, WE DON’T WANT YOU HERE” and “FEMA, GO
      HOME.”<br>
      <br>
      Long told colleagues that agents must not hesitate to use
      discreet, lethal force if citizens defy FEMA’s authority, and
      reminded them that powers granted by the Patriot Act absolve
      agents of criminal maleficence when acting in the line of
      duty.&nbsp; He warned them, however, not to shoot anybody in the
      presence of media personalities.<br>
      <br>
      Our FEMA source said the following: “Brock Long continues to
      perceive everyday people as a threat to his authority. And what
      happened in California has strengthened his paranoia. He wants the
      population subservient to FEMA. To him, you’re all livestock ready
      for the slaughterhouse. We’re talking about a man who has ordered
      agents to toss people off boats.&nbsp; Even supervisors who
      disagree with his policies are powerless to stop him.”..<br>

      </div>
      <b> </b><b>Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b><br>
      </b>Background: Bulbine abyssinica has been reported to possess a
      variety of pharmacological activities traditionally. Previous work
      suggested its antidiabetic properties, but information on the
      antidiabetic compounds is still lacking. Objective: The present
      research exertion was aimed to isolate and identify biologically
      active polyphenols from B. abyssinica leaves and to evaluate their
      efficacy on carbohydrate digesting enzymes. Materials and Methods:
      Fractionation of the polyphenolic contents from the methanolic
      extract of B. abyssinica leaves was executed by the silica gel
      column chromatography to yield different fractions. The
      antioxidant activities of these fractions were carried out against
      2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium
      salt (ABTS), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radicals, and ferric
      ion-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). In vitro antidiabetic
      experimentation was performed by evaluating the a-amylase and
      a-glucosidase inhibitory capacity. The isolated polyphenols were
      then identified using liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy
      (LC/MS). Results: Out of the eight polyphenolic fractions (BAL
      1–8), BAL-4 has the highest inhibitory activity against ABTS
      radicals whereas BAL-6 showed potent ferric ion-reducing capacity.
      BAL-5 was the most effective fraction with antidiabetic activity
      with IC50of 140.0 and 68.58 ± 3.2 µg/ml for a-amylase and
      a-glucosidase inhibitory activities, respectively. All the
      fractions competitively inhibited a-amylase, BAL-5 and BAL-6 also
      inhibited a-glucosidase competitively, while BAL-4 and BAL-1
      exhibited noncompetitive and near competitive inhibitions against
      a-glucosidase, respectively. The LC/MS analysis revealed the
      presence of carvone in all the fractions. Conclusions: The present
      study demonstrates the antioxidant and antidiabetic activities of
      the isolated polyphenols from B. abyssinica.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary</b><br>
      Polyphenols were successfully isolated and identified from Bulbine
      abyssinica leaves<br>
      The isolated polyphenols are biologically active with high
      antioxidant as well as inhibitor of carbohydrate-digesting enzymes<br>
      B. abyssinica can be a good source of amylase and glucosidase
      inhibitors<br>
      B. abyssinica can be used as complementary or alternative
      therapeutic agents especially for the treatment of diabetes<br>
      Carvone, quercetin, and psoralen could be the compounds
      responsible for the a-amylase and a-glucosidase inhibitory
      activities.<br>

      <b>Introduction</b><br>
      Plants produce a variety of secondary products having one or more
      hydroxyl functional groups on an aromatic ring called phenol.[1]
      These plant phenolics play important role in the plant defense
      mechanism against diseases and pests.[2] Phenolic acids can be
      classified into derivatives of benzoic acid and caffeic acid.
      Example of the benzoic derivative is the gallic acid while
      examples of the caffeic acid are coumaric and ferulic acids.[3]
      However, flavonoids, flavonols, tannins, lignins, and stilbenes
      are examples of plant phenolics. Plant phenolics have been used as
      food additives due to their distinctive odor and as ingredients in
      perfume. Recently, much attention has been focused on the potent
      antioxidative properties of polyphenolics and conversely their
      effects in the prevention of various oxidative stress-associated
      diseases. Free radicals are produced during oxidation processes
      and have been implicated in the cause of many human diseases such
      as cancer, diabetes, atherosclerosis, inflammation, cardiac,
      Alzheimer's, kidney, liver diseases, and aging.[3],[4],[5] The
      prevention of oxidative stress by plant polyphenols and their use
      in treatment of diseases is of increasing importance from the
      epidemiological data as well as in vitro and in vivo studies.[6]
      Asteraceae have been reported to be the largest family of
      flowering plants with many of its members shown to have
      pharmacological activities which contained important
      phytochemicals including polyphenolics and
      diterpenoids.[7],[8]Bulbine abyssinica A. rich belongs to this
      family and has been previously described to be rich in
      polyphenolics.[9] Further studies on the acetone and water
      extracts from the whole plant evaluated in vitro assays showed
      antioxidant potential, hypoglycemic, and advanced glycation
      end-products inhibition capacity.[9] In this study, antioxidant
      and antidiabetic properties of different polyphenol fractions were
      investigated through bioassay-guided isolation from the leaves of
      B. abyssinica...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Preparation of plant extracts and fractionation</b><br>
      The dried B. abyssinica leaves were washed, dried, and finely
      chopped using a grinder and then about 1 kg was macerated with
      methanol for 5 days and the extract evaporated under reduced
      pressure at 40°C, affording 200 g of the crude extract. This was
      then loaded into a glass column containing silica gel 60
      (0.063–0.200 nm) that has been previously washed with methanol and
      then eluted with methanol/ethyl acetate (2:8), ethyl
      acetate/hexane (7:3), methanol/ethyl acetate (8:2), and methanol
      to yield 8 fractions (BAL-1 to BAL-8). The elutions were examined
      by thin-layer chromatography and each one of them was dried,
      weighed, and reconstituted with methanol to prepare a stock
      solution at concentration of 1 mg/ml for preliminary screening of
      total phenolic contents, flavonoids, proanthocyanidins,
      2,2'-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), and
      DPPH scavenging activity. The fractions having the best
      polyphenolic contents and antioxidant activity were selected for
      further experiments; these fractions are BAL-4, BAL-6, BAL-5,
      BAL-8, BAL-7, and BAL-1 in the order of their activity...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusions</b><b><br>
      </b>Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that
      the polyphenolics isolated from B. abyssinica have significant
      antioxidant activities and inhibitory properties against a-amylase
      and a-glucosidase enzymes. The antidiabetic activities could be as
      a result of the carvone, quercetin, and psoralen contents of the
      plant. Therefore, B. abyssinica is an easily accessible source of
      natural antioxidants and antidiabetic compounds. This also
      confirms the folkloric usage of the plant for the treatment of
      diabetes. However, further studies need to be carried out on the
      isolation, purification, and elucidation of the structural
      properties of these compounds.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      Helping the immune system clear away old cells in aging mice
      helped restore youthful characteristics<br>
      <br>
      If only we could keep our bodies young, healthy and energetic,
      even as we attain the wisdom of our years. New research at the
      Weizmann Institute of Science suggests this dream could be at
      least partly obtainable in the future. The results of this
      research, led by Prof. Valery Krizhanovsky and Dr. Yossi Ovadya in
      the Molecular Cell Biology Department, were recently published in
      Nature Communications.<br>
      <br>
      The research began with an investigation into the way that the
      immune system is involved in a crucial activity: clearing away
      old, senescent cells that spell trouble for the body when they
      hang around. Senescent cells -- not completely dead but suffering
      loss of function or irreparable damage -- have been implicated in
      diseases of aging by promoting inflammation. The researchers used
      mice in which a crucial gene for this immune activity was missing.
      At two years (elderly, for mice), the bodies of these mice had a
      greater accumulation of senescent cells compared with the mice in
      which the gene for removing these cells was intact. The mice
      missing the gene suffered from chronic inflammation, and various
      functions in their bodies appeared to be diminished. They also
      looked older -- and died earlier -- than their normal
      counterparts.<br>
      <br>
      Next, the researchers gave the mice a drug that inhibits the
      function of certain proteins that help the aging cells survive in
      their senescent state, to see if this would contribute to the
      removal of these cells from the body. The drugs were administered
      to mice whose aging was a result of the malfunctions the group had
      uncovered in the immune system as well as those suffering
      premature aging from a different genetic error. The treated mice
      responded exceptionally well to the drug: Their blood tests and
      activity tests showed improvement, and their tissues appeared to
      be much closer to those of young mice. The scientists counted
      senescent cells, finding many fewer of them remaining in the
      treated mice's bodies; and when they looked for signs of
      inflammation, they found that this, too, was significantly lower.
      The mice treated with the drug were more active and their median
      lifespan rose....<br>
      <br>
      The scientists intend to continue exploring ways to prompt the
      human body to remove its old senescent cells, particularly to find
      means of activating the immune system to do this job. That is, if
      future experimentation proves their theories correct, they could
      end up creating truly "anti-aging" therapies.<br>

      Premised on the idea that one cannot know a science without
      knowing its history, History of Wireless offers a lively new
      treatment that introduces previously unacknowledged pioneers and
      developments, setting a new standard for understanding the
      evolution of this important technology.Starting with the
      background-magnetism, electricity, light, and Maxwell's
      Electromagnetic Theory-this book offers new insights into the
      initial theory and experimental exploration of wireless. In
      addition to the well-known contributions of Maxwell, Hertz, and
      Marconi, it examines work done by Heaviside, Tesla, and passionate
      amateurs such as the Kentucky melon farmer Nathan Stubblefield and
      the unsung hero Antonio Meucci. Looking at the story from
      mathematical, physics, technical, and other perspectives, the
      clearly written text describes the development of wireless within
      a vivid scientific milieu.&nbsp; <br>

      <br>
      Now in its second edition, this bestselling textbook may be the
      single most influential study of the historical relationship
      between science and technology ever published. Tracing this
      relationship from the dawn of civilization through the twentieth
      century, James E. McClellan III and Harold Dorn argue that
      technology as "applied science" emerged relatively recently, as
      industry and governments began funding scientific research that
      would lead directly to new or improved technologies. McClellan and
      Dorn identify two great scientific traditions: the useful
      sciences, patronized by the state from the dawn of civilization,
      and scientific theorizing, initiated by the ancient Greeks. They
      find that scientific traditions took root in China, India, and
      Central and South America, as well as in a series of Near Eastern
      empires, during late antiquity and the Middle Ages. From this
      comparative perspective, the authors explore the emergence of
      Europe and the United States as a scientific and technological
      power.The new edition reorganizes its treatment of Greek science
      and significantly expands its coverage of industrial civilization
      and contemporary science and technology with new and revised
      chapters devoted to applied science, the sociology and economics
      of science, globalization, and the technological systems that
      underpin everyday life.&nbsp; <br>

      <br>
      Today technology has created a world of dazzling progress, growing
      disparities of wealth and poverty, and looming threats to the
      environment. Technology: A World History offers an illuminating
      backdrop to our present moment--a brilliant history of invention
      around the globe. Historian Daniel R. Headrick ranges from the
      Stone Age and the beginnings of agriculture to the Industrial
      Revolution and the electronic revolution of the recent past. In
      tracing the growing power of humans over nature through
      increasingly powerful innovations, he compares the evolution of
      technology in different parts of the world, providing a much
      broader account than is found in other histories of technology. We
      also discover how small changes sometimes have dramatic
      results--how, for instance, the stirrup revolutionized war and
      gave the Mongols a deadly advantage over the Chinese. And how the
      nailed horseshoe was a pivotal breakthrough for western farmers.
      Enlivened with many illustrations, Technology offers a fascinating
      look at the spread of inventions around the world, both as boons
      for humanity and as weapons of destruction.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>What I Learned in the Peace Corps in
          Africa: Trump Is Right</b><br>
        <b>By Karin McQuillan</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Three weeks after college, I flew to Senegal, West Africa, to run
      a community center in a rural town.&nbsp; Life was placid, with no
      danger, except to your health.&nbsp; That danger was considerable,
      because it was, in the words of the Peace Corps doctor, "a
      fecalized environment."<br>
      <br>
      In plain English: s--- is everywhere.&nbsp; People defecate on the
      open ground, and the feces is blown with the dust – onto you, your
      clothes, your food, the water.&nbsp; He warned us the first day of
      training: do not even touch water.&nbsp; Human feces carries
      parasites that bore through your skin and cause organ failure.<br>
      <br>
      Never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined that a few
      decades later, liberals would be pushing the lie that Western
      civilization is no better than a third-world country.&nbsp; Or
      would teach two generations of our kids that loving your own
      culture and wanting to preserve it are racism.<br>
      <br>
      Last time I was in Paris, I saw a beautiful African woman in a
      grand boubou have her child defecate on the sidewalk next to Notre
      Dame Cathedral.&nbsp; The French police officer, ten steps from
      her, turned his head not to see.<br>
      <br>
      I have seen.&nbsp; I am not turning my head and pretending
      unpleasant things are not true.<br>
      <br>
      Senegal was not a hellhole.&nbsp; Very poor people can lead happy,
      meaningful lives in their own cultures' terms.&nbsp; But they are
      not our terms.&nbsp; The excrement is the least of it.&nbsp; Our
      basic ideas of human relations, right and wrong, are incompatible.<br>
      <br>
      As a twenty-one-year-old starting out in the Peace Corps, I loved
      Senegal.&nbsp; In fact, I was euphoric.&nbsp; I quickly made
      friends and had an adopted family.&nbsp; I relished the feeling of
      the brotherhood of man.&nbsp; People were open, willing to share
      their lives and, after they knew you, their innermost thoughts.<br>
      <br>
      The longer I lived there, the more I understood: it became
      blindingly obvious that the Senegalese are not the same as
      us.&nbsp; The truths we hold to be self-evident are not evident to
      the Senegalese.&nbsp; How could they be?&nbsp; Their reality is
      totally different.&nbsp; You can't understand anything in Senegal
      using American terms.<br>
      <br>
      Take something as basic as family.&nbsp; Family was a few hundred
      people, extending out to second and third cousins.&nbsp; All the
      men in one generation were called "father."&nbsp; Senegalese are
      Muslim, with up to four wives.&nbsp; Girls had their clitorises
      cut off at puberty.&nbsp; (I witnessed this, at what I thought was
      going to be a nice coming-of-age ceremony, like a bat mitzvah or
      confirmation.)&nbsp; Sex, I was told, did not include
      kissing.&nbsp; Love and friendship in marriage were Western
      ideas.&nbsp; Fidelity was not a thing.&nbsp; Married women would
      have sex for a few cents to have cash for the market.<br>
      <br>
      What I did witness every day was that women were worked half to
      death.&nbsp; Wives raised the food and fed their own children, did
      the heavy labor of walking miles to gather wood for the fire, drew
      water from the well or public faucet, pounded grain with heavy
      hand-held pestles, lived in their own huts, and had conjugal
      visits from their husbands on a rotating basis with their
      co-wives.&nbsp; Their husbands lazed in the shade of the trees.<br>
      <br>
      Yet family was crucial to people there in a way Americans cannot
      comprehend.<br>
      <br>
      The Ten Commandments were not disobeyed – they were unknown.&nbsp;
      The value system was the exact opposite.&nbsp; You were supposed
      to steal everything you can to give to your own relatives.&nbsp;
      There are some Westernized Africans who try to rebel against the
      system.&nbsp; They fail.<br>
      <br>
      We hear a lot about the kleptocratic elites of Africa.&nbsp; The
      kleptocracy extends through the whole society.&nbsp; My town had a
      medical clinic donated by international agencies.&nbsp; The
      medicine was stolen by the medical workers and sold to the local
      store.&nbsp; If you were sick and didn't have money, drop
      dead.&nbsp; That was normal.<br>
      <br>
      So here in the States, when we discovered that my 98-year-old
      father's Muslim health aide from Nigeria had stolen his clothes
      and wasn't bathing him, I wasn't surprised.&nbsp; It was familiar.<br>
      <br>
      Go to the post office, and the clerk would name an outrageous
      price for a stamp.&nbsp; After paying the bribe, you still didn't
      know it if it would be mailed or thrown out.&nbsp; That was
      normal.<br>
      <br>
      One of my most vivid memories was from the clinic.&nbsp; One day,
      as the wait grew hotter in the 110-degree heat, an old woman two
      feet from the medical aides – who were chatting in the shade of a
      mango tree instead of working – collapsed to the ground.&nbsp;
      They turned their heads so as not to see her and kept
      talking.&nbsp; She lay there in the dirt.&nbsp; Callousness to the
      sick was normal.<br>
      <br>
      Americans think it is a universal human instinct to do unto others
      as you would have them do unto you.&nbsp; It's not.&nbsp; It seems
      natural to us because we live in a Bible-based Judeo-Christian
      culture.<br>
      <br>
      We think the Protestant work ethic is universal.&nbsp; It's
      not.&nbsp; My town was full of young men doing nothing.&nbsp; They
      were waiting for a government job.&nbsp; There was no private
      enterprise.&nbsp; Private business was not illegal, just
      impossible, given the nightmare of a third-world bureaucratic
      kleptocracy.&nbsp; It is also incompatible with Senegalese
      insistence on taking care of relatives.<br>
      <br>
      All the little stores in Senegal were owned by Mauritanians.&nbsp;
      If a Senegalese wanted to run a little store, he'd go to another
      country.&nbsp; The reason?&nbsp; Your friends and relatives would
      ask you for stuff for free, and you would have to say yes.&nbsp;
      End of your business.&nbsp; You are not allowed to be a selfish
      individual and say no to relatives.&nbsp; The result: Everyone has
      nothing.<br>
      <br>
      The more I worked there and visited government officials doing
      absolutely nothing, the more I realized that no one in Senegal had
      the idea that a job means work.&nbsp; A job is something given to
      you by a relative.&nbsp; It provides the place where you steal
      everything to give back to your family.<br>
      <br>
      I couldn't wait to get home.&nbsp; So why would I want to bring
      Africa here?&nbsp; Non-Westerners do not magically become American
      by arriving on our shores with a visa.<br>
      <br>
      For the rest of my life, I enjoyed the greatest gift of the Peace
      Corps: I love and treasure America more than ever.&nbsp; I take
      seriously my responsibility to defend our culture and our country
      and pass on the American heritage to the next generation.<br>
      <br>
      African problems are made worse by our aid efforts.&nbsp; Senegal
      is full of smart, capable people.&nbsp; They will eventually solve
      their own country's problems.&nbsp; They will do it on their
      terms, not ours.&nbsp; The solution is not to bring Africans here.<br>
      <br>
      We are lectured by Democrats that we must privilege third-world
      immigration by the hundred million with chain migration.&nbsp;
      They tell us we must end America as a white, Western,
      Judeo-Christian, capitalist nation – to prove we are not
      racist.&nbsp; I don't need to prove a thing.&nbsp; Leftists want
      open borders because they resent whites, resent Western
      achievements, and hate America.&nbsp; They want to destroy America
      as we know it.<br>
      <br>
      As President Trump asked, why would we do that?<br>
      <br>
      We have the right to choose what kind of country to live in.&nbsp;
      I was happy to donate a year of my life as a young woman to help
      the poor Senegalese.&nbsp; I am not willing to donate my country.
