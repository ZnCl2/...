        </div>
        <b><br>
        </b>Happiness is a subjective experience that is an ultimate
        goal for humans. Psychological studies have shown that
        subjective happiness can be measured reliably and consists of
        emotional and cognitive components. However, the neural
        substrates of subjective happiness remain unclear. To
        investigate this issue, we used structural magnetic resonance
        imaging and questionnaires that assessed subjective happiness,
        the intensity of positive and negative emotional experiences,
        and purpose in life. We found a positive relationship between
        the subjective happiness score and gray matter volume in the
        right precuneus. Moreover, the same region showed an association
        with the combined positive and negative emotional intensity and
        purpose in life scores. Our findings suggest that the precuneus
        mediates subjective happiness by integrating the emotional and
        cognitive components of happiness…<br>
        <br>
        Previous functional neuroimaging investigations of happiness
        have consistently found that the induction of happy, as compared
        to neutral, emotions activated certain brain areas, including
        the anterior cingulate gyrus4,5,6,7,8, medial parietal cortex
        (posterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus)4,5,7,8,9, and
        amygdala4,5,8,9. These findings are consistent with those of
        meta-analyses of functional neuroimaging data indicating that
        these regions are involved in the elicitation of emotional
        states10,11,12,13,14. Although the previous studies investigated
        only the emotional component of subjective happiness, we
        hypothesized that the neural correlates of subjective happiness
        would include these brain regions. Moreover, we hypothesized
        that the emotional- and cognitive-component model of subjective
        happiness would be valid at the neural level…<b><br>

        scatter plot of adjusted gray matter volume as a function of the

        of interest, each multiplied by the associated parameter
        estimates at the peak coordinates in the right precuneus.<br>
        <b><br>
          Discussion<br>
          <br>
        </b>Our analysis of psychological ratings revealed that the mean
        subjective happiness score was similar to that reported in a
        previous study19. The correlation analysis revealed that
        subjective happiness was negatively associated with negative
        emotional traits, as previously reported18, but not with the
        negative emotional states. The regression analysis revealed that
        the subjective happiness score could be explained by the
        combined intensity of positive and negative emotions and purpose
        in life scores. Our results support previous theoretical and
        empirical data1 and indicate that subjective happiness is a
        stable construct consisting of emotional and cognitive
        components.<br>
        <br>
        More important, our analysis of structural MRI data revealed
        that the subjective happiness score was associated with
        increased gray matter volume in the precuneus. This finding is
        largely in line with those of previous functional neuroimaging
        studies showing that the induction of happy emotional states was
        associated with activation of the medial parietal
        cortex4,5,7,8,9. However, these previous studies investigated a
        transiently induced happy mood state, whereas subjective
        happiness, which is a more complex and stable subjective
        experience, has not been evaluated. Involvement of the precuneus
        in subjective happiness is consistent with empirical and
        theoretical findings regarding this region. Previous functional
        neuroimaging studies have shown that the precuneus region has
        the highest level of cortical glucose metabolism in the brain,
        highlighting the importance of this region for subjective
        consciousness in humans20. Several neuroimaging studies revealed
        that the precuneus is involved in changes in subjective
        experience (e.g., the gradual transition of consciousness level
        following the induction of anesthesia21,22), suggesting that
        this region may be involved in the production and/or alteration
        of subjective experiences20,23. Although this psychological
        function fits well with the concept of subjective happiness, no
        previous study investigated precuneus involvement in subjective
        happiness. To our knowledge, our study is the first to show that
        the precuneus is associated with subjective happiness.<br>
        <br>
        Furthermore, our results revealed an association between the
        precuneus and the combined positive and negative emotional
        intensity and purpose in life scores. These results indicate
        that the widely accepted psychological model postulating
        emotional and cognitive components of subjective happiness24 may
        be applicable at the level of neural structure. A previous
        neuroanatomical study in monkeys has found that the precuneus
        receives projections from widespread cortical and subcortical
        regions25. Several neuroimaging studies in humans also revealed
        that the precuneus is involved in the default mode network and
        communicates with widespread brain regions22,26. Moreover, the
        precuneus is involved in self-referential processing, which
        integrates the information of one’s current internal experience,
        past memory, and future plans20,27,28. Thus, the region is
        thought to be involved in the integration of internal and
        external information22. Together with these findings, our
        results suggest that the precuneus may play an important role in
        integrating different types of information and converting it
        into subjective happiness…<br>
        <br>
        Second, although we found that the cognitive and emotional
        components of happiness were associated with precuneus volume,
        recent structural MRI studies using a different methodology to
        investigate the structural neural substrates of the cognitive
        component of happiness reported different findings34,35.
        Specifically, these studies found that eudaimonic well-being36
        was positively associated with right insular cortex volume35 and
        that life satisfaction37 was positively associated with right
        parahippocampal gyrus volume and negatively associated with left
        ventromedial prefrontal cortex and left precuneus volumes34. We
        speculate that the cognitive component of happiness may contain
        multiple subcomponents and our use of a single purpose-of-life
        measure may not tap into all of these subcomponents. Further
        studies are needed to clarify the relationships between
        cognitive subcomponents of happiness and their associations with
        structural neural substrates…<br>
        <br>
        In conclusion, our investigation using structural MRI and
        questionnaires revealed a positive relationship between the
        subjective happiness score and gray matter volume in the right
        precuneus. Furthermore, we found a correlation between the
        combined purpose in life and positive and negative emotional
        intensity scores and gray matter volume in the same region. Our
        findings suggest that the precuneus mediates subjective
        happiness by integrating the emotional and cognitive components
        of happiness.<br>

        <b>&nbsp;<br>
        </b>A Florida State University researcher has discovered an
        artificial material that mimics photosynthesis and potentially
        creates a sustainable energy source.<br>
        <br>
        In The Journal of Physical Chemistry, Assistant Professor of
        Chemical Engineering Jose L. Mendoza-Cortes details how this new
        material efficiently captures sunlight and then, how the energy
        can be used to break down water into oxygen (O2) and hydrogen
        (H2). This process is known as oxidation, and it is also what
        happens during photosynthesis when a plant uses light to break
        down water and carbohydrates, which are the main energy sources
        for the plant.<br>
        <br>
        His discovery generates exciting new prospects for how this
        process could be used to forge new energy sources in a carbon
        neutral way. Potentially, hydrogen could be transported to other
        locations and burned as fuel.<br>
        <br>
        “In theory, this should be a self-sustaining energy source,”
        Mendoza-Cortes said. “Perhaps in the future, you could put this
        material on your roof and it could turn rain water into energy
        with the help of the sun.”<br>
        <br>
        But, unlike many other energy sources, this won’t have a
        negative effect on the environment.<br>
        <br>
        “You won’t generate carbon dioxide or waste,” he said.<br>
        <br>
        Mendoza-Cortes, a computational and theoretical chemist, said
        the challenge he faced was designing something that didn’t rust
        from the process of breaking down water that also trapped the
        energy and was inexpensive to create. To do this, he initially
        developed a multilayered material out of manganese oxide,
        commonly known as birnessite.<br>
        <br>
        But something exciting happened when Mendoza-Cortes and his team
        peeled back the layers of the material so just a single layer of
        the material remained — it began trapping light at a much faster
        rate.<br>
        <br>
        In technical terms, it transitioned from an indirect band gap
        material to a direct band gap one.<br>
        <br>
        Light with photo energy can penetrate indirect band gap
        materials much more easily without getting absorbed and used for
        other purposes. Silicon, for example, is the most commonly known
        indirect gap band material. But to make the material effective,
        silicon solar cells are typically stacked and thus hundreds of
        micrometers thick. If they were any thinner, light would simply
        pass through them.<br>
        <br>
        Creating a single-layer material that can efficiently trap light
        is a much more desirable outcome because it is much simpler and
        cheaper to manufacture.<br>
        <br>
        “This is why the discovery of this direct band gap material is
        so exciting,” Mendoza-Cortes said. “It is cheap, it is efficient
        and you do not need a large amount to capture enough sunlight to
        carry out fuel generation.”<br>
        <br>
        Mendoza-Cortes came to FSU by way of the Energy and Materials
        Strategic Faculty Hiring Initiative. He is a researcher at FSU’s
        High-Performance Materials Institute (HPMI), a multidisciplinary
        research institute dedicated to the research and development of
        advanced materials and manufacturing technologies. <br>
        <br>
        Mendoza-Cortes’ research is supported by HPMI, the FSU Research
        Computing Center, the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory
        and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where he
        completed a postdoctoral fellowship. Mendoza-Cortes’ former
        intern, Kevin Lucht, is a co-author on the paper. <br>

        <b><br>
        </b>We show a comprehensive study on the structure and
        electronic properties of a layered manganese oxide commonly
        known as birnessite. We present the effects of substituting
        different intercalated cations (Li+, Na+, K+, Be2+, Mg2+, Ca2+,
        Sr2+, Zn2+, B3+, Al3+, Ga3+, Sc3+, and Y3+) and the role of
        waters in the intercalated layer. The importance of the
        Jahn–Teller effect and ordering of the Mn3+ centers due to
        cation intercalation are addressed to explain the ability to
        tune the indirect band gap (Egi) from 2.63 to ∼2.20 eV and the
        direct band gap (Egd) from 3.09 to ∼2.50 eV. By aligning the
        structures’ bands, we noted that structures with Sr, Ca, B, and
        Al have potential for usage in water splitting, and anhydrous
        B-birnessite is predicted to have a suitable direct band gap for
        light capturing. Furthermore, we also demonstrate how the
        effects of cations in the bulk differ from the behavior on
        single layer surfaces. More specifically, we show that an
        indirect to direct band transition is observed when we separate
        the bulk into a single layer oxide. This study shows a new
        strategy for tuning the band gap of layered materials to capture
        light which may couple to its intrinsic water-splitting
        catalytic properties, thus resembling photosynthesis.<br>

        The invention discloses birnessite as a microwave degradation
        catalyst as well as synthesis and an application thereof. The
        method can stably control the molar ratio of Mn(III) and Mn(IV)
        in a birnessite product so as to control the regular crystal
        structure in birnessite. The birnessite with continuously
        changing molar ratio of Mn(III) and Mn(IV) in a certain range is
        prepared by the method. The birnessite has a remarkable
        degrading effect to methylene blue under the microwave-induced

        </b>The invention discloses a birnessite type manganese dioxide
        nanosheet hydrogen sensor and a preparation method thereof. The
        preparation method comprises the following steps: (1) preparing
        birnessite type manganese dioxide; (2) preparing an
        indirectly-heated hydrogen-sensitive element; (3) respectively
        welding a conducting wire and a resistive heater onto a sensor
        base to manufacture an indirectly-heated hydrogen sensor.
        According to the invention, a manganese acetate solution and a
        sodium peroxide solution are used as raw materials and a
        direct-oxidation coprecipitation technique is adopted to prepare
        a birnessite type manganese dioxide nanosheet which has the
        advantages of large specific area, high porosity, small grain
        size, high adsorption activity and poor crystallization
        property. The birnessite type manganese dioxide nanosheet is
        adopted as the hydrogen-sensitive element, so that the
        sensitivity of the sensor is increased, and the working
        temperature is reduced.<b><br>

        </b>Dana Durnford, a former commercial diver who plies a rubber
        dinghy along the Canadian Pacific coast to study the effects of
        Fukushima radiation on marine life, has been arrested for making
        alleged death threats against a chemistry professor at
        University of Victoria in British Columbia. Mr. Durnford is
        facing trial on two counts of harassment related to his comments
        on video at his webpage, the Nuclear Proctologist. The video
        clips in question have been removed by YouTube at the request of
        unnamed complainants.<br>
        <br>
        Whatever the substance those controversial statements, Canadians
        should realize his frustration arises in response to the
        official campaign of denial of Fukushima’s lethal effects. I
        have often enjoyed dialogues with Dana on the rense.com radio
        program on Monday nights, especially stories of his harrowing
        experiences at sea amid 15-foot swells. After a career of diving
        for shellfish, he developed a passion for coastal research two
        years ago after discovering that the once-lush seafloor and
        tidal pools of British Columbia have been denuded of vegetation
        and are now devoid of marine-animal life. A burning curiosity
        prompted him to obtain geiger counters, a microscope and
        underwater cameras to search for the root cause of this
        unprecedented natural catastrophe along North America’s Pacific
        coast,<br>
        <br>
        Durnford has an encyclopedic recall for identifying marine
        species that few marine biologists can equal. His estimate, four
        years after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, is that out of more
        than 2,000 coastal species only about 200 still survive. The
        absence of any other plausible cause prompted his conclusion
        that low-level radiation from Fukushima arriving in immense
        volumes is responsible for the greatest extermination event in
        human history. His field research shows that the ongoing ecocide
        of the Pacific is a man-made catastrophe and not a natural
        disaster, and the nuclear industry bears the entire culpability.
        For his tireless campaign of gathering a vast body of
        smoking-gun evidence, Durnford is being persecuted in a
        modern-day witch trial by the high priests of the nuclear
        industry.<br>
        <br>
        Durnford stands accused on trumped-up charges of a “hate crime”
        against those marine chemists who categorically deny radiation
        as a potential factor in the oceanic kill-off, a priori, that is
        even before they start to gather data from the shore. As quoted
        in the Globe and Mail, Durnford said, “in court I was charged
        with criminal harassment of nuclear industry PR people, and one
        of those was from Woods Hole and the other one was from UVic,
        British Columbia, Canada.”<br>
        <br>
        Correction: Durnford is not aware of the fact, and probably
        neither are the students at University of Victoria, that one of
        his accusers, Professor Jay Cullen, served as a postdoctoral
        researcher at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in
        Massachusetts, which throughout its history has been an “ocean
        environment” research front funded by the U.S. Navy’s Office of
        Naval Research.<b><br>
          <br>
          “Zero risk” from Fukushima<br>
          <br>
        </b>To be fair, as far as possible when presented with
        transparent scientific fraud, let us now pay attention to the
        opinions of the main “victim” of this alleged heinous murder
        plot.<br>
        <br>
        Chemistry professor Jay T. Cullen, with the University of
        Victoria, British Columbia, gave his account of a “hate crime”
        and “harassment” from critics of the Fukushima meltdowns to a
        sympathetic Globe and Mail in its November 11 edition:<br>
        <br>
        “Jay Cullen never expected the world of hate he encountered when
        he began to post scientific information about the impact of the
        Fukushima accident on the Pacific Ocean. Criticism was
        anticipated ­ but then he started getting death threats.<br>
        <br>
        “’I knew there were lots of individuals who felt strongly about
        nuclear power. So it wasn’t a surprise that there were those who
        didn’t accept what the scientific research was showing, but I
        have to admit the hatred and the threats I received, that was
        somewhat of a surprise.’<br>
        <br>
        “Dr. Cullen started a radionuclide-monitoring program in 2014.
        The Integrated Fukushima Ocean Radionuclide Monitoring project
        (or InFORM, as he optimistically called it) worked with a broad
        network of scientists to gather the latest research and
        distribute it to the public.<br>
        <br>
        “Shortly after he began blogging about the findings, which
        showed just about zero risk to the environment and to the public
        in North America, he became the target of a hate campaign.”<br>
        <br>
        So there you have it from both sides, the Rashomon effect. Truth
        is in the eye of the beholder, or is the payoff in a Swiss bank
        account? Who to believe: Dastardly Dana or the Professor of
        Culling?<b><br>
          <br>
          The Wheelchair Murders<br>
          <br>
        </b>When the Durnford case reaches trial, the prosecution must
        prove that the accused made a threat with murderous intent that
        could be actualized in a physical assault or with a weapon. The
        defendant, however, is disabled and requires the assistance of a
        wheelchair or crutches for mobility. It is highly unlikely that
        Durnford could mount a successful physical attack against any
        person capable of running, making the harassment charges simply
        a bad joke that exposes the folly of this spurious court case.<br>
        <br>
        If anything, the scene of Professors Cullen and Buesseler being
        chased around the docks by a wheelchair would make a hilarious
        episode for the Canadian comic-reality show “Just for Gags”.<b><br>
          <br>
          Apologists for Nuclear Ecocide<br>
          <br>
        </b>Here, I present arguments for Durnford’s defense, much of
        which cannot be entered into the court record in a national
        judicial system constrained by a blanket nuclear-security regime
        and Official Secrets Act that grossly subvert the Rule of Law:<br>
        <br>
        - First, it will be shown that the accusers Cullen and Buesseler
        have institutional links with the nuclear industry and nuclear
        weapons, and are therefore implicated in the Fukushima cover-up
        for their assigned task of countering anti-nuclear critics.
        Their illicit connections to the military-nuclear complex prompt
        them to concoct flawed research methodologies that purposely
        underestimate levels of radioactive contamination. Their
        grotesque violations of science ethics are here exposed,
        followed by a call for their being defrocked and excluded from
        academic discourse.<br>
        <br>
        - Second, the funding from the nuclear industry to the
        University of Victoria, located on Vancouver Island, is “hush
        money” timed to coincide with the imminent start of uranium
        shipments across Western Canada through Vancouver harbour to
        Asia by TEPCO Resources, yes, the same Tokyo Electric Power
        Company responsible for Fukushima and co-owner of the Cigar Lake
        uranium mine, which recently started extraction operations in
        Sasketchewan. TEPCO is hitting Canada in more ways than one.<br>
        <br>
        - Third, the Canadian government’s nuclear-secrecy regulations
        backed by the Official Secrets Act encourages extralegal
        suppression of anti-nuclear critics and enables the duplicitous
        export of uranium for nuclear weapons despite a long-standing
        export ban imposed by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. The
        Crown-owned Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. connected with the
        funding for Cullen’s inFORM radiation-monitoring project got its
        start as the uranium supplier to the Manhattan Project, which
        constructed the atomic bombs that exterminated up to a
        quarter-million civilians in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br>
        <br>
        - Fourth, the principle of international law set by the highest
        Tribunal in postwar history ruled that scientists who
        participate in genocidal programs must be meted out capital
        punishment. To repeat emphatically, for the education of
        plaintiffs Cullen and Buesseler, researchers implicated in mass
        murder deserve to be executed, according to the unanimous
        decision at the Nuremberg Doctors Trial.<b><br>
          <br>
          Downplaying the Radiation Threat<br>
          <br>
        </b>Before doing a single stitch of field research, Cullen
        stated that the Canadian coast is free of dangerous levels of
        radiation and categorically disputed that Fukushima radioactive
        contamination as a causal factor in the numerous reports of mass
        deaths of marine mammals, fish, sea birds and invertebrates over
        the past two years. Since 2014, his inFORM network has involved
        willing NGOs to set up monitoring stations north of Vancouver
        Island to measure radiation in water.<br>
        <br>
        Professor Cullen is using a bogus methodology, Water is known to
        be a highly unreliable medium for radiation measurement due to
        the diffraction and diffusion of gamma and beta rays, on the
        same principle as the reflection of visible light in a glass of
        liquid. Therefore, the only effectual method to determine
        exposure levels is by measuring radiation levels in marine
        vegetation and sea-animal tissue, to determine the
        “bio-accumulation” of radioactive isotopes. In an urgent crisis
        like Fukushima, the effect of radiation on life is all that
        matters.<br>
        <br>
        A low level of radioactive does not eliminate the risk of
        harmful health effects or lethal consequences. What matters more
        is the time-length of exposure because of its cumulative effect.
        The vast area of contamination of the atmosphere and water
        across the Pacific, resupplied by unstoppable releases from the
        Fukushima plant, has resulted in practically year-round 24X7
        exposure for residents of the North American Pacific coastal
        region. An apt analogy is the cancer threat from secondary
        cigarette smoke. While the nonsmoker does not inhale high
        concentrations of carcinogens, constant exposure to low levels
        of indoor smoke can lead to lung cancer.<br>
        <br>
        Bioaccumulation is, therefore, the focus of my field research in
        measuring radiation along the Fukushima coast and on the beaches
        of Southern California and Washington State over the past four
        years since the meltdowns. Some of those field studies were done
        at the tip of Makah Indian territory where the Pacific meets the
        Salish Sea channel. This area, which directly faces Vancouver
        Island where Dr. Cullen’s laboratory is located, showed
        disturbing levels of radiation contamination in varieties of
        seaweed and plastic flotsam. The fact that Professor Cullen
        cannot find any substantial traces of radiation in that same
        vicinity of the Salish Sea discloses him to be a huckster for
        the nuclear lobby and a disgrace for the University of Victoria.<b><br>
          <br>
          Cesium-137 Deception and Flat-Earth Theory<br>
        </b><br>
        The veracity of Buesseler and his apprentice Cullen rides on a
        claim they made to the PBS Nova science program: “Cullen and Ken
        Buesseler, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
        Institute, found no trace of radioactivity from the meltdown of
        the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear reactor in fish collected off
        British Columbia. Rather, the faint traces of radioactivity they
        found can be traced to weapons testing done over the Pacific in
        the 1960s and ’70s. Fukushima’s fingerprint is cesium-134, a
        radioactive isotope with a half-life of two years. Because it
        will decay almost completely within a decade, the presence of
        cesium-134 can only be explained by recent exposure, such as the
        discharge of radioactive coolant that occurred at Fukushima. By
        contrast, the isotope lingering from weapons testing,
        cesium-137, has a half-life of 30 years.”<br>
        <br>
        In an interview with the Juneau Empire newspaper in Alaska in
        April 2015, Cullen was dismissive of the health risk from
        Fukushima: "’The prediction is that we will not approach levels
        that will present a danger to anybody's health,’ Cullen said,
        adding ‘that it's unlikely marine organisms will be at risk. I
        would say that there's a small proportion of the public who hold
        the belief that the Pacific Ocean and our coasts are void of
        life because of radiation from Fukushima.’"<br>
        <br>
        The Buesseler-Cullen thesis, summarized, is that since March 1,
        2013 (two years after the 311 crisis), Fukushima radiation in
        seawater poses absolutely no threat due to the 2-year half-life
        of cesium-134. Any radiation from cesium-137 (half-life of 30
        years) is from atmosphere tests more than three decades ago,
        meaning there is at present no radioactive threat at all.<br>
        <br>
        Their fantastic fable for idiots is shattered by factual
        reporting by the Kyodo news agency (10 May 2014): “At the
        European Geosciences Union meeting in Vienna, Michio Aoyama, a
        professor at Fukushima University’s Institute of Environmental
        Radioactivity who is part of the research team, said that TEPCO
        underestimates the amount of cesium-137 that was released into
        the atmosphere and later fell into the sea.<br>
        <br>
        “Scientists are trying to detect the levels of radioactive
        cesium due to its potential, long-term risks to the land and
        sea. Cesium-137, which has a half-life of around 30 years, can
        cause cancer.The study estimates that 14,000 to 17,000
        terabecquerels of cesium-137 were released into the atmosphere,
        while about 3,500 terabecquerels directly flowed into the ocean.
        (A terabequerel is equal to 1 trillion bequerels.)<br>
        <br>
        “ Aoyama said the release of radioactive cesium-137 has a ‘big
        impact on the ocean’ since the Fukushima nuclear complex is near
        the coast. The study also found that 12,000 to 15,000
        terabecquerels of the cesium-137 released into the atmosphere
        fell into the sea, while the remaining amount fell into the
        soil. Of the amount that fell on land, up to 400 terabecquerels
        fell on North America.”<br>
        <br>
        No cesium-137 from Fukushima, Professors Cullen and Buesseler?
        Have you never heard about the mixed oxide (MOX) fuel rods of
        uranium and plutonium that went up in smoke from Reactor 3? And
        that these burnt-out rods continue to bleed radioactive isotopes
        including Cs-137 into the Pacific?<b><br>
        </b><br>
        The Buesseler-Cullen thesis collapses like flat-earth theory
        crumbled when challenged by one astronomer’s observations
        through a telescope in the late 16th century. Knowing full well
        the flaws in his own argument, Cullen reacts in the same manner
        at the flat-earther scientists did against Galileo, by
        denouncing Dana Durnford as a dangerous heretic. Unable to
        counter Durnford’s massive biological data findings, Cullen
        resorts to calling the police just like the top scientists of
        the past called in the Vatican’s thought-control priesthood
        against Galileo, who was imprisoned for the high crime of
        reporting the facts and nothing but the facts.<br>
        <b><br>
        </b>Class dismissed, and you Professor Cullen and Dr. Buesseler
        are fired and fork over the grant money. That, departments heads
        at U. Victoria, is how to deal with scientific fraud.<b><br>
          <br>
          Atomic Energy of Canada<br>
          <br>
        </b>What Jay Cullen failed to mention to the Toronto-based
        Global and Mail is that the 630,000 dollar grant to his inFORM
        project came from the MEOPAR foundation, whose Board chairman is
        Robert Walker, former CEO and President of Atomic Energy of
        Canada Ltd. (AECL). The federal Crown corporation is Canada’s
        largest nuclear laboratory, which developed the CANDU reactors
        and was the wartime uranium-supplier for the Manhattan Project,
        which built and detonated the world’s first atomic bombs.<br>
        <br>
        The Pentagon links to AECL were revealed early-on, in December
        1952, when the NRX reactor at AECL’s Chalk River lab suffered a
        partial meltdown in the world’s first major nuclear accident.
        One of the American naval officers dispatched to Chalk River by
        then-Captain Hyman Rickover, founder of the U.S. nuclear fleet,
        was Lt. Jimmy Carter. His assignment was to enter and inspect
        the damaged reactor building, and this is the probable cause for
        his struggles with cancer. The nuclear industry, which has shown
        no regrets about harming a president, certainly has nothing but
        contempt for ordinary citizens.<br>
        <br>
        Before his appointment at Victoria, Cullen was a postgraduate
        researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI),
        where obviously he was inducted into the radiation cover-up
        operation by Ken Buesseler. Woods Hole provide civilian cover
        for the U.S. Office of Naval Research (ONR), the marine
        component of DARPA. WHOI got its start during World War II with
        its development of sonar, needed to detect and target German
        U-boats and Japanese submarines. Sonar invention was a crash
        program for the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), which later
        created the CIA.<br>
        <br>
        Buesseller is a dissembler who has made extraordinary efforts to
        conceal his secret work for military programs. His focus on
        Fukushima radiation was initiated soon after the 311 disaster
        under assignment with the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL).
        Attached to that study of radioactivity in the seas south of
        Fukushima was postdoctoral researcher Elizabeth Douglass with
        the NRL. Funding for Woods Hole comes from the Defense
        Department; the Department of Energy, which produces nuclear
        warheads; weapons manufacturer Raytheon; and environmental
        polluter Chevron.<b><br>
          <br>
        </b>The team of Buesseler and Cullen, like a Sith lord and his
        eager apprentice, are agents of the nexus of the nuclear-weapons
        establishment and corporate merchants of death.<br>
        <b><br>
          Canada’s Nuclear Conundrum<br>
          <br>
        </b>Canada, in its less-than glorious moments, is capable of
        committing acts of official repression of the type Edward
        Snowdon warned of coming from its neighbor to the south. The
        Canadian government deploys an arsenal of press censorship and
        repression of anti-nuclear critics.<br>

        An arrest similar to Durnford’s occurred in Yellowknife in the
        Northern Territories soon after the Fukushima disaster targeted
        a local radio host who had discussed the radiation levels in
        northern Canada. He was soon thereafter taken away in a raid by
        uniformed men and silenced. His name was never identified to the
        public and he has not been heard from since. Yellowknife is the
        center of operations for the Pentagon-supported Canadian Arctic
        command.<br>
        <br>
        Despite the best efforts of the elder Trudeau against nuclear
        weapons, secret uranium shipments from Canada continued for
        nuclear-warhead production in the United States. In blatant
        violation of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Canada
        has supplied uranium to the Indian, Pakistani and Israeli
        nuclear program under the thinnest pretext of supporting
        “peaceful” civilian energy. Bureaucratic duplicity, of course,
        is connected with corruption.<b><br>
          <br>
          Devil in the Details<br>
          <br>
        </b>What is interesting today about the Fukushima-related arrest
        of Durnford is the eagerness of the Canadian authorities to
        suppress its own citizens who criticize Japan’s nuclear
        industry. This is because Fukushima-perpetrator TEPCO is a
        shareholder in Canada’s largest untapped deposit of high-grade
        uranium, which began production in September 2015. If ever there
        was a deal with the devil, it is called, appropriately, Cigar
        Lake.<br>
        <br>
        TEPCO is sending the uranium not to its own nuclear plants,
        which have little chance of restart-up. Instead, the
        nuclear-energy giant is morphing into a supplier of fuel rods
        for new reactors being promoted by the Abe government in Turkey,
        Vietnam, the UAE and India. Therefore, much of that uranium from
        Cigar Lake will be sent by truck on the public highways of
        Western Canada and loaded onto ships in Vancouver harbour. The
        planned massive expansion of uranium shipment will without doubt
        threatened public health in that fair city. This is why Jay
        Cullen is needed by TEPCO and CAMECO to be posted in the
        Vancouver region to dispel any concerns of local residents when
        local children start dying of thyroid cancer and leukemia.<b><br>
          <br>
          Fouling the Arctic<br>
          <br>
        </b>The Cigar Lake mine is located 450 meters underground in
        northern Sasketchewan. Deep below the lake bed, the uranium
        deposit rests on dense ancient bedrock. Above this subterranean
        trove is the Athabascan aquifer, a canyon-like labyrinth carved
        into porous sandstone by underground streams, which eventually
        feed into the northward-flowing MacKenzie River.<br>
        <br>
        The mining is done by CAMECO, the world’s largest publicly
        traded uranium miner, which was spun off by the federal
        government and Sasketchewan Province. The uranium deposit is
        blasted to pieces by water-jet technology. Pressured water,
        focused in a small radius, can easily cut through metal, as is
        done at fabrication workshops. The difficult challenge is to
        prevent loosened particles from contaminating the aquifer.
        Therefore a barrier between the mining and the aquifer is
        created by pumping super-chilled water into the sandstone to
        create an “ice wall”.<br>
        <br>
        Ice walls have a dismal record. Engineers at the Fukushima
        nuclear plant made many attempts to surround the facility with
        an ice barrier but have repeatedly failed. So too at Cigar Lake,
        where recurrent flooding has delaying mining for years on end.
        The simple fact that the brightest engineers cannot comprehend
        is that water when frozen expands, thereby shattering the matrix
        of sandstone.<br>
        <br>
        Cigar Lake has probably already started to contaminate the
        springs that fill the MacKenzie River, which drains into the
        Beaufort Sea. The waste material from Cigar Lake will add more
        radioactive material in the Arctic atop the massive amounts of
        isotopes and tritium carried by the jetstream from Fukushima.
        The destruction of the Arctic ice cap, along with the opening of
        a polar atmospheric ozone hole, suddenly started just a month
        after the Fukushima radioactive releases in 2011. The
        destruction of Arctic wildlife, including polar bears and
        walruses, are undoubtedly being caused by that surge of
        radiation contamination. All of these realities are denied by
        the scientific establishment and its military bosses.<b><br>
          <br>
          Nuremberg Verdict on Murderous Science<br>
        </b><br>
        Only a halfwit or a numskull could misconstrue Dana’s comments
        as a direct death threat against Cullen or Buesseler. To dare
        mention that an evil scientist deserves to die constitutes a
        crime, but to spew lies that abet the deaths of millions is just
        a job.<br>
        <br>
        His comments were essentially along the same lines as Jean
        Rostand’s in Thoughts of a Biologist: Kill one man, and you are
        a murderer. Kill millions of men, and you are a conqueror. Kill
        them all, and you are a god.” TEPCO has achieved the status of a
        deity, worshiped by Canada’s bankers and politicians. CAMECO and
        Atomic Energy of Canada are now trying to join the same major
        league. (As for diabolical metaphors, the AECL logo is just one
        ray from being a pentagram.)<br>
        <br>
        There are strong reasons why scientists are expected to live up
        to higher standards for truthfulness and ethical conduct, in
        contrast with the money-grubbing merchant or obedient
        technocrat. Communities and nations depend on the ethical
        integrity and moral conscience of science professionals who
        control vast powers over life and death.<br>
        <br>
        The temptation to destructive power was described by nuclear
        physicist Robert Oppenheimer in his chilling words on his newly
        devised atomic bomb: “Now I am become Death, destroyer of
        worlds.” Death on a planetary scale is being realized in the
        ongoing spread of radioactive contamination out of Fukushima.
        How a scientist reacts to this unending catastrophe, whether
        with a dismissive attitude or serious consideration, is an
        ethical litmus test.<br>
        <br>
        The higher responsibility of scientific researchers to defend
        the public interest was accorded special emphasis at the the
        Nuremberg Doctor’s Trial. The tribunal’s counts against the
        German medical researchers included “common design or
        conspiracy”, “crimes against humanity” and “membership in a
        criminal organization.” Among those who received the maximum
        penalty of hanging by the neck were Red Cross chief Karl
        Gebhardt, the Reich’s chief hygeinist Joachim Mrugowsky, and
        Wolfram Sieverts, head of military science research. The
        Nuremberg verdict set the standard for dealing with serious
        abuse of scientific authority.<br>
        <br>
        The Globe and Mail acticle reported that Cullen was shocked that
        “he was not only called a ‘shill for the nuclear industry’ and a
        ‘sham scientist’ but was told he and other researchers who were
        reporting that the Fukushima radiation wasn’t a threat deserved
        to be executed.”<br>
        <br>
        Well, Doktor Cullen, did you not choose to enter into a “common
        design or conspiracy” to deny the dangers to public health posed
        by radioactivity? Do you and Dr. Buesseler not make excuses for
        “crimes against humanity”? And, by any chance, do the two of you
        belong to a “criminal organization” that dares not reveal its
        existence?<br>
        <br>
        Do scientists who sell out their ethics for pieces of silver
        when millions of civilian lives are at stake “deserve to be
        executed”? According to the highest standard of international
        law on criminal abuse by scientific researcher, the Nuremberg
        Doctors Trial, the answer is an emphatic affirmative: Scientists
        involved in genocide should be put to death. There are no ifs,
        buts or maybes about it. You, Professor Cullen and Dr.
        Buesseler, are guilty, and Dana Durnford is innocent. The
        defense rests.<b><br>
          <br>
          Canada on Trial<br>
          <br>
        </b>While Durnford faces an official inquisition, it is actually
        Canada on trial. Will that northern dominion abide by its own
        principles of nonproliferation, opposition to nuclear war and
        environmental protection for the welfare of its communities, its
        children and its threatened wildlife? Or will Canada
        self-destruct like Shinzo Abe’s Japan under militarism, war
        denial and unstoppable radioactive contamination?<br>
        <br>
        The new Canadian prime minister faces the daunting challenge
        posed by his father: “Nuclear weapons exist. They probably
        always will. And they work, with horrible efficiency. They
        threaten the very future of our species. We have no choice but
        to manage that risk. Never again can we put the task out of our
        minds; nor trivialize it; nor make it routine. Nor dare we lose
        heart.”<br>
        <br>
        Yoichi Shimatsu, former editor of The Japan Times Weekly, is a
        science journalist who has conducted extensive radiation studies
        inside the Fukushima nuclear exclusion zone since April 2011. He
        shares a weekly online radio program at rense.com with Dana

        Dr. Guy McPherson addresses a bleak, new climate change concern:
        global dimming. With a cruel and terrible irony, the burning of
        coal and other particulate-emitting fuels may be slowing the
        rate global warming due to release of light-reflecting
        particulate matter. However, the commensurate CO2 and other
        greenhouse emissions cause heat to be retained in the
        atmosphere, thus contributing to long-term warming.<br>
        <br>
        In other words, global dimming may present a lose-lose situation
        with no current, viable solution; a true dilemma. Whether this
        issue will addressed in the next international global conference
        on climate change will be interesting to see. <b><br>

        </b>New design points a path to the ‘ultimate’
        batteryResearchers have successfully demonstrated how several of
        the problems impeding the practical development of the so-called
        ‘ultimate’ battery could be overcome.<br>
        <br>
        Scientists have developed a working laboratory demonstrator of a
        lithium-oxygen battery which has very high energy density, is
        more than 90% efficient, and, to date, can be recharged more
        than 2000 times, showing how several of the problems holding
        back the development of these devices could be solved. <br>
        <br>
        Lithium-oxygen, or lithium-air, batteries have been touted as
        the ‘ultimate’ battery due to their theoretical energy density,
        which is ten times that of a lithium-ion battery. Such a high
        energy density would be comparable to that of gasoline – and
        would enable an electric car with a battery that is a fifth the
        cost and a fifth the weight of those currently on the market to
        drive from London to Edinburgh on a single charge.<br>
        <br>
        However, as is the case with other next-generation batteries,
        there are several practical challenges that need to be addressed
        before lithium-air batteries become a viable alternative to
        gasoline.<br>
        <br>
        Now, researchers from the University of Cambridge have
        demonstrated how some of these obstacles may be overcome, and
        developed a lab-based demonstrator of a lithium-oxygen battery
        which has higher capacity, increased energy efficiency and
        improved stability over previous attempts.<br>
        <br>
        Their demonstrator relies on a highly porous, ‘fluffy’ carbon
        electrode made from graphene (comprising one-atom-thick sheets
        of carbon atoms), and additives that alter the chemical
        reactions at work in the battery, making it more stable and more
        efficient. While the results, reported in the journal Science,
        are promising, the researchers caution that a practical
        lithium-air battery still remains at least a decade away.<br>
        <br>
        “What we’ve achieved is a significant advance for this
        technology and suggests whole new areas for research – we
        haven’t solved all the problems inherent to this chemistry, but
        our results do show routes forward towards a practical device,”
        said Professor Clare Grey of Cambridge’s Department of
        Chemistry, the paper’s senior author.<br>
        <br>
        Many of the technologies we use every day have been getting
        smaller, faster and cheaper each year – with the notable
        exception of batteries. Apart from the possibility of a
        smartphone which lasts for days without needing to be charged,
        the challenges associated with making a better battery are
        holding back the widespread adoption of two major clean
        technologies: electric cars and grid-scale storage for solar
        power.<b><br>
          <br>
        </b>“In their simplest form, batteries are made of three
        components: a positive electrode, a negative electrode and an
        electrolyte,’’ said Dr Tao Liu, also from the Department of
        Chemistry, and the paper’s first author.<br>
        <br>
        In the lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries we use in our laptops and
        smartphones, the negative electrode is made of graphite (a form
        of carbon), the positive electrode is made of a metal oxide,
        such as lithium cobalt oxide, and the electrolyte is a lithium
        salt dissolved in an organic solvent. The action of the battery
        depends on the movement of lithium ions between the electrodes.
        Li-ion batteries are light, but their capacity deteriorates with
        age, and their relatively low energy densities mean that they
        need to be recharged frequently.<br>
        <br>
        Over the past decade, researchers have been developing various
        alternatives to Li-ion batteries, and lithium-air batteries are
        considered the ultimate in next-generation energy storage,
        because of their extremely high energy density. However,
        previous attempts at working demonstrators have had low
        efficiency, poor rate performance, unwanted chemical reactions,
        and can only be cycled in pure oxygen.<br>
        <br>
        What Liu, Grey and their colleagues have developed uses a very
        different chemistry than earlier attempts at a non-aqueous
        lithium-air battery, relying on lithium hydroxide (LiOH) instead
        of lithium peroxide (Li2O2). With the addition of water and the
        use of lithium iodide as a ‘mediator’, their battery showed far
        less of the chemical reactions which can cause cells to die,
        making it far more stable after multiple charge and discharge
        cycles.<br>
        <br>
        By precisely engineering the structure of the electrode,
        changing it to a highly porous form of graphene, adding lithium
        iodide, and changing the chemical makeup of the electrolyte, the
        researchers were able to reduce the ‘voltage gap’ between charge
        and discharge to 0.2 volts. A small voltage gap equals a more
        efficient battery – previous versions of a lithium-air battery
        have only managed to get the gap down to 0.5 – 1.0 volts,
        whereas 0.2 volts is closer to that of a Li-ion battery, and
        equates to an energy efficiency of 93%.<br>
        <br>
        The highly porous graphene electrode also greatly increases the
        capacity of the demonstrator, although only at certain rates of
        charge and discharge. Other issues that still have to be
        addressed include finding a way to protect the metal electrode
        so that it doesn’t form spindly lithium metal fibres known as
        dendrites, which can cause batteries to explode if they grow too
        much and short-circuit the battery.<br>
        <br>
        Additionally, the demonstrator can only be cycled in pure
        oxygen, while the air around us also contains carbon dioxide,
        nitrogen and moisture, all of which are generally harmful to the
        metal electrode.<br>
        <br>
        “There’s still a lot of work to do,” said Liu. “But what we’ve
        seen here suggests that there are ways to solve these problems –
        maybe we’ve just got to look at things a little differently.”<br>
        <b><br>
        </b>“While there are still plenty of fundamental studies that
        remain to be done, to iron out some of the mechanistic details,
        the current results are extremely exciting – we are still very
        much at the development stage, but we’ve shown that there are
        solutions to some of the tough problems associated with this
        technology,” said Grey.<b><br>

        </b>The rechargeable aprotic lithium-air (Li-O2) battery is a
        promising potential technology for next-generation energy
        storage, but its practical realization still faces many
        challenges. In contrast to the standard Li-O2 cells, which cycle
        via the formation of Li2O2, we used a reduced graphene oxide
        electrode, the additive LiI, and the solvent dimethoxyethane to
        reversibly form and remove crystalline LiOH with particle sizes
        larger than 15 micrometers during discharge and charge. This
        leads to high specific capacities, excellent energy efficiency
        (93.2%) with a voltage gap of only 0.2 volt, and impressive
        rechargeability. The cells tolerate high concentrations of
        water, water being the dominant proton source for the LiOH;
        together with LiI, it has a decisive impact on the chemical
        nature of the discharge product and on battery performance. <br>

        Lithium mobility, as a function of temperature during battery
        cycling, can be simply monitored by using in situ T2′ relaxation
        measurements. Since Li dynamics are strongly related to
        structural properties, the changes in in situ T2′ can be used to
        detect structural changes, such as Li ordering.<b><br>

        </b>… 1. Islam is a political system, NOT a religion, and unless
        and until humanity wakes the hell up and STOPS referring to it
        as a religion, there is no hope. Islam is a hyper-aggressive,
        militaristic, expansionist, totalitarian political system
        designed to create a super-rich micro-oligarchical ruling class
        with a massive, destitute, genetically handicapped underclass
        below. The paper-thin faux-religious facade was a conscious,
        specific con from the very beginning – much like Mormonism and
        Scientology – a pure racket using borrowed and piggy-backed
        religious motifs to lend credibility to a massive, loosely-knit
        network of crime syndicate cells.<br>
        <br>
        Here is a quote from Osama bin Laden that sums it all up:<br>
        <br>
        “Our talks with the infidel West and our conflict with them
        ultimately revolve around one issue; one that demands our total
        support, with power and determination, with one voice, and it
        is: Does Islam, or does it not, force people by the power of the
        sword to submit to its authority corporeally if not spiritually?
        Yes. There are only three choices in Islam: [1] either willing
        submission [conversion]; or [2] payment of the jizya, through
        physical, though not spiritual, submission to the authority of
        Islam; or [3] the sword, for it is not right to let him [an
        infidel] live. The matter is summed up for every person alive:
        Either submit, or live under the suzerainty of Islam, or die.”
        –Osama Bin Laden (The Al Qaeda Reader, p. 42)<br>
        <br>
        Definition of suzerainty: a situation in which a region or
        people is a compulsory tributary to a more powerful entity,
        which controls its foreign affairs while allowing the tributary
        vassal state internal autonomy… <b><br>

          Winston Churchill, "The River War" re : Islam ( 1899 )<br>
          <br>
        </b>"How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its
        votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in
        a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic
        apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident
        habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of
        commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the
        followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism
        deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its
        dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every
        woman must belong to some man as his absolute property - either
        as a child, a wife, or a concubine - must delay the final
        extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be
        a great power among men.<br>
        <br>
        "Individual Moslems may show splendid qualities. Thousands
        become the brave and loyal soldiers of the Queen; all know how
        to die; but the influence of the religion paralyses the social
        development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force
        exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a
        militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread
        throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every
        step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the
        strong arms of science - the science against which it had vainly
        struggled - the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as
        fell the civilisation of ancient Rome."<b><br>

        <b><br>
        </b>Once a upon a time, a long time ago, the tribe of Judah
        supported the Assyrians when they destroyed the Northern Kingdom
        of Israel. When their brothers, the Hebrews, fled south the
        tribe of Judah treated them as slaves and servants. Many of
        these Hebrews escaped this slavery and fled to Egypt where they
        found sanctuary.&nbsp; Their scholars eventually established a
        centre of learning in Alexandria, and were known as the
        Therapeutia. Also called the Essenes who after the Persian
        (Iranian) Cyrus the great, referred to in Isaiah as the Messiah
        and saviour, freed the Middle East, returned to Israel and
        resettled on what is now known as the West Bank, Mount Carmel
        and Damascus.<br>
        <br>
        Both Isaiah (17) and Jeremiah ( 34: 9 – 20) admonished the kings
        of Judah, not only for subjecting their brothers, the Hebrews,
        to slavery, but for breaking the Covenant. Both prophets speak
        in terms of two kingdoms. The kingdom of Israel and the kingdom
        of Judah. Often ignored by Biblical scholars and glossed over as
        the so-called Lost Ten Tribes of Israel who in fact never went
        anywhere. They are still there today. The are the Samaritans,
        the Torah Jews, the Orthodox Christians and the Muslims in
        Palestine, Syria, Iraq and Iran.<br>
        <br>
        According to the Covenant, Joshua/Yeshua (Greek translation:
        Jesus), dedicated the twelve tribes of Israel to the ten
        commandments and to love the Lord God alone at Mount Gerizim.
        Unlike other nations, they were not to have a monarchy, but were
        to be governed by a Judiciary, where Deborah, who sat under the
        palm tree at Tadmor, (you can read Palmyra here) was one of the
        first judges of Israel.<br>
        <br>
        Israel broke this Covenant when they demanded to have a king,
        and the Judge Samuel was told to protest to them that this was
        wrong and what kind of king would lead them. (1 Samuel 8)<br>
        <br>
        In the 21st century, the Zionist State (Judah)has not abided by
        Resolution 242. They have gone back on their word. According to
        the agreement the Golan Heights were to be returned to Syria
        (Israel) which they invaded during the six-day war in 1967 and
        peace agreements were to be signed. To date the Zionist sate has
        instead increased illegal settlements in the area and broken
        international law.<br>
        <br>
        As Jeremiah says to Judah (34: 9-20), they have gone back on
        their word today as they did in the past, and the consequences
        of their actions, according to the prophet, will be devastating.<br>
        <br>
        The Zionist State (Judah) has been supporting Daesh (Assyrians)
        on the Golan Heights and both Mossad and Zionist (Judah)
        generals have been captured in Iraq and Syria.<br>
        <br>
        Palmyra, the palm tree under which Debra sat and adjudicated as
        one of the first Judges of Israel, known as the House of God,
        Bethal, was invaded by Daesh (Assyrians) and her ancient
        monuments destroyed.<br>
        <br>
        Revelations in turn is about the early Christian Church.
        Damascus was one of the main centres of early Christianity 2,000
        years ago. These Christians were descended from the Hebrews, the
        Northern Kingdom of Israel, Ephraim and Manasseh the sons of
        Joseph. Ephraim is called the Firstborn of God in Jeremiah 31.
        Joshua/Yeshua (Greek translation: Jesus) was the grandson of
        Ephraim who established the New Kingdom of Israel.<br>
        <br>
        The early Christian church spread to Greece, in what is now
        western Turkey where the seven churches of Revelation are
        situated.<br>
        <br>
        In the 21st century we have Daesh (Assyrians) running rampant
        over both Iraq and Syria where they have beheaded Christians,
        crucified them and raped their women and children. They have
        also done the same to the Yezidis, the Kurds and the Shiite
        Muslim communities and Sunnis Muslims who have not supported
        them and&nbsp; all four groups are descendants of the Hebrews of
        the Northern Kingdom of Israel.<br>
        <br>
        Turkey in turn, a supporter of Daesh ( as we have seen in
        Putin’s report to the G20 on the 16th November,) has been
        illegally buying stolen oil from Daesh shipped in oil tanks from
        Syria and delivered to Erdogan’s son. Turkey was also
        responsible 100 years ago for the genocide of Orthodox Armenian
        Christians.As of the 20th November, Putin is now doing bombing
        raids and destroying their delivery trucks.<br>
        <br>
        According to Shiite Islam, the Mahdi will return at the second
        coming and will fight alongside Jesus to defeat the anti-Christ.
        Today what is known as the Shiite crescent in Iran, Syria and
        Iraq is fighting alongside Russia to defeat Daesh. Russia in
        turn, under Putin, has been restored to the Orthodox Christian
        Church after almost one hundred years of imposed atheism. Daesh
        is trained, funded and supported by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey,
        Israel and the United States.<br>
        <br>
        On the 28th September, Putin stood before the United Nations and
        without mentioning any of the guilty parties asked two important
        questions:<br>
        <br>
        “Do you know what you have done?”<br>
        <br>
        “Do you know what Nation State Sovereignty is?”<br>
        <br>
        On the 30th of September Putin entered the war and set about the
        total destruction of Daesh in Syria. On the 16th of November he
        presented to the G20 nations satellite and banking details of 40
        countries who had been either directly or indirectly training,
        funding and arming Daesh. Daesh comprises of many people from
        many different countries all over the world and very few of them
        are Syrians. They are now being destroyed in Syria with fire and
        brimstone.<br>
        <br>
        As I have pointed out in a previous article, Gog and Magog are
        the Khazars from Asia. These Khazars over the last 1,000 years
        have moved into Europe and The Middle East, where according to
        Khazar practice they have converted to Judaism, Roman Catholic
        Christianity and Islam and adopted the culture of the nations
        they have infiltrated. (Revelation 20: 8-10)<br>

        </b>In the 21st century they are the Ashkenazi Jews in Israel
        (Europeans from Eastern Europe) , the Jesuits in the Vatican
        (Blackwater/CIA) and the Wahhabi Muslims. All three groups are
        controlled by what is a Khazar ethic which embraces slavery,
        racism, sexism and the Talmud. Also keep in mind that the same
        pattern emerged 2,000 years ago with a pact between the High
        Priest Caiaphas (Zionist), the Herod Antipas
        (Edomite-Wahhabi)and Pontius Pilate (Rome.) In 35 A.D. they
        massacred the Samaritans at Mount Gerizim and were then banished
        to Gaul in 36 A.D. We see the same alliance in Kiev Ukraine
        between Zionists, Victoria Newland, Nazi-Avov Battalions (the
        Vatican supported the Nazis in WW2) and the Jihadists who have
        joined them to fight the Russian speaking population in Eastern
        Ukraine.<br>
        <br>
        As we watch this war play out in Syria, I strongly believe,
        rightly or wrongly, that the final battle will be fought on the
        Golan Heights, Armageddon. The Zionist State (Judah) would do
        well to retreat entirely, abide by Resolution 242 and hand it
        back to Syria (Israel).<br>
        <br>
        As for Turkey they are playing with fire. The Turks invaded what
        once was the Orthodox Christian Byzantine Empire and turned the
        Hagia Sophia into a museum. The best option for Turkey is to
        take the lead from Putin. This year the Grand Mosque was opened
        in Moscow. Turkey would do well to return the favour, stop
        supporting Daesh, remove Erdogan from power, return to a secular
        state, and hand back the Hagia Sophia to the Orthodox Christian
        church where they once again can hold church services.<br>
        <br>
        If these steps are not taken, then the dire warning in Isaiah
        17, Jeremiah 34: 9-20, as well as the destruction spoken of in
        Revelation, will be brought to bear on all nations who have
        supported Daesh either directly or indirectly.<br>
        <br>
        We have now reached Armageddon. I believe, the Golan Heights
        will be the final battle.<b><br>

        </div>
        <b><br>
        </b>All of the hate crime legislation in the world has been
        created by one group, the Zionist Jew lobby, working through
        B’nai Brith International and other similar orgs. They’ve set
        themselves up in every nation of the West and their primary
        purpose as agents of the state of Israel is to silence any and
        all criticism of the Zionist ideology and its debilitating
        effect upon human rights and freedom of expression. This fact is
        now beyond dispute and case after case where individuals are
        charged with these duplicitous “hate” crimes the complainants
        inevitably are dual citizens of the foreign state of Israel or
        else goy sycophants in the pay of these same lobbyists.<br>
        <br>
        To support Israel is to support racism, apartheid, murder of
        innocents, theft of other nation’s land, the destruction of
        other cultures, war, destruction and endless terrorist acts and
        media deception on a scale never before witnessed in human
        history.<br>
        <br>
        Any Western government that “stands with Israel” is admitting to
        and condoning and complicit with all of these barbaric and
        uncivilized actions that comprise the whole of what political
        Zionism entails.<br>
        <b><br>
          God<br>
          <br>
        </b>My first duty as a human being is to acknowledge, revere and
        do the Will of the Creator – source of all life. God = Love =
        Truth. If I don’t include God in every equation related to my
        work and my life then it all becomes meaningless and devoid of
        that one fundamental principle which governs both the physical
        and spiritual realms. Any attempt at addressing the evils that
        men do which omits the Truth is futile. God gave man Free Will
        which ultimately implies the right to express himself without
        fear of state repression. The atheistic Zionist agenda would end
        that freedom of the mind and soul and for that reason alone it
        must be resisted all costs.<b><br>
          <br>
          Conclusion<br>
          <br>
        </b>My purpose in all that I’ve done over my lifetime has been
        to shed light upon the machinations of those who would enslave
        us and silence us so that we’re not at liberty to express our
        thoughts and ideas. Censorship now remains the #1 threat to our
        global survival in that without the freedom to challenge the
        state (any state) and its dictates and demands we’re left bereft
        of the ability to speak the Truth. In this sense my struggle is
        every person’s struggle who desires to remain free and live in
        peace and harmony with their fellow human beings and all other
        life forms.<br>

        </b>Once head lice have attached themselves to hair follicles,

        Infestations of these bloodsucking parasites are commonly dealt

        Once head lice have attached themselves to hair follicles, they
        can deftly evade detection and are therefore hard to kill.
        Infestations of these bloodsucking parasites are commonly dealt
        with using chemicals and a specialized nit comb. Fraunhofer
        researchers are developing a technological comb that can
        reliably eliminate head lice using plasma with no biocide agents
        or chemicals. They will present a working prototype at the
        MEDICA exhibition in Düsseldorf.<br>
        <br>
        Anyone can get head lice, but the most common victims of such
        infestations are children between the ages of three and ten. The
        parasites feed themselves on blood and can crawl from one head
        to another quickly -- so they often spread in environments such
        as daycare centers or elementary schools, where the children's
        heads frequently touch. Head lice infestations not only result
        in terrible itching, they are also extremely hard to get rid of.
        A number of chemical treatments such as shampoos, lotions or
        gels are available. Typically, these products are massaged into
        the hair and scalp while still slightly damp after washing, and
        afterwards the hair is combed using a special nit comb. The
        problem is, this procedure kills the lice but not their eggs --
        known as nits -- so the treatment must be repeated a week later.
        For the children, the drawn-out procedure is unpleasant and
        painfull. Many parents are especially hesitant to use chemical
        products, as some of their active ingredients are harmful to
        children and infants. The lice and nits can also grow resistant
        to such chemicals.<br>
        <br>
        Researchers at the Application Center for Plasma and Photonics
        of the Fraunhofer Institute for Surface Engineering and Thin
        Films IST in Göttingen, Germany, are therefore developing an
        alternative treatment method that could eliminate the use of
        biocides and chemicals. For this goal, cold atmospheric pressure
        plasma is used: it reliably kills the parasites without causing
        harm or discomfort to the host. The researchers have developed a
        special plasma lice comb for this application. Funding for the
        project is provided by the Volkswagen Foundation.<b><br>
          <br>
          Electrical fields between electrodes convert air into plasma<br>
          <br>
        </b>The trick to this new technology lies in the high-voltage
        generator that sends pulses to the teeth of the comb, which
        serve here as electrodes. The air between two electrodes, or
        teeth, is ionized in the presence of the high-voltage pulses;
        thus, plasma is generated. "Plasma is an aggregate state that
        exists when energy is added to a gas or gas mixture," says Prof.
        Viöl, director of the Application Center for Plasma and
        Photonics.<br>
        <br>
        The high voltage is delivered only in very short bursts, using
        just enough energy to accelerate the tiny electrons without
        heating up the heavy gas particles pulses; thus, plasma is
        generated. In this manner, the temperature of the plasma can be
        set to room temperature. The cold plasmas kill both the lice and
        the nits without harming the hair or scalp. The process is
        completely harmless to humans. "After only one treatment, half
        of the wingless pests are already dead and the rest are gone
        within a day," says Viöl. The researcher and his team confirmed
        this through extensive efficacy and safety testing, which was
        conducted in cooperation with a research institute. "The plasma
        comb has already been introduced in regional pediatric offices
        and can be used just like a normal comb," Viöl explains.<br>
        <br>
        Patients with pre-existing ailments, such as asthma or
        allergies, can also benefit from treating head lice with plasma:
        there are no aggressive active ingredients to provoke
        symptomatic outbreaks. Also, the lack of chemical substances in
        this method makes it more environmentally compatible than
        traditional processes.<br>
        <br>
        The researchers have patented the technology and plan to
        initially bring it to market in small production batches as a
        cosmetic product. "The plasma comb can replace biocidal agents.
        By altering the shape of the comb and the distance between the
        teeth, it is also possible to use it for treating infestations
        on house pets," Viöl explains. Another conceivable option is to
        use the use the comb as health care device in developing
        countries, where head lice transmit dangerous bacteria such as
        typhoid or five-day fever pathogens.<b><br>

        <b><br>
        </b>Working with colleagues at the Harvard-MIT Center for
        Ultracold Atoms, a group led by Harvard Professor of Physics
        Mikhail Lukin and MIT Professor of Physics Vladan Vuletic have
        managed to coax photons into binding together to form molecules
        – a state of matter that, until recently, had been purely
        theoretical. The work is described in a September 25 paper in
        Nature.<br>
        <br>
        The discovery, Lukin said, runs contrary to decades of accepted
        wisdom about the nature of light. Photons have long been
        described as massless particles which don’t interact with each
        other – shine two laser beams at each other, he said, and they
        simply pass through one another.<br>
        <br>
        “Photonic molecules,” however, behave less like traditional
        lasers and more like something you might find in science fiction
        – the light saber.<br>
        <br>
        “Most of the properties of light we know about originate from
        the fact that photons are massless, and that they do not
        interact with each other,” Lukin said. “What we have done is
        create a special type of medium in which photons interact with
        each other so strongly that they begin to act as though they
        have mass, and they bind together to form molecules. This type
        of photonic bound state has been discussed theoretically for
        quite a while, but until now it hadn’t been observed.<br>
        <br>
        “It’s not an in-apt analogy to compare this to light sabers,”
        Lukin added. “When these photons interact with each other,
        they’re pushing against and deflect each other. The physics of
        what’s happening in these molecules is similar to what we see in
        the movies.”<br>
        <br>
        To get the normally-massless photons to bind to each other,
        Lukin and colleagues, including Harvard post-doctoral fellow
        Ofer Fisterberg, former Harvard doctoral student Alexey Gorshkov
        and MIT graduate students Thibault Peyronel and Qiu Liang
        couldn’t rely on something like the Force – they instead turned
        to a set of more extreme conditions.<br>
        <br>
        Researchers began by pumped rubidium atoms into a vacuum
        chamber, then used lasers to cool the cloud of atoms to just a
        few degrees above absolute zero. Using extremely weak laser
        pulses, they then fired single photons into the cloud of atoms.<br>
        <br>
        As the photons enter the cloud of cold atoms, Lukin said, its
        energy excites atoms along its path, causing the photon to slow
        dramatically. As the photon moves through the cloud, that energy
        is handed off from atom to atom, and eventually exits the cloud
        with the photon.<br>
        <br>
        “When the photon exits the medium, its identity is preserved,”
        Lukin said. “It’s the same effect we see with refraction of
        light in a water glass. The light enters the water, it hands off
        part of its energy to the medium, and inside it exists as light
        and matter coupled together, but when it exits, it’s still
        light. The process that takes place is the same it’s just a bit
        more extreme – the light is slowed considerably, and a lot more
        energy is given away than during refraction.”<br>
        <br>
        When Lukin and colleagues fired two photons into the cloud, they
        were surprised to see them exit together, as a single molecule.<br>
        <br>
        The reason they form the never-before-seen molecules?<br>
        <br>
        An effect called a Rydberg blockade, Lukin said, which states
        that when an atom is excited, nearby atoms cannot be excited to
        the same degree. In practice, the effect means that as two
        photons enter the atomic cloud, the first excites an atom, but
        must move forward before the second photon can excite nearby
        atoms.<br>
        <br>
        The result, he said, is that the two photons push and pull each
        other through the cloud as their energy is handed off from one
        atom to the next.<br>
        <br>
        “It’s a photonic interaction that’s mediated by the atomic
        interaction,” Lukin said. “That makes these two photons behave
        like a molecule, and when they exit the medium they’re much more
        likely to do so together than as single photons.”<br>
        <br>
        While the effect is unusual, it does have some practical
        applications as well.<br>
        <br>
        “We do this for fun, and because we’re pushing the frontiers of
        science,” Lukin said. “But it feeds into the bigger picture of
        what we’re doing because photons remain the best possible means
        to carry quantum information. The handicap, though, has been
        that photons don’t interact with each other.”<br>
        <br>
        To build a quantum computer, he explained, researchers need to
        build a system that can preserve quantum information, and
        process it using quantum logic operations. The challenge,
        however, is that quantum logic requires interactions between
        individual quanta so that quantum systems can be switched to
        perform information processing.<br>
        <br>
        “What we demonstrate with this process allows us to do that,”
        Lukin said. “Before we make a useful, practical quantum switch
        or photonic logic gate we have to improve the performance, so
        it’s still at the proof-of-concept level, but this is an
        important step. The physical principles we’ve established here
        are important.”<br>
        <br>
        The system could even be useful in classical computing, Lukin
        said, considering the power-dissipation challenges chip-makers
        now face. A number of companies – including IBM – have worked to
        develop systems that rely on optical routers that convert light
        signals into electrical signals, but those systems face their
        own hurdles.<br>
        <br>
        Lukin also suggested that the system might one day even be used
        to create complex three-dimensional structures – such as
        crystals – wholly out of light.<br>
        <br>
        “What it will be useful for we don’t know yet, but it’s a new
        state of matter, so we are hopeful that new applications may
        emerge as we continue to investigate these photonic molecules’
        properties,” he said.<b><br>

              Percent of Captured Light into Heat </b></big><br>
        </div>
        <b><br>
        </b>A multidisciplinary engineering team at the University of
        California, San Diego developed a new nanoparticle-based
        material for concentrating solar power plants designed to absorb
        and convert to heat more than 90 percent of the sunlight it
        captures.<br>
        <br>
        The new material can also withstand temperatures greater than
        700 degrees Celsius and survive many years outdoors in spite of
        exposure to air and humidity. Their work, funded by the U.S.
        Department of Energy’s SunShot program, was published recently
        in two separate articles in the journal Nano Energy.<br>
        <br>
        By contrast, current solar absorber material functions at lower
        temperatures and needs to be overhauled almost every year for
        high temperature operations.<br>
        <br>
        “We wanted to create a material that absorbs sunlight that
        doesn’t let any of it escape. We want the black hole of
        sunlight,” said Sungho Jin, a professor in the department of
        Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at UC San Diego Jacobs
        School of Engineering. Jin, along with professor Zhaowei Liu of
        the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and
        Mechanical Engineering professor Renkun Chen, developed the
        Silicon boride-coated nanoshell material. They are all experts
        in functional materials engineering.<b><br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Multi Scale Structures<br>
          <br>
        </b>The novel material features a “multiscale” surface created
        by using particles of many sizes ranging from 10 nanometers to
        10 micrometers. The multiscale structures can trap and absorb
        light which contributes to the material’s high efficiency when
        operated at higher temperatures.<br>
        <br>
        Concentrating solar power (CSP) is an emerging alternative clean
        energy market that produces approximately 3.5 gigawatts worth of
        power at power plants around the globe—enough to power more than
        2 million homes, with additional construction in progress to
        provide as much as 20 gigawatts of power in coming years. One of
        the technology’s attractions is that it can be used to retrofit
        existing power plants that use coal or fossil fuels because it
        uses the same process to generate electricity from steam.<br>
        <br>
        Traditional power plants burn coal or fossil fuels to create
        heat that evaporates water into steam. The steam turns a giant
        turbine that generates electricity from spinning magnets and
        conductor wire coils. CSP power plants create the steam needed
        to turn the turbine by using sunlight to heat molten salt. The
        molten salt can also be stored in thermal storage tanks
        overnight where it can continue to generate steam and
        electricity, 24 hours a day if desired, a significant advantage
        over photovoltaic systems that stop producing energy with the
        sunset.<br>
        <br>
        One of the most common types of CSP systems uses more than
        100,000 reflective mirrors to aim sunlight at a tower that has
        been spray painted with a light absorbing black paint material.
        The material is designed to maximize sun light absorption and
        minimize the loss of light that would naturally emit from the
        surface in the form of infrared radiation.<br>

        <br>
        The UC San Diego team’s combined expertise was used to develop,
        optimize and characterize a new material for this type of system
        over the past three years.&nbsp; Researchers included a group of
        UC San Diego graduate students in materials science and
        engineering, Justin Taekyoung Kim, Bryan VanSaders, and Jaeyun
        Moon, who recently joined the faculty of the University of
        Nevada, Las Vegas. The synthesized nanoshell material is
        spray-painted in Chen’s lab onto a metal substrate for thermal
        and mechanical testing. The material’s ability to absorb
        sunlight is measured in Liu’s optics laboratory using a unique
        set of instruments that takes spectral measurements from visible
        light to infrared.<br>
        <br>
        Current CSP plants are shut down about once a year to chip off
        the degraded sunlight absorbing material and reapply a new
        coating, which means no power generation while a replacement
        coating is applied and cured. That is why DOE’s SunShot program
        (DE-EE005802) challenged and supported UC San Diego research
        teams to come up with a material with a substantially longer
        life cycle, in addition to the higher operating temperature for
        enhanced energy conversion efficiency. The UC San Diego research
        team is aiming for many years of usage life, a feat they believe
        they are close to achieving.<b><br>

        </b>Modeled after President Kennedy’s moon landing program that
        inspired widespread interest in science and space exploration,
        then-Energy Secretary Steven P. Chu launched the Sunshot
        Initiative in 2010 with the goal of making solar power cost
        competitive with other means of producing electricity by 2020.<b><br>

        </b>Methods, systems, and devices are disclosed for fabricating
        and implementing optically absorbing coatings. In one aspect, an
        optically selective coating includes a substrate formed of a
        solar energy absorbing material, and a nanostructure material
        formed over the substrate as a coating capable of absorbing
        solar energy in a selected spectrum and reflecting the solar
        energy in another selected spectrum. A concentrating solar power
        (CSP) system includes heat transfer fluids (HTFs); thermal
        energy storage system (TES); and solar receivers in
        communication with HTFs and including a light absorbing coating
        layer based on cobalt oxide nanoparticles...<b><br>
          <br>
          BACKGROUND<br>
          <br>
        </b>[0004] Nanotechnology provides techniques or processes for
        fabricating structures, devices, and systems with features at a
        molecular or atomic scale, e.g., structures in a range of one to
        hundreds of nanometers in some applications. For example,
        nano-scale devices can be configured to sizes similar to some
        large molecules, e.g., biomolecules such as enzymes. Nano-sized
        materials used to create a nanostructure, nanodevice, or a
        nanosystem can exhibit various unique properties, e.g.,
        including optical properties, that are not present in the same
        materials at larger dimensions and such unique properties can be
        exploited for a wide range of applications.<b><br>
          <br>
          SUMMARY<br>
          <br>
          [</b>0005] Techniques, systems, devices and materials are
        disclosed for solar-absorbing coatings with ultra-high optical
        performance, including highly-scalable, low-cost fabrication
        processes to manufacture the solar energy-absorbing coatings of
        the disclosed technology. In some implementations, the coatings
        include nanoparticles (NPs) of black oxides deposited on
        high-temperature metal alloy surfaces, e.g., which can be in the
        form of standalone NPs or NPs embedded in a dielectric ceramic
        matrix.<br>
        <br>
        [0006] The systems, devices and techniques disclosed in this
        patent document provide for synthesized C03O4black oxide
        nanoparticles using a facile hydrothermal process and novel
        designs and fabrication processes of light-absorbing coating
        structure for high-temperature CSP systems. By introducing
        sacrificial polymer fillers into the nanopowder-based coating
        slurry, the surface texturing can be successfully obtained and
        the optical performance can be enhanced, as measured by a high
        figure of merit of 88.2%. For high temperature durability, a
        long-term aging test can be performed to show that the
        light-trapping structure remains intact after 750°C exposure in
        air for 1,000 hours. Consequently, the FOM shows negligible
        change after the 1,000-hour exposure. The textured C03O4coating
        is a promising candidate for solar absorbing in next-generation
        high-temperature CSP systems. The C03O4layer can easily be
        spray-coated in a manner suitable for large-scale CSP receiver
        applications...<b><br>

          THE MIAMI HERALD<br>
          <br>

        <div align="center"><big><b>Patent Filing Claims Solar Energy</b></big><br>
        </div>
        <b><br>
        </b>“WASHINGTON — In a U.S. patent application, a little-known
        Maryland inventor claims a stunning solar energy breakthrough
        that promises to end the planet’s reliance on fossil fuels at a
        fraction of the current cost – a transformation that also could
        blunt global warming.”<br>
        <br>
        Inventor Ronald Ace said that his flat-panel “Solar Traps,”
        which can be mounted on rooftops or used in electric power
        plants, will shatter decades-old scientific and technological
        barriers that have stymied efforts to make solar energy a cheap,
        clean and reliable alternative.<br>
        <br>
        “This is a fundamental scientific and environmental discovery,”
        Ace said. “This invention can meet about 92 percent of the
        world’s energy needs.”<br>
        <br>
        His claimed discoveries, which exist only on paper so far, would
        represent such a leap forward that they are sure to draw deep
        skepticism from solar energy experts. But a recently retired
        congressional energy adviser, who has reviewed the invention’s
        still-secret design, said it’s “a no brainer” that the device
        would vastly outperform all other known solar technology.<br>
        <br>
        Ace said he is arranging for a national energy laboratory to
        review his calculations and that his own crude prototypes
        already have demonstrated that the basic physics for the
        invention work.<br>
        <br>
        If the trap even comes close to meeting his futuristic vision,
        its impact could be breathtaking: It could reorder the world’s
        energy landscape, end the global economic drag of soaring energy
        costs, and eventually curb greenhouse gas emissions that are
        blamed for climate change.<br>
        <br>
        That all might sound rather rosy, since the previously
        undisclosed invention has yet to be constructed and fully
        tested. But John Darnell, a scientist and the former
        congressional aide who has monitored Ace’s dogged research for
        more than three years and has reviewed his complex calculations,
        has no doubts.<br>
        <br>
        “Anybody who is skilled in the art and understands what he’s
        proposing is going to have this dumbfounding reaction: ‘Oh, well
        it’s obvious it’ll work,’” said Darnell, a biochemist with an
        extensive background in thermodynamics.<br>
        <br>
        “Ron has turned conventional wisdom about solar on its head,” he
        said. “He thinks outside the box.”<br>
        <br>
        An independent inventor working from his home outside the
        nation’s capital, Ace said that his filing culminated years of
        research into ways to efficiently capture and store solar
        energy.<br>
        <br>
        In recent interviews and redacted excerpts from his patent
        application, he said that his invention can be used to retrofit
        conventional nuclear- or fossil fuel-fired power plants to
        produce electricity at about 2 cents per kilowatt-hour. That
        alone would be a staggering advance, slashing the average
        wholesale cost of power by two-thirds and the cost of solar
        energy by up to ninefold – estimates that Ace called
        conservative.<br>
        <br>
        But that’s just the beginning.<br>
        <br>
        A separate rooftop version, which Ace believes ultimately will
        power most homes and businesses, would initially provide cheap
        heating and hot water. Soon, he said, equipment for those traps
        will be able to convert solar energy to electricity, air
        conditioning and, if enough panels are installed, to produce
        excess energy to sell to utility companies. Consumers will be
        able to reap enough savings on their utility bills to recover
        their costs within two to four years, a performance that far
        surpasses photovoltaic solar panels that are gaining a market
        toehold worldwide, Ace said.<br>
        <br>
        His traps also could for the first time provide a viable way to
        operate power plants by collecting energy above 1,400 degrees
        Fahrenheit – the heat needed to drive the turbines that generate
        electricity. Such high-temperature plants would significantly
        top the efficiency of conventional nuclear-, coal- and
        gas-powered plants, further reducing costs, he said.<br>
        <br>
        Higher-temperature collection in all of these uses, he said,
        would overcome one of the tallest barriers to a solar age: the
        inability to develop cheap, long-term storage of thermal energy
        from the sun. Ace said that his invention would allow weeks of
        high-temperature storage at one-tenth to one-hundredth of the
        current cost, meaning that solar power systems could generate
        electricity uninterrupted during lengthy stints of cloudy
        weather.<br>
        <br>
        His traps will be so efficient that they can be used even in
        less sunny regions, he said.<br>
        <br>
        Until Ace shares his secrets, produces a working prototype,
        licenses a major project or wins the blessing of a peer review
        panel, he may get little credence.<br>
        <br>
        “There are few cases in history where people come up with
        something which is totally unexpected,” said Ramamoorthy Ramesh,
        a former head of the U.S. Energy Department’s Sunshot solar
        program, tasked to spur solar energy innovation. “Who knows? It
        may actually be correct. But I’m an experimentalist. And until
        it’s proven, I don’t believe it.”<br>
        <br>
        If Ace is making history, his invention may stand alongside the
        introduction of the steam engine 300 years ago that set the
        stage for the Industrial Revolution.<br>
        <br>
        Ace said that confidentiality agreements are being signed so
        that solar experts at the Sandia National Laboratories in
        Albuquerque, N.M., can review his invention. He already has
        confided details to former President Jimmy Carter, who created
        the Energy Department in 1977 with a mission of sponsoring
        “transformative science and technology solutions.” Former U.S.
        Rep. Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland, who was Darnell’s boss and has
        championed Ace’s search for investors, has called the inventor
        “a genius.”<br>
        <br>
        A major stumbling block for solar thermal energy devices
        invented to date has been that, as temperatures rise, increasing
        amounts of energy escapes, or radiates away, from their
        receivers. At 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit, currently designed
        receivers would radiate as much energy as they collect, sinking
        their efficiency to zero, solar experts say.<br>
        <br>
        In his patent application, Ace wrote that his invention amounts
        to “a high-temperature blackbody absorber” that is “similar in
        some ways to an astronomical black hole.”<br>
        <br>
        The key, he said, is his trap’s ability to absorb nearly 100
        percent of the sunshine that hits it, while allowing only a tiny
        percentage of energy to escape, even at ultra-high temperatures.<br>
        <br>
        Such a feat would astound many solar experts, who have had
        little success combating radiation losses in pilot solar plants,
        which use fields of mirrors to redirect and concentrate sunlight
        on common receivers.<br>
        <br>
        Ace said that he contacted five national laboratories during his
        research, floating his interpretations of physics laws or
        double-checking his methodology on complex math equations
        without divulging his invention.<br>
        <br>
        Darnell, who is barred by a confidentiality agreement from
        revealing its details, said that even if the solar trap “comes
        up way short, it’s going to be way ahead of the competition.”<br>
        <br>
        Ace is putting his reputation on the line in touting multiple
        scientific breakthroughs that he says can harness the sun’s
        diffuse rays into energy that is cheap and reliable enough to
        compete with other fuel sources. If so, he has conquered a
        challenge whose answers have eluded scientists and engineers
        around the world.<br>
        <br>
        There are obstacles everywhere, enough so that a senior Energy
        Department official told McClatchy last year that the agency’s
        solar program is still in its infancy despite billions of
        dollars in expenditures over more than 35 years.<br>
        <br>
        For starters, the energy in sunshine is dilute, unlike the
        highly concentrated energy in oil or coal, and so it takes a lot
        of area to absorb solar energy.<br>
        <br>
        Collecting those rays is tricky, because the Earth’s rotation
        makes it difficult to design mirrors or receivers that can track
        sunlight for more than a few hours per day.<br>
        <br>
        Even rotating mirrors, called heliostats, can’t collect solar
        energy on cloudy days.<br>
        <br>
        There are also the radiation losses from a hot receiver, the
        geographically variable weather that leaves some regions with
        less sunshine and the critical need for massive storage.<br>
        <br>
        The currently preferred storage method is to transfer solar
        energy to tanks of molten salt. So far, that’s proved too
        expensive, accounting for 25 percent of a power plant’s cost
        just to store eight to 12 hours of energy, only a few hours for
        higher-temperature plants. As a result, pilot plants built in
        the sunny Southwest under Sandia’s auspices require backup from
        conventional fuels and wouldn’t be viable without federal
        subsidies. To make matters worse, fierce competition from plants
        powered by cheap, Chinese-made photovoltaic panels have undercut
        the financial models behind solar thermal plants, leading to
        bankruptcies and canceled plans.<br>
        <br>
        Ace said that, because his solar traps can collect energy at
        ultra-high temperatures, the storage issue all but disappears.
        The energy can be stored for weeks in silicon dioxide (pure
        sand) or other cheap materials and extracted via heat exchangers
        as needed, he said, meaning that reliable solar power plants
        could be built almost anywhere, though it would be more
        expensive in cloudy regions.<br>
        <br>
        As for finding the space to mount enough solar traps atop homes
        and businesses, Ace estimates that there are well over 7,000
        square miles of residential and commercial rooftops in the
        United States.<br>
        <br>
        A solar energy breakthrough of the magnitude that Ace describes
        not only would be momentous for its scientific merit, but also
        for its timing, amid global warming concerns and projections of
        a looming worldwide energy crisis, despite the U.S. oil and gas
        revival. The world population is projected to surge past 8.5
        billion people in the next 20 years, even as energy companies
        are drilling for oil in increasingly harsh conditions.<br>
        <br>
        An all-out shift to solar energy, a process that would take
        decades even on a fast track, could avert economic tumult and
        potential military conflict if affordable fossil fuels became
        scarcer.<br>
        <br>
        While solar power wouldn’t on its face address the long-term
        need for liquid fuels to replace oil, Ace said that once a
        region amassed huge stores of thermal energy, it could be used
        to create other forms of energy, including liquid fuels. For
        example, Sandia researchers developed a way to use
        high-temperature solar energy to break down carbon dioxide from
        the air into carbon monoxide, a key building block in making
        synthetic hydrocarbons whose greenhouse gas emissions would be
        carbon neutral.<br>
        <br>
        Ramesh, the former Energy Department Sunshot chief, met with Ace
        in May 2012, weeks before leaving his post to return to a
        faculty job at the University of California, Berkeley.<br>
        <br>
        In a phone interview, Ramesh called the inventor “a very smart
        guy” who appears to have a solid knowledge of physics, thermal
        energy and optics. He said that Ace touted his solar trap and
        described what would be “a fundamental discovery,” but he did
        not confide details.<br>
        <br>
        “I need to see data, and he needs money to show the data,”
        Ramesh said, describing the chicken-and-egg dilemmas that often
        confront inventors. “You have to prove out everything before
        somebody puts in money.”<br>
        <br>
        Since 2010, the Energy Department has approved nearly $13
        billion in grants and loans for cutting-edge research on solar
        power. But Ace and his company, Pinnacle Products LLC, have yet
        to apply for or receive a nickel of it. For one reason, he said,
        he didn’t feel comfortable revealing his technology in a grant
        application before he obtained protection by applying for a
        patent.<br>
        <br>
        Ace also said that an Energy Department grant wouldn’t help
        bankroll his first priority, which is to raise $1.8 million to
        seek and maintain patents in 60 countries to protect U.S.
        economic interests in his technology. Federal rules bar using
        grant money to pay for foreign patent applications.<br>
        <br>
        Searching for investors who have “passion, pesos and
        patriotism,” Ace has recently picked up modest new investments
        from several engineers and scientists, he said.<br>
        <br>
        For Ace, a tenacious man who has worked marathon hours, it’s
        often been a lonely quest.<br>
        <br>
        He said that he has been motivated by a desire to avoid an
        energy disaster and to help reduce the national debt. He
        envisions licensing his technology to the Defense Department so
        that military bases could use the traps to generate cheap power
        and even profit by selling low-cost excess energy to neighboring
        communities or host countries.<br>
        <br>
        Darnell, for one, gushes with pride to have been able to act as
        a sounding board.<br>
        <br>
        He said that Ace “has laid out a roadmap for how the world
        could, in fact, over a period of time, convert to a truly
        sustainable, truly clean, truly benign technology that
        essentially could bring prosperity everywhere in the world the
        sun shines.”<b><br>

          Abstract -- </b>The present invention proposes a permanent
        and prosperous solution to both human global warming
        (.about.0.26 to 0.74.degree. F.) as well as natural global
        warming (.about.7 to 9.degree. F.). It simultaneously employs
        all three of the physical laws to thermostatically regulate
        Earth: Macro solar energy reflection; sequestration of absorbed
        solar energy; and, enhanced infrared radiation from Earth.
        Temporal and spatial macro aerosol water evaporation is employed
        to triple-cool Earth’s surface, by way of: 1. Low-altitude
        atmospheric and oceanic vapor-cooling and/or macro storage of
        artificial snow; 2. Automatic ascension of lightweight water
        vapors to high-altitudes for enhanced water-phase-change
        infrared radiation from Earth, and; 3. Increased cloud coverage
        to reflect more incoming solar energy. Deep subterranean, high
        temperature, high pressure, permanent sequestration of macro
        quantities of absorbed solar energy assists terrestrial
        surface-cooling, but also duals as retrievable long term
        solar-energy-storage to power macro evaporators–without
        requiring conventional fossil or nuclear sources. The present
        invention has other applications such as: 1. dramatically
        enhanced space-conditioning efficiency if combined with
        potable-water-patent U.S. Pat. No. 6,688,129.sup.1, and; 2.
        long-term macro solar energy storage for totally reliable,
        boundless solar-electric power. However, the principal
        objective, by far, is the stabilization of glacial-melting and
        glacial-growth, in order to permanently stabilize the oceans at
        their present levels to preserve our vital global seaports. This
        document endorses both human (AGW or, anthropogenic global
        warming) and ancient natural global warming processes...<b><br>

          <i>Astrophysicists find Jupiter likely bumped giant planet
            from solar system</i><br>
        </div>
        <b><br>
        </b>It's like something out of an interplanetary chess game.
        Astrophysicists at the University of Toronto have found that a
        close encounter with Jupiter about four billion years ago may
        have resulted in another planet's ejection from the Solar System
        altogether.<br>
        <br>
        The existence of a fifth giant gas planet at the time of the
        Solar System's formation -- in addition to Jupiter, Saturn,
        Uranus and Neptune that we know of today -- was first proposed
        in 2011. But if it did exist, how did it get pushed out?<br>
        <br>
        For years, scientists have suspected the ouster was either
        Saturn or Jupiter.<br>
        <br>
        "Our evidence points to Jupiter," said Ryan Cloutier, a PhD
        candidate in U of T's Department of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics
        and lead author of a new study published in The Astrophysical
        Journal.<br>
        <br>
        Planet ejections occur as a result of a close planetary
        encounter in which one of the objects accelerates so much that
        it breaks free from the massive gravitational pull of the Sun.
        However, earlier studies which proposed that giant planets could
        possibly eject one another did not consider the effect such
        violent encounters would have on minor bodies, such as the known
        moons of the giant planets, and their orbits.<br>
        <br>
        So Cloutier and his colleagues turned their attention to moons
        and orbits, developing computer simulations based on the
        modern-day trajectories of Callisto and lapetus, the regular
        moons orbiting around Jupiter and Saturn respectively. They then
        measured the likelihood of each one producing its current orbit
        in the event that its host planet was responsible for ejecting
        the hypothetical planet, an incident which would have caused
        significant disturbance to each moon's original orbit.<br>
        <br>
        "Ultimately, we found that Jupiter is capable of ejecting the
        fifth giant planet while retaining a moon with the orbit of
        Callisto," said Cloutier, who is also a graduate fellow at the
        Centre for Planetary Sciences at the University of Toronto at
        Scarborough. "On the other hand, it would have been very
        difficult for Saturn to do so because Iapetus would have been
        excessively unsettled, resulting in an orbit that is difficult
        to reconcile with its current trajectory."<b><br>

        </b>The world desperately needs a new inexpensive reliable safe
        energy source-an energy source that can eliminate our dependence
        on foreign oil. The energy source described in this little book
        is just such a new energy source. The author has found the
        secrets of unlocking the E = mc2 energy in any matter. Reactor
        fuel need not be Uranium, Plutonium, or Hydrogen. It could be
        sand, water, air, garbage, toxic chemicals, or high level
        radioactive wastes-just to get rid of them. A little bit of fuel
        goes an extremely long way. The type of reactor that can do all
        these things is the Electrino Fusion Power Reactor. Electrinos
        are a better fit in particle physics than quarks, and more
        symmetric. Electrinos have the interesting property that they
        can fuse to become new particles-but each time they do so, they
        switch from matter to antimatter, or vice versa. We take
        advantage of this phenomenon to annihilate any matter to obtain
        energy for electricity generation. Some of the discoveries in
        this book are as old as 1983. Some came in 1995. Others came in
        2004. The discovery, however, that made the EFP Reactor
        efficient enough to be self-sustaining and viable did not come
        until October 2007. The principle reactions, however, were not
        understood until July, 2008. Thus the EFP Reactor is a new
        discovery. The EFP Reactor, however, is not a single source of
        energy. Two kinds of energy sources are required in EFP
        Reactors. One type of energy produced is entropy energy for
        electricity production. The other type of energy produced with
        the reactor is positive order energy. This type of energy is
        necessary to make the accelerators 100% efficient and keep the
        irradiated electric panels from degrading with the strong
        radiation.<br>

        </b>…In a recent study published in Science, a team of
        researchers from Weill Cornell Medicine, Cold Spring Harbor
        Laboratory, Tufts Medical Center, Harvard Medical School and The
        Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center found that high doses of
        vitamin C -- roughly equivalent to the levels found in 300
        oranges -- impaired the growth of mutant colorectal tumors in
        cultured cells and mice. The findings could lead to the
        development of new natural treatments and provide critical
        insights into who would most benefit from them…<br>
        <br>
        In an oxygen-rich environment such as human arteries, a fraction
        of vitamin C, also called ascorbic acid, becomes oxidized and is
        transformed into a new compound called dehydroascorbic acid
        (DHA). Scientists have known for some time that a specific
        membrane protein, known as glucose transporter GLUT1, enables
        both glucose and DHA to enter cells -- an activity not afforded
        to ascorbic acid. But it was less clear what DHA does once
        inside the cells.<br>
        <br>
        In the study, investigators show that DHA acts like a Trojan
        horse. Once inside, natural antioxidants inside the cancer cell
        attempt to convert the DHA back to ascorbic acid; in the
        process, these antioxidants are depleted and the cell dies from
        oxidative stress.<br>
        <br>
        "While many normal cells also express GLUT1, KRAS-mutant and
        BRAF-mutant cancer cells typically have much higher levels since
        they require a high rate of glucose uptake in order to survive
        and grow," Dr. Cantley said. "Also, KRAS and BRAF mutant cells
        produce more reactive oxygen species than normal cells and
        therefore need more antioxidants in order to survive. This
        combination of characteristics makes these cancer cells far more
        vulnerable to DHA than normal cells or other types of cancer
        cells."...<b><br>

        <b>Abstract</b> -- More than half of human colorectal cancers
        (CRCs) carry either KRAS or BRAF mutations, and are often
        refractory to approved targeted therapies. We report that
        cultured CRC cells harboring KRAS or BRAF mutations are
        selectively killed when exposed to high levels of vitamin C.
        This effect is due to increased uptake of the oxidized form of
        vitamin C, dehydroascorbate (DHA), via the GLUT1 glucose
        transporter. Increased DHA uptake causes oxidative stress as
        intracellular DHA is reduced to vitamin C, depleting
        glutathione. Thus, ROS accumulates and inactivates
        glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Inhibiting
        GAPDH in highly glycolytic KRAS or BRAF mutant cells leads to an
        energetic crisis and cell death not seen in KRAS and BRAF
        wild-type cells. High-dose vitamin C impaired tumor growth in
        Apc/KrasG12D mutant mice. These results provide a mechanistic
        rationale for exploring the therapeutic use of vitamin C for
        CRCs with KRAS or BRAF mutations.<br>

          Abstract -</b>- Physiological effects have been observed in a
        human subject in response to stimulation of the skin with weak
        electromagnetic fields that are pulsed with certain frequencies
        near ½ Hz or 2.4 Hz, such as to excite a sensory resonance. Many
        computer monitors and TV tubes, when displaying pulsed images,
        emit pulsed electromagnetic fields of sufficient amplitudes to
        cause such excitation. It is therefore possible to manipulate
        the nervous system of a subject by pulsing images displayed on a
        nearby computer monitor or TV set. For the latter, the image
        pulsing may be embedded in the program material, or it may be
        overlaid by modulating a video stream, either as an RF signal or
        as a video signal. The image displayed on a computer monitor may
        be pulsed effectively by a simple computer program. For certain
        monitors, pulsed electromagnetic fields capable of exciting
        sensory resonances in nearby subjects may be generated even as
        the displayed images are pulsed with subliminal intensity.<b><br>

        longer. “This is an area that traditionally has had no
        seismicity until very recently,” says Matt Skinner with the
        Corporation Commission. It’s shown just in the last few days.
        The Oklahoma Corporation Commission believes the reason for the
        earthquakes, is disposal well injecting into the Arbuckle
        formation. “We’ve had somewhere in the area of 20 earthquakes
        since Saturday morning there maybe even a little bit more as I
        speak,” he says.<br>
        <br>
        Barbara Bush of Medford knows all too well, she tells us the
        quakes are getting more and more frightening. “We’ve been
        concerned and we’ve become complacent almost my kids were here
        from Dallas my son and his wife they were scared to death they
        were ready to leave the house,” she tells us. She says she does
        not know what it will really cost her, and her property. “How
        are we going to know that until down the road? I mean we have
        constant shaking.”<br>
        <br>
        So, new measures to cut back on the quakes will be phased in.
        The Corporation Commission says the first step is volume cutback
        on injection wells. All wells within 0-3 miles of the epicenter
        of the cluster of earthquakes will be cut back by 50% of the
        average volume. Then, wells 3-6 miles will be cut back by 25%.
        Skinner warns, it must be done in two phases. “There is a
        theoretical risk that the change in pressure can actually cause
        more earthquake activity,” he says. There have been similar
        volume cut back in other parts of the state to help put a stop
        to these earthquakes, including Cushing. <br>

        </b>Germany. Chaos Descends.<br>
        <br>
        Dear Friends,<b><br>
          <br>
        </b>Europe is now in total chaos and I think that you should
        know about it.<br>
        <br>
        I have waited a week or so to see how things will develop and to
        glean more information before presenting the facts. As you may
        know from the media, the flood of refugees cum economic
        immigrants into Europe has reached ridiculous proportions and to
        the extent that Hungary and other Balkan states have closed
        their borders and Turkey is considering doing the same. Angela
        Merkel in an ill advised speech to the Bundestag, welcomed all
        refugees to Germany and the floodgates opened and, in my view,
        this was all pre-planned beginning with the Pope’s appeal last
        year for Islam to move closer to Christianity. This was then
        followed up via the Italian Government instructing the Italian
        Navy to rescue all boat refugees and bring them to Italy.<br>
        <br>
        As a result, it seems that some 8,000 people per day are now
        entering Europe via various routes. Most of these are young
        males between 17 and 25. The result is chaos as you can imagine.
        Here in Saarland we have been overwhelmed with refugees mainly
        young males but some families. In Lebach, some 10 kilometers
        from here, a camp for 200 was set up and a further 100 added
        this last week. The politicians, local government and religious
        leaders have fallen over themselves to bring them in and cater
        for them.<br>
        <br>
        And so what is the result? In Ventimiglia near Monte Carlo, the
        refugees banded together (organized by smart phone) and over ran
        the market and stole or destroyed everything and ransacked the
        town. Here in Lebach, a group entered a supermarket and took
        what they wanted and destroyed the rest. When the Manageress
        confronted them, they called up their friends and smashed the
        place to bits. The police arrived but were overwhelmed. The
        supermarket is now closed.<br>
        <br>
        Yesterday, my friends rang from Weissenfels near Leipzig since
        two supermarkets and a Kaufland store in Halle suffered the same
        way. More news is coming in from all over Germany of the same
        situations.<br>
        <br>
        The media reports none of this. Many people have demonstrated
        against being over run by immigrants. In Weissenfels, families
        were thrown out of an eight flat apartment block and 70 refugees
        moved in. Small towns of some 2,000 to 3,000 people are over run
        by some 5,000 to 6,000 refugees. Much civil unrest is apparent
        and is just boiling under the surface. Europe is in chaos and
        the do-gooders have totally lost control of the situation. Islam
        has overwhelmed us. For the Syrian and Afghan refugees, I have
        every sympathy. They need help and should get it, but for the
        rest, in my view, the state authorities must be firm and send
        them back. Perhaps it is too late. Anyway, I thought that you
        should know that the situation here is pretty grim and I fail to
        see how it can be resolved. I can only foresee a police state.<b><br>

          <b>8/01/91</b><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        In the winter of 1983, archival research expert David Dodge, and
        former Baltimore police investigator Tom Dunn, were searching
        for evidence of government corruption in public records stored
        in the Belfast Library on the coast of Maine.<br>
        <br>
        By chance, they discovered the library’s oldest authentic copy
        of the Constitution of the United States (printed in 1825). Both
        men were stunned to see this document included a 13th Amendment
        that no longer appears on current copies of the Constitution.
        Moreover, after studying the Amendment’s language and historical
        context, they realized the principle intent of this “missing”
        13th Amendment was to prohibit lawyers from serving in
        government. So began a seven year, nationwide search for the
        truth surrounding the most bizarre Constitutional puzzle in
        American history — the unlawful removal of a ratified Amendment
        from the Constitution of the United States.<br>
        <br>
        Since 1983, Dodge and Dunn have uncovered additional copies of
        the Constitution with the “missing” 13th Amendment printed in at
        least eighteen separate publications by ten different states and
        territories over four decades from 1822 to 1860. In June of this
        year (1991), Dodge uncovered the evidence that this missing 13th
        Amendment had indeed been lawfully ratified by the state of
        Virginia and was therefore an authentic Amendment to the
        American Constitution. If the evidence is correct and no logical
        errors have been made, a 13th Amendment restricting lawyers from
        serving in government was ratified in 1819 and removed from the
        U.S. Constitution during the tumult of the Civil War. Since the
        Amendment was never lawfully repealed, it is still the Law
        today. The implications are enormous.<br>
        <br>
        The story of this “missing” Amendment is complex and at times
        confusing because the political issues and vocabulary of the
        American Revolution were different from our own. However, there
        are essentially two issues: What does the Amendment mean? and,
        Was the Amendment ratified? Before we consider the issue of
        ratification, we should first understand the Amendment’s meaning
        and consequent current relevance.<b><br>
          <br>
          MEANING of the 13th Amendment<br>
          <br>
        </b>The “missing” 13th Amendment to the Constitution of the
        United States reads as follows:<br>
        <br>
        “If any citizen of the United States shall accept, claim,
        receive, or retain any title of nobility or honour, or shall
        without the consent of Congress, accept and retain any present,
        pension, office, or emolument of any kind whatever, from any
        emperor, king, prince, or foreign power, such person shall cease
        to be a citizen of the United States, and shall be incapable of
        holding any office of trust or profit under them, or either of
        them.”<br>
        <br>
        At the first reading, the meaning of this 13th Amendment (also
        called the “title of nobility” Amendment) seems obscure;
        unimportant. The references to “nobility,” “honour,” “emperor,”
        “king,” and “prince,” lead us to dismiss this Amendment as a
        petty post-revolution act of spite directed against the British
        monarchy. The U.S. modern world of Lady Di and Prince Charles,
        make anti-royalist sentiments seem so archaic and quaint, that
        the Amendment can be ignored.<br>
        <br>
        Not so. Consider some evidence of its historical significance:
        First, “titles of nobility” were prohibited in both Article VI
        of the Articles of Confederation (1777) and in Article I,
        Sections 9 and 10 of the Constitution of the United States
        (1787);<br>
        <br>
        Second, although already prohibited by the Constitution, an
        additional “title of nobility” amendment was proposed in 1789,
        again in 1810, and according to Dodge, finally ratified in 1819.
        Clearly, the founding fathers saw such a serious threat in
        “titles of nobility” and “honors” that anyone receiving them
        would forfeit their citizenship. Since the government prohibited
        “titles of nobility” several times over four decades, and went
        through the amending process (even though “titles of nobility”
        were already prohibited by the Constitution), it’s obvious that
        the Amendment carried much more significance for our founding
        fathers than is readily apparent today.<b><br>
          <br>
          HISTORICAL CONTEXT<br>
          <br>
        </b>To understand the meaning of this “missing” 13th Amendment,
        we must understand its historical context — the era surrounding
        the American Revolution. We tend to regard the notion of
        “Democracy” as benign, harmless, and politically unremarkable.
        But at the time of the American Revolution, King George III and
        the other monarchies of Europe saw Democracy as an unnatural,
        ungodly ideological threat, every bit as dangerously radical as
        Communism was once regarded by modern Western nations. Just as
        the 1917 Communist Revolution in Russia spawned other
        revolutions around the world, the American Revolution provided
        an example and incentive for people all over the world to
        overthrow their European monarchies.<br>
        <br>
        Even though the Treaty of Paris ended the Revolutionary War in
        1783, the simple fact of our existence threatened the
        monarchies. The United States stood as a heroic role model for
        other nations, that inspired them to also struggle against
        oppressive monarchies. The French Revolution (1789-1799) and the
        Polish national uprising (1794) were in part encouraged by the
        American Revolution. Though we stood like a beacon of hope for
        most of the world, the monarchies regarded the United States as
        a political typhoid Mary, the principle source of radical
        democracy that was destroying monarchies around the world. The
        monarchies must have realized that if the principle source of
        that infection could be destroyed, the rest of the world might
        avoid the contagion and the monarchies would be saved. Their
        survival at stake, the monarchies sought to destroy or subvert
        the American system of government. Knowing they couldn’t destroy
        us militarily, they resorted to more covert methods of political
        subversion, employing spies and secret agents skilled in bribery
        and legal deception — it was, perhaps, the first “cold war”.
        Since governments run on money, politicians run for money, and
        money is the usual enticement to commit treason, much of the
        monarchy’s counter- revolutionary efforts emanated from English
        banks.<b><br>
          <br>
          DON’T BANK ON IT (Modern Banking System)<br>
        </b><br>
        The essence of banking was once explained by Sir Josiah Stamp, a
        former president of the Bank of England:”The modern banking
        system manufactures money out of nothing. The process is perhaps
        the most astounding piece of sleight of hand that was ever
        invented. Banking was conceived in inequity and born in sin…
        Bankers own the earth. Take it away from them but leave them the
        power to create money, and, with a flick of a pen, they will
        create enough money to buy it back again… Take this great power
        away from them, or if you want to continue to be the slaves of
        bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery, then let bankers
        continue to create money and control credit.”<br>
        <br>
        The last great abuse of the U.S. banking system caused the
        depression of the 1930’s. Today’s abuses may cause another.
        Current S&amp;L and bank scandals illustrate the on-going
        relationships between banks, lawyers, politicians, and
        government agencies (look at the current BCCI bank scandal,
        involving lawyer Clark Clifford, politician Jimmy Carter, the
        Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and even the CIA). These scandals are
        the direct result of years of law-breaking by an alliance of
        bankers and lawyers using their influence and money to corrupt
        the political process and rob the public. (Think you’re not
        being robbed? Guess who’s going to pay the bill for the excesses
        of the S&amp;L’s, U.S.-taxpayer? You are.) The systematic
        robbery of productive individuals by parasitic bankers and
        lawyers is not a recent phenomenon. This abuse is a human
        tradition that predates the Bible and spread from Europe to
        America despite early colonial prohibitions.<br>
        <br>
        When the first United States Bank was chartered by Congress in
        1790, there were only three state banks in existence. At one
        time, banks were prohibited by law in most states because many
        of the early settlers were all too familiar with the practices
        of the European goldsmith banks. Goldsmith banks were
        safe-houses used to store client’s gold. In exchange for the
        deposited gold, customers were issued notes (paper money) which
        were redeemable in gold. The goldsmith bankers quickly succumbed
        to the temptation to issue “extra” notes, (unbacked by gold).
        Why? Because the “extra” notes enriched the bankers by allowing
        them to buy property with notes for gold that they did not own,
        gold that did not even exist. Colonists knew that bankers
        occasionally printed too much paper money, found themselves
        over-leveraged, and caused a “run on the bank”. If the bankers
        lacked sufficient gold to meet the demand, the paper money
        became worthless and common citizens left holding the paper were
        ruined. Although over-leveraged bankers were sometime hung, the
        bankers continued printing extra money to increase their
        fortunes at the expense of the productive members of society.
        (The practice continues to this day, and offers “sweetheart”
        loans to bank insiders, and even provides the foundation for
        deficit spending and the U.S. Federal government’s unbridled
        growth.)<b><br>
          <br>
          PAPER MONEY<br>
          <br>
        </b>If the colonists forgot the lessons of goldsmith bankers,
        the American Revolution refreshed their memories. To finance the
        war, Congress authorized the printing of continental bills of
        credit in an amount not to exceed $200,000,000. The States
        issued another $200,000,000 in paper notes. Ultimately, the
        value of the paper money fell so low that they were soon traded
        on speculation from 5000 to 1000 paper bills for one coin. It’s
        often suggested that the U.S. Constitution’s prohibition against
        a paper economy — “No State shall… make any Thing but gold and
        silver Coin a tender in Payment of Debts” — was a tool of the
        wealthy to be worked to the disadvantage of all others. But only
        in a “paper” economy can money reproduce itself and increase the
        claims of the wealthy at the expense of the productive.<br>
        <br>
        “Paper money,” said Pelatiah Webster, “polluted the equity of
        our laws, turned them into engines of oppression, corrupted the
        justice of our public administration, destroyed the fortunes of
        thousands who had confidence in it, enervated the trade,
        husbandry, and manufactures of U.S. country, and went far to
        destroy the morality of U.S. people.”<b><br>
          <br>
          CONSPIRACIES<br>
          <br>
        </b>A few examples of the attempts by the monarchies and banks
        that almost succeeded in destroying the United States:<br>
        <br>
        According to the Tennessee Laws (1715-1820, vol. II, p. 774), in
        the 1794 Jay Treaty, the United States agreed to pay 600,000
        pounds sterling to King George III, as reparations for the
        American revolution. The Senate ratified the treaty in secret
        session and ordered that it not be published. When Benjamin
        Franklin’s grandson published it anyway, the exposure and
        resulting public uproar so angered the Congress that it passed
        the Alien and Sedition Acts (1798) so federal judges could
        prosecute editors and publishers for reporting the truth about
        the government. Since we had won the Revolutionary War, why
        would U.S. Senators agree to pay reparations to the loser? And
        why would they agree to pay 600,000 pounds sterling, eleven
        years after the war ended? It doesn’t make sense, especially in
        light of Senate’s secrecy and later fury over being exposed,
        unless we assume U.S. Senators had been bribed to serve the
        British monarchy and betray the American people. That’s
        subversion.<br>
        <br>
        The United States Bank had been opposed by the Jeffersonians
        from the beginning, but the Federalists (the pro-monarchy party)
        won out in its establishment. The initial capitalization was
        $10,000,000 — 80% of which would be owned by foreign bankers.
        Since the bank was authorized to lend up to $20,000,000 (double
        its paid in capital), it was a profitable deal for both the
        government and the bankers since they could lend, and collect
        interest on, $10,000,000 that didn’t exist.<br>
        <br>
        However, the European bankers outfoxed the government and by
        1796, the government owed the bank $6,200,000 and was forced to
        sell its shares. (By 1802, the U.S. government owned no stock in
        the United States Bank.) The sheer power of the banks and their
        ability to influence representative government by economic
        manipulation and outright bribery was exposed in 1811, when the
        people discovered that European banking interests owned 80% of
        the bank. Congress therefore refused to renew the bank’s
        charter. This led to the withdrawal of $7,000,000 in specie by
        European investors, which in turn, precipitated an economic
        recession, and the War of 1812. That’s destruction.<br>
        <br>
        There are undoubtedly other examples of the monarchy’s efforts
        to subvert or destroy the United States; some are common
        knowledge, others remain to be disclosed to the public. For
        example, David Dodge discovered a book called “2 VA LAW” in the
        Library of Congress Law Library. According to Dodge, “This is an
        un-catalogued book in the rare book section that reveals a plan
        to overthrow the constitutional government by secret agreements
        engineered by the lawyers. That is one of the reasons why this
        Amendment was ratified by Virginia and the notification was lost
        in the mail. There is no public record that this book exists.”
        That may sound surprising, but according to The Gazette
        (5/10/91), “the Library of Congress has 349,402 un-catalogued
        rare books and 13.9 million un-catalogued rare manuscripts.”
        There may be secrets buried in that mass of documents even more
        astonishing than a missing Constitutional Amendment.<b><br>
          <br>
          TITLES OF NOBILITY<br>
          <br>
        </b>In seeking to rule the world and destroy the United States,
        bankers committed many crimes. Foremost among these crimes were
        fraud, conversion, and plain old theft. To escape prosecution
        for their crimes, the bankers did the same thing any career
        criminal does. They hired and formed alliances with the best
        lawyers and judges money could buy. These alliances, originally
        forged in Europe (particularly in Great Britain), spread to the
        colonies, and later into the newly formed United States of
        America.<br>
        <br>
        Despite their criminal foundation, these alliances generated
        wealth, and ultimately, respectability. Like any modern member
        of organized crime, English bankers and lawyers wanted to be
        admired as “legitimate businessmen”. As their criminal fortunes
        grew so did their usefulness, so the British monarchy
        legitimized these thieves by granting them “titles of nobility”.<br>
        <br>
        Historically, the British peerage system referred to knights as
        “Squires” and to those who bore the knight’s shields as
        “Esquires”. As lances, shields, and physical violence gave way
        to the more civilized means of theft, the pen grew mightier (and
        more profitable) than the sword, and the clever wielders of
        those pens (bankers and lawyers) came to hold titles of
        nobility. The most common title was “Esquire” (used, even today,
        by some lawyers).<b><br>
          <br>
          INTERNATIONAL BAR ASSOCIATION<br>
          <br>
        </b>In Colonial America, attorneys trained attorneys but most
        held no “title of nobility” or “honor”. There was no requirement
        that one be a lawyer to hold the position of district attorney,
        attorney general, or judge; a citizen’s “counsel of choice” was
        not restricted to a lawyer; there were no state or national bar
        associations. The only organization that certified lawyers was
        the International Bar Association (IBA), chartered by the King
        of England, headquartered in London, and closely associated with
        the international banking system. Lawyers admitted to the IBA
        received the rank “Esquire” — a “title of nobility”. “Esquire”
        was the principle title of nobility which the 13th Amendment
        sought to prohibit from the United States.<br>
        <br>
        Why? Because the loyalty of “Esquire” lawyers was suspect.
        Bankers and lawyers with an “Esquire” behind their names were
        agents of the monarchy, members of an organization whose
        principle purposes were political, not economic, and regarded
        with the same wariness that some people today reserve for
        members of the KGB or the CIA.<br>
        <br>
        Article 1, Sect. 9 of the Constitution sought to prohibit the
        International Bar Association (or any other agency that granted
        titles of nobility) from operating in America. But the
        Constitution neglected to specify a penalty, so the prohibition
        was ignored, and agents of the monarchy continued to infiltrate
        and influence the government (as in the Jay Treaty and the US
        Bank charter incidents). Therefore, a “title of nobility”
        amendment that specified a penalty (loss of citizenship) was
        proposed in 1789, and again in 1810. The meaning of the
        amendment is seen in its intent to prohibit persons having
        titles of nobility and loyalties to foreign governments and
        bankers from voting, holding public office, or using their
        skills to subvert the government.<b><br>
          <br>
          HONOR<br>
        </b><br>
        The missing Amendment is referred to as the “title of nobility”
        Amendment, but the second prohibition against “honour” (honor),
        may be more significant.<br>
        <br>
        According to David Dodge, Tom Dunn, and Webster’s Dictionary,
        the archaic definition of “honor” (as used when the 13th
        Amendment was ratified) meant anyone “obtaining or having an
        advantage or privilege over another”. A contemporary example of
        an “honor” granted to only a few Americans is the privilege of
        being a judge: Lawyers can be judges and exercise the attendant
        privileges and powers; non-lawyers cannot.<br>
        <br>
        By prohibiting “honors”, the missing Amendment prohibits any
        advantage or privilege that would grant some citizens an unequal
        opportunity to achieve or exercise political power. Therefore,
        the second meaning (intent) of the 13th Amendment was to ensure
        political equality among all American citizens, by prohibiting
        anyone, even government officials, from claiming or exercising a
        special privilege or power (an “honor”) over other citizens.<br>
        <br>
        If this interpretation is correct, “honor” would be the key
        concept in the 13th Amendment. Why? Because, while “titles of
        nobility” may no longer apply in today’s political system, the
        concept of “honor” remains relevant. For example, anyone who had
        a specific “immunity” from lawsuits which were not afforded to
        all citizens, would be enjoying a separate privilege, an
        “honor”, and would therefore forfeit his right to vote or hold
        public office. Think of the “immunities” from lawsuits that U.S.
        judges, lawyers, politicians, and bureaucrats currently enjoy.
        As another example, think of all the “special interest”
        legislation the U.S. government passes: “special interests” are
        simply euphemisms for “special privileges” (honors).<b><br>
          <br>
          WHAT IF? (Implications if Restored)<br>
          <br>
        </b>If the missing 13th Amendment were restored, “special
        interests” and “immunities” might be rendered unconstitutional.
        The prohibition against “honors” (privileges) would compel the
        entire government to operate under the same laws as the citizens
        of this nation. Without their current personal immunities
        (honors), US judges and I.R.S. agents would be unable to abuse
        common citizens without fear of legal liability. If this 13th
        Amendment were restored, the entire U.S. Government would have
        to conduct itself according to the same standards of decency,
        respect, law, and liability as the rest of the nation. If this
        Amendment and the term<b> </b>“honor” were applied today, U.S.
        Government’s ability to systematically coerce and abuse the
        public would be all but eliminated.<br>
        <br>
        Imagine! A government without special privileges or immunities.
        How could we describe it? It would be … almost like … a
        government … of the people … by the people … for the people!
        Imagine: a government … whose members were truly accountable to
        the public; a government that could not systematically exploit
        its own people! It’s unheard of … it’s never been done before.
        Not ever in the entire history of the world.<br>
        <br>
        Bear in mind that Senator George Mitchell of Maine and the U.S.
        National Archives concede this 13th Amendment was proposed by
        Congress in 1810. However, they explain that there were
        seventeen states when Congress proposed the “title of nobility”
        Amendment; that ratification required the thirteen states, but
        since only twelve states supported the Amendment, it was not
        ratified. The Government Printing Office agrees; it currently
        prints copies of the Constitution of the United States which
        include the “title of nobility” Amendment as proposed, but
        un-ratified.<br>
        <br>
        Even if this 13th Amendment were never ratified, even if Dodge
        and Dunn’s research or reasoning is flawed or incomplete, it
        would still be an extraordinary story. Can you imagine, can you
        understand how close the US came to having a political paradise,
        right here on Earth? Do you realize what an extraordinary gift
        our forebears tried to bequeath us? And how close we came? One
        vote. One state’s vote.<br>
        <br>
        The federal government concedes that twelve states voted to
        ratify this Amendment between 1810 and 1812. But they argue that
        ratification require thirteen states, so the Amendment lays
        stillborn in history, unratified for lack of a just one more
        state’s support. One vote. David Dodge, however, says one more
        state did ratify, and he claims he has the evidence to prove it.<b><br>
          <br>
          PARADISE LOST, RATIFICATION FOUND<br>
          <br>
        </b>In 1789, the House of Representatives compiled a list of
        possible Constitutional Amendments, some of which would
        ultimately become our Bill of Rights. The House proposed
        seventeen; the Senate reduced the list to twelve. During this
        process that Senator Tristrain Dalton (Mass.) proposed an
        Amendment seeking to prohibit and provide a penalty for any
        American accepting a “title of Nobility” (RG 46 Records of the
        U.S. Senate). Although it wasn’t passed, this was the first time
        a “title of nobility” amendment was proposed.<br>
        <br>
        Twenty years later, in January, 1810, Senator Reed proposed
        another “Title of Nobility” Amendment (History of Congress,
        Proceedings of the Senate, p. 529-530). On April 27, 1810, the
        Senate voted to pass this 13th Amendment by a vote of 26 to 1;
        the House resolved in the affirmative 87 to 3; and the following
        resolve was sent to the States for ratification:<br>
        <br>
        “If any citizen of the United States shall Accept, claim,
        receive or retain any title of nobility or honour, or shall,
        without the consent of Congress, accept and retain any present,
        pension, office or emolument of any kind whatever, from any
        emperor, king, prince or foreign power, such person shall cease
        to be a citizen of the United States, and shall be incapable of
        holding any office of trust or profit under them, or either of
        them.”<br>
        <br>
        The Constitution requires three-quarters of the states to ratify
        a proposed amendment before it may be added to the Constitution.
        When Congress proposed the “Title of Nobility” Amendment in
        1810, there were states, thirteen of which would have to ratify
        for the Amendment to be adopted. According to the National
        Archives, the following is a list of the twelve states that
        ratified, and their dates of ratification:<br>
        <br>
        Maryland&nbsp; --&nbsp; Dec. 25, 1810<br>
        Kentucky --&nbsp; Jan. 31, 1811<br>
        Ohio --&nbsp; Jan. 31, 1811<br>
        Delaware --&nbsp; Feb. 2, 1811<br>

        Before a thirteenth state could ratify, the War of 1812 broke
        out with England. By the time the war ended in 1814, the British
        had burned the Capitol, the Library of Congress, and most of the
        records of the first 38 years of government. Whether there was a
        connection between the proposed “title of nobility” amendment
        and the War of 1812 is not known. However, the momentum to
        ratify the proposed Amendment was lost in the tumult of war.<br>
        <br>
        Then, four years later, on December 31, 1817, the House of
        Representatives resolved that President Monroe inquire into the
        status of this Amendment. In a letter dated February 6, 1818,
        President Monroe reported to the House that the Secretary of
        State Adams had written to the governors of Virginia, South
        Carolina and Connecticut to tell them that the proposed
        Amendment had been ratified by twelve States and rejected by two
        (New York and Rhode Island), and asked the governors to notify
        him of their legislature’s position. (House Document No. 76)
        (This, and other letters written by the President and the
        Secretary of State during the month of February, 1818, note only
        that the proposed Amendment had not yet been ratified. However,
        these letters would later become crucial because, in the absence
        of additional information they would be interpreted to mean the
        amendment was never ratified).<br>
        <br>
        On February 28, 1818, Secretary of State Adams reported the
        rejection of the Amendment by South Carolina. [House Doc. No.
        129]. There are no further entries regarding the ratification of
        the 13th Amendment in the Journals of Congress; whether Virginia
        ratified is neither confirmed nor denied. Likewise, a search
        through the executive papers of Governor Preston of Virginia
        does not reveal any correspondence from Secretary of State
        Adams. (However, there is a journal entry in the Virginia House
        that the Governor presented the House with an official letter
        and documents from Washington within a time frame that
        conceivably includes receipt of Adams’ letter.) Again, no
        evidence of ratification; none of denial.<br>
        <br>
        However, on March 10, 1819, the Virginia legislature passed Act
        No. 280 (Virginia Archives of Richmond, “misc.’ file, p. 299 for
        micro-film): “Be it enacted by the General Assembly, that there
        shall be published an edition of the Laws of this Commonwealth
        in which shall be contained the following matters, that is to
        say: the Constitution of the united States and the amendments
        thereto…” This act was the specific legislated instructions on
        what was, by law, to be included in the re-publication (a
        special edition) of the Virginia Civil Code. The Virginia
        Legislature had already agreed that all Acts were to go into
        effect on the same day — the day that the Act to re-publish the
        Civil Code was enacted. Therefore, the 13th Amendment’s official
        date of ratification would be the date of re-publication of the
        Virginia Civil Code: March 12, 1819.<br>
        <br>
        The Delegates knew Virginia was the last of the 13 States that
        were necessary for the ratification of the 13th Amendment. They
        also knew there were powerful forces allied against this
        ratification so they took extraordinary measures to make sure
        that it was published in sufficient quantity (4,000 copies were
        ordered, almost triple their usual order), and instructed the
        printer to send a copy to President James Monroe as well as
        James Madison and Thomas Jefferson. (The printer, Thomas
        Ritchie, was bonded. He was required to be extremely accurate in
        his research and his printing, or he would forfeit his bond.)<br>
        <br>
        In this fashion, Virginia announced the ratification: by
        publication and dissemination of the Thirteenth Amendment of the
        Constitution.<br>
        <br>
        There is question as to whether Virginia ever formally notified
        the Secretary of State that they had ratified this 13th
        Amendment. Some have argued that because such notification was
        not received (or at least, not recorded), the Amendment was
        therefore not legally ratified. However, printing by a
        legislature is prima facie evidence of ratification. Further,
        there is no Constitutional requirement that the Secretary of
        State, or anyone else, be officially notified to complete the
        ratification process. The Constitution only requires that three-
        fourths of the states ratify for an Amendment to be added to the
        Constitution. If three-quarters of the states ratify, the
        Amendment is passed. Period. The Constitution is otherwise
        silent on what procedure should be used to announce, confirm, or
        communicate the ratification of amendments.<br>
        <br>
        Knowing they were the last state necessary to ratify the
        Amendment, the Virginians had every right announce their own and
        the nation’s ratification of the Amendment by publishing it on a
        special edition of the Constitution, and so they did.<br>
        <br>
        Word of Virginia’s 1819 ratification spread throughout the
        States and both Rhode Island and Kentucky published the new
        Amendment in 1822. Ohio first published in 1824. Maine ordered
        10,000 copies of the Constitution with the 13th Amendment to be
        printed for use in the schools in 1825, and again in 1831 for
        their Census Edition. Indiana Revised Laws of 1831 published the
        13th Article on p. 20. Northwestern Territories published in
        1833. Ohio published in 1831 and 1833. Then came the Wisconsin
        Territory in 1839; Iowa Territory in 1843; Ohio again, in 1848;
        Kansas Statutes in 1855; and Nebraska Territory six times in a
        row from 1855 to 1860. So far, David Dodge has identified eleven
        different states or territories that printed the Amendment in
        twenty separate publications over forty-one years. And more
        editions including this 13th Amendment are sure to be
        discovered. Clearly, Dodge is onto something.<br>
        <br>
        You might be able to convince some of the people, or maybe even
        all of them, for a little while, that this 13th Amendment was
        never ratified. Maybe you can show them that the ten
        legislatures which ordered it published eighteen times we’ve
        discovered (so far) consisted of ignorant politicians who don’t
        know their amendments from their… ahh, articles. You might even
        be able to convince the public that our U.S. forefathers never
        meant to “outlaw” public servants who pushed people around,
        accepted bribes or special favors to “look the other way.”
        Maybe. But before you do, there’s an awful lot of evidence to be
        explained.<b><br>
          <br>
          THE AMENDMENT DISAPPEARS<br>
          <br>
        </b>In 1829, the following note appears on p. 23, Vol. 1 of the
        New York Revised Statutes:<br>
        <br>
        “In the edition of the Laws of the U.S. before referred to,
        there is an amendment printed as article 13, prohibiting
        citizens from accepting titles of nobility or honor, or
        presents, offices, &amp;c. from foreign nations. But, by a
        message of the president of the United States of the 4th of
        February, 1818, in answer to a resolution of the house of
        representatives, it appears that this amendment had been
        ratified only by 12 states, and therefore had not been adopted.
        See Vol. IV of the printed papers of the 1st session of the 15th
        congress, No. 76.” In 1854, a similar note appeared in the
        Oregon Statutes. Both notes refer to the Laws of the United
        States, 1st vol. p. 73 (or 74).<br>
        <br>
        It’s not yet clear whether the 13th Amendment was published in
        Laws of the United States, 1st Vol., prematurely, by accident,
        in anticipation of Virginia’s ratification, or as part of a plot
        to discredit the Amendment by making it appear that only twelve
        States had ratified. Whether the Laws of the United States Vol.
        1 (carrying the 13th Amendment) was re-called or made-up is
        unknown. In fact, it’s not even clear that the specified volume
        was actually printed — the Law Library of the Library of
        Congress has no record of its existence.<br>
        <br>
        However, because the noted authors reported no further
        references to the 13th Amendment after the Presidential letter
        of February, 1818, they apparently assumed the ratification
        process had ended in failure at that time. If so, they neglected
        to seek information on the Amendment after 1818, or at the state
        level, and therefore missed the evidence of Virginia’s
        ratification. This opinion — assuming that the Presidential
        letter of February, 1818, was the last word on the Amendment —
        has persisted to this day.<br>
        <br>
        In 1849, Virginia decided to revise the 1819 Civil Code of
        Virginia (which had contained the 13th Amendment for 30 years).
        It was at that time that one of the code’s revisers (a lawyer
        named Patton) wrote to the Secretary of the Navy, William B.
        Preston, asking if this Amendment had been ratified or appeared
        by mistake. Preston wrote to J. M. Clayton, the Secretary of
        State, who replied that this Amendment was not ratified by a
        sufficient number of States. This conclusion was based upon the
        information that Secretary of State John Quincy Adams had
        provided the House of Representatives in 1818, before Virginia’s
        ratification in 1819. (Even today, the Congressional Research
        Service tells anyone asking about this 13th Amendment this same
        story: that only twelve states, not the<br>
        requisite thirteen, had ratified.)<br>
        <br>
        However, despite Clayton’s opinion, the Amendment continued to
        be published in various states and territories for at least
        another eleven years (the last known publication was in the
        Nebraska territory in 1860). Once again the 13th Amendment was
        caught in the riptides of American politics. South Carolina
        seceded from the Union in December of 1860, signaling the onset
        of the Civil War. In March, 1861, President Abraham Lincoln was
        inaugurated.<br>
        <br>
        Later in 1861, another proposed amendment, also numbered
        thirteen, was signed by President Lincoln. This was the only
        proposed amendment that was ever signed by a president. That
        resolve to amend read:<br>
        <br>
        “ARTICLE THIRTEEN, No amendment shall be made to the
        Constitution which will authorize or give to Congress the power
        to abolish or interfere, within any State, with the domestic
        institutions thereof, including that of persons held to labor or
        service by the laws of said State.”<br>
        <br>
        In other words, President Lincoln had signed a resolve that
        would have permitted slavery, and upheld states’ rights. Only
        one State, Illinois, ratified this proposed amendment before the
        Civil War broke out in 1861. In the tumult of 1865, the original
        13th Amendment was finally removed from the US Constitution. On
        January 31, another 13th Amendment (which prohibited slavery in
        Sect. 1, and ended states’ rights in Sect. 2) was proposed. On
        April 9, the Civil War ended with General Lee’s surrender. On
        April 14, President Lincoln (who, in 1861, had signed the
        proposed Amendment that would have allowed slavery and states
        rights) was assassinated. On December 6, the “new” 13th
        Amendment loudly prohibiting slavery (and quietly surrendering
        states rights to the federal government) was ratified, replacing
        and effectively erasing the original 13th Amendment that had
        prohibited “titles of nobility” and “honors”.<b><br>
          <br>
          SIGNIFICANCE OF REMOVAL<br>
          <br>
        </b>To create the present oligarchy (rule by lawyers) which the
        U.S. now endures, the lawyers first had to remove the 13th
        “titles of nobility” Amendment that might otherwise have kept
        them in check. In fact, it was not until after the Civil War and
        after the disappearance of this 13th Amendment, that American
        bar associations began to appear and exercise political power.<br>
        <br>
        Since the unlawful deletion of the 13th Amendment, the newly
        developing bar associations began working diligently to create a
        system wherein lawyers took on a title of privilege and nobility
        as “Esquires” and received the “honor” of offices and positions
        (like district attorney or judge) that only they could hold. By
        virtue of these titles, honors, and special privileges, lawyers
        have assumed political and economic advantages over the majority
        of U.S. citizens. Through these privileges, they have nearly
        established a two-tiered citizenship in this nation where a
        majority may vote, but only a minority (lawyers) may run for
        political office. This two-tiered citizenship is clearly
        contrary to Americans’ political interests, the nation’s
        economic welfare, and the Constitution’s egalitarian spirit.<br>
        <br>
        The significance of this missing 13th Amendment and its deletion
        from the Constitution is this: Since the amendment was never
        lawfully nullified, it is still in full force and effect and is
        the Law of the land. If public support could be awakened, this
        missing Amendment might provide a legal basis to challenge many
        existing laws and court decisions previously made by lawyers who
        were unconstitutionally elected or appointed to their positions
        of power; it might even mean the removal of lawyers from the
        current US government system.<br>
        <br>
        At the very least, this missing 13th Amendment demonstrates that
        two centuries ago, lawyers were recognized as enemies of the
        people and nation. Some things never change.<b><br>
          <br>
          THOSE WHO CANNOT RECALL HISTORY ….<br>
          &nbsp;</b><br>
        Heed warnings of Founding FathersIn his farewell address, George
        Washington warned of “… change by usurpation; for through this,
        in one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the
        customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed.” In
        1788, Thomas Jefferson proposed that we have a Declaration of
        Rights similar to Virginia’s. Three of his suggestions were
        “freedom of commerce against monopolies, trial by jury in all
        cases” and “no suspensions of the<br>
        habeas corpus.”<br>
        <br>
        No doubt Washington’s warning and Jefferson’s ideas were
        dismissed as redundant by those who knew the law. Who would have
        dreamed the U.S. legal system would become a monopoly against
        freedom when that was one of the primary causes for the
        rebellion against King George III?<br>
        <br>
        Yet, the denial of trial by jury is now commonplace in the U.S.
        courts, and habeas corpus, for crimes against the state, is
        suspended. (By crimes against the state, I refer to “political
        crimes” where there is no injured party and the corpus delicti
        [evidence] is equally imaginary.)<br>
        <br>
        The authority to create monopolies was judge-made law by Supreme
        Court Justice John Marshall, et al during the early 1800’s.
        Judges (and lawyers) granted to themselves the power to declare
        the acts of the People “un-Constitutional”, waited until their
        decision was grandfathered, and then granted themselves a
        monopoly by creating the bar associations. Although Article VI
        of the U.S. Constitution mandates that executive orders and
        treaties are binding upon the states (“… and the Judges in every
        State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or
        Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.”), the
        supreme Court has held that the Bill of Rights is not binding
        upon the states, and thereby resurrected many of the complaints
        enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, exactly as Thomas
        Jefferson foresaw in “Notes on the State of Virginia”, Query 17,
        p. 161, 1784:<br>
        <br>
        “Our rulers will become corrupt, our people careless… the time
        for fixing every essential right on a legal basis is [now] while
        our rulers are honest, and ourselves united. From the conclusion
        of this war we shall be going downhill. It will not then be
        necessary to resort every moment to the people for support. They
        will be forgotten, therefore, and their rights disregarded. They
        will forget themselves, but in the sole faculty of making money,
        and will never think of uniting to effect a due respect for
        their rights. The shackles, therefore, which shall not be
        knocked off at the conclusion of this war, will remain on us
        long, will be made heavier and heavier, till our rights shall
        revive or expire in a convulsion.”<br>
        <br>
        We await the inevitable convulsion. Only two questions remain:
        Will we fight to revive our rights? Or, Will we meekly submit as
        our last remaining rights expire, surrendered to the courts, and
        perhaps to a “new world order”?<b><br>
          <br>
          MORE EDITIONS FOUND<br>
          <br>
        </b>As we go to press, I’ve received information from a
        researcher in Indiana, and another in Dallas, who have found
        five more editions of statutes that include the Constitution and
        the missing 13th Amendment. These editions were printed by Ohio,
        1819; Connecticut (one of the states that voted against
        ratifying the Amendment), 1835; Kansas, 1861; and the Colorado
        Territory, 1865 and 1867.<br>
        <br>
        These finds are important because:<br>
        <br>
        They offer independent confirmation of Dodge’s claims; and They
        extend the known dates of publication from Nebraska 1860
        (Dodge’s most recent find), to Colorado in 1867.<br>
        <br>
        The most intriguing discovery was the 1867 Colorado Territory
        edition which includes both the “missing” 13th Amendment and the
        current 13th Amendment (freeing the slaves), on the same page.
        The current 13th Amendment is listed as the 14th Amendment in
        the 1867 Colorado edition. This investigation has followed a
        labyrinthine path that started with the questions about how the
        U.S. courts evolved from a temple of the Bill of Rights to the
        current star chamber and whether this situation had anything to
        do with retiring chief Justice Burger’s warning that we were
        “about to lose our Constitution”. My seven year investigation
        has been fruitful beyond belief; the information on the missing
        13th Amendment is only a “drop in the bucket” of the information
        I have discovered. Still, the research continues, and by
        definition, is never truly complete.<b><br>
          <br>
          ARGUMENTS<br>
        </b><br>
        Imagine a nation which prohibited at least some lawyers from
        serving in government. Imagine a government prohibited from
        writing laws granting “honors” (special privileges, immunities,
        or advantages) to individuals, groups, or government officials.
        Imagine a government that could only write laws that applied to
        everyone, even themselves, equally. It’s never been done before.
        Not once. But it has been tried: In 1810 the Congress of the
        United States proposed a 13th Amendment to the Constitution that
        might have given us just that sort of equality and political
        paradise. The story begins (again) in 1983, when David Dodge and
        Tom Dunn discovered an 1825 edition of the Maine Civil Code
        which contained the U.S. Constitution and a 13th Amendment which
        no longer appears on the Constitution:<br>
        <br>
        “If any citizen of the United States shall accept, claim,
        receive, or retain any title of nobility or honor, or shall
        without the consent of Congress, accept and retain any present,
        pension, office, or emolument of any kind whatever, from any
        emperor, king, prince, or foreign power, such person shall cease
        to be a citizen of the United States, and shall be incapable of
        holding any office of trust or profit under them, or either of
        them.”<br>
        <br>
        This Amendment would have restricted at least some lawyers from
        serving in government, and would prohibit legislators from
        passing any special interest legislation, tax breaks, or special
        immunities for anyone, not even themselves. It might have
        guaranteed a level of political equality in this nation that
        most people can’t even imagine. Since 1983, researchers have
        uncovered evidence that:<br>
        <br>
        The 13th Amendment prohibiting “titles of nobility” and “honors”
        appeared in at least 30 editions of the Constitution of the
        United States which were printed by at least 14 states or
        territories between 1819 and 1867; and This amendment quietly
        disappeared from the Constitution near the end of the Civil War.<br>
        <br>
        Either this Amendment was: Unratified and mistakenly published
        for almost 50 years; or Ratified in 1819, and then illegally
        removed from the Constitution by 1867.<br>
        <br>
        If this 13th Amendment was unratified and mistakenly published,
        the story has remained unnoticed in American history for over a
        century. If so, it’s at least a good story — an extraordinary
        historical anecdote.<br>
        <br>
        On the other hand, if Dodge is right and the Amendment was truly
        ratified, an Amendment has been subverted from our Constitution.
        If so, this “missing” Amendment would still be the Law, and this
        story could be one of the most important stories in American
        History. Whatever the answer, it’s certain that something
        extraordinary happened to our Constitution between 1819 and
        1867.<b><br>
          <br>
          PROS AND CONS (for Ratification)<br>
          <br>
        </b>Of course, there are two sides to this issue. David Dodge,
        the principal researcher, argues that this 13th Amendment was
        ratified in 1819 and then subverted from the Constitution near
        the end of the Civil War. U.S. Senator George Mitchell of Maine,
        and Mr. Dane Hartgrove (Acting Assistant Chief, Civil Reference
        Branch of the National Archives) have argued that the Amendment
        was never properly ratified and only published in error. There
        is some agreement. Both sides agree the Amendment was proposed
        by Congress in 1810. Both sides also agree that the proposed
        Amendment required the support of at least thirteen states to be
        ratified. Both sides agree that between 1810 and 1812 twelve
        states voted to support ratification. The pivotal issue is
        whether Virginia ratified or rejected the proposed Amendment.
        Dodge contends Virginia voted to support the Amendment in 1819,
        and so the Amendment was truly ratified and should still be a
        part of our Constitution. Senator Mitchell and Mr. Hartgrove
        disagree, arguing that Virginia did not ratify. Unfortunately,
        several decades of Virginia’s legislative journals were
        misplaced or destroyed (possibly during the Civil War; possibly
        during the 1930’s). Consequently, neither side has found
        absolute proof that the Virginia legislature voted for (or
        against) ratification. A series of letters exchanged in 1991
        between David Dodge, Sen. Mitchell, and Mr. Hartgrove illuminate
        the various points of disagreement. After Dodge’s initial report
        of a “missing” Amendment in the 1825 Maine Civil Code, Sen.
        Mitchell explained that this edition was a one-time publishing
        error: “The Maine Legislature mistakenly printed the proposed
        Amendment in the Maine Constitution as having been adopted. As
        you know, this was a mistake, as it was not ratified.”<br>
        <br>
        Further, “All editions of the Maine Constitution printed after
        1820 [sic] exclude the proposed amendment; only the originals
        contain this error.” Dodge dug deeper, found other editions
        (there are 30, to date) of state and territorial civil codes
        that contained the missing Amendment, and thereby demonstrated
        that the Maine publication was not a “one-time” publishing
        error.<b><br>
          <br>
          YES VIRGINIA, THERE IS A RATIFICATION<br>
          <br>
        </b>After examining Dodge’s evidence of multiple publications of
        the “missing” Amendment, Sen. Mitchell and Mr. Hartgrove
        conceded the Amendment had been published by several states and
        was ratified by twelve of the seventeen states in the Union in
        1810. However, because the Constitution requires that
        three-quarters of the states vote to ratify an Amendment.
        Mitchell and Hartgrove insisted that the 13th Amendment was
        published in error because it was passed by only twelve, not
        thirteen States. Dodge investigated which seventeen states were
        in the Union at the time the Amendment was proposed, which
        states had ratified, which states had rejected the amendment,
        and determined that the issue hung on whether one last state
        (Virginia) had or had not, voted to ratify.<br>
        <br>
        After several years of searching the Virginia state archive,
        Dodge made a crucial discovery: In Spring of 1991, he found a
        misplaced copy of the 1819 Virginia Civil Code which included
        the “missing” 13th Amendment. Dodge notes that, curiously,
        “There is no public record that shows this book [the 1819
        Virginia Civil Code] exists. It is not catalogued as a holding
        of the Library of Congress nor is it in the National Union
        Catalogue. Neither the state law library nor the law school in
        Portland were able to find any trace that this book exists in
        any of their computer programs.”<br>
        <br>
        Dodge sent photo-copies of the 1819 Virginia Civil Code to Sen.
        Mitchell and Mr. Hartgrove, and explained that, “Under
        legislative construction, it is considered prima facie evidence
        that what is published as the official acts of the legislature
        are the official acts.” By publishing the Amendment as ratified
        in an official publication, Virginia demonstrated that they:<br>
        <br>
        Knew they were the last state whose vote was necessary to ratify
        this 13th Amendment; Had voted to ratify the Amendment; and Were
        publishing the Amendment in a special edition of their Civil
        Code as an official notice to the world that the Amendment had
        indeed been ratified.<br>
        <br>
        Dodge concluded, “Unless there is competing evidence to the
        contrary, it must be held that the Constitution of the United
        States was officially amended to exclude from its body of
        citizens any who accepted or claimed a title of nobility or
        accepted any special favors. Foremost in this category of
        ex-citizens are bankers and lawyers.”<b><br>
          <br>
          RATIONALES (for Ratification)<br>
          <br>
        </b>Undeterred, Sen. Mitchell wrote that, “Article XIII did not
        receive the three-fourths vote required from the states within
        the time limit to be ratified.” (Although his language is
        imprecise, Sen. Mitchell seems to concede that although the
        Amendment had failed to satisfy the “time limit”, the required
        three-quarters of the states did vote to ratify.) Dodge replies:
        “Contrary to your assertion.., there was no time limit for
        amendment ratification in 1811. Any time limit is now
        established by Congress in the Resolves for proposed
        amendments.”<br>
        <br>
        In fact, ratification time limits didn’t start until 1917, when
        Sect. 3 of the Eighteenth Amendment stated that, “This Article
        shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified within
        seven years from the date of submission … to the States by
        Congress.” A similar time limit is now included on other
        proposed Amendments, but there was no specified time limit when
        the 13th Amendment was proposed in 1810 or ratified in 1819.
        Sen. Mitchell remained determined to find some rationale,
        somewhere, that would defeat Dodge’s persistence. Although Sen.
        Mitchell implicitly conceded that his “published by error” and
        “time limit” arguments were invalid, he continued to grope for
        reasons to dispute the ratification: “… regardless of whether
        the state of Virginia did ratify the proposed Thirteenth
        Amendment… on March 12, 1819, this approval would not have been
        sufficient to amend the Constitution.<br>
        <br>
        In 1819, there were twenty-one states in the United States and
        any amendment would have required approval of sixteen states to
        amend the Constitution. According to your own research, Virginia
        would have only been the thirteenth state to approve the
        proposed amendment.” Dodge replies: “Article V [amendment
        procedures] of the Constitution is silent on the question of
        whether or not the framers meant three-fourths of the states at
        the time the proposed amendment is submitted to the states for
        ratification, or three-fourths of the states that exist at some
        future point in time. Since only the existing states were
        involved in the debate and vote of Congress on the Resolve
        proposing an Amendment, it is reasonable that ratification be
        limited to those States that took an active part in the
        Amendment process.”<br>
        <br>
        Dodge demonstrated this rationale by pointing out that,
        “President Monroe had his Secretary of State… [ask the]
        governors of Virginia, South Carolina, and Connecticut, in
        January, 1818, as to the status of the amendment in their
        respective states. The four new states (Louisiana, Indiana,
        Mississippi, and Illinois) that were added to the union between
        1810 and 1818 were not even considered.”<br>
        <br>
        From a modern perspective, it seems strange that not all states
        would be included in the ratification process. But bear in mind
        that this perspective is based on life in a stable nation that’s
        added only five new states in this century — about one every
        eighteen years. However, between 1803 and 1821 (when the 13th
        Amendment ratification drama unfolded), they added eight states
        — almost one new state every two years. This rapid national
        growth undoubtedly fostered national attitudes different from
        our own. The government had to be filled with the euphoria of a
        growing Republic that expected to quickly add new states all the
        way to the Pacific Ocean and the Isthmus of Panama. The
        government would not willingly compromise or complicate that
        growth potential with procedural obstacles; to involve every new
        state in each on-going ratification could inadvertently slow the
        nation’s growth.<br>
        <br>
        For example, if a territory petitioned to join the Union while
        an Amendment was being considered, its access to statehood might
        depend on whether the territory expected to ratify or reject a
        proposed amendment. If the territory was expected to ratify the
        proposed Amendment government, officials who favored the
        Amendment might try to accelerate the territory’s entry into the
        Union. On the other hand, those opposed to the Amendment might
        try to slow or even deny a particular territory’s statehood.
        These complications could unnecessarily slow the entry of new
        states into the nation, or restrict the nation’s ability to pass
        new Amendments. Neither possibility could appeal to politicians.
        Whatever the reason, the House of Representatives resolved to
        ask only Connecticut, South Carolina, and Virginia for their
        decision on ratifying the 13th Amendment — they did not ask for
        the decisions of the four new states. Since the new states had
        Representatives in the House who did not protest when the
        resolve was passed, it’s apparent that even the new states
        agreed that they should not be included in the ratification
        process.<br>
        <br>
        In 1818, the President, the House of Representatives, the
        Secretary of State, the four “new” states, and the seventeen
        “old” states, all clearly believed that the support of just
        thirteen states was required to ratify the 13th Amendment. That
        being so, Virginia’s vote to ratify was legally sufficient to
        ratify the “missing’ Amendment in 1819 (and would still be so
        today).<b><br>
          <br>
          INSULT TO INJURY<br>
          <br>
        </b>Apparently persuaded by Dodge’s various arguments and proofs
        that the “missing” 13th Amendment had satisfied the
        Constitutional requirements for ratification, Mr. Hartgrove
        (National Archives) wrote back that Virginia had nevertheless
        failed to satisfy the bureaucracy’s procedural requirements for
        ratification:<br>
        <br>
        “Under current legal provisions, the Archivist of the United
        States is empowered to certify that he has in his custody the
        correct number of state certificates of ratification of a
        proposed Constitutional amendment to constitute its ratification
        by the United States of America as a whole. In the nineteenth
        century, that function was performed by the Secretary of State.
        Clearly, the Secretary of State never received a certificate of
        ratification of the title of nobility amendment from the
        Commonwealth of Virginia, which is why that amendment failed to
        become the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States
        Constitution.”<br>
        <br>
        This is an extraordinary admission. Mr. Hartgrove implicitly
        concedes that the 13th Amendment was ratified by Virginia and
        satisfied the Constitution’s ratification requirements. However,
        Hartgrove then insists that the ratification was nevertheless
        justly denied because the Secretary of State was not properly
        notified with a “certificate of ratification”. In other words,
        the government’s last, best argument that the 13th Amendment was
        not ratified boils down to this:<br>
        <br>
        Though the Amendment satisfied Constitutional requirement for
        ratification, it is nonetheless missing from our Constitution
        simply because a single, official sheet of paper is missing in
        Washington. Mr. Hartgrove implies that despite the fact that
        three-quarters of the States in the Union voted to ratify an
        Amendment, the will of the legislators and the people of this
        nation should be denied because somebody screwed up and lost a
        single “certificate of ratification”. This “certificate” may be
        missing because either:<br>
        <br>
        Virginia failed to file a proper notice; or The notice was “lost
        in the mail”; or The notice was lost, unrecorded, misplaced, or
        intentionally destroyed, by some bureaucrat in Washington D.C.
        This final excuse insults every American’s political rights, but
        Mr. Hartgrove nevertheless offers a glimmer of hope: If the
        National Archives “received a certificate of ratification of the
        title of nobility amendment from the Commonwealth of Virginia,
        we would inform Congress and await further developments.” In
        other words, the issue of whether this 13th Amendment was
        ratified and is, or is not, a legitimate Amendment to the U.S.
        Constitution, is not merely a historical curiosity — the
        ratification issue is still alive.<br>
        <br>
        But most importantly, Hartgrove implies that the only remaining
        argument against the 13th Amendment’s ratification is a
        procedural error involving the absence of a “certificate of
        ratification”.<br>
        <br>
        Dodge countered Hartgrove’s procedure argument by citing some of
        the ratification procedures recorded for other states when the
        13th Amendment was being considered. He notes that according to
        the Journal of the House of Representatives. 11th Congress, 2nd
        Session, at p. 241, a “letter” (not a “certificate of
        ratification”) from the Governor of Ohio announcing Ohio’s
        ratification was submitted not to the Secretary of State but
        rather to the House of Representatives where it “was read and
        ordered to lie on the table.” Likewise, “The Kentucky
        ratification was also returned to the House, while Maryland’s
        earlier ratification is not listed as having been returned to
        Congress.”<br>
        <br>
        The House Journal implies that since Ohio and Kentucky were not
        required to notify the Secretary of State of their ratification
        decisions, there was likewise no requirement that Virginia file
        a “certificate of ratification” with the Secretary of State.
        Again, despite arguments to the contrary, it appears that the
        “missing” Amendment was Constitutionally ratified and should not
        be denied because of some possible procedural error.<br>
        <b><br>
          QUICK, MEN! TO THE ARCHIVES!<br>
          <br>
        </b>Each of Sen. Mitchell’s and Mr. Hartgrove’s arguments
        against Ratification have been overcome or badly weakened.
        Still, some of the evidence supporting ratification is
        inferential; some of the conclusions are only implied. But it’s
        no wonder that there’s such an austere sprinkling of hard
        evidence surrounding this 13th Amendment:<br>
        <br>
        According to The Gazette (5/10/91), the Library of Congress has
        349,402 un-catalogued rare books and 13.9 million un-catalogued
        rare manuscripts. The evidence of ratification seems
        tantalizingly close but remains buried in those masses of
        un-catalogued documents, waiting to be found. It will take some
        luck and some volunteers to uncover the final proof.<br>
        <br>
        We have an Amendment that looks like a duck, walks like a duck,
        and quacks like a duck. But because we have been unable to find
        the eggshell from which it hatched in 1819, Sen. Mitchell and
        Mr. Hartgrove insist we can’t … quite … absolutely prove it’s a
        duck, and therefore, the government is under no obligation to
        concede it’s a duck. Maybe so. But if we can’t prove it’s a
        duck, they can’t prove it’s not. If the proof of ratification is
        not quite conclusive, the evidence against ratification is
        almost nonexistent, largely a function of the government’s
        refusal to acknowledge the proof. We are left in the peculiar
        position of boys facing bullies in the schoolyard. We show them
        proof that they should again include the “missing” 13th
        Amendment on the Constitution; they sneer and jeer and taunt us
        with cries of “make us”. Perhaps we shall.<br>
        <br>
        It’s worth noting that Rick Donaldson, another researcher,
        uncovered certified copies of the 1865 and 1867 editions of the
        Colorado Civil Codes which also contain the missing Amendment.
        Although these editions were stored in the Colorado state
        archive, their existence was previously un-catalogued and
        unknown to the Colorado archivists.<br>
        <br>
        This raises a fantastic possibility. If there’s insufficient
        evidence that Virginia did ratify in 1819, there is no evidence
        that Virginia did not. Therefore, since there was no time limit
        specified when the Amendment was proposed, and since the
        government clearly believed only Virginia’s vote remained to be
        counted in the ratification issue, the current state legislature
        of Virginia could theoretically vote to ratify the Amendment,
        send the necessary certificates to Washington, and thereby add
        the Amendment to the Constitution.<br>
        <br>
        Was it ratified? There is a lot of evidence that it was. Could
        all of the following publications have been in error?<br>

        Note: The “Laws of the United States” was published by John
        Duane. Without doubt, Duane was aware of Virginia’s plan to
        ratify this amendment which targeted, amongst other things, the
        emolument of banking and the agents of foreign banking
        interests, the attorneys. Currency manipulation led to the
        failure of numerous banks and in turn to many a personal
        bankruptcy, including that of Thomas Jefferson. The allegiance
        of attorneys** has always been with the money state, whether
        pharaoh, caesar, monarch or corporate monopoly.<br>
        <br>
        ** See: “Acts of Virginia”, Feb. 20, 1812, p.143. The Court, in
        “Horst v. Moses”, 48 Alabama 129, 142 (1872) gave the following
        description of a title of nobility:<br>
        <br>
        To confer a title of nobility, is to nominate to an order of
        persons to whom privileges are granted at the expense of the
        rest of the people. It is not necessarily hereditary, and the
        objection to it rises more from the privileges supposed to be
        attached than to the otherwise empty title or order. These
        components are forbidden separately in the terms “privilege”,
        “honor”, and “emoluments”, as they are collectively in the term
        “title of nobility”. The prohibition is not affected by any
        consideration paid or rendered for the grant.<br>
        <br>
        “Bouvier’s Law Dictionary”, 15th Edition, vol. 1 (1885) lists
        the due process amendments as 5 and 15 [15 was re-numbered to

        claim of eminent domain through fictions of law. Eminent domain

        The debate goes on. The mystery continues to unfold. The answer
        lies buried in the archives. If you are close to a state archive
        or large library anywhere in the USA, please search for editions
        of the U.S. Constitution printed between 1819 and 1870.<br>
        <br>
        If you will, please check your state’s archives and libraries to
        review any copies of the Constitution printed prior to the Civil
        War, or any books containing prints of the Constitution before
        1870. If you locate anything related to this project we would
        appreciate hearing from you so we may properly fulfill this
        effort of research.<br>

          SUMMARY: <br>
        </b><br>
        Scaled down and in electric grid, victims financed it,
        sophisticated acquisition system.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        It is a system that can sniff its own signals on the way in, and
        if it handles/encrypts itself doing that - it eavesdrops on
        itself and sends it out of band encrypted and undetected.&nbsp;
        It does not go into the regular info stream, but goes out of
        that and out of band, then is encrypted and undetected.<br>
        <br>
        On the flip side, it has gotten to the point w phased array
        antennas (pizza box antennas) in personal devices they are being
        widely deployed and now individual cellphones can have 10
        antennas in one device and quite programmable across frequency
        band and direction. Cell phones now are computers and started w
        I-phones and when IOS Android came out.<br>

          <b>Angie Riedel</b><br>

        <b><br>
        </b>We Americans are obsessed with rule-following and the law to
        the point of ignorance. We think of rules and laws as something
        from on high that must not be broken. We don’t believe we are
        free to ignore the law, even if it kills us to obey it. We quite
        literally accept the notion that the law is what is supreme and
        the law is what is noble and that it is the law that must be
        defended at all costs. We give our lives to protect the law.<br>
        <br>
        The fact is, that makes no sense. At all. Where do I begin?<br>
        <br>
        The law can’t be supreme, only our lives can hold supreme
        meaning. Laws cannot be noble, only people can be noble. The law
        doesn’t need to be defended, because it can’t be harmed; in
        fact, it doesn’t even exist except inside people’s heads. People
        need to be defended, because we can be harmed, we can cease to
        exist. And because we are irreplaceable and life is sacred, we
        need to take steps to defend and protect life. Therefore, giving
        our lives to defend something that can’t be harmed makes no
        sense. What is the law for if it is not to protect and defend
        our lives?<br>
        <br>
        Here are a couple of obvious basics about laws, which will
        probably not come as any surprise. In the first place, the law
        and the rules are nothing more than words. They are words
        written on paper or posted on signs. The words do not come from
        on high, or from beyond, nor are they eternal and immutable.
        They are not by any means guaranteed to be fair, or right, or
        moral, or correct, and there is no legal obligation for them to
        be any of those things….<br>
        <b><br>
          &amp;c...<br>
          <br>
        </b>… The law has become so far removed from the average citizen
        that it has become a monster. It consumes us in our ignorance.
        Because the law and those who “uphold” it are both
        self-concerned and self-worshiping, there is little doubt that
        our current system of so-called law and order, our system of
        justice, is only concerned with it’s own power and continued
        control over the public and very little else.<br>
        <br>
        We are always right to challenge the law anytime we see it
        working in contradiction to simple truth and justice, and sadly,
        it often does just that. The bottom line is that our system of
        laws is no more real or valid or powerful than we decide to let
        it be, and although it would claim to have power over us, it
        does not and cannot, there is no mechanism or proof of any such
        thing. We can walk away from it any time we like and just blow
        it off.<br>
        <br>
        We can say, “You are invalid and we are no longer interested in
        playing your stupid power games that control us and our lives
        and are patently unfair. Leave us alone, you are nothing. We are
        better off without you.” We can indeed turn and walk away
        anytime, and that is the truth, the natural law, our birthright,
        something that cannot be changed. It is the reality of human
        law.<br>
        <br>
        It is always up to us what our own laws are, and it is always up
        to us whether or not to accept them, obey them, abide by them or
        have anything to do with them. The only power human law has is
        the power we give it. And the power we give it can also be taken
        away, by us.<br>
        <br>
        That is the reality of power, and the fact is that reality has
        been subverted and propagandized by very clever, very devious,
        very evil people who have sold us the notion that they must have
        power over us to keep us safe. That is always a lie. No one can
        keep us safe. If you think that through, you’ll realize the
        truth of it. Fear is the tool that enslaves us. And nonexistent
        power is what keeps us beneath those who feed off of us and
        deprive us of natural justice...<br>

          <b>Paul Craig Roberts</b><br>
        </div>
        <b><br>
        </b>The re-enserfment of Western peoples is taking place on
        several levels. One about which I have been writing for more
        than a decade comes from the offshoring of jobs. Americans, for
        example, have a shrinking participation in the production of the
        goods and services that are marketed to them.<br>
        <br>
        On another level we are experiencing the financialization of the
        Western economy about which Michael Hudson is the leading expert
        (Killing The Host). Financialization is the process of removing
        any public presence in the economy and converting the economic
        surplus into interest payments to the financial sector.<br>
        <br>
        These two developments deprive people of economic prospects. A
        third development deprives them of political rights. The
        Trans-Pacific and Trans-Atlantic Partnerships eliminate
        political sovereignty and turn governance over to global
        corporations.<br>
        <br>
        These so called “trade partnerships” have nothing to do with
        trade. These agreements negotiated in secrecy grant immunity to
        corporations from the laws of the countries in which they do
        business. This is achieved by declaring any interference by
        existing and prospective laws and regulations on corporate
        profits as restraints on trade for which corporations can sue
        and fine “sovereign” governments. For example, the ban in France
        and other counries on GMO products would be negated by the
        Trans-Atlantic Partnership. Democracy is simply replaced by
        corporate rule.<br>
        <br>
        I have been meaning to write about this at length. However,
        others, such as Chris Hedges, are doing a good job of explaining
        the power grab that eliminates representative government.<br>
http://www.opednews.com/articles/1/The-Most-Brazen-Corporate-by-Chris-Hedges-American-Hypocrisy_Americans-For-Prosperity_Corporate-Citizenship_Corporate-Crime-151107-882.html<br>
        <br>
        The corporations are buying power cheaply. They bought the
        entire US House of Representatives for just under $200 million.
        This is what the corporations paid Congress to go along with
        “Fast Track,” which permits the corporations’ agent, the US
        Trade Representative, to negotiate in secret without
        congressional input or oversight.
http://www.opednews.com/articles/Almost-200-Million-Donate-by-Paola-Casale-Banking_Congress_Control_Corporations-150620-523.html<br>
        <br>
        In other words, a US corporate agent deals with corporate agents
        in the countries that will comprise the “partnership,” and this
        handful of well-bribed people draw up an agreement that
        supplants law with the interests of corporations. No one
        negotiating the partnership represents the peoples’ or public’s
        interests. The governments of the partnership countries get to
        vote the deal up or down, and they will be well paid to vote for
        the agreement.<br>
        <br>
        Once these partnerships are in effect, government itself is
        privatized. There is no longer any point in legislatures,
        presidents, prime ministers, judges. Corporate tribunals decide
        law and court rulings.<br>
        <br>
        It is likely that these “partnerships” will have unintended
        consequences. For example, Russia and China are not part of the
        arrangements, and neither are Iran, Brazil, India, and South
        Africa, although seperately the Indian government appears to
        have been purchased by American agribusiness and is in the
        process of destroying its self-sufficient food production
        system. These countries will be the repositories for national
        sovereignty and public control while freedom and democracy are
        extinguished in the West and the West’s Asian vassals.<br>
        <br>
        Violent revolution throughout the West and the complete
        elimination of the One Percent is another possible outcome.
        Once, for example, the French people discover that they have
        lost all control over their diet to Monsanto and American
        agribusiness, the members of the French government that
        delivered France into dietary bondage to toxic foods are likely
        to be killed in the streets.<br>
        <br>
        Events of this sort are possible throughout the West as peoples
        discover that they have lost all control over every aspect of
        their lives and that their only choice is revolution or death.<b><br>

            suicide of European nations</b><br>
        </div>
        <b><br>
        </b>The 'guests' in Western Europe “don't like the food”, so
        what are they going to do about that? Can these 'guests' grow,
        process or provide food for themselves, on the lands in the
        nations that they are determined to take-over? They say they're
        bored, might they want to clean up the places they have soiled
        with their bodily wastes? Can these 'demanding-invaders' provide
        anything for themselves beyond satisfying their own bloodlust's
        compounded by their instinctive desire to rape torture and
        murder the people that opened their countries to them?<br>
        <br>
        Can these 'guests' provide water supplies for themselves, or can
        they produce their own fuel to use in their stolen cars? These
        creatures are not fully formed people with any ability to care
        for themselves and especially not for the huge families they
        supposedly want to create ­ 22 children per family ­ on no
        money, no resources and no meaningful work that anyone could or
        would ever choose to pay for? How does that work?<br>
        <br>
        Most of these 'men' have grown up raping, torturing and beating
        the people around them. They're thought processes are already
        irrefutably formed, and clearly most of them have no skills at
        all. These same men are advocating their “marriage” to young
        European-girls. They want to turn 12 year old's into mothers for
        their breeding programs that they want to initiate as part of
        their domination over the entire continent of Europe.<br>
        <br>
        But a mother of twelve years old can do nothing for a child that
        she gives birth to, consequently that “baby' will be stunted for
        life: The new life created in this way will only be a body to be
        used and abused: How is this conducive to creating a basis for
        'founding a dominant society', when most of this new population
        is barely above the mental level of the most primitive apes and
        they are certainly not human in any respect?<br>
        <br>
        Finally In this new arrangement the 'guests' have decided,
        because of their overwhelming numbers, that they will decide
        what happens in their “new homes”, who can live where and on
        what, while they proceed to murder rape and torture the
        population, at will, that made their change of country possible
        in the first place?<br>
        <br>
        “But Where will the money come from” to keep all these unwelcome
        parasites alive, just to 'carry-out' their designed destruction
        of the entire human race? I think they're dreaming big, because
        they believe their own fantasies, what they have not counted on
        is that the Europeans might actually wake-up and decide to kill
        them all, instead of waiting to become further enslaved by them
        than they are already, courtesy of the non-governments of Europe
        that ORDERED this invasion in the first place, on direct orders
        from Zionist Israel.<b><br>

        Get off Facebook NOW, and NEVER hit anyone elses profile or
        click a like again, EVER, Facebook is now BANNED for anyone with
        an ounce of awareness<br>
        <br>
        Via a bug Facebook installs when you visit their web site or
        click a like, even if you have no account with facebook Facebook
        can keep on monitoring visitors permanently forever after,
        including all phone numbers, PASSWORDS TO OTHER WEB SITES, every
        site you ever visit ever again, and more.<br>
        <br>
        There has been a new development with Facebook. Facebook now
        plants a bug on your computer that hands them your phone
        numbers, browsing history, and tracks all future history as well
        as all photos and anything else you do on your computer if you
        ever hit the web site or ever click a like, even if you have no
        facebook account. Facebook has gone full hostile, AVOID FACEBOOK
        LIKE THE PLAGUE.<br>
        <br>
        How do I know this? Easy, Belgium ordered them to stop doing it,
        and published the court case.<br>
        <br>
        A court in Belgium has ordered Facebook to stop tracking the
        country's Internet users who are not members of the US-based
        social networking website.<br>
        <br>
        "Today the judge... ordered the social network Facebook to stop
        tracking and registering Internet usage by people who surf the
        Internet in Belgium within the 48 hours which follow this
        statement," the court said on Monday.<br>
        <br>
        The ruling follows a case lodged in June by the Belgian Privacy
        Commission, which said Facebook indiscriminately tracks Internet
        users when they click "like" or "share" on the website, or when
        they visit Facebook pages even if they do not have accounts with
        the website, according to the court.<br>
        <br>
        "If Facebook ignores this order it must pay a fine of 250,000
        euros (269,000 dollars) a day to the Belgian Privacy
        Commission," the court noted.<br>
        <br>
        It also said the networking site uses a special cookie called
        "datr" that lodges on Internet users' device to track their
        activities.<br>
        <br>
        Datr provides Facebook with access to an amazing amount of
        user's personal information, such as the Internet protocol (IP)
        address of the computer, browsing data, outside login
        information, phone numbers, AND MORE. What can be defined as
        "more?" Well, More than IP address, browsing data, login
        information to other web sites, and phone numbers has GOT TO
        mean your photos, anything you type, EVERYTHING because that is
        the only way it could be more than log-ins to other web sites
        and your phone numbers! FACEPLANT IS MALWARE ON STEROIDS, AND
        YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO SIGN UP OR INSTALL ANYTHING, ONE HIT TO
        FACEPLANT GETS YOU NAILED.<br>
        <br>
        The Belgian court also said "this is personal data, which
        according to Belgian law, Facebook can only use if the Internet
        user expressly gives their consent, as Belgian privacy law
        dictates."<br>
        <br>
        In response, Facebook said it would appeal against the decision,
        emphasizing that the cookie was safe.<br>
        <br>
        "We've used the datr cookie for more than five years to keep
        Facebook secure for 1.5 billion people around the world," the
        website's spokesman said in a statement emailed to AFP.<br>
        <br>
        LET ME DEFINE HOW FACEBOOK DEFINES SECURE AND SAFE: "OUTSIDE LOG
        IN INFORMATION" MEANS WEB SITES OTHER THAN FACEBOOK. HOW
        "SECURE" OR "SAFE" IS IT FOR FACEBOOK TO GET YOUR GMAIL, PAYPAL,
        AND OTHER LOG INS WHEN THERE IS NO CONCEIVABLE WAY THEY WOULD
        WANT THEM IF THEY DID NOT INTEND TO USE THEM?<br>
        <br>
        Despite Paypal log ins being encrypted, all it takes is a
        keylogger to hand over the data, outside the encryption stream.
        If Faceplant is so invasive they deserve your Yahoo, Gmail, and
        other "outside" log in data, what is stopping them from logging
        everything, and I MEAN EVERYTHING?<br>
        <br>
        Yeah, the cookie (which is malware by a different name if it can
        do all of that) is "safe" for the Jewish community, which can
        then obviously use it as a gateway to rape everything on your
        computer and anything you have on the web wholesale. That is the
        only way "more" than "outside log ins and phone numbers" can
        possibly be "more". Got a skydrive? Faceplant is IN! Got an
        online bank account? Faceplant is IN! Got a web site you
        administer? Faceplant is in there too, they have gone five steps
        over the line and off the cliff, DITCH THEM OR IT WILL BE DOOM,
        FACEPLANT IS THE NSA WITH NO CHECK AND BALANCE WHATSOEVER.<br>
        <br>
        I hate to say it, but Facebook could probably even censor other
        web sites via that "cookie!" If they are that invasive, Facebook
        could do it ALL if they have THAT MUCH access to your computer.<br>
        <br>
        And this court case in Belgium is very real, it happened, this
        is not a guess, an uncle story, or any sort of fiction. Most
        likely the only way to make sure Facebook is gone for good is to
        wipe your hard drive and start over, and NEVER hit that site
        again or ever even click a "like" EVER AGAIN. I am confident
        Faceplant is way too filthy to get rid of just by "deleting
        cookies",<br>
        If they set something up that can get your phone numbers and log
        in data to other web sites and more just because you visited
        their site with no account at all, well, that is a hell of a lot
        more than just a cookie, that is the most virulent
        auto-installing malware on the planet and if they can install
        that type of program on your computer automatically without you
        knowing it, they can plant any "evidence" they want on your
        computer as well, NO IFS OR BUTS.<br>
        <br>
        And guess what? Google is a percentage of that evil. You see, if
        you get an android phone, Google continuously tracks your
        location and keeps the record permanently. And Google does hand
        the information over when asked. And Google has a fine habit of
        keeping track of android phone after android phone and linking
        the history as you change phones, and always has, as it turns
        out, everything since 2009 (the beginning of Android) has been
        permanently stored at Google, every phone number dialed, every
        place you ever went, everything you bought or scanned, ALL OF
        IT. Who needs the NSA? Google and Faceplant have done the job
        for them!...<b><br>

        Commission," the court noted.<br>
        <br>
        It also said the networking site uses a special cookie called
        "datr" that lodges on Internet users’ device to track their
        activities.<br>
        <br>
        Cookies are files that track whether a person has visited a
        website before, and inform the site itself.<br>
        <br>
        Datr provides Facebook with access to an amazing amount of
        user’s personal information, such as the Internet protocol (IP)
        address of the computer, browsing data, outside login
        information, phone numbers, and so on.<br>
        <br>
        The Belgian court also said “this is personal data, which
        Facebook can only use if the Internet user expressly gives their
        consent, as Belgian privacy law dictates."<br>
        <br>
        In response, Facebook said it would appeal against the decision,
        emphasizing that the cookie was safe.<br>
        <br>
        "We've used the datr cookie for more than five years to keep
        Facebook secure for 1.5 billion people around the world," the
        website’s spokesman said in a statement emailed to AFP.<b><br>

        <br>
        Movies such as 1987’s “Predator,” in which an alien who sees in
        the infrared hunts down Arnold Schwarzenegger and his team,
        introduced a generation of sci-fi fans to thermal imaging. Since
        then, heat-sensing devices have found many real-word
        applications but have remained relatively expensive and rigid.
        But a new development featuring graphene, reported in ACS’
        journal Nano Letters, could lead to a flexible, transparent and
        low-cost infrared vision system.<br>
        <br>
        The concept of humans — or aliens — having the power to see in
        the infrared to help fight enemies in the dark has been around
        for decades. Technology has allowed real-life military, police,
        firefighters and others to do their jobs successfully at night
        and in smoky conditions. It also helps manufacturers and
        building inspectors identify overheating equipment or circuits.
        But currently, many of these systems require cryogenic cooling
        to filter out background radiation, or “noise,” and create a
        reliable image. This approach, however, complicates the design
        of these imaging devices, and adds to the cost and the unit’s
        bulkiness. Tomás Palacios, Pablo Jarillo-Herrero and colleagues
        wanted to find a more practical solution.<br>
        <br>
        The researchers integrated graphene with silicon
        microelectromechanical systems (known as MEMS) to make their
        device. Testing showed it could be used to detect a person’s
        heat signature at room temperature without cryogenic cooling. In
        the future, advances could make the device even more versatile.
        The researchers say that a thermal sensor could be based on a
        single layer of graphene, which would make it transparent and
        flexible. Also, manufacturing could be simplified, which would
        bring costs down.<br>

        In this work, we leverage graphene’s unique tunable Seebeck
        coefficient for the demonstration of a graphene-based thermal
        imaging system. By integrating graphene based
        photothermo-electric detectors with micromachined silicon
        nitride membranes, we are able to achieve room temperature
        responsivities on the order of ∼7–9 V/W (at λ = 10.6 μm), with a
        time constant of ∼23 ms. The large responsivities, due to the
        combination of thermal isolation and broadband infrared
        absorption from the underlying SiN membrane, have enabled
        detection as well as stand-off imaging of an incoherent
        blackbody target (300–500 K). By comparing the fundamental
        achievable performance of these graphene-based thermopiles with
        standard thermocouple materials, we extrapolate that graphene’s
        high carrier mobility can enable improved performances with
        respect to two main figures of merit for infrared detectors:
        detectivity (&gt;8 × 108 cm Hz1/2 W–1) and noise equivalent
        temperature difference (&lt;100 mK). Furthermore, even average
        graphene carrier mobility (&lt;1000 cm2 V–1 s–1) is still
        sufficient to detect the emitted thermal radiation from a human
        target.<br>

              infinitely fast with new on-chip material</b></big><br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          <i>Researchers have designed the first on-chip metamaterial
            with a refractive index of zero, meaning that the phase of
            light can travel infinitely fast. </i><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        Electrons are so 20th century. In the 21st century, photonic
        devices, which use light to transport large amounts of
        information quickly, will enhance or even replace the electronic
        devices that are ubiquitous in our lives today. But there's a
        step needed before optical connections can be integrated into
        telecommunications systems and computers: researchers need to
        make it easier to manipulate light at the nanoscale.<br>
        <br>
        Researchers at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering
        and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have done just that, designing the
        first on-chip metamaterial with a refractive index of zero,
        meaning that the phase of light can travel infinitely fast.<br>
        <br>
        This new metamaterial was developed in the lab of Eric Mazur,
        the Balkanski Professor of Physics and Applied Physics and Area
        Dean for Applied Physics at SEAS, and is described in the
        journal Nature Photonics.<br>
        <br>
        "Light doesn't typically like to be squeezed or manipulated but
        this metamaterial permits you to manipulate light from one chip
        to another, to squeeze, bend, twist and reduce diameter of a
        beam from the macroscale to the nanoscale," said Mazur. "It's a
        remarkable new way to manipulate light."<br>
        <br>
        Although this infinitely high velocity sounds like it breaks the
        rule of relativity, it doesn't. Nothing in the universe travels
        faster than light carrying information -- Einstein is still
        right about that. But light has another speed, measured by how
        fast the crests of a wavelength move, known as phase velocity.
        This speed of light increases or decreases depending on the
        material it's moving through.<br>
        <br>
        When light passes through water, for example, its phase velocity
        is reduced as its wavelengths get squished together. Once it
        exits the water, its phase velocity increases again as its
        wavelength elongates. How much the crests of a light wave slow
        down in a material is expressed as a ratio called the refraction
        index -- the higher the index, the more the material interferes
        with the propagation of the wave crests of light. Water, for
        example, has a refraction index of about 1.3.<br>
        <br>
        When the refraction index is reduced to zero, really weird and
        interesting things start to happen.<br>
        <br>
        In a zero-index material, there is no phase advance, meaning
        light no longer behaves as a moving wave, traveling through
        space in a series of crests and troughs. Instead, the zero-index
        material creates a constant phase -- all crests or all troughs
        -- stretching out in infinitely long wavelengths. The crests and
        troughs oscillate only as a variable of time, not space.<br>
        <br>
        This uniform phase allows the light to be stretched or squished,
        twisted or turned, without losing energy. A zero-index material
        that fits on a chip could have exciting applications, especially
        in the world of quantum computing.<br>
        <br>
        "Integrated photonic circuits are hampered by weak and
        inefficient optical energy confinement in standard silicon
        waveguides," said Yang Li, a postdoctoral fellow in the Mazur
        Group and first author on the paper. "This zero-index
        metamaterial offers a solution for the confinement of
        electromagnetic energy in different waveguide configurations
        because its high internal phase velocity produces full
        transmission, regardless of how the material is configured."<br>
        <br>
        The metamaterial consists of silicon pillar arrays embedded in a
        polymer matrix and clad in gold film. It can couple to silicon
        waveguides to interface with standard integrated photonic
        components and chips.<br>
        <br>
        "In quantum optics, the lack of phase advance would allow
        quantum emitters in a zero-index cavity or waveguide to emit
        photons which are always in phase with one another," said Philip
        Munoz, a graduate student in the Mazur lab and co-author on the
        paper. "It could also improve entanglement between quantum bits,
        as incoming waves of light are effectively spread out and
        infinitely long, enabling even distant particles to be
        entangled."<br>
        <br>
        "This on-chip metamaterial opens the door to exploring the
        physics of zero index and its applications in integrated
        optics," said Mazur.<br>

        Metamaterials with a refractive index of zero exhibit physical
        properties such as infinite phase velocity and wavelength.
        However, there is no way to implement these materials on a
        photonic chip, restricting the investigation and application of
        zero-index phenomena to simple shapes and small scales. We
        designed and fabricated an on-chip integrated metamaterial with
        a refractive index of zero in the optical regime. Light refracts
        perpendicular to the facets of a prism made of this
        metamaterial, directly demonstrating that the index of
        refraction is zero. The metamaterial consists of
        low-aspect-ratio silicon pillar arrays embedded in a polymer
        matrix and clad by gold films. This structure can be fabricated
        using standard planar processes over a large area in arbitrary
        shapes and can efficiently couple to photonic integrated
        circuits and other optical elements. This novel on-chip
        metamaterial platform opens the door to exploring the physics of
        zero index and its applications in integrated optics.<br>

        A new material with micropores might be a way to fight climate
        change. Scientists have created crystals that capture carbon
        dioxide much more efficiently than previously known materials,
        even in the presence of water. The research was recently
        published in a report in the scientific journal Science.<br>
        <br>
        One way to mitigate climate change could be to capture carbon
        dioxide (CO2) from the air. So far this has been difficult,
        since the presence of water prevents the adsorption of CO2.
        Complete dehydration is a costly process. Scientists have now
        created a stable and recyclable material, where the micropores
        within the crystal have different adsorption sites for carbon
        dioxide and water.<br>
        <br>
        "As far as I know this is the first material that captures CO2
        in an efficient way in the presence of humidity. In other cases
        there is competition between water and carbon dioxide and water
        usually wins. This material adsorbs both, but the CO2 uptake is
        enormous," says Osamu Terasaki, Professor at the Department of
        Materials and Environmental Chemistry at Stockholm University.<br>
        <br>
        The new material is called SGU-29, named after Sogang University
        in Korea, and is the result of international cooperation. It is
        a copper silicate crystal. The material could be used for
        capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and especially to
        clean emissions.<br>
        <br>
        "CO2 is always produced with moisture, and now we can capture
        CO2 from humid gases. Combined with other systems that are being
        developed, the waste carbon can be used for new valuable
        compounds. People are working very hard and I think we will be
        able to do this within five years. The most difficult part is to
        capture carbon dioxide, and we have a solution for that now,"
        says Osamu Terasaki.<br>

        A Travel Air 2000 biplane made the world's first piloted flight
        under steam power over Oakland, California, on 12 April 1933.
        The strangest feature of the flight was its relative silence;
        spectators on the ground could hear the pilot when he called to
        them from mid-air. The aircraft, piloted by William Besler, had
        been fitted with a two-cylinder, 150 hp reciprocating engine.<br>

        <b>Comment :</b><br>
        <br>
        Nick Kelly -- My Dad Maurice A. Kelly (29/7/1931-3/8/2011) wrote
        a book 'STEAM IN THE AIR' all about Steam Aircraft. In fact
        quite large steam models were flying in 19th Century and there
        were a number of other steam aircraft built. The engine was a
        Doble Type as The Bessler Brothers (Who also owned The Davenport
        Locomotive Works) owned the rights to the Doble patents in the
        USA. Dad was always surprised that the idea was not developed
        for silent (espionage) uses. In fact the engine was later
        removed from the aircraft and fitted into a US Naval Picket
        Boat!<br>
        <br>
        An important contribution to its design was made by Nathan C.
        Price, a former Doble Steam Motors engineer.<br>
        Price was working on high pressure compact engines for rail and
        road transport; the purpose of the flight was to obtain
        publicity for this work. Following its unexpectedly favourable
        reception Price went to Boeing and worked on various aviation
        projects, but Boeing dropped the idea of a steam aeroengine in
        1936. Price later worked for Lockheed where his experience with
        developing compact burners for steam boilers helped to design
        Lockheed's first jet engine. <br>
        <br>
        The advantages of the "Besler System" that were claimed at the
        time included the elimination of audible noise and destructive
        vibration; greater efficiency at low engine speeds and also at
        high altitudes where lower air temperatures assisted
        condensation; reduced likelihood of engine failure; reduced
        maintenance costs; reduced fuel costs, since fuel oil was used
        in place of petrol; reduced fire hazard since the fuel was less
        volatile and operating temperatures were lower; and a lack of
        need for radio shielding.<br>
        <br>
        For capacities in excess of 1000 horse power a turbine captures
        the energy released by the expansion of steam more efficiently
        than a piston. Thus, the steam reciprocating engine turned out
        to be unsuitable for scaling up to the needs of large aircraft.<br>

        Some details on how to convert a weed eater or other 2 cycle
        engine over to steam. This video shows how to use an electric
        solenoid valve to input pulses of air or steam into the engine
        to drive it. It also shows how to construct a simple cam out of
        some plastic drain pipe and thick foam tape to create an
        eccentric cam to actuate a micro switch. You can get an engine
        from a local small engine repair shop for free, a micro switch
        at a local hardware or electronics store, and a solenoid valve
        for steam or just air from the supplier mentioned in the video.
        Later, we'll connect this engine to an alternator and begin
        making electricity in preparation for making a couple kilowatts
        of electricity to power the home or small business.<br>

        For years, scientists have been attempting to create such a
        weapon as part of Champ, or the Counter-electronics High-powered
        microwave Advanced Missile Project.<br>
        <br>
        Now, the US Air Force claims it has advanced the technology, and
        says it can deploy it using the stealthy Joint Air-to-Surface
        Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM).<br>
        <br>
        There are fears a well targeted attack could knock out multiple
        power stations. <br>
        <br>
        'This technology marks a new era in modern-day warfare,' said
        Keith Coleman, CHAMP program manager for Boeing Phantom Works. <br>
        <br>
        'In the near future, this technology may be used to render an
        enemy's electronic and data systems useless even before the
        first troops or aircraft arrive.'<br>
        <br>
        McAfee says this is a huge issue being ignored.<br>
        <br>
        He hit out at President Obama's focus on gun control.<br>
        <br>
        On 2 October, President Obama declared: 'Here's what you need to
        do: You have to make sure that anybody that you are voting for
        is on the right side of this issue.' <br>
        <br>
        If politicians oppose these measures, he continued, 'even if
        they're great on other stuff, you've got to vote against them.'
        <br>
        <br>
        McAfee said he was initially confused by the statement.<br>
        <br>
        'Frantically searching again for my benzodiazepines, and certain
        that rabid squirrels would imminently emerge from my wristwatch
        and form a tribunal accusing me of crimes against humanity, a
        saving thought flashed into my mind: What if the president is
        right? Could this simplification be the salvation of this
        long-suffering nation?'<br>
        <br>
        It could be the ultimate armour against cyberwarfare.<br>
        <br>
        A Utah firm has revealed a new, flexible material that can
        create a 'faraday cage' blocking all electronic transmissions.<br>
        <br>
        The material could even be used as wallpaper to protect entire
        rooms. <br>
        <br>
        He claims antidepressents could be to blame for the gun control
        issues. <br>
        <br>
        'In the 1980s we saw the first wide scale use of selective
        serotonin reuptake inhibitors (antidepressants), such as Prozac,
        Paxil and others.<br>
        <br>
        'Hundreds of studies have shown that these antidepressants have
        side effects that include violent thoughts. <br>
        <br>
        'A few minutes of research will tell us that 8% of the US
        population is taking antidepressants, yet a known 30% of all
        mass murderers since 1980 were taking antidepressants, and it is
        highly suspected that the real number approaches 90% – a
        statistical anomaly of egregious proportions.'<br>
        <br>
        'But it is much easier to disprove a cause (as we did with guns
        above) than it is to prove a cause.'<br>
        <br>
        'In any case, the President's proposal – that we abandon the
        complex process of weighing the near infinite issues that are
        important to us, and to choose a single issue upon which we can
        direct the entire future of our society, may well, in the
        confusion of my simple mind, be the Holy Grail of politics. <br>
        <br>
        'But if it is then surely weighing the possible deaths of 90% of
        our citizens due to cyber warfare against gun violence which
        causes fewer deaths per year than traffic accidents, seems that
        possibly our president is suffering an acid flashback rather
        than myself.'<br>
        <br>
        According to Foxtrot Alpha, the weapons are alsmost ready for
        use.<br>
        <br>
        Once integrated into JASSM, Champ will be a 'first day of war'
        standoff weapon it claims.<br>
        <br>
        Because it can be launched by both bombers and fighters,
        Lockheed's Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, or JASSM, is
        an ideal platform for Champ.<br>
        <br>
        'The capability is real … and the technology can be available
        today,' said Major General Thomas Masiello, the Air Force
        Research Laboratory.<br>
        <br>
        'That's an operational system already in our tactical air force'<br>
        <br>
        In 2012, aircraft manufacturer Boeing successfully tested the
        weapon on a one-hour flight during which it knocked out the
        computers of an entire military compound.<br>
        <br>
        During Boeing's experiment, the missile flew low over the Utah
        Test and Training Range, discharging electromagnetic pulses on
        to seven targets, permanently shutting down their electronics. <br>
        <br>
        Boeing said that the test was so successful even the camera
        recording it was disabled.<br>
        <br>
        Although the project is shrouded in secrecy, experts believe the
        missile is equipped with an electromagnetic pulse cannon.<br>
        <br>
        This uses a super-powerful microwave oven to generate a
        concentrated beam of energy which causes voltage surges in
        electronic equipment, rendering them useless before surge
        protectors have the chance to react.<br>

        first troops or aircraft arrive,' he said during the initial
        test.<br>
        <br>
        However, experts fear that the project could create an arms
        race, with countries scrambling to build their own
        electromagnetic pulse weapons.<br>
        <br>
        Professor Trevor Taylor, Professorial Fellow at the Royal United
        Services Institute, has previously said the Western world would
        be more vulnerable attack because of its increased reliance on
        electronics.<br>
        <br>
        'Should the US be known to have developed such a technology to
        the production stage, it would drive others to try to act
        similarly,' he said. <br>

        In a world desperate for a cultural shift that can offer us a
        future beyond the inevitable crash of consumer civilization,
        those who have a better vision and those who have the knowledge
        and skill to bring ideas into fruition are finding it easier
        than ever to connect and make amazing things happen.<br>
        <br>
        We have before us the great potential for the emergence of the
        ‘maker culture,’ a culture where communities make what they need
        out of what they already have, using ideas and plans developed,
        tested and shared freely via open source.<br>
        <br>
        Among the ranks of incredible people around the globe who are
        actively bringing about this kind of societal transformation is
        Marcin Jakubowski, a Polish born US immigrant who’s grand vision
        for the future of technology and local sovereignty is being
        built, right now, on a small Midwestern farm in the US.<br>
        <br>
        After earning a Ph.D. in fusion physics, he settled down on some
        acreage in rural Missouri to learn the more practical skill of
        farming. Now he’s become the mastermind of Open Source Ecology
        (OSE), a NGO and hive of engineers, architects, inovators,
        farmers, and forward thinking pioneers who are condensing 250+
        years of industrial knowledge into a single set of machines and
        tools that will allow individuals to accomplish industrial level
        infrastructure, machining, farming and energy projects on a
        small, local scale, using locally sourced and repurposed
        materials and biofuels. It’s called the Global Village
        Construction Set (GVCS).<br>

            ABSTRACT. This paper argues that at least one of the
            following propositions is true: (1) the human species is
            very likely to go extinct before reaching a “posthuman”
            stage; (2) any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely
            to run a significant number of simulations of their
            evolutionary history (or variations thereof); (3) we are
            almost certainly living in a computer simulation. It follows
            that the belief that there is a significant chance that we
            will one day become posthumans who run ancestor-simulations
            is false, unless we are currently living in a simulation. A
            number of other consequences of this result are also
            discussed.<br>

        Japan Times ( Nov 4, 2015 ) --&nbsp; [F]ormer Japanese
        ambassador to Switzerland, Mitsuhei Murata, recently proposed…
        for Japan to stage an “honorable retreat” from hosting the 2020
        Olympics… [I]n the September issue of Gekkan Nippon, Murata…
        noted the danger still posed by large numbers of spent fuel rods
        suspended in spent fuel pools in reactors 1, 2 and 3 [which]
        can’t be removed from the damaged reactor buildings due to the
        high levels of radioactivity surrounding these reactors…
        Murata’s gravest concern is a number of troubling indications of
        recurring criticality [ i.e. uncontrolled nuclear chain
        reactions] in one or more of the reactors at Fukushima No. 1.
        For example, he notes that in December 2014, both radioactive
        iodine-131 and tellurium-132 were reported as having been
        detected in Takasaki city, Gunma Prefecture [~130 miles SW of
        Fukushima Daiichi]. Given the short half-lives of these
        radioactive particles, their presence could not be the result of
        the original meltdowns at Fukushima.<br>

            effect</i><br>

        A team of physicists is claiming to have coaxed sparks from the
        vacuum of empty space1. If verified, the finding would be one of
        the most unusual experimental proofs of quantum mechanics in
        recent years and "a significant milestone", says John Pendry, a
        theoretical physicist at Imperial College London who was not
        involved in the study.<br>
        <br>
        The researchers, based at the Chalmers University of Technology
        in Gothenburg, Sweden, will present their findings early next
        week at a workshop in Padua, Italy. They have already posted a
        paper on the popular pre-print server arXiv.org, but have
        declined to talk to reporters because the work has not yet been
        peer-reviewed. High-profile journals, including Nature,
        discourage researchers from talking to the press until their
        findings are ready for publication.<br>
        <br>
        Nevertheless, scientists not directly connected with the group
        say that the result is impressive. "It is a major development,"
        says Federico Capasso, an experimental physicist at Harvard
        University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who has worked on
        similar quantum effects.<br>
        <br>
        At the heart of the experiment is one of the weirdest, and most
        important, tenets of quantum mechanics: the principle that empty
        space is anything but. Quantum theory predicts that a vacuum is
        actually a writhing foam of particles flitting in and out of
        existence.<br>
        <br>
        The existence of these particles is so fleeting that they are
        often described as virtual, yet they can have tangible effects.
        For example, if two mirrors are placed extremely close together,
        the kinds of virtual light particles, or photons, that can exist
        between them can be limited. The limit means that more virtual
        photons exist outside the mirrors than between them, creating a
        force that pushes the plates together. This 'Casimir force' is
        strong enough at short distances for scientists to physically
        measure it.<br>
        From virtual to real<br>
        <br>
        For decades, theorists have predicted that a similar effect can
        be produced in a single mirror that is moving very quickly.
        According to theory, a mirror can absorb energy from virtual
        photons onto its surface and then re-emit that energy as real
        photons. The effect only works when the mirror is moving through
        a vacuum at nearly the speed of light — which is almost
        impossible for everyday mechanical devices.<br>
        <br>
        Per Delsing, a physicist at the Chalmers University of
        Technology, and his colleagues circumvented this problem using a
        piece of quantum electronics known as a superconducting quantum
        interference device (SQUID), which is extraordinarily sensitive
        to magnetic fields.<br>
        <br>
        The team fashioned a superconducting circuit in which the SQUID
        effectively acted as a mirror. Passing a magnetic field through
        the SQUID moved the mirror slightly, and switching the direction
        of magnetic field several billion times per second caused it to
        'wiggle' at around 5% the speed of light, a speed great enough
        to see the effect.<br>
        <br>
        The result was a shower of microwave photons shaken loose from
        the vacuum, the team claims. The group's analysis shows that the
        frequency of the photons was roughly half the frequency at which
        they wiggled the mirror — as was predicted by quantum theory.<br>
        <br>
        Capasso calls the experiment "very clever". He doubts that the
        effect has any practical use because it doesn't generate large
        numbers of photons, but he considers it a nice demonstration of
        quantum mechanics. He still hopes to see a moving piece of metal
        generate detectable light from the vacuum, and believes that
        micromechanical systems may eventually be able to reach such
        speeds.<br>
        <br>
        Pendry says that the result, if it stands up, is bound to
        generate excitement. "Work in this area stirs considerable
        passion in the breasts of physicists." <br>

        One of the most surprising predictions of modern quantum theory
        is that the vacuum of space is not empty. In fact, quantum
        theory predicts that it teems with virtual particles flitting in
        and out of existence. While initially a curiosity, it was
        quickly realized that these vacuum fluctuations had measurable
        consequences, for instance producing the Lamb shift of atomic
        spectra and modifying the magnetic moment for the electron. This
        type of renormalization due to vacuum fluctuations is now
        central to our understanding of nature. However, these effects
        provide indirect evidence for the existence of vacuum
        fluctuations. From early on, it was discussed if it might
        instead be possible to more directly observe the virtual
        particles that compose the quantum vacuum. 40 years ago, Moore
        suggested that a mirror undergoing relativistic motion could
        convert virtual photons into directly observable real photons.
        This effect was later named the dynamical Casimir effect (DCE).
        Using a superconducting circuit, we have observed the DCE for
        the first time. The circuit consists of a coplanar transmission
        line with an electrical length that can be changed at a few
        percent of the speed of light. The length is changed by
        modulating the inductance of a superconducting quantum
        interference device (SQUID) at high frequencies (~11 GHz). In
        addition to observing the creation of real photons, we observe
        two-mode squeezing of the emitted radiation, which is a
        signature of the quantum character of the generation process. <br>

        "We have it under control".[1]<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        The people in the Gulf are in grave danger. The health reports,
        the geological reports and the weather reports are suggestive of
        one thing, the people of the Gulf are looking at greatly reduced
        lifespans. If they move now, they could mitigate some of the
        effects. The key word is some.<br>
        <br>
        From the scientific evidence that I have seen,&nbsp; if I lived
        in the Gulf, I would immediately leave to a safer location.<br>
        <br>
        [2]There are many quiet voices, fearing repraisal who say that
        the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, is still leaking oil. There are
        others, shrimp fisherman out of work, who are hired by BP to
        help with Corexit dispersal missions. Over five years after the
        accident, Corexit is still being sprayed at night by BP, for
        profit, and they are using people from the Gulf who have lost
        their incomes and need the work. They will speak privately, but
        are afraid to speak out for fear of losing their income. I have
        spoken with a half dozen over the last three years. These
        Corexit spraying missions are endangering the quality of the
        air, the water, the land and the food. The Gulf is catastrophe
        of Bibllical proportions waiting to consume millions with
        related health effects caused by Corexit. Originally, the EPA
        told BP, Nalco and Goldman Sachs that they could not use Corexit
        on the oil spill. BP gave the EPA the big middle finger.
        Further, as I covered 5 years ago, the Corexit does not disperse
        the oil, it submerges it into the water column. This sucks all
        the CO2 out of the water and has a devastating impact on the
        environment and the species inhabitating this environment.<br>
        <br>
        There were strong and early indications that the use of Corexit,
        combined with the leaking oil, were producing, both long term
        and short term, catastrophic environmental and individual
        health[3] effects. Oil and Corexit, used to “disperse” the oil
        spill have impacted untold numbers of Gulf residents’ health.
        Additionally, both the food supply[4] and the food chain are
        being adversely impacted. The air and the subsequent
        evapotranspiration cycle[5] has been irreversibly altered which,
        in turn, impacts the water table and the safety of water
        supplies[6] as well as the safety of crops. The most devastating
        finding relates the events of the oil spill to the phenomena of
        the ever-widening Louisiana sinkholes and the related
        underground explosions as well as the very high concentration of
        toxic and highly flammable methane in the air and in the water.<br>
        <br>
        One of the major threats to the Gulf Coast comes from an
        imperiled food supply which is the result from the explosion on
        the Deep Water Horizon oil rig.<br>
        <br>
        Dr. Wilma Subra, a MacAuthur (Genius) Award[7] winning
        chemist.who investigated the effects of corexit on humans very
        early on, stated that the corexit was “in the air, the water,
        and the food we consume”. Dr. Subra test many people in the Gulf
        and found Benzine levels at 65 times the level that one would
        expect. This speaks to the genocide that is coming to the Gulf
        with regard to the contraction of various cancers and other
        related diseases… “the health impacts that were and are
        continuing to be caused by the BP crude and dispersants. We have
        a very, very large and very, very sick population[8].”<br>
        <br>
        Corexit is banned in 17 countries. Because it is manufactured by
        NALCO, both BP and Goldman Sachs profit ad the people suffer….<br>

        <br>
        Mercury pollution is one of the most insidious problems in our
        environment. Today my colleagues and I at Flinders University
        have unveiled a new material than can scrub mercury from the
        environment, as a result of research to be published this week.
        The material – sulphur-limonene polysulphide – binds to mercury
        and changes colour, helping us see how effective it is.<br>
        <br>
        Mercury is a neurotoxin. Developing fetuses are most vulnerable
        and mercury poisoning can cause developmental delays in unborn
        babies.<br>
        <br>
        The primary pathway for mercury in people is through eating
        fish. Mercury accumulates in animals' tissues, so fish at the
        top of the food chain can contain high and potentially toxic
        levels. It can cause both chronic and acute effects in marine
        life. Pregnant women are recommended to avoid eating large
        amounts of certain types of fish.<br>
        <br>
        Since the Industrial Revolution humans have increased the
        concentration of mercury in the ocean by 10%, and the rate is
        increasing.<br>
        <br>
        The major sources of mercury in water in Australia are from
        water supply, manufacturing, mining, oil and gas extraction, and
        electricity generation.<br>
        <br>
        Our new material not only removes mercury from water and soil,
        but is created from industrial waste products. So our material
        effectively solves two problems: cleaning up pollution, and
        doing it sustainably.<br>
        <br>
        <b>When Life Gives You Limonene</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Sulphur-limonene polysulphide is a polymer or large molecule
        made, as the name suggests, from sulphur and limonene. Sulphur
        is the element known for smelling like rotten eggs when combined
        with hydrogen to produce hydrogen sulphide. Limonene is found in
        the oil of orange peel and other citrus fruits.<br>
        <br>
        Sulphur-limonene polysulphide. Justin Chalker, Author provided<br>
        <br>
        Both are waste products. The petroleum industry produces between
        60 million and 70 million tonnes of sulphur each year. There are
        literally mountains of sulphur lying around the globe, unused.<br>
        <br>
        The citrus industry produces more than 70 thousand tonnes of
        limonene each year. Finding a use for these materials is an
        important contribution to the preparation of sustainable
        materials.<br>
        <br>
        The vast majority of polymers (plastics, rubber, paints,
        coatings etc) are derived from finite supplies of petroleum.
        Identifying new sources is therefore critical for the
        sustainable production of polymers.<br>
        <br>
        In waste-valorisation, new uses are found for byproducts that
        are otherwise stockpiled as waste. Contributing to this goal,
        the new polymer in this research is made entirely from
        industrial byproducts sulphur and limonene – no other parts are
        required.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Cleaning Up Mercury</b><br>
        <br>
        At the outset of the project, we were primarily interested in
        making a new polymer from widely available and sustainable
        materials. There have been some recent reports on using sulphur
        and limonene as starting materials for very different types of
        polymers. We simply wanted to see if we could use both sulphur
        and limonene in the same polymer.<br>
        <br>
        The chemical merger of these two industrial byproducts proved
        remarkably easy. The real surprise came when we studied its
        behaviour in metal binding. Because the polymer has a high
        sulphur content, we anticipated it should have a high affinity
        for metals that bond to sulphur. This was indeed the case.<br>
        <br>
        Moreover, we found it could remove more than 50% of the mercury
        from water after only a single treatment. Subsequent treatments
        can be used to approach mercury levels suitable for drinking.<br>
        <br>
        While there are other materials that are very efficient at
        removing mercury from water, our material is unique in that it
        is far less expensive. Also, when the polysulphide is exposed to
        mercury, it changes colour. This colour-changing or chromogenic
        response was a very welcome surprise. We can use this property
        as a sensor for mercury.<br>
        <br>
        Sulfur-limonene polysulfide turns yellow when it binds to
        mercury (Hg)<br>
        <br>
        Our preliminary studies indicate that the sulphur-limonene
        polysulphide is not toxic. This is a critical finding if the
        polymer is to be used directly in natural ecosystems such as
        rivers, lakes and oceans.<br>
        <br>
        We are currently exploring commercialisation of the technology.
        These efforts are aimed at partnering with existing industries
        and environmental agencies to produce and use the material in
        large-scale remediation efforts. We are also weighing options
        for seeking investment for a startup company.<br>
        <br>
        Using the material in toxic waste clean-up may be a year or more
        away, but we are pursuing these efforts actively with a
        partnership between Flinders Partners (the commercialisation arm
        of Flinders University) and The University of Tulsa
        (collaborators in this research).<br>
        <br>
        We aim to use this material to remove mercury from groundwater
        and soil. We are also exploring its use as a component in water
        filters to ensure safe drinking water. More generally, we hope
        to inspire other scientists and engineers to develop novel and
        useful materials that address urgent challenges in
        sustainability.<br>

        Researchers at Flinders University have accidentally discovered
        a way to remove mercury from water using a material made from
        industrial waste and orange peel.<br>
        <br>
        Mercury is a dangerous pollutant that can damage food and water
        supplies, affect the human nervous systems and is especially
        poisonous for children.<br>
        <br>
        Synthetic chemist Dr Justin Chalker said his team initially set
        out to make a useful type of plastic or polymer made from
        something widely available.<br>
        <br>
        "We ended up settling on sulphur because it's produced in 70
        million tonnes per year by the petroleum industry as a
        by-product, so there are not very many uses for it, and limonene
        is produced in 70,000 tonnes per year and so it's relatively
        cheap," he said.<br>
        <br>
        "It literally grows on trees."<br>
        <br>
        The plastic-like substance they created is made entirely from
        sulphur and limonene, industrial waste products that are widely
        available but unused around the world.<br>
        <br>
        "We take sulphur, which is a by-product of the petroleum
        industry, and we take limonene, which is the main component of
        orange oil, so is produced in large quantities by the citrus
        industry, and we're able to react them together to form a type
        of soft red rubber, and what this material does is that it can
        grab mercury out of the water," Dr Chalker said.<br>

        University)<br>
        <br>
        "So we are taking waste material and making a polymer from it
        that can remove mercury from water."<br>
        <br>
        Because the material needed to make the polymer is so
        inexpensive, large quantities can be deployed at a site of
        contamination, in rivers, lakes and other waterways.<br>
        <br>
        "We've also done toxicity studies to make sure that the polymer
        itself is not harmful to the environment so that gives us hope
        that we'll be able to commercialise and actually use this in the
        environment," Dr Chalker said.<br>
        <br>
        The substance could be used to literally suck up mercury at
        sites where it is contaminating water.<br>
        <br>
        "We also are thinking about using it as a coating to line pipes
        and other devices that are used to transport water or it could
        be used as part of a water filtration device," Dr Chalker said.<br>
        <br>
        The substance changes colour when it comes into contact with and
        absorbs mercury, which means it could also be used to detect
        whether waterways are polluted.<br>
        New substance could help solve potentially fatal disorder<br>
        <br>
        Dr Jack Ng, who heads the risk assessment program for the
        Cooperative Research Centre for Contamination Assessment and
        Remediation of the Environment, said mercury's impact on humans
        could be devastating.<br>
        <br>
        "When you talk about organic form of mercury, this neurological
        disorder, high doses can be fatal... [it's] particularly a
        problem in younger generation children and its neurological
        disorders and that's a major concern," he said.<br>
        <br>
        Dr Ng sees big potential for this new substance.<br>
        <br>
        "From what the briefing describes it seems to be a promising
        product, typically for mercury in water or in aqueous form it
        can act with this polymer material," he said.<br>
        <br>
        Jon Miller, the managing director of environmental remediation
        company the Remediation Group, said there was a significant need
        for a solution to mercury contamination.<br>
        <br>
        "In particular there is a significant amount of mercury in
        bio-solids, which is the end product of sewerage treatment
        processes," Mr Miller said.<br>
        <br>
        "There are large stock piles of bio-solids that contain mercury
        certainly here in Melbourne and if there is a way of being able
        to remove the mercury then it could be used for either energy
        generation of agricultural applications.<br>
        <br>
        "So that comes to mind as being an obvious first starter if it
        can be proved that this process genuinely works."<br>
        <br>

        today in the German Chemical Society journal Angewandte Chemie

        The limited availability of petroleum resources and their
        escalating prices has led to an increase interest in the
        development of new platform chemicals from renewable resources.
        From the standpoint of cost and availability, fatty acid
        derivatives and (R)-(+)-limonene are among valuable renewable
        raw materials of great promise for polymer synthesis. Thus, we
        present a versatile and effective way to synthesize renewable
        diolefin and dithiols derived from (R)-(+)-limonene and/or fatty
        acid derivatives via thiol-ene addition. The monomers thus
        obtained have been characterized and their behavior in thermal
        or photochemical thiol-ene polyaddition have been investigated.
        Thus, through different combinations, (R)-(+)-limonene and fatty
        acid derivatives copolymers were prepared and their
        structure-thermal property relationships were studied. GPC
        results and intensive DSC analysis of the resulting polymers
        revealed that renewable polysulfides from amorphous to
        high-melting crystalline polymers with molecular weights up to
        31.8 kDa can be obtained. In addition, polysulfones were also
        prepared by oxidation of corresponding polysulfides with
        hydrogen peroxide solution. DSC analysis demonstrated an
        increase in thermal properties when the polysulfides are
        oxidized into polysulfones. Overall, the combination of
        (R)-(+)-limonene and fatty acid derived monomers might open an
        entry to new polymers derived from these renewable resources.<br>

        </b><b>Interview with Nikola Tesla from 1899</b><br>
        <br>
        Once, in 1899, Nikola Tesla had an interview with a certain
        journalist John Smith, when Tesla said “Everything is the
        Light“. In one of its rays is the fate of nations, each nation
        has its own ray in that great light source, which we see as the
        Sun. In this interview this greatest inventor and seer of modern
        time unravels a new vision of humanity which we, the light
        warriors of the first and the last hour have created a century
        later. A must read for every Ascended Master from the PAT.<br>
        <br>
        Part of this interview is dedicated to Tesla’s critics on
        Einstein’s theory of relativity that discards the ether as
        energy. I have proved in the new Theory of the Universal Law why
        Einstein’s theory of relativity is entirely wrong and why there
        is no vacuum (void), and that everything is energy. Thus I
        confirm Tesla’s ideas as expressed in this interview.<br>
        <br>
        George, May 7, 2015<br>
        <br>
        Journalist: Mr. Tesla, you have gained the glory of the man who
        got involved in the cosmic processes. Who are you, Mr. Tesla?<br>
        <br>
        <i>Tesla: It is a right question, Mr. Smith, and I will try to
          give you the right answer to it.</i><i><br>
        </i><i> </i><br>
        Journalist: Some say you’re from the country of Croatia, from
        the area called Lika, where together with the people are growing
        trees, rocks and starry sky. They say that your home village is
        named after the mountain flowers, and that the house, where you
        were born, is next to the forest and the church.<br>
        <br>
        <i>Tesla: Really, all it true. I’m proud of my Serbian origin
          and my Croatian homeland.</i><i><br>
        </i><i> </i><br>
        Journalist: Futurists say that the Twenty-and Twenty First
        Century was born in head of Nikola Tesla. They celebrate
        conversely magnetic field and sing hymns to Inductions engine.
        Their creator was called the hunter who caught the light in his
        net from the depths of the earth, and the warrior who captured
        fire from heaven. Father of alternating current will make the
        Physics and Chemistry dominate half the world. Industry will
        proclaim him as their supreme saint, a banker for the largest
        benefactors. In the laboratory of Nikola Tesla for the first
        time is broken atom.<br>
        <br>
        There is created a weapon that causes the earthquake vibrations.
        There are discovered black cosmic rays. Five races will pray to
        him in the Temple of the future, because they had taught a great
        secret that Empedocles elements can be watered with the life
        forces from the ethers.<br>
        <br>
        <i>Tesla: Yes, these are some of my most important discoveries.
          I’m a defeated man. I have not accomplished the greatest thing
          I could.</i><br>
        <br>
        Journalist: What is it, Mr. Tesla?<br>
        <br>
        <i>Tesla: I wanted to illuminate the whole earth. There is
          enough electricity to become a second sun. Light would appear
          around the equator, as a ring around Saturn.</i><i><br>
        </i><i> </i><i><br>
        </i><i> Mankind is not ready for the great and good. In Colorado
          Springs I soaked the earth by electricity. Also we can water
          the other energies, such as positive mental energy. They are
          in the music of Bach or Mozart, or in the verses of great
          poets. In the Earth’s interior, there are energy of Joy, Peace
          and Love. Their expressions are a flower that grows from the
          Earth, the food we get out of her and everything that makes
          man’s homeland. I’ve spent years looking for the way that this
          energy could influence people. The beauty and the scent of
          roses can be used as a medicine and the sun rays as a food.</i><i><br>
        </i><i> </i><i><br>
        </i><i> Life has an infinite number of forms, and the duty of
          scientists is to find them in every form of matter. Three
          things are essential in this. All that I do is a search for
          them. I know I will not find them, but I will not give up on
          them.</i><br>
        <br>
        Journalist: What are these things?<br>
        <br>
        <i>Tesla: One issue is food. What a stellar or terrestrial
          energy to feed the hungry on Earth? With what wine watered all
          thirsty, so that they can cheer in their heart and understand
          that they are Gods?</i><i><br>
        </i><i> </i><i><br>
        </i><i> Another thing is to destroy the power of evil and
          suffering in which man’s life passes! They sometimes occur as
          an epidemic in the depths of space. In this century, the
          disease had spread from Earth in the Universe.</i><i><br>
        </i><i> </i><i><br>
        </i><i> The third thing is: Is there an excess Light in the
          Universe? I discovered a star that by all the astronomical and
          mathematical laws could disappear, and that nothing seems to
          be modified. This star is in this galaxy. Its light can occur
          in such density that fits into a sphere smaller than an apple,
          a heavier than our Solar System. Religions and philosophies
          teach that man can become the Christ, Buddha and Zoroaster.
          What I’m trying to prove is wilder, and almost unattainable.
          This is what to do in the Universe so every being is born as
          Christ, Buddha or Zoroaster.</i><i><br>
        </i><i> </i><i><br>
        </i><i> I know that gravity is prone to everything you need to
          fly and my intention is not to make flying devices (aircraft
          or missiles), but teach individual to regain consciousness on
          his own wings … Further; I am trying to awake the energy
          contained in the air. There are the main sources of energy.
          What is considered as empty space is just a manifestation of
          matter that is not awakened.</i><i><br>
        </i><i> </i><i><br>
        </i><i> No empty space on this planet, nor in the Universe.. In
          black holes, what astronomers talk about, are the most
          powerful sources of energy and life.</i><br>
        <br>
        Journalist: On the window of your room in hotel
        “Valdorf-Astoria”, on the thirty-third floor, every morning, the
        birds arrive.<br>
        <br>
        <i>Tesla: A man must be sentimental towards the birds. This is
          because of their wings. Human had them once, the real and
          visible!</i><br>
        <br>
        Journalist: You have not stopped flying since those distant days
        in Smiljan!<br>
        <br>
        <i>Tesla: I wanted to fly from the roof and I fell: Children’s
          calculations could be wrong. Remember, the youth wings have
          everything in life!</i><br>
        <br>
        Journalist: Have you ever married? It is not known that you have
        affection for love or for a woman. Photos from the youth show
        you were handsome man.<br>
        <i><br>
        </i><i> Tesla: Yes. I did not. There are two views: a lot
          affection or not at all. The center serves to rejuvenate human
          race. Women for certain people nurtures and strengthen its
          vitality and spirit. Being single does the same to other
          people. I chose that second path.</i><i><br>
        </i><i> </i><br>
        Journalist: Your admirers are complaining that you attacking
        relativity. The strange is your assertion that the matter has no
        energy. Everything is imbued with energy, where it is?<br>
        <br>
        <i>Tesla: First was energy, then matter.</i><br>
        <br>
        Journalist: Mr. Tesla, it’s like when you said that you were
        born by your father, and not on you.<br>
        <br>
        <i>Tesla: Exactly! What about the birth of the Universe? Matter
          is created from the original and eternal energy that we know
          as Light .It shone, and there have been appear star, the
          planets, man, and everything on the Earth and in the Universe.
          Matter is an expression of infinite forms of Light, because
          energy is older than it. There are four laws of Creation. The
          first is that the source of all the baffling, dark plot that
          the mind cannot conceive, or mathematics measure. In that plot
          fit the whole Universe.</i><i><br>
        </i><i> </i><i><br>
        </i><i> The second law is spreading a darkness, which is the
          true nature of Light, from the inexplicable and it’s
          transformed into the Light. The third law is the necessity of
          the Light to become a matter of Light. The fourth law is: no
          beginning and no end; three previous laws always take place
          and the Creation is eternal.</i><br>
        <br>
        Journalist: In the hostility to the theory of relativity you go
        so far, that you hold lectures against its Creator at your
        birthday parties..<br>
        <br>
        <i>Tesla: Remember, it is not curved space, but the human mind
          which cannot comprehend infinity and eternity! If relativity
          has been clearly understood by its Creator, he would gain
          immortality, even yet physically, if he is pleased.</i><i><br>
        </i><i> </i><i><br>
        </i><i> I am part of a light, and it is the music. The Light
          fills my six senses: I see it, hear, feel, smell, touch and
          think. Thinking of it means my sixth sense. Particles of Light
          are written note. O bolt of lightning can be an entire sonata.
          A thousand balls of lightning is a concert.. For this concert
          I have created a Ball Lightning, which can be heard on the icy
          peaks of the Himalayas. About Pythagoras and mathematics a
          scientist may not and must not infringe of these two. Numbers
          and equations are signs that mark the music of the spheres. If
          Einstein had heard these sounds,&nbsp;&nbsp; he would not
          create theories of relativity. These sounds are the messages
          to the mind that life has meaning, that the Universe exists in
          perfect harmony, and its beauty is the cause and effect of
          Creation. This music is the eternal cycle of stellar heavens.</i><i><br>
        </i><i> </i><i><br>
        </i><i> The smallest star has completed composition and also,
          part of the celestial symphony. The man’s heartbeats are part
          of the symphony on the Earth. Newton learned that the secret
          is in geometric arrangement and motion of celestial bodies. He
          recognized that the supreme law of harmony exists in the
          Universe. The curved space is chaos, chaos is not music.
          Einstein is the messenger of the time of sound and fury.</i><br>
        <br>
        Journalist: Mr. Tesla, do you hear that music?<br>
        <br>
        <i>Tesla: I hear it all the time. My spiritual ear is as big as
          the sky we see above us. My natural ear I increased by the
          radar. According to the Theory of Relativity, two parallel
          lines will meet in infinity. By that Einstein’s curved will
          straighten. Once created, the sound lasts forever. For a man
          it can vanish, but continues to exist in the silence that is
          man’s greatest power.</i><i><br>
        </i><i> </i><i><br>
        </i><i> No, I have nothing against Mr. Einstein. He is a kind
          person and has done many good things, some of which will
          become part of the music. I will write to him and try to
          explain that the ether exists, and that its particles are what
          keep the Universe in harmony, and the life in eternity. </i><br>
        <br>
        Journalist: Tell me, please, under what conditions Angel adopt
        on the Earth?<br>
        <br>
        <i>Tesla: I have ten of them. Keep good records vigilant.</i><br>
        <br>
        Journalist: I will document all your words, Dear Mr. Tesla.<br>
        <br>
        <i>Tesla: The first requirement is a high awareness of its
          mission and work to be done. It must, if only dimly, exist in
          the early days. Let us not be falsely modest; Oak knows that
          it is oak tree, a bush beside him being a bush. When I was
          twelve, I have been sure I will get to Niagara Falls. For most
          of my discoveries I knew in my childhood that I will achieve
          them, although not entirely apparent … The second condition to
          adapt is determination. All that I might, I finished.</i><br>
        <br>
        Journalist: What is the third condition of adjustment, Mr.
        Tesla?<br>
        <br>
        <i>Tesla: Guidance for all the vital and spiritual energies in
          labor. Therefore purification of the many effects and needs
          that man has. I therefore have not lost anything, but just
          gained.</i><i><br>
        </i><i> </i><i><br>
        </i><i> So I enjoyed every day and night. Write down: Nikola
          Tesla was a happy man… The fourth requirement is to adjust the
          physical assembly with a work.</i><br>
        <br>
        Journalist: What do you mean, Mr. Tesla?<br>
        <br>
        <i>Tesla: First, the maintenance of the assembly. Man’s body is
          a perfect machine. I know my circuit and what’s good for him.
          Food what nearly all people eat, to me it is harmful and
          dangerous. Sometimes I visualize that chefs in the world are
          all in conspiracy against me … Touch my hand.</i><br>
        <br>
        Journalist: It was cold.<br>
        <br>
        <i>Tesla: Yes. Bloodstream can be controlled, and many processes
          in and around us. Why are you frightened young man?</i><br>
        <br>
        Journalist: It’s a story that Mark Twain wrote a mysterious
        stranger, that wonderful book of Satan, inspired by you.<br>
        <br>
        <i>Tesla: The word “Lucifer” is more charming. Mr. Twain likes

          cried. We became friends and he often came to my lab. Once he
          requested to show him a machine that by vibration provokes a

          sleep, to fell asleep and wake up in the time which I have

          picking what is required at a given moment. This is all around

          related to a deep and wonderful relationship: man and the

              cotton, tampons, gauze pads, swabs</b><br>
          </big><br>

            Erin Gallagher</b><br>

        <br>
        A team of Argentine scientists found traces of glyphosate in 85%
        of personal care and feminine hygiene products containing cotton
        and commonly purchased in drugstores and supermarkets.<br>
        <br>
        The research was conducted by a multidisciplinary team from the
        National University of La Plata and was presented at the Third
        National Congress of Doctors of Fumigated Peoples.<br>
        <br>
        Glyphosate was found in 85% of the products containing cotton
        bought in pharmacies and supermarkets including feminine care
        products like tampons and sanitary pads, sterile gauze pads,
        cotton swabs and wipes. A report published in March 2015 by the
        International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) under the
        World Health Organization (WHO) classified the potent herbicide
        as “probably carcinogenic.”<br>
        <br>
        The results of the preliminary study were presented by doctor
        Damián Marino from Espacio Multidisciplinario de Interacción
        Socioambiental (Emisa) of the University of La Plata last
        weekend.<br>
        <br>
        The study looked at a sampling of products from pharmacies and
        supermarkets in the area of La Plata, and analyzed cotton swabs,
        gauze and articles for feminine use. The results from all
        commercial products detected 85% glyphosate and 62% AMPA
        (metabolite or derivative of glyphosate).<br>
        <br>
        Almost 100% of the cotton produced in Argentina is transgenic
        and glyphosate applications are made while the cocoon is open.<br>
        <br>
        “We are starting the process to see what other herbicides are
        found,” Marino said in his presentation.<br>
        <br>
        “The report left us shocked,” said Dr. Medardo Ávila Vázquez, a
        conference participant and from Cordoba.<br>
        <br>
        “We had focused our attention on the presence of glyphosate in
        food, but did not think the products we use in all hospitals and
        health centers in the country to cure patients are contaminated
        with a carcinogenic product. The authorities must give an
        immediate response to this situation.”<br>
        <br>
        The research team from National University of La Plata headed by
        Damián Marino conducted a previous study on fruits and
        vegetables and found that 8 out of 10 contained pesticides. The
        study analyzed 60 samples of fruits and vegetables and found
        that 76.6% had at least one chemical and 27.7% of the samples
        had between three and five agrochemicals.<br>
        <br>
        “The variety of pesticides is extensive. And the cocktail of
        chemicals is very strong, ” said Damián Marino. Among the
        products that were tested in the previous study they also found
        the insecticide endosulfan which has been banned in Argentina
        since 2013.<br>
        <br>
        Marino analyzed: “If pesticides – according to the previous
        study by our team – are in almost 80% of samples of fruits and
        vegetables and in addition are in at least 85% of the samples of
        daily consumer health products we reviewed, this is not just an
        issue “of fumigated villages,” it is a a public health issue, a
        matter serious enough for the authorities to get involved,” he
        said.<br>

          <i>System that replaces human intuition with algorithms
            outperforms 615 of 906 human teams.</i><br>

        Big-data analysis consists of searching for buried patterns that
        have some kind of predictive power. But choosing which
        “features” of the data to analyze usually requires some human
        intuition. In a database containing, say, the beginning and end
        dates of various sales promotions and weekly profits, the
        crucial data may not be the dates themselves but the spans
        between them, or not the total profits but the averages across
        those spans.<br>
        <br>
        MIT researchers aim to take the human element out of big-data
        analysis, with a new system that not only searches for patterns
        but designs the feature set, too. To test the first prototype of
        their system, they enrolled it in three data science
        competitions, in which it competed against human teams to find
        predictive patterns in unfamiliar data sets. Of the 906 teams
        participating in the three competitions, the researchers’ “Data
        Science Machine” finished ahead of 615.<br>
        <br>
        In two of the three competitions, the predictions made by the
        Data Science Machine were 94 percent and 96 percent as accurate
        as the winning submissions. In the third, the figure was a more
        modest 87 percent. But where the teams of humans typically
        labored over their prediction algorithms for months, the Data
        Science Machine took somewhere between two and 12 hours to
        produce each of its entries.<br>
        <br>
        “We view the Data Science Machine as a natural complement to
        human intelligence,” says Max Kanter, whose MIT master’s thesis
        in computer science is the basis of the Data Science Machine.
        “There’s so much data out there to be analyzed. And right now
        it’s just sitting there not doing anything. So maybe we can come
        up with a solution that will at least get us started on it, at
        least get us moving.”<br>
        <br>
        <b>Between the lines</b><br>
        <br>
        Kanter and his thesis advisor, Kalyan Veeramachaneni, a research
        scientist at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence
        Laboratory (CSAIL), describe the Data Science Machine in a paper
        that Kanter will present next week at the IEEE International
        Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics.<br>
        <br>
        Veeramachaneni co-leads the Anyscale Learning for All group at
        CSAIL, which applies machine-learning techniques to practical
        problems in big-data analysis, such as determining the
        power-generation capacity of wind-farm sites or predicting which
        students are at risk for dropping out of online courses.<br>
        <br>
        “What we observed from our experience solving a number of data
        science problems for industry is that one of the very critical
        steps is called feature engineering,” Veeramachaneni says. “The
        first thing you have to do is identify what variables to extract
        from the database or compose, and for that, you have to come up
        with a lot of ideas.”<br>
        <br>
        In predicting dropout, for instance, two crucial indicators
        proved to be how long before a deadline a student begins working
        on a problem set and how much time the student spends on the
        course website relative to his or her classmates. MIT’s
        online-learning platform MITx doesn’t record either of those
        statistics, but it does collect data from which they can be
        inferred.<br>
        <br>
        Kanter and Veeramachaneni use a couple of tricks to manufacture
        candidate features for data analyses. One is to exploit
        structural relationships inherent in database design. Databases
        typically store different types of data in different tables,
        indicating the correlations between them using numerical
        identifiers. The Data Science Machine tracks these correlations,
        using them as a cue to feature construction.<br>
        <br>
        For instance, one table might list retail items and their costs;
        another might list items included in individual customers’
        purchases. The Data Science Machine would begin by importing
        costs from the first table into the second. Then, taking its cue
        from the association of several different items in the second
        table with the same purchase number, it would execute a suite of
        operations to generate candidate features: total cost per order,
        average cost per order, minimum cost per order, and so on. As
        numerical identifiers proliferate across tables, the Data
        Science Machine layers operations on top of each other, finding
        minima of averages, averages of sums, and so on.<br>
        <br>
        It also looks for so-called categorical data, which appear to be
        restricted to a limited range of values, such as days of the
        week or brand names. It then generates further feature
        candidates by dividing up existing features across categories.<br>
        <br>
        Once it’s produced an array of candidates, it reduces their
        number by identifying those whose values seem to be correlated.
        Then it starts testing its reduced set of features on sample
        data, recombining them in different ways to optimize the
        accuracy of the predictions they yield.<br>
        <br>
        “The Data Science Machine is one of those unbelievable projects
        where applying cutting-edge research to solve practical problems
        opens an entirely new way of looking at the problem,” says Margo
        Seltzer, a professor of computer science at Harvard University
        who was not involved in the work. “I think what they’ve done is
        going to become the standard quickly — very quickly.”<br>

        The earthquake swarms in one San Francisco Bay Area city keeps
        rising, and according to the US Geological Center’s past
        historical data, has shattered all previous old records. As of
        Wednesday, the USGS noted that San Ramon, about 45 miles from
        San Francisco had experienced 446 quakes, including 86 quakes
        that were a magnitude of 2.0 or higher, since Oct. 13. A total
        of 28 earthquakes have been documented alone since Tuesday. San
        Ramon had previously set a record in 2003 when a swarm of 120
        earthquakes struck there over 31 days.<br>

        China's plans for 400 nuclear reactors threaten global
        catastrophe, writes Oliver Tickell. In the normal way of things
        we could expect major accidents every few years, but with 300
        reactors along China's seismically active coast, a major tsunami
        would be a Fukushima on steroids - wiping out much of China and
        contaminating the whole planet...<br>

        Human skin contains unique microstructures and sensory
        receptors. Researchers have mimicked these structures in an
        electronic film <br>
        The grooved surface is made from plastic and graphene oxide and
        can detect touch and temperature using electric charges<br>
        It is so sensitive it can detect the weight of a human hair
        being placed on it <br>

        A company that uses genomic analysis technology to derive the
        contents of food has found a disturbing “additive” in some of
        the hot dogs they tested- human DNA.<br>
        <br>
        Clear Food chalks up the find, in 2 percent of the 345 hot dogs
        and sausages tested, to hygienic issues.<br>
        <br>
        Overall, the company said it found that 14.4 percent of hot dogs
        were problematic in some way…<br>
        <br>
        The company analyzed 345 hot dog and sausage products from 75
        brands and 10 retailers, and said they found “human DNA in 2% of
        the samples, and in 2/3rds of the vegetarian samples.” ...<br>

        </div>
        <b> </b><br>
        In the 1920s, the Apache elder Stalking Wolf, who was the mentor
        of master tracker Tom Brown, Jr., received this horrid vision of
        the self-destruction of white men in North America. Only one
        sign remains to be fulfilled before the Purification begins: <br>
        <br>
        "There will be a great famine throughout the world, like man
        cannot imagine. Waters will run vile, the poisons of man’s sins
        running strong in the waters of the soils, lakes and rivers.
        Crops will fail, the animals of man will die, and diseases will
        kill the masses. The grandchildren will feed upon the remains of
        the dead, and all about will be the cries of pain and anguish.
        Roving bands of men will hunt and kill other men for food, and
        water will always be scarce, getting scarcer with each passing
        year. The land, the water, the sky will all be poisoned, and man
        will live in the wrath of the Creator. Men will hide at first in
        the cities, but there he will die. A few will run to the
        wilderness, but the wilderness will destroy them, for they had
        long ago been given a choice. Man will be destroyed, his cities
        in ruin, and it is then that the grandchildren will pay for the
        sins of their grandfathers and grandmothers...<br>

        </b><b>"TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I GOT THE JEW CALL."</b><br>
        <br>
        Senator Al Franken admits in his book, Lies and the Lying Liars
        Who Tell Them (2003), that he received a call from the former
        mayor of New York, Ed Koch, warning him not to go to his office
        in the World Trade Center on 9-11, using the Hebrew calendar as
        a reference for the date, which was September 11, 2001.<br>
        <br>
        Franken refers to this warning call as the "Jew call."<br>
        <br>
        "Al", he told me, "don't go to work on the twenty-third day of
        Elul."<br>
        <br>
        Al Franken may have been a comedian who went to Washington, but
        this is not funny. Being forewarned about 9-11 is a criminal
        matter...<br>

              Every Icelander To Get Paid In Bank Sale</b></big><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        First, Iceland jailed its crooked bankers for their direct
        involvement in the financial crisis of 2008. Now, every
        Icelander will receive a payout for the sale of one of its three
        largest banks, Íslandsbanki.<br>
        <br>
        If Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson has his way — and he
        likely will — Icelanders will be paid kr 30,000 after the
        government takes over ownership of the bank. Íslandsbanki would
        be second of the three largest banks under State proprietorship.<br>
        <br>
        “I am saying that the government take [sic] some decided
        portion, 5%, and simply hand it over to the people of this
        country,” he stated. Because Icelanders took control of their
        government, they effectively own the banks. Benediktsson
        believes this will bring foreign capital into the country and
        ultimately fuel the economy — which, incidentally, remains the
        only European nation to recover fully from the 2008 crisis.
        Iceland even managed to pay its outstanding debt to the IMF in
        full — in advance of the due date. …<br>

        <br>
        Talk show host, Dan Cofall, recently asked me a question that
        many readers have also asked.<br>
        <br>
        Why would Obama allow Russian soldiers into the country during a
        period of time that World War III seems like a certainty and
        Obama seems to be preparing to go to war with the Russians?<br>
        <br>
        I agree that that on the surface, this seems like a gross
        contradiction in facts, unless of course, one considers that
        Obama is a traitor to the American people and is an active
        participant in the demise of the United States. This notion gets
        legs when one considers that Obama is scaling down the American
        miliary to pre-World War II levels at the precise time that
        America should be beefing up its defenses in preparation for war
        that will likely kick off in Syria. In short, Obama is playing
        for the other team. His objective of fundamentally transforming
        America, includes throwing the United States of America to the
        wolves. He is the modern day manifestation of Benedict Arnold.<br>
        <br>
        We do not even know who Obama is. Who was his high school
        English teacher? Who was his basketball coach. Who did he take
        to the prom? We knew nothing about this Manchurian candidate,
        yet, we elected him to be the President? Why was his mother
        working Tim Geithner’s father at the CIA PSYOPS Ford Foundation
        which was associated with MK-Ultra? The answer is simple, he is
        stunning example of a modern day Manchurian candidate. His
        CIA-created family cannot hide who he really is…<br>

        The next war could easily be over before it starts. Short of a

        strategy, there is nothing that the United States can do, short
        of a prolonged civilian led conflict, led by armed veterans, to
        stave off invasion and occupation. There will be no warning of
        the coming invasion. This article covers the eight ways will
        America will die in a single night.<br>

        Liberty is a right of doing whatever the laws permit, and if a
        citizen could do what they forbid he would no longer be

        <b>Tommy Jefferson</b> : “ The spirit of the times may alter,
        will alter. Our rulers will become corrupt, our people careless.
        A single zealot may become persecutor, and better men be his
        victims. It can never be too often repeated that the time for
        fixing every essential right, on a legal basis, is while our
        rulers are honest, ourselves united. From the conclusion of this
        war we shall be going down hill. It will not then be necessary
        to resort every moment to the people for support. They will be
        forgotten, therefore, and their rights disregarded. They will
        forget themselves in the sole faculty of making money, and will
        never think of uniting to effect a due respect for their rights.
        The shackles, therefore, which shall not be knocked off at the

        Iceland recently jailed its 26th banker, totaling over 74 years
        of prison time among the 26 criminals. These banksters were
        jailed for causing the financial meltdown of Iceland.
        Conversely, the U.S. bankster criminals on Wall Street were
        rewarded for their fraud and market manipulation with an
        gigantic set of ongoing bailouts as the taxpayers of the country
        were financially raped.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Iceland : The World’s Center of Democracy </b><b><br>
        </b><b><br>
        </b><b>Last Man Standing</b><br>
        <br>
        Iceland remains the only European nation to recover fully from
        the 2008 crisis. Iceland even managed to pay its outstanding
        debt to the IMF in full, and the debt was paid in advance of the
        due date. This is highly significant because this means the Bank
        of International Settlements has absolutely no hold on Iceland
        and its banking system. Conversely, the banks in the United
        States are so manipulated by the Bank of International
        Settlements that the US stands of on the brink of the next
        bankster-created war which will be fought and lost against
        Russia and China.<br>
        <br>
        Once upon a time, America nearly had her Icelandic moment. Just
        over 50 years ago, America nearly achieved independence from
        bankster influence. But as fate would have it, a fatal head shot
        from the grassy knoll, from a gun fired by Lucian Sarti who used
        hollow point bullets, ended America’s hope of true economic and
        political sovereignty in 1963.<br>
        <br>
        <b>A Speech for the Ages</b><br>
        <br>
        In June of 1963, JFK called out the elitist bankster war mongers
        in his famous American University speech. Unfortunately, JFK’s
        enlightened attitude was a threat to the prevailing
        establishment and he paid for his idealism with his life five
        months after delivering the American University Commencement
        speech.<br>
        <br>
        We had never seen a President championing the virtues of peace
        and the elevation of the concern for the common man. We will not
        likely ever see this kind of leadership again. The following
        excerpts of JFK’s American University speech show us what could
        have been and why the elite could not handle four more years of
        a JFK Presidency. For if JFK had lived, the following ideals
        would have formed the goals of an energized nation.<br>
        <br>
        Here are the words of a young, idealistic President as spoken at
        American University in June of 1963:<br>
        <br>
        “…So, let us not be blind to our differences–but let us also
        direct attention to our common interests and to the means by
        which those differences can be resolved. And if we cannot end
        now our differences, at least we can help make the world safe
        for diversity. For, in the final analysis, our most basic common
        link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe
        the same air. We all cherish our children’s future. And we are
        all mortal…<br>
        <br>
        …First: Chairman Khrushchev, Prime Minister Macmillan, and I
        have agreed that high-level discussions will shortly begin in
        Moscow looking toward early agreement on a comprehensive test
        ban treaty. Our hopes must be tempered with the caution of
        history–but with our hopes go the hopes of all mankind… <br>
        <br>
        …Confident and unafraid, we labor on–not toward a strategy of
        annihilation but toward a strategy of peace…”<br>
        <br>
        Can’t live in a world of peace, the banksters would not make as
        much money. JFK had to go.<br>
        <br>
        <b>If JFK Had Lived</b><br>
        <br>
        If JFK had lived, so too, would have 58,000 Americans and untold
        millions of Vietnamese. If JFK had lived, we would not have
        spent two trillion dollars on nuclear arms. The money could have
        been spent, as JFK suggested, on education. America might not
        have become the hopelessly dumbed down nation that it has
        become. If JFK had lived the Federal Reserve would have
        eventually gone the way of the two previous central banks in the
        United States. The US Congress would have retaken the
        constitutional power of coining money, interest free money.
        America would have remained solvent.<br>
        <br>
        If JFK had lived, he would have continued to confront the oil
        companies and today, we might have achieved energy independence
        and could be paying about a buck for a gallon if gas. Alaska
        would be the new Middle East and the petrodollar, which
        threatens to plunge us into a world war over Syria and Iran,
        would no longer be a problem. The world would be coming to the
        US for its energy needs and our economy would be booming.<br>
        <br>
        If JFK had lived, the people would have had their true
        representative in the White House. It was the last time, that
        anyone, outside the elite establishment, had anyone in top level
        government that cared for them.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Conclusion</b><br>
        <br>
        The day that John Kennedy died, November 22, 1963, was the
        beginning of the end for America. These same forces, the
        interlocking directorates of the military industrial complex,
        the Federal Reserve, the major oil companies and the media that
        they control, continued to suck the life out of America to the
        point of where we stand today, a shell of our former country.
        November, 22, 1963, was the day the America lost her chance to
        become like modern day Iceland where we would have jailed
        criminal banksters instead of allowing ourselves to be enslaved
        by them.<br>

        [Germany—the country at the center of the European Union and its
        economic powerhouse—is something of a black hole. 70 years after
        the fall of Nazism, it is still an occupied country, under
        military and political domination of the US. The national press,
        popularly referred to as Lügenpresse (the lying press)
        faithfully echoes the party line set in Washington. Germany's
        spineless politicians, popularly renamed from Volksvertreter
        (people's representatives) to Volksverräter (traitors to the
        people) are no better. And so we are unable to see what is
        actually happening there, as the European Union is, in the words
        of Russia's FM Sergei Lavrov, “committing suicide” by letting in
        the invading hordes from the Middle East. And so this short
        report by Alex, who tells us what he sees, is most welcome.]<br>
        <br>
        Do you remember the last time you saw a man with wild eyes,
        strange clothes and a giant sign around his neck saying “The End
        Is Nigh”? “How ridiculous and pathetic!” you might have thought.
        Now, imagine the reality of your country changing within weeks
        to a point where you come to the same conclusion as him,
        suddenly feeling that his approach might be ever so reasonable.
        When a large part of your fellow-humans catch a strange sort of
        illness, one which leads to complete insanity faster than in the
        worst zombie outbreak, you might find yourself out of more
        viable strategies.<br>
        <br>
        This exactly is happening to me, as well as most people I know,
        right now, right here in our export-champion, model-democracy
        Germany. Sane people are finding themselves isolated and
        helpless amid insane politicians, an antagonistic press,
        paralyzed communities and a large inert populace unable to even
        fathom what’s happening. I am of course talking about the
        so-called “refugee crisis,” but because even this name is
        working against us, I will call it what it really is—a war
        against Europe by means of invasion. It is now vitally important
        to call things by their right name, because this distinguishes
        friend from foe.<br>
        <br>
        But it is even more important is to understand why this is a war
        rather than a crisis caused by refugees. Everything about this
        development bears the hallmarks of a military/intelligence
        operation.<br>
        <br>
        First of all, look at the timing and the scale. It really took
        off around September, and within less then two month it is
        already threatening the stability of Europe as a whole, to a
        point where even the European “Leaders” are talking about the
        end of the European Union. Credible numbers are not available,
        but the German government estimates the number of “refugees”
        that have already arrived somewhere between one and two million,
        so the real number is probably much larger. Almost all the camps
        are crammed with far more people than is claimed. Some towns are
        being forced to cope with more “refugees” than they have
        citizens, some double as many. The estimates for next year
        amount to something between two and five million more
        “refugees.”<br>
        <br>
        Ask yourself, why would millions of men (the overwhelming
        majority are young men) suddenly and collectively decide to
        leave their families behind, leave their country, travel
        thousands of miles and head for either Germany, Austria or
        Sweden, ignoring all the other safe countries on the way? Who
        told them that this would be worth it? Where did they all get
        the money to pay for it? Why was there absolutely no effort at
        any border to stop them? Why did this not start earlier? After
        all, the middle east has been a war zone for years—ever since
        the USA exploited 9/11 to start “spreading democracy.” How could
        this happen within days, weeks at most. Did the first hundred
        thousand send a message to the rest that it was OK for them to
        come too? If so, how?<br>
        <br>
        Secondly, look at the character of the average “refugee.” Why
        are they all well-fed, well-clothed, self-confident young men
        showing no signs of stress or hardship? Why are they leaving
        their families behind? Do they know their wives and children can
        follow them later? If so, how? Why do these men not want to stay
        behind and try to rescue their countries? Why do they all own
        high-quality mobile phones charged with seemingly endless
        minutes? It is clear that the “refugees” have been briefed on
        exactly what kinds of social benefits they can demand, and how
        to go about doing it, and so they are audacious and become
        violent if met with resistance. They even demand expensive
        medical treatments, which are granted and taken for granted.
        Why? There are no background checks for any of these
        people—naturally, because there is no time to do ten
        thousand-plus background checks every day. For all we know,
        these people could be criminals, mercenaries and terrorists. An
        unknown number have serious diseases, such as hepatitis, TB and
        even the plague. No one keeps track of that, no one registered
        them, no one limits their freedom of movement. Those who
        register do so mostly with forged Syrian passports, which Turkey
        hands out like candy, even to black Africans who look nothing
        like the Syrians. Tens of thousands of “refugees” have
        “disappeared” from their camps, some even stopped the special
        trains midway to their destinations by pulling the emergency
        brake and ran off into the wilderness. Where to and why—no one
        knows. No one asks questions, but what is clear is that we have
        completely lost control over European territory.<br>
        <br>
        Thirdly, there is the little matter of collaboration and
        treason. Even if this is a genuine refugee crisis, why is that
        none of the policies of the German/European government make any
        sense? And why is the press acting continuously and uniformly in
        favor of their policies, and is downright hostile toward the
        European populace? If millions of people have to flee immediate
        peril, there are a lot of different ways to care for them
        without endangering the integrity of Europe and ruining several
        national budgets. But instead of discussing what to do, how to
        do it and how to pay for it, the plan seemed to be
        predetermined, decided and fixed long ago.<br>
        <br>
        The political “solution” is to soak every city and town in
        Germany, Austria and Sweden with people of unknown origin and
        intention. Flanked by a press hailing the process,
        underestimating their numbers and suppressing reports of crimes
        committed by the “refugees,” damning and demonizing every form
        of opposition. Every branch of government, all authorities and
        parties, in concert with the press, stand should to shoulder in
        pushing this agenda against the overwhelming indignation of
        their citizens and closing their eyes to the fact that this is
        against the law. Censorship, propaganda, hate speech, defamation
        and open rejection of basic democratic rights against any
        opposition, are simply exploding right now. A prime example of
        this is Germany's vice chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, who called an
        undefined but large part of the German populace who dare to
        oppose this insanity “Pack” (vermin).<br>
        <br>
        Everyone who takes a stand in Germany now, opposing any
        refugee-related policy by the government, is subjected to
        insults is labelled as a right-wing extremist, a hateful
        criminal and a danger to society. Some get singled out and
        persecuted in public using extensive defamation campaigns. The
        author Akif Pirinçci became the latest victim after giving a
        speech at the PEGIDA demo, the accusation against him based on a
        shameless misrepresentation of the facts.<br>
        <br>
        Even the most peaceful protest is immediately threatened with a
        ban (but most are still granted permission anyway). Every speech
        or publication mentioning treason or comparable accusations is
        instantly subject to investigations under the charge of
        demagoguery or threat of violence. Current examples can be found
        daily in the major mainstream outlets such as Der Spiegel, Die
        Welt, Bild and the like. If this situation came about by chance,
        such a spontaneous consensus would have been extremely unlikely.
        But from day one this has been an obvious propaganda/defamation
        campaign against the truth and against the interests of the
        European populace.<br>
        <br>
        The German press even earned itself a new name that sticks:
        “Lügenpresse” (the lying press) is a word that can be heard on
        every corner. In private, the politicians are being called
        traitors all the time.<br>
        <br>
        The national railroad company is ordered to offer special trains
        free of charge for the “refugees,” bringing them into every
        corner of Germany the fastest way possible while delaying
        regular trains.<br>
        <br>
        Vacant houses and apartments are confiscated by force and given
        over to the “refugees” free of charge. Every “refugee” given
        rental housing is paid for by the communities, as much as 500
        Euros per person per month. This is a big opportunity for some
        scumbags to make money really fast, by making, ill and elderly
        Germans homeless.<br>
        <br>
        The police and the press have been ordered to suppress reports
        of any crimes the “refugees” commit, and so you will not find
        any in the press, nor even in police reports. But if you ask
        around, you will hear plenty of stories about rampant assaults
        and rapes in every city and many towns in Germany. Some
        “refugee” camps burned down, but most were burned down by their
        inhabitants, mostly in protest or because of minor
        disagreements. Police sirens are heard in every city every hour
        now.<br>
        <br>
        When the “refugees” started shoplifting, then raiding
        supermarkets, the government told the retailers to keep quiet
        about this, and has been paying for everything that was damaged
        or stolen ever since. The only exceptions are alcohol and
        cigarettes—all other retail goods are free, no questions asked.<br>
        <br>
        The small business sector has declared the “refugees”
        unemployable, due to zero qualifications, unwillingness to work
        and lack of language skills. However, the experts in the press
        somehow see a “big opportunity” to grow the economy. There is no
        critical discussion and no plan for the future. The only advice
        Chancellor Merkel gave to Germany was “Wir schaffen das” (We
        will do it), not elaborating exactly what we will do, nor how.
        But anyone brave enough to think for themselves can easily
        guess.<br>
        <br>
        To keep it short, any political common sense and human instinct
        would prohibit such reckless, potentially irreversible, not to
        mention illegal behavior. Its end result is clearly visible: it
        is either the ruin of Europe—mainly the countries targeted by
        the “refugees,” which are Germany, Austria and Sweden—or war.
        Since I don’t believe that either coincidences or stupidity of
        this magnitude is possible, this is either treason or high
        treason. At least two charges have been filed against the
        current government, one for organized immigration crimes, and
        just recently for high treason. About 400 people became party to
        this action afterward. They are unlikely to succeed, because the
        judiciary is complicit. But if it isn’t obviously high treason
        now, it will become so within weeks—called out by everyone,
        because there is no end in sight.<br>
        <br>
        The rest of organized society is equally treasonous. The press
        has openly declared itself an enemy of democracy and the general
        public, and at best a collaborators. The church, even while
        immediately threatened by violent Islam, prays for more
        immigrants, damning people who dare to utter doubts. The
        intelligentsia is either silent or applauds our altruism. The
        treason is complete. Police and the military are completely
        overwhelmed. The military was reduced in size long ago to the
        point of utter ineffectiveness and has been stressed out by
        international missions. The police is simply not equipped to
        handle millions of potential enemies fanned out all over Europe,
        awaiting the order to attack.<br>
        <br>
        For foreign observers, this may sound far fetched and
        exaggerated. But consider this: in some areas of Germany, when
        you call the police now, no one will answer the phone. When they
        do, they are unable to do anything. A friend of mine called the
        police hotline (not the regular local emergency number) and was
        advised to form some sort of militia to solve the problem. A
        town of 600 has a dozen policemen at most, but often around a
        thousand “refugees” to handle. No one will come to their help if
        these “refugees” decide to take what they seem to believe is
        theirs already—because someone told them so, I guess. We are
        adrift in a sea of enemies, and the front-line in this war will
        run along the welcome mats at our front doors.<br>
        <br>
        I find myself in a nightmare unable to wake up. Most people feel
        helpless and unwilling to accept the sad truth: we have been
        betrayed by everyone (except perhaps the police and the
        military) we entrusted with our safety and our hopes for the
        future. Even though the end of the global economy in its current
        form seemed a given to me, this kind of treason and ill intent
        to bring it all down took me by surprise. Among the twenty or so
        people I talked to about this in confidence, absolutely everyone
        is convinced that this is heading toward civil war—and fast! The
        only question remaining is whether the Germans start it, or the
        “refugees,” or some other party. We are one mayor terror attack
        away from sheer chaos. I have heard from several people
        connected to European security circles that the illegal weapons
        market is completely sold out, with many dealers holding on to
        their weapons for their own personal use. This is a rumour, but
        since we have been forced to depend on hearsay for any real
        information right now, I tend to believe it.<br>
        <br>
        There is a small protest movement making headlines in Germany
        and even internationally. The PEGIDA movement has been gathering
        every Monday in Dresden to protest European immigration policy
        for a whole year now. They have had plenty of support since bad
        immigration policy has given rise to this manufactured
        “Völkerwanderung” (mass migration). On the October 19—the
        one-year anniversary gathering—around 35-40 thousand people came
        to protest peacefully, only to be attacked by several thousand
        violent “protesters” from the Antifa movement. An allegedly
        anti-fascist group, so violent and fascist in their behavior
        they would make for excellent recruiting material for the actual
        fascists of the SA or the NSDAP. One of the PEGIDA followers was
        beaten and severely wounded with a metal pole even before the
        gathering started. Several hundred policemen had to fight for
        their lives for hours. The Antifa, which is known to many as the
        second executive of the government, is nothing but an effective
        mobile force to quell resistance, exactly like the SA, only
        without the nice uniforms. Wherever demonstrations are
        announced, the Antifa members will travel there to express their
        opinion with “hard-hitting” arguments.<br>
        <br>
        Unsurprisingly, PEGIDA is a prime target for hatred and
        defamation right now. As small as it is, the establishment seems
        to consider it as real danger, since their complete press gag
        order against it during the last year did not choke it off. But
        as important as they might be locally, the outcome seems to be
        irreversible. The invasion has succeeded already. With each
        passing day the numbers turn more and more against us. By now
        the best outcome is a civil war within months, reversing this
        development. The worst outcome is complete disintegration of
        European nations within the next few years, rendering large
        parts of the continent ungovernable. The divorce between the
        government and the people is almost complete by now. No sane
        person believes the press or the politicians. The ones who do
        retreat into fantasies of hate and self hatred. Never before was
        it more visible to me that this society is completely broken,
        with every key element, acting against both individual and
        collective interests, seemingly following orders while digging
        their own graves.<br>
        <br>
        Once again, unquestioning obedience has taken over German
        society, but this time without the consent by the masses,
        because this time the final solution concerns them. The chaos
        that will follow will by no means be an accident: it is
        engineered and ordered.<br>
        <br>
        Once again, yet another generation will have to answer to their
        grandchildren: How could you let this happen?<br>

        </div>
        <br>
        ...Yesterday I heard a long discussion on NPR, a corporate and
        Israeli owned propaganda organ, about the migrant problem in
        Europe. Yes, migrants, not refugees.<br>
        <br>
        These migrants have appeared out of nowhere. They have decided
        to seek a better life in Europe, where capitalism, which
        provides jobs, freedom, democracy, and women’s rights guarantee
        a fulfilling life. Only the West provides a fulfilling life,
        because it doesn’t yet bomb itself.<br>
        <br>
        The hordes overrunning Europe just suddenly decided to go there.
        It has nothing to do with Washington’s 14 years of destruction
        of seven countries, enabled by the dumbshit Europeans
        themselves, who provided cover for the war crimes under such
        monikers as the “coalition of the willing,” a “NATO operation,”
        “bringing freedom and democracy.”<br>
        <br>
        From the Western presstitute media you would never know that the
        millions fleeing into Europe are fleeing American and European
        bombs that have indiscriminately slaughtered and dislocated
        millions of Muslim peoples.<br>
        <br>
        Not even the tiny remnant of conservative magazines, the ones
        that the neocon nazis have not taken over or exterminated, can
        find the courage to connect the refugees with US policy in the
        Middle East.<br>
        <br>
        For example, Srdja Trifkovic writing in the October issue of
        Chronicles: A Magazine of American Culture, sees the refugees as
        “the third Muslim invasion of Europe.” For Trifkovic, the
        refugees are invaders who will bring about the collapse of the
        remnant of Western Christian Civilization.<br>
        <br>
        Trifkovic never mentions that the Europeans brought the millions
        of Muslim refugees upon themselves, because their corrupt
        political bosses are Washington’s well-paid vassals and enabled
        Washington’s wars for hegemony that displaced millions of
        Muslims. For Trifkovic and every other conservative, only
        Muslims can do wrong. As Trifkovic understands it, the wrong
        that the West does is not defending itself against Muslims.<br>
        <br>
        Trifkovic believes that Europe will soon live under Sharia law.
        He wonders if America will “have the wherewithal to carry the
        torch.”<br>
        <br>
        A majority of Americans live in a fake world created by
        propaganda. They are disconnected from reality. I have in front
        of me a local North Georgia newspaper dated October that reports
        that “a Patriot Day Memorial Service was held at the Dawson
        County Fire Headquarters on September 11 to remember the
        terrorist attacks that shook America 14 years ago.” Various
        local dignitaries called on the attendees to remember “all of
        those who have died not only on that day, but since that day in
        the fight to keep America free.”<br>
        <br>
        The dignitaries did not say how murdering and dislocating
        millions of Muslims in seven counries keeps us free. No doubt,
        the question has never occurred to them. America runs on rote
        platitudes.<br>
        <br>
        The presidents of Russia and China watch with amazement the
        immoral stupidity that has become America’s defining
        characteristic. At some point the Russians and Chinese will
        realize that no matter how patient they are, the West is lost
        and cannot be redeemed.<br>
        <br>
        When the West collapses from its own evil, peace will return to
        the world.<br>

        JAPAN – Japan refuses Muslims permanent residence. Muslims
        cannot own real estate or any type of business; worship of Islam
        is banned. Any Muslim tourist caught spreading the word of Islam
        will be deported immediately, including all family members.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        CUBA – Cuba rejects plans for first mosque.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

        &nbsp;<br>
        NORWAY – Record number of Muslims, (over 2,000) were deported
        from Norway as a way of fighting crime. Since these Muslim
        criminals have been deported, crime has dropped by 72%. Prison
        Officials report that nearly half of their jail cells are now
        vacant, courtrooms quieter, Police freed to attend to other
        matters, mainly traffic offenses, to keep their roads and
        highways safe.<br>
        <br>
        GERMANY – In Germany last year there were 81 violent attacks
        targeting mosques. Austrian police arrested 13 men targeting
        suspected jihad recruiters.<br>
        <br>
        CHINA – A Chinese court sends 22 Muslim Imams to jail for 16 to
        20 years for spreading Islamic hatred. Eighteen Jihadists have
        been executed. China refuses to set up a separate Islamic State.
        Muslim prayers are banned in government buildings and schools in
        Xinjiang (Western China). Hundreds of Muslim families are
        prepared to leave China for their own safety and return back to
        their own Middle Eastern countries.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        CZECH REPUBLIC – Czech Republic refuses Islam in their country,
        regarding it as evil.&nbsp; <br>

        &nbsp;<br>
        IRELAND – Muslims in Northern Ireland announce plans to leave to
        avoid anti-Islamic violence by Irish locals. The announcement
        comes after an attack on groups of Muslims in the city of
        Belfast. Hospital staff was reluctant to treat hospitalised
        Muslims.&nbsp; Most were given the Band-Aid treatment and sent
        home with staff muttering ”Good Riddance”.&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        THE NETHERLANDS – Dutch MP’s call for removal of all mosques in
        the Netherlands. One Member of the Dutch Parliament: “We want to
        clean Netherlands of Islam”. Dutch MP Machiel De Graaf spoke on
        behalf of the Party for Freedom when he said, “All mosques in
        the Netherlands should be shut down. Without Islam, the
        Netherlands would be a wonderful safe country to live in, as it
        was before the arrival of Muslim refugees”.<br>

        Islamic gangs in Germany have broken into schools and churches
        and plundered collection boxes, crosses and other valuable and
        sacred objects used in church services, according to
        prosecutors.<br>
        <br>
        From the schools, the men stole laptops, money and a cash card,
        which they used to finance ISIS jihadist fighters seeking to
        topple the regime of Syrian president Bashur al-Assad, alleged
        chief prosecutor Nadja Gudermann.<br>
        <br>
        The pilfered churches were in the area around Cologne, a city
        known for its many historic and beautiful churches including a
        soaring cathedral.<br>
        <br>
        In all, the Muslim gangs are accused of stealing more than
        $21,000 worth of goods.<br>
        <br>
        During the break-ins, which took place between 2011 and 2014,
        the men were said to have not only stolen thousands of dollars
        in items but often left major damage to the churches requiring
        costly repairs.<br>
        <br>
        The central figure in the gang was a 26-year-old Moroccan,
        prosecutors say, who also uploaded a video to YouTube
        encouraging Muslims to enlist with the Islamic State and fight
        for jihad. He himself appears in the German section of the
        video.<br>
        <br>
        Prosecutors allege the Moroccan Muslim traveled to Syria, where
        he received military training.<br>

        <b>Christian brutally beaten by Muslim in Hamburg</b><br>
        <br>
        In another case of assaults on Christians by Muslim migrants, in
        a refugee-camp in Hamburg, a 24-year-old Iranian convert to
        Christianity was brutally beaten by an Afghan man with a
        telescopic baton, reported the German newspaper Die Welt.<br>
        <br>
        Although other refugees restrained the attacker, he managed to
        escape.<br>
        <br>
        These are not the first instances of violence associated with
        the mass influx Muslim migrants into Europe, around 70 percent
        of whom are men between the ages of 18 and 45.<br>
        <br>
        In late August, a riot broke out at a German refugee camp as a
        mob tried to lynch an Afghan man after he tore pages of the
        Quran, the BBC reported.<br>
        <br>
        When police tried to intervene, they were attacked by Muslims
        throwing stones and concrete blocks.<br>
        <br>
        There have also been widespread reports of rapes of women in

        <b>News blackout on German protests</b><br>
        <br>
        While there has been zero coverage by the major media in the
        United States, thousands of Germans have taken to the streets to
        protest the more than 800,000 migrants who have been “welcomed”
        by their government. That, in turn, has brought out
        counter-protesters who support the government’s decision.<br>
        <br>
        On Oct. 11, a group of Germans formed a human blockade against
        busloads of migrants being transported to their town of
        Freiburg. German police intervened against their own citizens,
        dousing them with pepper spray.<br>

        Leaders warn the continent was "falling apart" trying to deal
        with the migrant crisis..<br>
        <br>
        ...According to Welt am Sonntag, an unsigned discussion paper
        circulated among security official warns: “We are importing
        Islamic extremism, Arabic anti-semitism, the national and ethnic
        conflicts of other nations and other concepts of rights and
        society.”<br>
        <br>
        It warns of an extremist backlash among the “mainstream middle
        class”. “We will see many people turning away from this
        constitutional state.” <br>

            The following quatrains are those which include astrological
            dating. These have been compared with 21st century
            ephemerides -- and they pertain to the present time and

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to the most
            obvious interpretations of Nostradamus' cryptic quatrains,
            Europe will suffer another invasion by Muslims. The
            situation will be complicated later by Russian and Chinese
            aggressions. Some of his predictions came true within 20
            years after the publication of The True Centuries, but most
            of them definitely indicate a future war between Christians
            and Muslims. About a dozen of the quatrains concerning this
            war are dated by astronomical configurations that began in
            the 1980s and continue into the 21st century. That war did
            not begin on schedule, but the prophet was perfectly
            accurate in his timing the outbreak of the Balkan war
            between Christians and Muslims in the 1990s. It is the
            opinion of this writer that the Marian movement (of prayer
            for peace) was successfully in delaying the prophesied
            "wrath of God" for some 20 years -- but that grace period
            has ended</font> </p>

        The inhabitants of Geneva will be wise to flee when the economy
        (Saturn) turns from banking (gold) to war (iron) against
        "RAYPOZ". This is Nostradamus' transposed spelling for Zopyra,
        who delivered Babylon into the hands of Darius. Another
        possibility is a disaster generated by the CERN accelerator,
        or&nbsp; a positive ray (ion beam) weapon that will be used. The

        Zionist zealot rabbi Meir Kahane’s pure evil lives, founder of
        the Arab-hating Jewish Defense League (JDL). Israel banned it in
        1988, calling it a “threat to national security.”<br>
        <br>
        Even the Islamophobic Anti-Defamation League (ADL) said its
        membership includes only “thugs and hooligans” - dedicated to
        hate-mongering and violence against Palestinians.<br>
        <br>
        Its poisonous ideology persists in Israel. Radicalized rabbis
        preach it. Nothing is done to stop them. Hate-mongering rabbis
        responded to questions including: “Am I allowed to kick the
        insurgent, hit him or shoot him in order to kill him after he
        has been arrested or is this prohibited?”<br>
        <br>
        Rabbi Rabbi Rav Benzion Mutzafi&nbsp; said “(i)t is not only
        desirable to do so, but it is a religious duty that you hold his
        head down to the ground and hit him until his last breath.”...<br>
