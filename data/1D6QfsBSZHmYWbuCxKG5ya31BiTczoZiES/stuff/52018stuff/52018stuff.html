              Few Americans realize that the U.S. economy is being
              propped up by the Shale Oil Industry.&nbsp; However, the
              shale oil industry is nothing more than a Ponzi Scheme, so
              when it collapses, it will take down the U.S. economy with
              it.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the reason few Americans
              understand how lousy the economics are in producing shale
              oil and gas is due to the misinformation and propaganda
              being put out by the industry and energy analysts.<br>
              <br>
              I am quite surprised how bank analysts and brokerage firms
              can continue to fund the shale oil and gas or advise
              clients to purchase stock when the industry is behaving
              just like the Bernie Madoff Ponzi Scheme.&nbsp; The only
              big difference is that the U.S. Shale Industry is a Ponzi
              at least four times greater than Madoff’s $65 billion
              fiasco...<br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Whether the mask is labeled fascism,
              democracy, or dictatorship of the proletariat, our great
              adversary remains the apparatus—the bureaucracy, the
              police, the military. Not the one facing us across the
              frontier of the battle lines, which is not so much our
              enemy as our brothers’ enemy, but the one that calls
              itself our protector and makes us its slaves. No matter
              what the circumstances, the worst betrayal will always be
              to subordinate ourselves to this apparatus and to trample
              underfoot, in its service, all human values in ourselves
              and in others.”—Simone Weil, French philosopher and
              political activist<br>
              <br>
              We labor today under the weight of countless tyrannies,
              large and small, carried out in the name of the national
              good by an elite class of government officials who are
              largely insulated from the ill effects of their actions. <br>
              <br>
              We, the middling classes, are not so fortunate.<br>
              <br>
              We find ourselves badgered, bullied and browbeaten into
              bearing the brunt of their arrogance, paying the price for
              their greed, suffering the backlash for their militarism,
              agonizing as a result of their inaction, feigning
              ignorance about their backroom dealings, overlooking their
              incompetence, turning a blind eye to their misdeeds,
              cowering from their heavy-handed tactics, and blindly
              hoping for change that never comes. <br>
              <br>
              The overt signs of the despotism exercised by the
              increasingly authoritarian regime that passes itself off
              as the United States government are all around us:
              warrantless surveillance of Americans’ private phone and
              email conversations by the NSA; SWAT team raids of
              Americans’ homes; shootings of unarmed citizens by police;
              harsh punishments meted out to schoolchildren in the name
              of zero tolerance; drones taking to the skies
              domestically; endless wars; out-of-control spending;
              militarized police; roadside strip searches; roving TSA
              sweeps; privatized prisons with a profit incentive for
              jailing Americans; fusion centers that collect and
              disseminate data on Americans’ private transactions; and
              militarized agencies with stockpiles of ammunition, to
              name some of the most appalling.<br>
              <br>
              Yet as egregious as these incursions on our rights may be,
              it’s the endless, petty tyrannies inflicted on an
              overtaxed, overregulated, and underrepresented populace
              that occasionally nudge a weary public out of their numb
              indifference and into a state of outrage. <br>
              <br>
              Consider, for example, that federal and state governments
              now require on penalty of a fine that individuals apply
              for permission before they can grow exotic orchids, host
              elaborate dinner parties, gather friends in one’s home for
              Bible studies, give coffee to the homeless, let their kids
              manage a lemonade stand, keep chickens as pets, or braid
              someone’s hair, as ludicrous as that may seem... [ Cont'd

              Experimental setup to investigate implicit learning of
              surroundings.<br>
              Spatial representations of surroundings, including those
              outside the visual field, are crucial for guiding movement
              in a three-dimensional world. The visual system appears to
              provide sufficient information for movement despite our
              visual field being limited to the frontal region. However,
              this theory had not been scientifically tested until now.<br>
              <br>
              A group led by Professor Satoshi Shioiri from the Research
              Institute of Electrical Communication at Tohoku University
              in Japan, used a visual search experiment to demonstrate
              that the human visual system indeed has the ability to
              perceive things beyond the limits of the visual field....<br>

          ...The trick, the authors say, is to develop drugs that
          interact with one of the enzymes within our cells - an
          approach that makes it harder for the virus to become
          drug-resistant.<br>
          <br>
          "Viruses hijack the host to make more copies of themselves.
          This enzyme is one of the host enzymes that the virus
          hijacks," said Roberto Solari, visiting professor at the
          National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London,
          and a co-author of the study.<br>
          <br>
          Writing in the journal Nature Chemistry, a team of researchers
          based around the UK report how they looked at molecules that
          interact with a human enzyme that attaches a type of fatty
          acid molecule on to proteins. While two of these molecules on
          their own had little effect on the enzyme, the team found that
          when they were chemically stitched together they became
          remarkably potent in preventing the enzyme from working as
          normal.<br>
          <br>
          Solari said that is important, since the virus uses the enzyme
          to assemble the protein coat which surrounds the genetic
          material of the virus.<br>
          <br>
          "What we found is if we block the addition of this fat, the
          coat doesn't assemble so the virus doesn't package its genes
          into its coat," he said. "The virus still makes its own genes,
          it makes the coat, but the coat can't assemble so the virus
          can't replicate - you actually don't make infectious
          particles."<br>
          <br>
          The team say the molecule appears to completely prevent the
          virus from replicating, whether it is added one hour before,
          one hour after or at the same time as the cells are infected,
          and that it remains effective up to three hours after
          infection. The approach was also found to prevent the
          replication of other viruses in the same family as rhinovirus
          - including polio and foot-and-mouth disease....<br>
          <br>
          ...tests have so far only been carried out on human cells in a
          dish...<br>

          The Balfour Declaration of 1917 (dated 2 November 1917) was a
          letter from the United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary Arthur
          James Balfour to Baron Rothschild (Walter Rothschild, 2nd
          Baron Rothschild), a leader of the British Jewish community,
          for transmission to the Zionist Federation of Great Britain
          and Ireland. His Majesty's government view with favour the
          establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish
          people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the
          achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that
          nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and
          religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in
          Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews
          in any other country. The statement was issued through the
          efforts of Chaim Weizmann and Nahum Sokolow, the principal
          Zionist leaders based in London; as they had asked for the
          reconstitution of Palestine as "the" Jewish national home, the
          declaration fell short of Zionist expectations. "He who
          passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who
          helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting
          against it is really cooperating with it." - Dr. Martin Luther
          King Jr. "If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you
          have chosen the side of the oppressor" Bishop Desmond Tutu
          "Every time anyone says that Israel is our only friend in the

          on an audio-frequency control technology...<br>
          <br>
          <b>Summary of the Invention</b><br>
          <br>
          The purpose of the present invention is to overcome the
          deficiencies of the prior art and provide a method for
          producing bean sprouts based on audio frequency regulation
          technology.<br>
          <br>
          The method for producing bean sprouts based on the audio
          frequency modulation technology is: 5 growth stages of bean
          sprouts with foaming species, small buds, two buds, middle
          buds and long vegetables;<br>
          <br>
          In the foaming stage, the water is changed every 3 hours or
          so, and the water temperature is Controlled at 23 ~ 24 °C,
          while applying the frequency of 3000 ~ 3500hz, the volume of
          the sound waves in the 80 ~ 100db continuous stimulation, the
          stimulation time is 9 ~ 12 hours; <br>
          <br>

              of electronics by a hundred-fold</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Among the chief complaints for smartphone, laptop and other
          battery-operated electronics users is that the battery life is
          too short and -- in some cases -- that the devices generate
          heat. Now, a group of physicists led by Deepak K. Singh,
          associate professor of physics and astronomy at the University
          of Missouri, has developed a device material that can address
          both issues. The team has applied for a patent for a magnetic
          material that employs a unique structure -- a "honeycomb"
          lattice that exhibits distinctive electronic properties...<br>
          <br>
          "Semiconductor diodes and amplifiers, which often are made of
          silicon or germanium, are key elements in modern electronic
          devices," said Singh, who also serves as the principal
          investigator of the Magnetism and Superconductivity Research
          Laboratory at MU. "A diode normally conducts current and
          voltage through the device along only one biasing direction,
          but when the voltage is reversed, the current stops. This
          switching process costs significant energy due to dissipation,
          or the depletion of the power source, thus affecting battery
          life. By substituting the semiconductor with a magnetic
          system, we believed we could create an energetically effective
          device that consumes much less power with enhanced
          functionalities."<br>
          <br>
          Singh's team developed a two-dimensional, nanostructured
          material created by depositing a magnetic alloy, or permalloy,
          on the honeycomb structured template of a silicon surface. The
          new material conducts unidirectional current, or currents that
          only flow one way. The material also has significantly less
          dissipative power compared to a semiconducting diode, which is
          normally included in electronic devices.<br>
          <br>
          The magnetic diode paves the way for new magnetic transistors
          and amplifiers that dissipate very little power, thus
          increasing the efficiency of the power source. This could mean
          that designers could increase the life of batteries by more
          than a hundred-fold. Less dissipative power in computer
          processors could also reduce the heat generated in laptop or
          desktop CPUs.<br>
          <br>
          "Although more works need to be done to develop the end
          product, the device could mean that a normal 5-hour charge
          could increase to more than a 500-hour charge," Singh said.
          "The device could also act as an 'on/off switch' for other
          periphery components such as closed-circuit cameras or radio
          frequency attenuators, which reduces power flowing through a
          device. We have applied for a U.S. patent and have begun the
          process of incorporating a spin-off company to help us take
          the device to market."<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          <br>
          The magnetic analog of a semiconductor diode, demonstrating
          unidirectional electrical transport, is a highly desirable
          functionality for spintronics application, as it can play a
          dual role as magnetic memory device and logic element.
          However, creating such a functional material or device with
          operation ability at room temperature in the absence of any
          external tuning parameter, for instance a magnetic field, is a
          challenge till date. In this study, the finding of
          semiconductor diode-type rectification in a 2D honeycomb
          lattice, made of an ultrasmall permalloy magnet with a typical
          length of ˜12 nm is reported. The unidirectional electrical
          transport behavior, characterized by the asymmetric colossal
          enhancement in differential conductivity at a modest current
          application of ˜10–15 µA, persists to T = 300 K in honeycomb
          lattice of a moderate thickness of ˜6 nm. Importantly, the
          unidirectional biasing arises without the application of a
          magnetic field with an output power, ˜30 nW, by three orders
          of magnitude smaller than a semiconductor junction diode.
          Together, these properties provide a new vista for spintronics
          research.<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          <br>
          The nature of magnetic correlation at low temperature in
          two-dimensional artificial magnetic honeycomb lattice is a
          strongly debated issue. While theoretical researches suggest
          that the system will develop a novel zero entropy spin solid
          state as T ? 0 K, a confirmation to this effect in artificial
          honeycomb lattice of connected elements is lacking. This study
          reports on the investigation of magnetic correlation in newly
          designed artificial permalloy honeycomb lattice of ultrasmall
          elements, with a typical length of ˜12 nm, using neutron
          scattering measurements and temperature-dependent
          micromagnetic simulations. Numerical modeling of the polarized
          neutron reflectometry data elucidates the
          temperature-dependent evolution of spin correlation in this
          system. As temperature reduces to ˜7 K, the system tends to
          develop novel spin solid state, manifested by the alternating
          distribution of magnetic vortex loops of opposite chiralities.
          Experimental results are complemented by temperature-dependent
          micromagnetic simulations that confirm the dominance of spin
          solid state over local magnetic charge ordered state in the
          artificial honeycomb lattice with connected elements. These
          results enable a direct investigation of novel spin solid
          correlation in the connected honeycomb geometry of 2D
          artificial structure. <br>

              political backbone to be a head of a state.</i><i><br>

          <br>
          You can’t make this stuff up: Netanyahu, the problem child in
          the Middle East, has told Vladimir Putin that Iran has vowed
          to annihilate six million Jews! If you think that Netanyahu
          would never come up with something so dumb, then you are
          underestimating Netanyahu’s fantastical imagination. This is
          his exact word:<br>
          <br>
          “There is a country in the Middle East, Iran, which calls for
          the destruction of another 6 million Jews.”[1]<br>
          <br>
          No one with an ounce of brain cells knocking together would
          invent such a stupid statement. The simple fact is that
          outside of Israel, Iran has the largest Jewish population in
          the Middle East. Moreover, “Jews feel safer in Iran than in US
          &amp; EU despite Tel Aviv-Tehran tensions.”[2] And they have
          been there for centuries! How does Iran plan to annihilate
          those people? Who is Netanyahu really fooling this time? his
          finest puppet (Donald Trump)?<br>
          <br>
          When Netanyahu made similar statements back in 2015, Iranian
          officials responded by saying: “It is truly, truly regrettable
          that bigotry gets to the point of making allegations against
          an entire nation which has saved Jews three times in its
          history…”[3]...<br>

          The DARPA Subterranean (SubT) Challenge aims to develop
          innovative technologies that would augment operations
          underground. The SubT Challenge will explore new approaches to

          environments, including human-made tunnel systems, urban
          underground, and natural cave networks. <br>

          <b><br>
          </b>GcMAF eradicates cancer; cells seen via microscopes and
          time lapse photography. <br>
          <br>
          This is a world wide first, and a scientific research paper
          named "Multifaceted immunotherapeutic effects of GcMAF on
          human breast cancer cells" peer reviewed, and published by us
          in the January 2013 Immunology Conference in San Diego.<br>
          <br>
          Human MCF7 breast cancer cells are shown both in a corrugated
          layer on the surface below, and as irregular "fingers" above.<br>
          <br>
          Macrophages are small round circles added at the bottom left.
          They do nothing until the First Immune GcMAF&nbsp; is added.<br>
          <br>
          Time lapse photography over 60 hours shows the cancer
          monolayer below first changing from corrugated to smooth from
          the bottom left as the cancer is destroyed; then the cancer
          "fingers" are also eaten and destroyed by the macrophages. <br>
          <br>
          This is part of the assays performed on batches of our GcMAF,
          and are carried out in First Immune (gcmaf.eu's) laboratories
          as part of our everyday production.<br>
          <br>
          We supply 5,000 patients, 300 doctors in 30 nations. <br>
          <br>
          This confirms the research paper "Effects of vitamin D-binding
          protein-derived macrophage-activating factor on human breast
          cancer cells," published in the journal Anticancer Research
          2012 Jan;32(1):45-52, in which they also kindly used our First
          Immune GcMAF for their experiments.<b><br>

          </b>ART MATRIX LLC is developing the HipStar™, a product that
          will change the way hikers, campers, backpackers move by
          literally taking the weight off their shoulders...<br>

          &nbsp;According to the Mountain Tactical Institute’s research,
          there are five “thumb rules” discovered: <br>
          <br>
          1) One pound on your feet equals five pounds on your back.<br>
          2) One pound on your feet equals five percent more energy
          expended.<br>
          3) Every one percent of your body weight makes you six seconds
          slower per mile.<br>
          4) Ten percent grade incline cuts your speed in half.&nbsp; <br>
          5) Going up slows you down twice as much as going down speeds
          you up. Every percent of incline adds 15 seconds to your mile
          pace. Every percent of decline takes 8 sec. off of your mile
          pace. ..<br>

          <br>
          In a professional or military setting, the HipStar™ can be
          used to transport vital equipment and supplies over almost any
          terrain by rolling it on the ground or carrying it on the
          " user’s back.<br>

          <br>
          The HipStar™ will be available in three versions: Light,
          Medium, and Heavy-duty. The heavy-duty model can easily hold
          up to 80 lbs (or even more) of gear with only 6-8 lbs. of
          force in cart mode. It can be used by military or heavy
          hikers/tourists. This group is used to carry large heavy
          backpacks (50-60 lbs.) ..<br>
          <br>
          ?1. How do you make fifty pounds feel like one pound?A
          suitcase balances a lot of weight on one axle - the same
          design used in the HipStar.&nbsp; <br>
          2. How do you keep your hands free?...The HipStar attaches to
          your hip and leaves enough room behind you so your heels don’t
          hit it when you are walking or running.&nbsp; <br>
          3. How do you keep it from bumping into you when you walk?...
          The HipStar’s shock absorbers and flexible harness even out
          those disturbing walking motions for a comfortable experience.<br>
          4. What do you do when you hit uneven terrain?The HipStar
          folds down into a backpack in seconds...<b><br>

          A reproducibility crisis afflicts a wide range of scientific
          and social-scientific disciplines, from epidemiology to social
          psychology. Improper use of statistics, arbitrary research
          techniques, lack of accountability, political groupthink, and
          a scientific culture biased toward producing positive results
          together have produced a critical state of affairs. Many
          supposedly scientific results cannot be reproduced in
          subsequent investigations.<br>
          <br>
          This study examines the different aspects of the
          reproducibility crisis of modern science. The report also

          Lab, a Lab which he started in 1978 at Stanford University. In
          1992 the Lab left Stanford and became a non profit research

            Tour of the Human Predicament and What to Do About it<br>
            <br>
          </b>We live in exciting times. It's my belief that "you
          personally" will most likely die of starvation or conflict
          between 2040 to 2075. You will experience a collapse of human
          civilization, a 90% die-off of humans, a destruction of the
          ecosystem, a loss of access to mined and drilled resources,
          and a dark age from which your descendent's will not reemerge.<br>
          <br>
          If your kids survive to 2100 they will have been cannibals and
          will live like 17th century serfs -- no electricity, no
          running water, no schools, no medicine, and life will be
          short, nasty, and brutish.<br>
          <br>
          Your first task in preparing for this tour is to decide if I
          have any good reasons for believing this.<br>
          a) If you think I don't, for example technology will solve all
          my worries, then your view of the future means we don't have
          to change civilization's course.<br>
          b) If after investigation, you find that I have good reasons,
          your second task is to use what you have learned about how
          civilizations develop to chart a different course. <br>
          <br>

            <br>
          </b>On 5 April 2009 in Prague, US President Barack Obama
          asserted the United States’ commitment to ‘seek the peace and
          security of a world without nuclear weapons’. He was adding
          his voice and the efforts of his administration to the growing
          number of world leaders, citizens and civil-society
          organisations seeking the elimination of such weapons.1
          Banning the bomb has been a passionate and often popular
          crusade since its creation and first use, but in all that time
          it has never been a serious strategic objective for any state
          that possessed nuclear weapons.2 Why would a sitting US
          president take the political and strategic risk of declaring
          that progress towards this goal was a key element of America’s
          national security policy?<br>
          <br>
          There is no simple answer. A vast and complex set of
          interests, issues, theories, experiences and beliefs
          influences individual and national views on nuclear weapons,
          views that span the range of practical, political, moral and
          psychological understanding. Some recent arguments for
          eliminating nuclear weapons cover new ground and derive from
          the belief that the twenty-first-century global security
          environment differs fundamentally from that of the Cold War.
          Some proponents claim that historical changes have undermined
          the ability of nuclear weapons and deterrence to provide
          security benefits to most nations. Others challenge earlier
          calculations of the value of such weapons and assessments of
          the balance between the risks and benefits of a strategy of
          nuclear deterrence.<br>
          <br>
          Moreover, recent scholarship in the fields of history and
          deterrence theory questions deeply held beliefs regarding how
          nuclear weapons might influence the behaviour of national
          decision-makers. For example, declassified official documents
          from the Cold War reveal occasions when nuclear catastrophe
          was avoided by luck or seemingly random events rather than by
          the clearly identifiable operation of nuclear deterrence.
          There are further examples where existential characteristics
          of alerted nuclear forces appear to have caused crises that
          nearly resulted in their use. Finally, a growing number of
          strategists and technical and political elites regard nuclear
          weapons and deterrence theory as anachronistic. Some view the
          whole idea of nuclear weapons as out of step with today’s
          global threats, understanding of power and notions of human
          rights and the rule of law. Emerging structural changes in the
          international system (such as globalisation) undercut
          traditional theories of nuclear deterrence, while trends in
          information technology make possible much more agile and
          discriminate forms of military power. These arguments dovetail
          with others that assert that our greater understanding of the
          Earth’s environmental systems and humankind’s interdependence
          with those systems has made eliminating nuclear weapons more
          salient. A quite limited exchange of nuclear weapons against
          urban areas could trigger or accelerate global climatic
          catastrophe (cooling rather than warming), leading to the
          deaths of millions who had been uninvolved in the conflict
          itself. Many citizens, scientists and laymen alike, view
          nuclear-weapons abolition as an essential milestone in the
          development of human civilisation, a moral, ideological and
          practical campaign that could catalyse the transformation of
          international relations and improve the outlook for
          civilisation at a critical time.<br>
          <br>
          Humanity stands at an historic juncture, facing multiple
          interconnected threats within a compressed timescale. Besides
          the potential use of nuclear weapons, these include
          environmental degradation, resource scarcity, climate change,
          overpopulation, global disease pandemics, financial crises and
          natural disasters. The sort of international cooperation
          needed to reduce the number of nuclear weapons is similar to
          that needed to address these other transnational threats.
          Elimination of nuclear weapons would at least symbolically
          improve the chances of successfully addressing other
          existential threats.<br>
          <br>
          Obama, and others who seek a world without nuclear weapons,
          are right. Eliminating nuclear weapons is profoundly in the
          national-security interest of the United States and its allies
          and friends. Without major progress towards the elimination of
          nuclear arms, moreover, it is unlikely that the world will be
          able to avoid nuclear use for a prolonged period or respond
          adequately to security challenges related to climate change,
          resource scarcity and environmental degradation. The
          international community must reject the myths and expose the
          risks of the ideology of nuclear deterrence if it is to
          successfully meet the mutual global challenges of the
          twenty-first century.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Challenging myths</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          The United States and the other nuclear-armed nations have
          long maintained the threat of nuclear retaliation to deter
          acts of aggression against them. During the hostile
          ideological conflict of the Cold War, strategists on both
          sides concluded that only the prospect of mutually assured
          destruction would instil prudence and prevent decision-makers
          from issuing political or military challenges that bore a high
          risk of leading to military conflict.3 The strategy of nuclear
          deterrence was adopted in the West, reluctantly, as the least
          bad choice for managing what was believed to be an all-out
          struggle with Soviet Communism for domination of the planet
          and the social and political ideology of humankind. The
          ‘balance of terror’ and ‘mutually assured destruction’ (MAD)
          were not desirable strategies; they were viewed as the best
          that could be achieved given the circumstances of the Cold
          War. This was despite universal agreement that an exchange of
          nuclear attacks in response to aggression would inflict
          unprecedented damage on the citizens and territory of a
          nation.4 The use of nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of
          Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 embedded the overwhelmingly
          destructive nature of the bomb deeply into the collective
          psyche. Given no clear alternatives, national-security elites
          accommodated themselves to the paradox of nuclear deterrence
          and devised complex theoretical formalisms claiming that the
          risks of such a strategy were manageable and acceptable. In
          the world of nuclear deterrence, strategists were reconciled
          to the fact that, in order to be safe, you had to be willing
          to be crazy. As Winston Churchill put it in 1955, safety would
          ‘be the sturdy child of terror and survival the twin brother
          of annihilation’.5<br>
          <br>
          The world of 2013 is dramatically different, and it will
          change even more profoundly in the decades ahead. The question
          today is whether a strategy based on nuclear deterrence
          continues to be the most effective way for governments to deal
          with international tensions and protect themselves, or whether
          alternative strategies with greater benefits and lower risks
          are available. The answer depends in part on how our
          understanding of nuclear deterrence has evolved and whether it
          remains as stable and salient as the majority of the strategic
          community believed it to be during the Cold War.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Weapons of acceptable risk?</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          No one doubts the catastrophic consequences of nuclear war.
          The rapid destruction of even a small number of major urban
          areas in any nation would bring unprecedented devastation and
          loss of life. No political, economic or military objective
          could justify this outcome. Nor does anyone believe that any
          human or technological device, system or tool will operate
          forever without failure or error. Yet we accept the risk of
          nuclear war that accompanies reliance on a strategy of nuclear
          deterrence because we perceive that risk to be low and because
          no mainstream school of strategic thought is promoting an
          alternative.<br>
          <br>
          The concept of risk includes the relationship between the
          consequences and probability of an event. If the consequences
          of an event are extremely negative, such as the devastation
          resulting from nuclear war, then you want the probability of
          the event occurring to be vanishingly small, as close to zero
          as possible. But the questions of the probability of nuclear
          war and what factors cause changes in this probability over
          time have seen little scientific or scholarly analysis. This
          is a glaring omission in strategic discourse. We know that
          nuclear deterrence can fail, either through poor decisions,
          escalation during a crisis, a series of mechanical and human
          errors, or malicious acts that lead to inadvertent use.6 It
          has nearly failed several times, the most famous example being
          the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.<br>
          <br>
          A chain of events leading to nuclear war can emerge even when
          no political leader believes it is in the interest of the
          state to initiate war, and both sides act in a manner intended
          to avoid it. The long list of nuclear accidents, malfunctions,
          mishaps, false alarms and close calls, often initiated by
          mechanical and human error, continues to grow. Such incidents
          include crashes of nuclear-armed aircraft and submarines,
          warning systems mistaking flocks of geese or reflections of
          sunlight for enemy missile launches, maintenance crews
          dropping tools and blowing up missile silos, and the temporary
          loss or misplacement of nuclear weapons.7<br>
          <br>
          In 2002 it was revealed that two episodes during the Cuban
          Missile Crisis had brought nuclear war much closer than had
          been previously realised. On 26 October 1962, the destroyer
          USS Beale tracked and dropped small charges (the size of hand
          grenades) on a Soviet submarine to signal it to surface.
          Unknown to the US Navy, the submarine was armed with a nuclear
          torpedo with a 15-kilotonne warhead. Running out of air, the
          Soviet vessel was surrounded by American warships and
          desperately needed to surface, but was also considering
          defending itself. The captain ordered the arming of the
          nuclear torpedo, and the political officer concurred.
          Fortunately, the submarine brigade commander was also on
          board; he overruled the captain and defused the threat of a
          nuclear attack on the American fleet that would have almost
          surely brought on a nuclear response.<br>
          <br>
          The US military and intelligence services, too, were unaware
          that Soviet nuclear warheads for tactical missiles had already
          arrived in Cuba by September 1962. The shorter-range systems
          were operational by the time President John F. Kennedy was
          considering military action to destroy the missile bases in
          October. Based on incomplete knowledge, his military advisers
          considered the chances low that US conventional attacks on the
          Cuban missile sites would escalate to nuclear war. But they
          were unaware that the local Soviet commanders of the
          tactical-missile bases had been given the authority to launch
          their missiles if attacked. If US air-strikes had been
          ordered, as several high-ranking military leaders recommended,
          it is very likely that a nuclear exchange would have followed,
          potentially escalating to direct attacks on US and Soviet
          cities.<br>
          <br>
          The risk of deterrence failure remains significant. Nuclear
          deterrence is a complex, tightly coupled system. It is
          vulnerable to the unpredictable and uncontrollable nature of
          human error, mechanical failure and accident.8 If it fails, as
          nearly all such systems eventually do, it is likely to fail
          catastrophically and cause unprecedented human suffering. The
          American public (and the citizens of other nuclear-armed
          states) should demand that their governments conduct
          probabilistic risk assessments of scenarios that could result
          in the use of nuclear weapons.9 The nuclear, chemical, health
          and transportation industries are required to use this science
          to justify the safety of many actions and products and
          demonstrate that risks have been systematically identified and
          accounted for. Why should we demand less of the institutions
          we trust with our defence? Without an attempt to determine the
          probability of deterrence failure under variety of postulated
          scenarios, it is impossible to conduct a rational risk–benefit
          assessment of maintaining nuclear deterrence as a key element
          of national-security strategy.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Weapons of peace and strength?</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Following the use of nuclear weapons against Japan, and in the
          absence of nuclear war between nuclear-armed nations, a
          powerful belief in the strategic benefits of nuclear weapons
          emerged. A central pillar of this belief was the assumption
          and assertion by most observers in the West that the US atomic
          bombings were the decisive factor in Japan’s decision to
          surrender. This allowed the claim that the use of atomic
          weapons actually saved tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of
          American and Japanese lives by ending the war without the need
          to invade the Japanese Home Islands. Supporters of nuclear
          deterrence also claim that it has proved to be one of the most
          effective tools ever devised to avoid warfare between major
          states.10 This belief is understandable, given the frequency
          of conventional war prior to the development of nuclear
          weapons and the relative absence of direct warfare between
          major powers after they acquired nuclear arms. The
          national-security elite of many nations has embraced these two
          views, that nuclear weapons can be decisive in conflict and
          can prevent conflict from occurring. Indeed, they have become
          canons of strategic thought, though curiously much more so
          among civilian defence experts than among military
          professionals who might be called on to the use the weapons.<br>
          <br>
          Recent scholarship has challenged both the logic and
          historical accuracy of arguments supporting the efficacy of
          nuclear weapons in the war against Japan and the view that
          nuclear deterrence is the leading cause of the absence of
          great-power war since 1945.11 For example, there is an
          emerging view among historians that the entry of the Soviet
          Union into the Pacific War on 9 August 1945 was more decisive
          in Japan’s decision to surrender than the threat of further
          atomic bombings. Japan was already largely defeated and lacked
          the armed strength or industrial capacity to fight a two-front
          war. The conventional bombing of Japanese cities had inflicted
          similar or greater devastation than the atomic bombs but had
          failed to prompt surrender. Moreover, careful analysis of the
          correspondence and behaviour of the Japanese leadership
          reveals a stronger reaction to the Soviet declaration than to
          the atomic bombings.12<br>
          <br>
          Nor did nuclear weapons end interstate conflict, even between
          nuclear powers. The specific causes of the absence of major
          war on the European continent or between the United States and
          the Soviet Union from 1949 to 1991 cannot be known. But a
          disciplined thought experiment into the most likely causes of
          this relative calm would seek evidence that there was indeed
          an intent to use military force on the part of a state facing
          a nuclear power and that leaders failed to employ force
          because of their fear of nuclear war. Such evidence is scarce,
          especially outside the context of crises generated by
          accidents and misperceptions between great powers, which
          continued despite the presence of nuclear weapons. Moreover,
          during those crises the existence of nuclear weapons escalated
          the level of tension and put decision-makers in situations
          where the probability of miscalculation and human error was
          increased. This raises the possibility that the traditional
          view of nuclear deterrence as a crisis stabiliser may be
          incorrect.<br>
          <br>
          Another approach to investigating the role that nuclear
          weapons may have played in the Cold War calm would be to
          control for other plausible explanations of war-avoidance
          during the period. Could a lack of intent to use military
          force for less than vital national objectives be a significant
          cause of the peace? How about an aversion to the devastating
          consequences of major conventional war by leaders and
          citizens, many of whom had experienced it twice in their
          lifetimes?13 Finally, can one dismiss completely the notions
          that major war became less likely as a result of shifts in the
          political orientation of national governments, growing
          economic and cultural interdependence, or advances in
          information, life-sciences and environmental technology?
          Certainly it is plausible that regional security alliances,
          ongoing East–West security dialogues and the evolution of
          European integration played a role in avoiding a third world
          war.14 These alternative explanations have not been
          exhaustively explored and they cannot be dismissed. That
          Western scholars and strategists since the Cold War have
          largely neglected them is unfortunate. This is not to say that
          nuclear weapons played no role in keeping the peace, but it is
          reasonable to conclude that the absence of major war between
          states during this period had multiple causes and it is
          possible that nuclear weapons played only a minor role. Yet no
          thorough, peer-reviewed scholarly effort has been conducted
          which attempts to assign and defend accurate weights or
          degrees of influence that the various causes may have played
          in the historical outcome.<br>
          <br>
          It is clearly unreasonable to assert that evidence supports
          the claim that nuclear deterrence was the major cause of
          war-avoidance. This assertion is a belief, unsupported by
          anything approaching a strong, clear body of historically
          documented evidence. In fact, there is little reason to claim
          that the long peace since the Second World War is any more
          likely a blessing of the nuclear age than the logical
          conclusion of a substantial historical process, and one for
          which, contrary to proponents of nuclear deterrence, there are
          earlier precedents. Some scholars challenge even the view that
          the post-war peace is a true historical anomaly that needs any
          special explanation.15 The problem with the strength of the
          belief that nuclear deterrence caused the so-called long peace
          is that it biases strategic thinking in a way that increases
          faith in the value of nuclear weapons without firm evidence.
          This perception of high value increases tolerance for the
          risks of nuclear deterrence.<br>
          <br>
          The historical evidence that has emerged since the end of the
          Cold War further weakens the argument that nuclear deterrence
          was the leading cause of peace. After studying the Soviet
          Union’s political and military archives and interviewing
          members of the General Staff, scholars have learned that there
          was never any intent on the part of the Soviet Union to invade
          Western Europe or attack the United States. Despite the fact
          that conventional wisdom in the West claimed that the Soviets
          were working on a nuclear force posture that would enable them
          to win a nuclear war, the Soviet military leadership actually
          considered victory to be unattainable in any meaningful sense.
          According to first-hand interviews conducted after 1991, the
          Soviet General Staff understood the devastation that would
          result from a nuclear war and therefore did not develop a
          working definition of victory.16 Ironically, but not
          unsurprisingly, the Soviets perceived the United States to be
          preparing for a first strike. This predominance of worst-case
          mirror-imaging, with both sides assuming the other believed it
          could win, and was therefore likely to start a nuclear war,
          challenges the claim that nuclear weapons tend to improve
          communication between adversaries. In the US–Soviet case, it
          appears that just the opposite was true. Rather than
          contributing to war-avoidance, it appears that the strategy of
          nuclear deterrence was largely irrelevant to deterring a major
          US–Soviet or NATO–Soviet war. Neither side ever saw an
          advantage in initiating such a conflict in the first place.17<br>
          <br>
          In addition to the uncertain contribution made by nuclear
          weapons to the absence of direct US–Soviet warfare during the
          Cold War, it is clear they have played a negligible role in
          the absence of conflict between Russia and the United States
          for the past 20 years. That peace is much more satisfactorily
          explained by the lack of fundamental political and ideological
          conflict and the development of a much greater range of mutual
          interests between the former adversaries. The low remaining
          risk of nuclear war between Russia and the United States is
          due far less to their nuclear deterrent relationship than it
          is to the inherent dangers of their continued deployment and
          operation of alert nuclear forces that are susceptible to
          accident, theft or inadvertent or unauthorised use.<br>
          <br>
          The contribution that nuclear weapons make today to deterring
          the most likely threats to the security of the United States
          and its allies is also dubious. America exists in a world
          where none of the other states possessing nuclear arms (with
          the possible exception of North Korea, the strength of whose
          rudimentary nuclear-weapons capabilities remains unknown) has
          state goals or conducts a foreign policy fundamentally hostile
          to the interests of the United States. Today, a terrorist
          attack is thought to be much more likely than an attack by
          another state. US nuclear weapons do not deter terrorist
          attacks. Al-Qaeda has attacked the United States, Great
          Britain, Pakistan, several NATO countries, and Israeli
          citizens and interests. Russia has also suffered terror
          attacks. All these states possess nuclear arms or are in
          alliance with nuclear powers.<br>
          <br>
          The existence of nuclear weapons in the age of global
          terrorism creates a very real security liability for all
          states. The key uncertainty in the current security
          environment is not whether nations will be attacked by
          terrorists and non-state actors but whether such actors will
          acquire the means to move from conventional to nuclear
          explosives, making their inevitable attacks of much greater
          consequence. To prevent nuclear attack by terrorists and
          sub-state actors, states must successfully devise a strategy
          of denying them the ability to acquire nuclear weapons.
          Current strategic trends run counter to this objective. More
          nuclear-weapons materials are being produced, more knowledge
          relevant to the construction of nuclear weapons is being
          dispersed, and terrorist organisations are becoming more
          interested in acquiring nuclear capabilities.<br>
          <br>
          The priorities and requirements of this approach are vastly
          different from a nuclear deterrent strategy. Such a strategy
          of denial places priority on achieving absolute minimal
          stockpiles of nuclear weapons and materials throughout the
          world and preventing their spread to other states, because
          that spread increases the likelihood that terrorists could
          acquire them. A denial strategy also emphasises the need for
          the most effective security possible for the nuclear weapons
          and nuclear materials that do exist. But perfect security for
          such items can never be achieved. In September 2007, for
          example, six cruise missiles armed with nuclear warheads were
          mistakenly carried on a B-52 strategic bomber from North
          Dakota to Louisiana, where they sat on a runway for hours
          without proper security because no one knew they were there.18
          Such incidents highlight the fact that the ultimate objective
          of a denial strategy is the elimination of all nuclear weapons
          and weapons-grade fissile materials so that there are none
          that could fall into terrorist hands. In seeking a world free
          of nuclear weapons, Obama is also seeking the security of a
          world with a drastically lower risk of nuclear terrorism.<br>
          <b><br>
            Weapons of caution and stability?<br>
          </b><br>
          Another claim made by advocates of nuclear deterrence is that
          it induces caution during crises, makes leaders more
          risk-adverse and more hesitant to take military action, and
          allows the resolution of crises before they escalate into
          major military exchanges.19 This is perhaps the hope Churchill
          had in mind when he said ‘safety will be the sturdy child of
          terror’. Belief in the ability of nuclear weapons to
          ameliorate historical shortcomings in the war-avoidance skills
          of national leaders grew during the Cold War as no major war
          broke out and several US–Soviet crises passed without the use
          of such weapons. This was accepted as evidence of the benefits
          of nuclear deterrence.<br>
          <br>
          But explanations of war-avoidance during these episodes based
          on post-Cold War historical research, including first-hand
          interviews with participants, have little to do with the
          theoretical operation of nuclear deterrence and much more to
          do with luck and personal judgement. Former Secretary of
          Defense Robert McNamara noted that the decision-making process
          in Washington, as well as in Moscow and Havana, during the
          Cuban Missile Crisis was characterised by ‘misinformation,
          miscalculation, and misjudgment’.20<br>
          <br>
          Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev’s decision to send to Cuba
          nuclear missiles that could strike the United States was a
          reckless, high-risk action, the sort of thing
          nuclear-deterrence theory predicts would be avoided. The
          Soviet Union knew by 1961 that the United States considered
          the Castro revolution to be a threat to US security and was
          willing to use military force to support counter-revolution.
          Moscow had also been informed by the United States that any
          Soviet transfer of offensive weaponry to Cuba would be
          opposed. Despite this, Khrushchev and his foreign minister,
          defence minister and commander of the Strategic Rocket Forces
          (all of whom understood the potential for nuclear war and its
          consequences) decided to offer nuclear missiles to Cuba.21
          Adding to the risk of this decision was the manner in which it
          was implemented. Offensive missiles and 162 nuclear warheads
          were secretly transported to the island beginning in July
          1962. Following growing concern about the intensifying
          Soviet–Cuban military relationship and the discovery of
          evidence that nuclear missiles might be headed to Cuba, US
          Attorney General Robert Kennedy met with Soviet Ambassador
          Anatoly Dobrynin in Washington on 4 September. Dobrynin told
          Kennedy that he was instructed by Khrushchev to assure the US
          side that no surface-to-surface or offensive missiles would be
          placed in Cuba. The same day President Kennedy made a public
          statement that ‘the gravest of issues would arise’ if any
          offensive missiles were installed in Cuba. Three days later
          Dobrynin repeated to US Ambassador Adlai Stevenson the Soviet
          pledge that no offensive weapons were being sent to Cuba.
          Soviet leaders had to know that their attempted deception of
          individuals directly involved in crisis decision-making would
          further raise the stakes and narrow the room for potential
          negotiation. The discovery of the deception was sure to add
          anger and personal betrayal to the atmosphere of objective
          crisis, making compromise or movement towards re-establishing
          even the slimmest element of mutual trust more difficult.<br>
          <br>
          Examples of Cold War misjudgement, misperception and poor
          communication are not limited to the Soviet side and did not
          stop after the Cuban Missile Crisis. In November 1983, US
          leadership and intelligence services failed to grasp the true
          extent of Soviet anxiety regarding events surrounding a NATO
          command exercise code-named Able Archer. The Soviet Union
          began preparations for a nuclear attack on the United States
          because its leaders believed they had persuasive indications
          that Washington was on the verge of launching a surprise
          nuclear attack against them. The clearest evidence of the
          failure of the US side to realise how genuinely alarmed the
          Soviets were regarding the possibility of a US–NATO first
          strike was the decision to add new features to the annual Able
          Archer exercise in November 1983, including participation of
          the US president and vice president and simulated
          communications with the UK and NATO command in a practice
          drill that took NATO forces through a full-scale simulated
          release of nuclear weapons against the Soviets.<br>
          <br>
          According to US intelligence sources, on the night of 8 or 9
          November KGB headquarters sent a flash cable to its
          intelligence officers in Western Europe advising them,
          incorrectly, that US forces in Europe had gone on alert and
          that troops at some bases were being mobilised. The cable
          speculated that the alert might be the beginning of a
          countdown to a surprise nuclear attack. According to Soviet
          and CIA sources, Soviet nuclear-capable aircraft in Poland and
          East Germany were placed on high alert status in response. In
          the following days the Soviets realised that there had been no
          actual alert of NATO forces, but they remained deeply
          concerned about US intentions and America’s potential to
          deliberately initiate a major war.<br>
          <br>
          Deterrence theory claims that the fear of nuclear devastation
          motivates military planners and political leaders to exercise
          caution and seek an accurate understanding of a nuclear
          rival’s intentions. The events surrounding Able Archer clearly
          cast doubt on this claim. The United States and its NATO
          allies either misperceived the Soviet sense of insecurity or
          deliberately ignored it. Had they been aware of Soviet fears
          and eager to moderate them, it is doubtful that some of the
          more alarming features such as the nuclear release drill would
          have been included in Able Archer 83.<br>
          <b><br>
            Underappreciated risks and costs<br>
          </b><br>
          It appears that the war scare that culminated with Able Archer
          83 was a case of mutual intelligence failure and leadership
          misperception, shortcomings that remain all too frequent in
          the post-Cold War era. The fact that it happened 33 years
          after the beginning of a nuclear deterrent relationship
          between the United States and Soviet Union and brought the
          chance of nuclear war closer than at any time since the Cuban
          Missile Crisis is evidence against the so-called benefits of
          nuclear deterrence on national decision-making. What if there
          are no such benefits? What if nuclear-armed nations are just
          as prone to stumbling into war or choosing to use military
          force as they were prior to the acquisition of nuclear
          weapons? The fundamental difference then would be the
          magnitude of risk carried by states that choose to rely on
          nuclear deterrence. If deterrence fails, millions, or even
          hundreds of millions of civilians can be killed in less than a
          day. Without nuclear weapons the consequences of military
          conflict, even between great powers, would not be nearly as
          severe. Sustained use of conventional weapons can be
          devastating, and nuclear weapons could eventually be
          reconstituted and used, but the time needed for either to
          happen at least presents an opportunity to end hostilities
          before cities are destroyed.<br>
          <br>
          Nuclear weapons also inhibit the development of positive
          relations between former rivals, as the unsteady progress in
          the development of positive US–Russian relations since the end
          of the Cold War demonstrates. How deeply can two nations
          engage as partners while still proclaiming the capability and
          willingness to destroy one another, just in case? To be sure,
          sources of tension other than opposing nuclear forces exist in
          the US–Russian relationship, but fundamental change would be
          needed in the area of nuclear strategy before a true
          partnership could be established. In the years ahead, the
          value of a true security partnership with Russia and China for
          both the United States and Europe is likely to be very high
          indeed.<br>
          <br>
          Current US nuclear posture with respect to Russia seems to be
          completely out of step with declared policy. In 1994, Russia
          and the United States reached a bilateral de-targeting
          agreement which stated that ‘for the first time since the dawn
          of the nuclear age – Russia and United States will not operate
          nuclear forces, day-to-day, in a manner that presumes they are
          adversaries’.22 But if Russia is not presumed to be a
          potential adversary, three fundamental features of the current
          US nuclear force structure and operating posture make little
          sense.<br>
          <br>
          Firstly, the force is too big. Without the need to target
          Russia’s strategic forces there simply are not enough
          plausible aim-points in the world for US nuclear weapons that
          would require 1,500–2,000 operationally deployed warheads. For
          example, in an extreme crisis, perhaps 50–100 nuclear weapons
          at most would be needed to threaten devastation on Iran, North
          Korea or China. Only Russia’s large and dispersed nuclear
          force has historically justified US forces totalling thousands
          of nuclear weapons. Secondly, there would be no need for
          alerted weapons. No country other than Russia has the
          capability to pre-empt the launch of US forces by destroying a
          significant portion of them on the ground. Thirdly, US nuclear
          weapons would not need the operational capability (in terms of
          accuracy and destructive yield) to limit damage to the United
          States by destroying Russian nuclear weapons at their
          protected bases before they could be launched.<br>
          <br>
          The inability of the United States and Russia to make more
          rapid progress on reducing nuclear weapons and increasing
          transparency regarding the roles and missions of remaining
          weapons has created a source of continued misperception and
          mistrust. America’s maintenance of large alerted nuclear
          forces, even as it develops strategic missile defences,
          naturally leads Russia to question America’s strategic
          intentions. Russia’s retention of thousands of older
          non-strategic nuclear weapons raises similar suspicions among
          the NATO Allies. Given the generally positive nature of the
          US–Russian relationship, the continued competitive mutual
          nuclear entanglement hinders the development of truly
          normalised relations. For example, there is no compelling
          reason why US and Russian nuclear forces could not be safely
          decoupled, with each nation building down to their own
          strategic comfort level. The resulting asymmetries need not
          create instability as long as the political relationship
          remains positive.<br>
          <br>
          The problem is that much of the US strategic community
          continues to perceive Russia as a potential adversary, despite
          pronouncements to the contrary. This limits their willingness
          to reduce US nuclear counterforce or damaging-limitation
          capabilities vis-à-vis Russian strategic forces and causes
          them to advocate the maintenance of numerically large US
          forces capable of prompt attacks. Those who support the
          maintenance of large, accurate, prompt-use nuclear forces
          claim that they are necessary as a hedge against the
          possibility of a resurgent hostile Russia. However, recent
          studies by the Department of Defense conclude that, even if
          Russia did turn adversarial and increase its nuclear forces in
          excess of US totals, the survivable capabilities of US forces
          would continue to provide the ability to answer a Russian
          attack with a devastating response.23 The Pentagon’s new
          national security strategy document asserts that the United
          States can meet all its deterrent goals with respect to the
          full range of potential adversaries with a smaller nuclear
          arsenal than it now possesses.24<br>
          <br>
          The continued reliance on large nuclear forces and Cold
          War-style nuclear deterrence has many costs. There is the cost
          in terms of hindering positive development of relations with
          Russia and China. The very risk of deterrence failure and the
          accompanying constant fear of annihilation impose an
          immeasurable psychological cost. If deterrence does fail, the
          resulting human suffering could be unparalleled. There is also
          a cost to efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to
          additional states and non-state actors. Embracing nuclear
          deterrence encourages proliferation. By concluding that the
          threat of nuclear use can help states manage a variety of
          threats to national security and stability, proponents of
          nuclear deterrence invite other states to seek nuclear weapons
          to secure similar purported benefits.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, there is the large financial cost of a nuclear
          deterrent. Maintaining its current arsenal of over 10,000
          nuclear warheads costs the United States approximately $31
          billion annually. By comparison, the combined US international
          diplomacy and foreign assistance budget is approximately $39bn
          per year.25 Current plans call for the modernisation of US
          nuclear weapons manufacturing infrastructure and the
          construction of a new generation of nuclear missiles, bombers
          and submarines. This will cost hundreds of billions of dollars
          over the next 20 years. In a prolonged era of fiscal
          constraint, and with the benefits of nuclear weapons
          uncertain, this level of expenditure is unjustifiable. But
          perhaps the greatest cost of continued reliance by most
          nuclear-armed states on a strategy of nuclear deterrence is
          that it mischaracterises the sources of danger in today’s
          world and distracts decision-makers from adequately preparing
          for the most likely future threats.<br>
          <b><br>
            Strategic oldthink<br>
            <br>
          </b>In the realist tradition of international relations
          theory, all nations are independent actors trying to maximise
          their power and security in an anarchical world.26 Nations
          initiate armed conflict as a means to advance or protect their
          interests because they calculate the benefits of using
          military force outweigh the risks of doing nothing in a
          competitive system. Proponents of nuclear deterrence argue
          that nuclear weapons changed the dynamics of this system by
          raising the stakes and uncertainties of using military force,
          making it less likely.27<br>
          <br>
          There are many problems with this view. Firstly, states
          possessing nuclear weapons have continued to use military
          force in situations that could have led them into conflict
          with other nuclear-armed nations. Nuclear weapons did not
          deter NATO from using force in Kosovo in the late 1990s or
          Russian military action in Georgia in 2008. Moreover, states
          without nuclear weapons have even attacked those who possess
          them, an outcome that flies in the face of the claims of
          deterrence proponents. Nuclear weapons did not deter Egypt and
          Syria from attacking Israel in 1973, Argentina from attacking
          British territory in the 1982 Falklands War or Iraq from
          attacking Israel during the 1991 Gulf War.<br>
          <br>
          Secondly, the theory of nuclear deterrence says little about
          how the roles of nuclear weapons might change in an
          ever-evolving international system. The nature of threats to
          individual nations and the stability of the international
          system have changed dramatically since the introduction of
          nuclear weapons. Examples of fundamental change include the
          end of the Cold War and the emergence of large-scale
          transnational terrorism. Another, more important change is the
          increased degree of international security interdependence.<br>
          <br>
          This increased interdependence is clear in the field of
          economics, but it has also been highlighted by advances in our
          scientific understanding of the interaction between the
          Earth’s natural systems and the patterns of modern
          civilisation. Nothing demonstrates this more clearly than our
          understanding of environmental science. A nation concerned
          about the economic, public-health and security consequences of
          atmospheric pollution, climate change, sea-level rise and
          diminishing supplies of fresh water can implement laws and
          policies that drastically reduce its pollution of air and
          water within its own borders. But such a strategy is futile,
          because the air above its borders and the water in its rivers
          and aquifers is well mixed with pollutants from surrounding
          nations. Only if all nations cooperate to reduce pollution can
          any one of them substantially benefit from the effort. The
          same is true for global disease pandemics and natural
          disasters. These security threats affect many nations
          simultaneously and individual national efforts to counter or
          address them cannot be fully effective.<br>
          <br>
          The interconnectedness of the issues of nuclear deterrence and
          transnational environmental threats has been demonstrated by
          two scientists, Alan Robock and Owen Brian Toon, who used
          computer modelling techniques to simulate the climatic
          consequences of a regional nuclear exchange between India and
          Pakistan. Their results show that even with the detonation of
          nuclear weapons limited to the territories of the two
          combatants, the smoke and dust raised into the atmosphere by
          the nuclear explosions would eventually circle the globe,
          killing crops and temporarily cooling the planet. Robock and
          Toon project that nearly a billion people would die, the vast
          majority civilians in nations outside the warring states.28
          The implication of this analysis is that all countries have a
          direct security interest in preventing nuclear war, anywhere.
          It would be perfectly reasonable for the US joint chiefs of
          staff to advise the secretary of defense and White House that
          in order to protect the security of the US population, the
          Pentagon must have the ability to forcibly prevent nuclear war
          between India and Pakistan, or any other two countries. This
          means that no matter what the reason for the war, or who
          initiated hostilities, the security of the United States would
          demand that Indian and Pakistani nuclear weapons be destroyed
          in flight or preemptively attacked on the ground before they
          could be detonated and cause a global climatic catastrophe
          that would kill thousands of Americans.<br>
          <br>
          The US military and much of the broader national-security
          community have recognised the seriousness of transnational
          threats such as global climate change. The US Department of
          Defense, for example, included climate threat as a key pillar
          of its most recent Quadrennial Defense Review and the CIA has
          established a Center for the Study of Climate Change. Despite
          this growing awareness, the response remains inadequate and
          the mechanisms for effective cooperation on transnational
          threats remain underdeveloped.29 If we fail to slow climate
          change or successfully adapt to its consequences, political
          and military crises are likely to result.30 Nuclear deterrence
          will be meaningless in these crises. Threats to use nuclear
          weapons will lack credibility because carrying them out would
          greatly worsen global environmental damage and its
          consequences for all states, including those who used nuclear
          weapons in an attempt to defend themselves or defeat their
          rivals.<br>
          <b><br>
            A teachable moment<br>
          </b><br>
          The destructive power of nuclear weapons can create an
          opportunity for a teachable moment unique in the history of
          human civilisation. The universal threat of nuclear war marks
          civilisation’s passage of a major milestone and reveals a
          fundamental truth of the modern international security
          environment. Technologically advanced nations have gained and
          will forever now possess multiple means to destroy one
          another. The number of nations with these capabilities will
          inevitably increase as technical knowledge and skill spread
          across the globe. Nuclear weapons may be only the first
          example of such a capability. New and more devastating means
          of human destruction may constantly appear as science and
          technology advance.<br>
          <br>
          We must learn that the greatest meaning of the nuclear
          revolution is that every government facing a nuclear-armed
          rival has been forced to conclude that ‘my adversaries’ sense
          of security is now my concern’, and integrate that
          understanding into strategy, force planning and operations.31
          Paradoxically, certain actions that might increase a state’s
          military capability against its rival are in fact contrary to
          its interests because they could panic that competitor into
          initiating nuclear war. This need to take the perceptions of
          an enemy into account and accommodate them for the sake of
          one’s own security is transformative.<br>
          <br>
          The nuclear paradox can help us learn by providing clarity for
          a valuable new understanding: the nearly instantaneous global
          reach of nuclear weapons and their widespread proliferation
          crystallises unlike any other human construction the fact that
          seeking security from a purely nationalist perspective is
          ineffective and unscientific. The physical, biological and
          environmental sciences increasingly reinforce this and tell us
          that there is no such thing as national security, there is
          only international or collective security. The alternative is
          collective insecurity.<br>
          <br>
          Nuclear weapons can only have a positive legacy if we learn
          from them. An international security system based the
          willingness of nations to commit mutual suicide to protect
          themselves has always been recognised as a sub-optimum
          solution to the security dilemma. It is fraught with great
          risk to the world’s nations and peoples and we should be
          ceaselessly striving for more rational and humane ways to
          achieve security. Nuclear disarmament has been pursued for
          more than 60 years and enshrined as a law-backed international
          goal not because it is the moralistic pipe-dream of the
          uninformed citizenry, but because many serious practitioners
          of international statecraft see it as an essential goal of a
          sustainable international order.32<br>
          <br>
          It is not beyond the capabilities of government leaders and
          institutions to internalise the understanding that major war
          between modern states can no longer produce security benefits.
          It is not necessary to continue living with the risks of
          nuclear deterrence in order reap the cautionary benefits
          bestowed by the knowledge that modern nations can destroy one
          another. President Ronald Reagan likened nuclear deterrence
          based on mutually assured destruction to ‘two cowboys in a
          frontier saloon aiming their guns at each other´s heads
          permanently’. This is why he concluded that ‘nuclear war
          cannot be won and must never be fought’.33<br>
          <b><br>
            The nuclear taboo<br>
          </b><br>
          Several scholars have argued that realist or traditional
          models of state behaviour cannot adequately explain the fact
          that nuclear weapons have not been used since 1945. They posit
          that a powerful norm or taboo against nuclear use has emerged.
          This taboo is based on the tradition of non-use, a growing
          understanding of the difficulty of achieving military aims
          with nuclear weapons and a deep moral revulsion to the
          indiscriminate destruction that nuclear weapons would bring
          upon human populations and the environment.34<br>
          <br>
          That such a taboo exists and has strengthened over the years
          is indeed an affirmation that the idea of using nuclear
          weapons in the name of national defence is viewed by most
          people as morally illegitimate and incompatible with basic
          human values. It is also welcome evidence of the existence and
          strength of those values. Unfortunately, many observers regard
          the nuclear taboo as a reason to believe that the risk of
          nuclear war is overblown. They are confident that, despite the
          vulnerability to unforeseen events and human and mechanical
          error, nuclear weapons will not be used because controls are
          adequate, cooler heads will prevail and no leader will want to
          violate the mores and norms of the nuclear taboo.<br>
          <br>
          Rather than being complacent with regard to existing reliance
          on nuclear weapons and the attendant risks to civilisation, an
          effort should be made to nurture and strengthen the taboo and
          extend it to cover all military conflict among or against
          nuclear-armed states. There is no compelling reason why
          governments can’t realise that launching major war between
          nuclear states carries such a high risk of leading to nuclear
          use that they must, in essence, treat it with equal opprobrium
          to nuclear use and adopt a taboo against major wars as well.
          Why do we need the day-to-day presence of the threat of
          nuclear destruction and the architecture that creates it to
          benefit from the taboo against initiating Armageddon?<br>
          <br>
          If human civilisation is to survive it must demonstrate that
          violent conflict between major states is avoidable. This is
          not a new or radical concept. It is the foundational principle
          of the United Nations Charter that has been signed by 192 of
          the world’s 195 nations. Reagan said that peace was not the
          absence of conflict but the ability to resolve conflict by
          peaceful means.<br>
          <br>
          Like chemical weapons, biological weapons, cluster munitions
          and anti-personnel landmines, nuclear weapons can be subjected
          to international regimes that seek to prevent particularly
          dangerous or inhumane technologies from being used for
          military purposes. The regimes banning these weapons, while
          not yet completely implemented, clearly demonstrate that it is
          possible to eliminate major classes of military technology and
          make their manufacture and use illegal. Giving up nuclear
          weapons is neither impossible nor more dangerous than the
          world we are living in and may indeed lead to a safer world.
          In essence, the idea of nuclear deterrence based on the threat
          of mutual destruction, or deterrence with any future
          indiscriminate weapon of mass destruction, must become
          universally taboo.<br>
          <br>
          The view that nuclear weapons needed to be eliminated was
          articulated as soon as they came into being, and the view that
          the ideology of nuclear deterrence is incompatible with basic
          human values and the positive development of human
          civilisation is also as old as nuclear weapons themselves.
          Most nations and people view nuclear weapons as a problem, not
          a solution. At least 30 countries that could build such
          weapons have chosen not to. Many of the bomb’s inventors,
          including Robert Oppenheimer, were deeply troubled by its
          potential destructiveness and argued against making it a
          cornerstone of national security. The vast majority of
          nations, 189 out of 195, have pledged never to acquire nuclear
          weapons under the 1970 Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty.<br>
          <br>
          Nuclear weapons should be eliminated because they will not
          make nations powerful in the twenty-first century and beyond.
          Their existence in the arsenals of the world creates the
          possibility of their use and the risks they create outweigh
          their value. The marginal contribution that nuclear deterrence
          now makes to the absence of major aggression between great
          powers is being purchased at too high a price. That price is
          the constant risk that a complex, tightly coupled and largely
          automated system subject to normal, systemic and human error
          will, as science tells us, inevitably fail, and fail
          catastrophically, with unprecedented and unjustified loss of
          civilian life. Mistakes with conventional weapons can have
          limited physical impact. Small mistakes are not possible with
          nuclear weapons.<br>
          <br>
          Nuclear weapons are useless for confronting and resolving the
          most likely future international security challenges, but
          steady progress towards the elimination of such weapons can
          help nations confront these transnational problems. The
          diplomatic and technical skills acquired through the creation
          of treaties and institutions to effectively verify the
          elimination of nuclear weapons from national arsenals can
          provide powerful models and experience for addressing other
          transnational threats. The elimination of nuclear weapons, a
          project that will require 25–35 years, can thus be an
          organising principle and set an example for the forms of
          international cooperation, laws and institutions that are
          required to manage other global challenges. Secondly,
          elimination of nuclear weapons will allow creative,
          intellectual, technical and financial resources now devoted to
          nuclear threats to be focused toward the resolution of
          transnational crises faced by all nations. As nuclear weapons
          are drawn down those resources can be re-focused toward
          developing clean energy, carbon-capture technologies, clean
          water management and low-impact, high-productivity
          agriculture.<br>
          <br>
          Nuclear weapons should be eliminated because there is a real
          historic opportunity to do so and because failing to do so
          will imperil current and future generations as they try to
          manage a host of inevitable global security problems.
          Transformation in the way states interact will be necessary
          before the last nuclear weapons are eliminated, but tangible
          progress toward nuclear disarmament cannot await the
          resolution of all international conflict. International
          conflict existed before nuclear weapons were invented,
          persists while states possess nuclear arsenals and will remain
          after nuclear weapons are eliminated from those arsenals.<br>
          <br>
          Obama said in Prague that the elimination of nuclear weapons
          might not be achieved in his lifetime, but 2045 – 34 years
          from now, when Obama will be 84 – will mark the 100th
          anniversary of the atomic bombing of Japan. Three-and-a-half
          decades is time enough for the world to transition away from
          the ideology of nuclear deterrence and to dismantle the system
          of nuclear forces deployed in the name of national defence.
          Each passing year will bring the need to support Obama’s
          vision of a world free of nuclear weapons more sharply into
          focus. The international community has the opportunity to
          honour the memory of the victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by
          eliminating nuclear weapons from the arsenals of the world
          within a century after they were unleashed.<br>

          5 Churchill’s last speech is entitled ‘Never Despair’. It was
          given to the House of Commons on 1 March 1955 and is available

          <br>
          6 While inadvertent or unintended use by the attacker is not a
          classic failure of deterrence, its possibility can be regarded
          as evidence of a vulnerability of deterrent systems. If
          decision-makers are so rationally averse to nuclear war they
          should only accept technical systems that have no potential
          for error or malicious tampering. Unfortunately, such systems
          do not exist. Furthermore, it will not much matter to the
          victim of a nuclear attack that it was an accident. The desire
          to retaliate will be overwhelming and under current doctrine
          retaliation may even be initiated before the accidentally
          launched weapons detonate.<br>

          They’ve Ever Made Love With</b><br>
        <b>by Daisy Magnum</b><br>

      <b><br>
      </b>Women "harvest" every male's DNA, according to a new study.<br>
      <br>
      Women retain and carry living DNA from every man with whom they
      have sexual intercourse.<br>
      <br>
      This bombshell discovery has been unearthed during a brand-new
      study by the University of Seattle and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
      Research Center.<br>
      <br>
      The scientific study actually discovered the shocking information
      by accident.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists were initially attempting to identify whether ladies
      who were pregnant with a son are more susceptible to specific
      neurological illnesses that take place more regularly in males.<br>
      <br>
      But as the scientists picked apart the female brain, the research
      study began to drift hugely off course.<b><br>
        <br>
        Women harvest DNA<br>
        <br>
      </b>What they actually found, however, is that the female brain is
      far more complex than we previously believed.<br>
      <br>
      The research study found that female brains typically harvest
      “male microchimerism.”...<br>
      <br>
      According to the research, the study reports:<br>
      “63% of the females (37 of 59) tested harbored male microchimerism
      in the brain.<br>
      “Male microchimerism was present in multiple brain regions.”<br>
      “CONCLUSIONS: Male microchimerism was not irregular in females
      without sons.<br>
      “Besides known pregnancies, other possible sources of male
      microchimerism include unrecognized spontaneous abortion,
      disappeared male twin, an older sibling transferred by the
      maternal blood circulation, or SEXUAL INTERCOURSE.<br>
      “Male microchimerism was substantially more frequent and levels
      were greater in ladies with induced abortion than in women with
      other pregnancy histories.<br>
      “More research studies are needed to figure out specific origins
      of male microchimerism in women.”<b><br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;Koen comments:<br>
        <br>
      </b>...The crucial points are false. What the study found was
      specifically that male microchimerism can occur in pregnancy and
      in some cases possibly also from direct blood contact.<br>
      The article as it is on your pages now claims that the study
      showed this could also happen by sexual intercourse and also in
      women who had never been pregnant. However, that is not at all
      what the real study says. In all cases there had been a pregnancy
      or actual blood transfer. The study does not even mention sexual
      intercourse, nor does it ever mention the "collection" of male dna
      from earlier&nbsp; sexual partners. Not once. <br>
      I don't know who brewed that batch of nonsense but it's just
      crock. <br>
      No, in fact, the actual study only says that micro-chymerism of
      cells originating in&nbsp; male embryo can and do occur in their
      mothers, and sometimes possibly in twins of which the male embryo
      is re-absorbed by the female embryo in the womb. Now this last way
      is in fact the common way for chymerism to take place in mammals.
      <br>
      And the former is also not surprising, after all we know that
      babys can absorb stem-cells from their mother through either
      umbillical blood or even through breast milk. So why would it be
      surprising that stem-cells from the embryo also flow back into the
      mother during pregnancy? <br>
      There were indeed a few women who had never given birth to a son
      in the study, but that doesn't mean there was never a male embryo
      to exchange cells with. Re-absorption of the embryo does happen in
      nature.<b><br>

      <div align="center"><i>With an atomic structure resembling a
          Japanese basketweaving pattern, “kagome metal” exhibits
          exotic, quantum behavior.</i><i><br>
        </i><br>
        <b>by Jennifer Chu</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>A motif of Japanese basketweaving known as the kagome pattern
      has preoccupied physicists for decades. Kagome baskets are
      typically made from strips of bamboo woven into a highly
      symmetrical pattern of interlaced, corner-sharing triangles.<br>
      <br>
      If a metal or other conductive material could be made to resemble
      such a kagome pattern at the atomic scale, with individual atoms
      arranged in similar triangular patterns, it should in theory
      exhibit exotic electronic properties. <br>
      <br>
      In a paper published today in Nature, physicists from MIT, Harvard
      University, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory report that
      they have for the first time produced a kagome metal — an
      electrically conducting crystal, made from layers of iron and tin
      atoms, with each atomic layer arranged in the repeating pattern of
      a kagome lattice.<br>
      <br>
      When they flowed a current across the kagome layers within the
      crystal, the researchers observed that the triangular arrangement
      of atoms induced strange, quantum-like behaviors in the passing
      current. Instead of flowing straight through the lattice,
      electrons instead veered, or bent back within the lattice.<br>
      <br>
      This behavior is a three-dimensional cousin of the so-called
      Quantum Hall effect, in which electrons flowing through a
      two-dimensional material will exhibit a “chiral, topological
      state,” in which they bend into tight, circular paths and flow
      along edges without losing energy.<br>
      <br>
      “By constructing the kagome network of iron, which is inherently
      magnetic, this exotic behavior persists to room temperature and
      higher,” says Joseph Checkelsky, assistant professor of physics at
      MIT. “The charges in the crystal feel not only the magnetic fields
      from these atoms, but also a purely quantum-mechanical magnetic
      force from the lattice. This could lead to perfect conduction,
      akin to superconductivity, in future generations of materials.”<br>
      <br>
      To explore these findings, the team measured the energy spectrum
      within the crystal, using a modern version of an effect first
      discovered by Heinrich Hertz and explained by Einstein, known as
      the photoelectric effect. <br>
      <br>
      “Fundamentally, the electrons are first ejected from the
      material’s surface and are then detected as a function of takeoff
      angle and kinetic energy,” says Riccardo Comin, an assistant
      professor of physics at MIT. “The resulting images are a very
      direct snapshot of the electronic levels occupied by electrons,
      and in this case they revealed the creation of nearly massless
      ‘Dirac’ particles, an electrically charged version of photons, the
      quanta of light.”<br>
      <br>
      The spectra revealed that electrons flow through the crystal in a
      way that suggests the originally massless electrons gained a
      relativistic mass, similar to particles known as massive Dirac
      fermions. Theoretically, this is explained by the presence of the
      lattice’s constituent iron and tin atoms. The former are magnetic
      and give rise to a “handedness,” or chirality. The latter possess
      a heavier nuclear charge, producing a large local electric field.
      As an external current flows by, it senses the tin’s field not as
      an electric field but as a magnetic one, and bends away.<br>
      <br>
      The research team was led by Checkelsky and Comin, as well as
      graduate students Linda Ye and Min Gu Kang in collaboration with
      Liang Fu, the Biedenharn Associate Professor of Physics, and
      postdoc Junwei Liu. The team also includes Christina Wicker ’17,
      research scientist Takehito Suzuki of MIT, Felix von Cube and
      David Bell of Harvard, and Chris Jozwiak, Aaron Bostwick, and Eli
      Rotenberg of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.<b><br>
        <br>
        “No alchemy required”<br>
        <br>
      </b>Physicists have theorized for decades that electronic
      materials could support exotic Quantum Hall behavior with their
      inherent magnetic character and lattice geometry. It wasn’t until
      several years ago that researchers made progress in realizing such
      materials.<br>
      <br>
      “The community realized, why not make the system out of something
      magnetic, and then the system’s inherent magnetism could perhaps
      drive this behavior,” says Checkelsky, who at the time was working
      as a researcher at the University of Tokyo. <br>
      <br>
      This eliminated the need for laboratory produced fields, typically
      1 million times as strong as the Earth’s magnetic field, needed to
      observe this behavior. <br>
      <br>
      “Several research groups were able to induce a Quantum Hall effect
      this way, but still at ultracold temperatures a few degrees above
      absolute zero — the result of shoehorning magnetism into a
      material where it did not naturally occur,” Checkelsky says. <br>
      <br>
      At MIT, Checkelsky has instead looked for ways to drive this
      behavior with “instrinsic magnetism.” A key insight, motivated by
      the doctoral work of Evelyn Tang PhD ’15 and Professor Xiao-Gang
      Wen, was to seek this behavior in the kagome lattice. To do so,
      first author Ye ground together iron and tin, then heated the
      resulting powder in a furnace, producing crystals at about 750
      degrees Celsius — the temperature at which iron and tin atoms
      prefer to arrange in a kagome-like pattern. She then submerged the
      crystals in an ice bath to enable the lattice patterns to remain
      stable at room temperature.<br>
      <br>
      “The kagome pattern has big empty spaces that might be easy to
      weave by hand, but are often unstable in crystalline solids which
      prefer the best packing of atoms,” Ye says. “The trick here was to
      fill these voids with a second type of atom in a structure that
      was at least stable at high temperatures. Realizing these quantum
      materials doesn’t need alchemy, but instead materials science and
      patience.”<b><br>
        <br>
        Bending and skipping toward zero-energy loss<br>
        <br>
      </b>Once the researchers grew several samples of crystals, each
      about a millimeter wide, they handed the samples off to
      collaborators at Harvard, who imaged the individual atomic layers
      within each crystal using transmission electron microscopy. The
      resulting images revealed that the arrangement of iron and tin
      atoms within each layer resembled the triangular patterns of the
      kagome lattice. Specifically, iron atoms were positioned at the
      corners of each triangle, while a single tin atom sat within the
      larger hexagonal space created between the interlacing triangles.<br>
      <br>
      Ye then ran an electric current through the crystalline layers and
      monitored their flow via electrical voltages they produced. She
      found that the charges deflected in a manner that seemed
      two-dimensional, despite the three-dimensional nature of the
      crystals. The definitive proof came from the photoelectron
      experiments conducted by co-first author Kang who, in concert with
      the LBNL team, was able to show that the electronic spectra
      corresponded to effectively two-dimensional electrons. <br>
      <br>
      “As we looked closely at the electronic bands, we noticed
      something unusual,” Kang adds. “The electrons in this magnetic
      material behaved as massive Dirac particles, something that had
      been predicted long ago but never been seen before in these
      systems.”<br>
      <br>
      “The unique ability of this material to intertwine magnetism and
      topology suggests that they may well engender other emergent
      phenomena,” Comin says. “Our next goal is to detect and manipulate
      the edge states which are the very consequence of the topological
      nature of these newly discovered quantum electronic phases.” <br>
      <br>
      Looking further, the team is now investigating ways to stabilize
      other more highly two-dimensional kagome lattice structures. Such
      materials, if they can be synthesized, could be used to explore
      not only devices with zero energy loss, such as dissipationless
      power lines, but also applications toward quantum computing.<br>
      <br>
      “For new directions in quantum information science there is a
      growing interest in novel quantum circuits with pathways that are
      dissipationless and chiral,” Checkelsky says. “These kagome metals
      offer a new materials design pathway to realizing such new
      platforms for quantum circuitry.”<br>

      <b>Abstract<br>
        <br>
      </b>The kagome lattice is a two-dimensional network of
      corner-sharing triangles1 that is known to host exotic quantum
      magnetic states2,3,4. Theoretical work has predicted that kagome
      lattices may also host Dirac electronic states5 that could lead to
      topological6 and Chern7 insulating phases, but these states have
      so far not been detected in experiments. Here we study the
      d-electron kagome metal Fe3Sn2, which is designed to support bulk
      massive Dirac fermions in the presence of ferromagnetic order. We
      observe a temperature-independent intrinsic anomalous Hall
      conductivity that persists above room temperature, which is
      suggestive of prominent Berry curvature from the
      time-reversal-symmetry-breaking electronic bands of the kagome
      plane. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe
      a pair of quasi-two-dimensional Dirac cones near the Fermi level
      with a mass gap of 30 millielectronvolts, which correspond to
      massive Dirac fermions that generate Berry-curvature-induced Hall
      conductivity. We show that this behaviour is a consequence of the
      underlying symmetry properties of the bilayer kagome lattice in
      the ferromagnetic state and the atomic spin–orbit coupling. This
      work provides evidence for a ferromagnetic kagome metal and an
      example of emergent topological electronic properties in a
      correlated electron system. Our results provide insight into the
      recent discoveries of exotic electronic behaviour in
      kagome-lattice antiferromagnets8,9,10 and may enable lattice-model
      realizations of fractional topological quantum states11,12.<br>

      </b>White spot lesions (WSL) and incipient caries on enamel
      surfaces are the earliest clinical outcomes for demineralization
      and caries. If left untreated, the caries can progress and may
      cause complex restorative procedures or even tooth extraction
      which destroys soft and hard tissue architecture as a consequence
      of connective tissue and bone loss. Current clinical practices are
      insufficient in treating dental caries. A long-standing practical
      challenge associated with demineralization related to dental
      diseases is incorporating a functional mineral microlayer which is
      fully integrated into the molecular structure of the tooth in
      repairing damaged enamel. This study demonstrates that small
      peptide domains derived from native protein amelogenin can be
      utilized to construct a mineral layer on damaged human enamel in
      vitro. Six groups were prepared to carry out remineralization on
      artificially created lesions on enamel: (1) no treatment, (2) Ca2+
      and PO43– only, (3) 1100 ppm fluoride (F), (4) 20?000 ppm F, (5)
      1100 ppm F and peptide, and (6) peptide alone. While the 1100 ppm
      F sample (indicative of common F content of toothpaste for
      homecare) did not deliver F to the thinly deposited mineral layer,
      high F test sample (indicative of clinical varnish treatment)
      formed mainly CaF2 nanoparticles on the surface. Fluoride,
      however, was deposited in the presence of the peptide, which also
      formed a thin mineral layer which was partially crystallized as
      fluorapatite. Among the test groups, only the peptide-alone sample
      resulted in remineralization of fairly thick (10 µm) dense
      mineralized layer containing HAp mineral, resembling the structure
      of the healthy enamel. The newly formed mineralized layer
      exhibited integration with the underlying enamel as evident by
      cross-sectional imaging. The peptide-guided remineralization
      approach sets the foundation for future development of biomimetic
      products and treatments for dental health care.<br>

        Inventor(s):&nbsp; SARIKAYA et al.<br>
        <br>
        BACKGROUND<br>
        <br>
      </b>Accumulation of various chromogcns/discolorants, for example,
      food and tobacco that come into contact daily onto tooth surfaces
      and their subsequent penetration into deeper regions (dentin),
      cause tooth discoloration. Furthermore, the process of aging,
      disease, trauma, certain medications, certain congenital
      conditions, and environmental effects can also cause teeth to
      become discolored. Although discolored teeth do not cause health
      problems, since bright white teem arc usually considered to be
      cosmetically desirable, there is a great deal of interest in
      developing compositions and methods for whitening teeth.<br>
      <br>
      There arc several techniques for whitening or bleaching of teeth.
      Professional whitening methods, also known as "in-clinic"
      whitening strategics, arc considered presently as the most
      effective methods. These in-clinic whitening strategies typically
      involve the application of high-concentration peroxide products
      (up to 35%) and other abrasive chemicals to the discolored area.
      These peroxide species penetrate the stained area (up to
      underlying dentin layer) and dissolve the accumulated discoloring
      agents through an oxidation process. To achieve desired effects
      more quickly, such oxidation reactions on teeth arc often assisted
      with external laser light application, which heats up the reaction
      site and thereby increases the rate oxidation reaction.
      Furthermore, utilization of titanium dioxide up to 10% is often
      preferred to facilitate these photo- catalytic reactions. Other
      in-clinic whitening techniques involve superficially removing the
      enamel layer with abrasive instruments or pumice followed by
      treatment with additional caustic agents.<br>
      <br>
      There arc several drawbacks of these in-clinic techniques. First
      of all, the abrasive chemicals and peroxide agents causes enamel
      demoralization and results with teeth sensitivity. In most cases
      sorc/injurcd gums as well as bad taste of the product itself cause
      much discomfort to the patients. Further, patients arc required to
      make a clinic appointment to get this medical service.<br>
      <br>
      Other existing products for at-home use contain considerably lower<br>
      <br>
      concentrations of active oxidizing agents and, thus, arc generally
      less effective than in- clinic whitening strategics and products.
      Therefore, dramatic whitening effect can only be achieved by the
      repeated applications of these reagents for several weeks. These
      treatments often assisted with bleaching trays (night-guard) in
      order to better localize bleaching products and, thereby, maximize
      the whitening effect However, even though these at home products
      contain active whitening agents in lower concentrations, similar
      side effects as those associated with professional treatments arc
      very common. In addition, there arc paint-on, at-home whitening
      products, also known as "tooth varnishes", as well as whitening
      strips intended to eliminate the need for dental trays. However,
      these products require more frequent applications, usually 3-timcs
      in a day, to complete whitening procedure. Finally, among the
      variety of at-home use products, whitening toothpastes and gels
      are the least effective form of whitening products due to their
      short contact time with the tooth surfaces. Although bleaching
      agent additives augment the effectiveness, the whitening effect is
      primarily as a result of removal of surface stains via mechanical
      action of brushing and other polishing ingredients (for example,
      silica particles).<br>
      <br>
      Dental caries is one of the major public health problems and it is
      a highly prevalent disease among the global population. Incipient
      caries and white spot lesions (WSL) as well as hypersensitivity,
      arc the earliest clinical evidence of enamel dcmincralization and
      dental caries. Dental caries occurs when tooth enamel is exposed
      to acid produced by cariogenic bacteria. As a result, acid
      diffuses into surface enamel and dissolves hydroxyapatite (HAp)
      mineral. Due to its non-rcgenerative nature, enamel is unable to
      heal and repair itself post-dcmincralization. Traditionally,
      fluoride (F) has been used as the key agent in prevention of
      caries. Fluoride functions primarily via topical mechanisms. It is
      believed that fluoride forms a thin layer of new but harder
      mineral, namely fluorapatitc (FAp) which is incorporated into the
      existing HAp mineral on the tooth surface. There is a trend of
      enhancing the rcmincralization effect of fluoride with calcium and
      phosphate supplementation in high risk individuals. Although
      controversial, the use of fluoride products remains the primary
      treatment modality for caries prevention and rcmincralization,
      with major limitations regarding the efficacy of these products
      for the reversal or prevention of dental caries. Fluoride delivery
      systems, therefore, arc not sufficient to overcome the high caries
      risk especially in younger and elderly population.<br>
      <br>
      There is presently an unmet need for tooth whitening and
      mineralization methods and products that reduce or eliminate the
      need for concentrated, abrasive oxidizing agents and attendant
      side effects such as dcmincralization-associatcd tooth sensitivity
      and gum line injuries.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
        <br>
      </b>Herein we provide methods and compositions for whitening teeth
      where the natural color of teeth is restored and improved upon by
      generating newly formed thin mineral layer on discolored tooth
      surface using one or more biomineralizing<br>
      <br>
      polypeptides. Herein we also provide methods and compositions for
      mineralizing teeth.<br>

      In a first aspect, the present application provides a method for
      whitening teeth, comprising administering to a subject in need
      thereof an amount effective to whiten the teeth of a

      </b>Conclusion &amp; Significance: We developed a peptide-based
      aqueous mineralization methodology to treat dental
      hypersensitivity by forming a continuous mineral layer on the
      exposed dentin of human teeth in vitro. This biomimctic treatment
      provides a unique solution to dentinal hypersensitivity which can
      be used as a platform technology for in- clinic and
      over-the-counter hypersensitivity treatments. <br>

        <br>
      </b>Aims: The dangerous portion of ultraviolet radiation is widely
      believed to be completely absorbed by the atmosphere before
      reaching Earth’s surface. Our objective is to make multiple
      measurements at Earth’s surface of the solar irradiance spectrum
      in the range 200-400 nm. <br>
      <br>
      Methods: We made numerous measurements of the solar irradiance
      " spectrum in the range 200-400 nm at an elevation
      of 56 m with International Light Technologies ILT950UV Spectral
      Radiometer mounted on a Meade LXD55 auto guider telescope tripod
      and mount assembly.<br>
      <br>
      Results: Our multifold measurements of solar irradiance spectra
      demonstrate conclusively that all wavelengths in the spectral
      range 200-400 nm reach Earth’s surface, contrary to the widespread
      perception that all UV-C and the majority of UV-B never reach the
      surface. We confirm the surface UV-C measurements of D’Antoni et
      al. (2007) that were disputed, based on faulty computer model
      calculations of atmospheric ozone, and thereafter ignored by the
      geoscience community.<br>
      <br>
      Conclusions: The veracity of our data and D’Antoni et al. (2007)’s
      data call into question the validity of atmospheric ozone models.
      Further, we call into question the simplistic supposition of the
      Montreal Protocol that chloro-fluoro-hydrocarbons are the primary
      cause of ozone depletion, and point to the very heavy burden of
      halogens introduced into the atmosphere by ongoing jet-sprayed
      coal-fly-ash geoengineering. We demonstrate that satellite-based
      LISIRD solar spectra irradiance at the top of the atmosphere is
      badly flawed with some regions of the spectrum being less intense
      than measured at Earth’s surface. That calls into question any
      calculations made utilizing LISIRD data. We provide introductory
      information on the devastating effects of UV-B and UV-C on humans,
      phytoplankton, coral, insects and plants. These will be discussed
      in greater detail in subsequent articles.<br>

      in the military to become a military “officer,” which is quite a
      contrast from the mere nine months it takes for a police officer
      to earn the title. But according to a group of 10 former Austin

      just like the military, the Austin PD is training&nbsp; “warriors”
      instead of “guardians.”<br>

          Japanese basketweaving pattern, “kagome metal” exhibits
          exotic, quantum behavior.</i><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><b>Jennifer Chu</b> | MIT News Office, March
        19, 2018<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A motif of Japanese basketweaving known as the kagome pattern has
      preoccupied physicists for decades. Kagome baskets are typically
      made from strips of bamboo woven into a highly symmetrical pattern
      of interlaced, corner-sharing triangles.<br>
      <br>
      If a metal or other conductive material could be made to resemble
      such a kagome pattern at the atomic scale, with individual atoms
      arranged in similar triangular patterns, it should in theory
      exhibit exotic electronic properties. <br>
      <br>
      In a paper published today in Nature, physicists from MIT, Harvard
      University, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory report that
      they have for the first time produced a kagome metal — an
      electrically conducting crystal, made from layers of iron and tin
      atoms, with each atomic layer arranged in the repeating pattern of
      a kagome lattice.<br>
      <br>
      When they flowed a current across the kagome layers within the
      crystal, the researchers observed that the triangular arrangement
      of atoms induced strange, quantum-like behaviors in the passing
      current. Instead of flowing straight through the lattice,
      electrons instead veered, or bent back within the lattice.<br>
      <br>
      This behavior is a three-dimensional cousin of the so-called
      Quantum Hall effect, in which electrons flowing through a
      two-dimensional material will exhibit a “chiral, topological
      state,” in which they bend into tight, circular paths and flow
      along edges without losing energy.<br>
      <br>
      “By constructing the kagome network of iron, which is inherently
      magnetic, this exotic behavior persists to room temperature and
      higher,” says Joseph Checkelsky, assistant professor of physics at
      MIT. “The charges in the crystal feel not only the magnetic fields
      from these atoms, but also a purely quantum-mechanical magnetic
      force from the lattice. This could lead to perfect conduction,
      akin to superconductivity, in future generations of materials.”<br>
      <br>
      To explore these findings, the team measured the energy spectrum
      within the crystal, using a modern version of an effect first
      discovered by Heinrich Hertz and explained by Einstein, known as
      the photoelectric effect. <br>
      <br>
      “Fundamentally, the electrons are first ejected from the
      material’s surface and are then detected as a function of takeoff
      angle and kinetic energy,” says Riccardo Comin, an assistant
      professor of physics at MIT. “The resulting images are a very
      direct snapshot of the electronic levels occupied by electrons,
      and in this case they revealed the creation of nearly massless
      ‘Dirac’ particles, an electrically charged version of photons, the
      quanta of light.”<br>
      <br>
      The spectra revealed that electrons flow through the crystal in a
      way that suggests the originally massless electrons gained a
      relativistic mass, similar to particles known as massive Dirac
      fermions. Theoretically, this is explained by the presence of the
      lattice’s constituent iron and tin atoms. The former are magnetic
      and give rise to a “handedness,” or chirality. The latter possess
      a heavier nuclear charge, producing a large local electric field.
      As an external current flows by, it senses the tin’s field not as
      an electric field but as a magnetic one, and bends away.<br>
      <br>
      The research team was led by Checkelsky and Comin, as well as
      graduate students Linda Ye and Min Gu Kang in collaboration with
      Liang Fu, the Biedenharn Associate Professor of Physics, and
      postdoc Junwei Liu. The team also includes Christina Wicker ’17,
      research scientist Takehito Suzuki of MIT, Felix von Cube and
      David Bell of Harvard, and Chris Jozwiak, Aaron Bostwick, and Eli
      Rotenberg of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.<br>
      <br>
      “No alchemy required”<br>
      <br>
      Physicists have theorized for decades that electronic materials
      could support exotic Quantum Hall behavior with their inherent
      magnetic character and lattice geometry. It wasn’t until several
      years ago that researchers made progress in realizing such
      materials.<br>
      <br>
      “The community realized, why not make the system out of something
      magnetic, and then the system’s inherent magnetism could perhaps
      drive this behavior,” says Checkelsky, who at the time was working
      as a researcher at the University of Tokyo. <br>
      <br>
      This eliminated the need for laboratory produced fields, typically
      1 million times as strong as the Earth’s magnetic field, needed to
      observe this behavior. <br>
      <br>
      “Several research groups were able to induce a Quantum Hall effect
      this way, but still at ultracold temperatures a few degrees above
      absolute zero — the result of shoehorning magnetism into a
      material where it did not naturally occur,” Checkelsky says. <br>
      <br>
      At MIT, Checkelsky has instead looked for ways to drive this
      behavior with “instrinsic magnetism.” A key insight, motivated by
      the doctoral work of Evelyn Tang PhD ’15 and Professor Xiao-Gang
      Wen, was to seek this behavior in the kagome lattice. To do so,
      first author Ye ground together iron and tin, then heated the
      resulting powder in a furnace, producing crystals at about 750
      degrees Celsius — the temperature at which iron and tin atoms
      prefer to arrange in a kagome-like pattern. She then submerged the
      crystals in an ice bath to enable the lattice patterns to remain
      stable at room temperature.<br>
      <br>
      “The kagome pattern has big empty spaces that might be easy to
      weave by hand, but are often unstable in crystalline solids which
      prefer the best packing of atoms,” Ye says. “The trick here was to
      fill these voids with a second type of atom in a structure that
      was at least stable at high temperatures. Realizing these quantum
      materials doesn’t need alchemy, but instead materials science and
      patience.”<br>
      <br>
      Bending and skipping toward zero-energy loss<br>
      <br>
      Once the researchers grew several samples of crystals, each about
      a millimeter wide, they handed the samples off to collaborators at
      Harvard, who imaged the individual atomic layers within each
      crystal using transmission electron microscopy. The resulting
      images revealed that the arrangement of iron and tin atoms within
      each layer resembled the triangular patterns of the kagome
      lattice. Specifically, iron atoms were positioned at the corners
      of each triangle, while a single tin atom sat within the larger
      hexagonal space created between the interlacing triangles.<br>
      <br>
      Ye then ran an electric current through the crystalline layers and
      monitored their flow via electrical voltages they produced. She
      found that the charges deflected in a manner that seemed
      two-dimensional, despite the three-dimensional nature of the
      crystals. The definitive proof came from the photoelectron
      experiments conducted by co-first author Kang who, in concert with
      the LBNL team, was able to show that the electronic spectra
      corresponded to effectively two-dimensional electrons. <br>
      <br>
      “As we looked closely at the electronic bands, we noticed
      something unusual,” Kang adds. “The electrons in this magnetic
      material behaved as massive Dirac particles, something that had
      been predicted long ago but never been seen before in these
      systems.”<br>
      <br>
      “The unique ability of this material to intertwine magnetism and
      topology suggests that they may well engender other emergent
      phenomena,” Comin says. “Our next goal is to detect and manipulate
      the edge states which are the very consequence of the topological
      nature of these newly discovered quantum electronic phases.” <br>
      <br>
      Looking further, the team is now investigating ways to stabilize
      other more highly two-dimensional kagome lattice structures. Such
      materials, if they can be synthesized, could be used to explore
      not only devices with zero energy loss, such as dissipationless
      power lines, but also applications toward quantum computing.<br>
      <br>
      “For new directions in quantum information science there is a
      growing interest in novel quantum circuits with pathways that are
      dissipationless and chiral,” Checkelsky says. “These kagome metals
      offer a new materials design pathway to realizing such new
      platforms for quantum circuitry.”<br>

      Foundation and the National Science Foundation.<br>

      </b><br>
      The kagome lattice is a two-dimensional network of corner-sharing
      triangles1 that is known to host exotic quantum magnetic
      states2,3,4. Theoretical work has predicted that kagome lattices
      may also host Dirac electronic states5 that could lead to
      topological6 and Chern7 insulating phases, but these states have
      so far not been detected in experiments. Here we study the
      d-electron kagome metal Fe3Sn2, which is designed to support bulk
      massive Dirac fermions in the presence of ferromagnetic order. We
      observe a temperature-independent intrinsic anomalous Hall
      conductivity that persists above room temperature, which is
      suggestive of prominent Berry curvature from the
      time-reversal-symmetry-breaking electronic bands of the kagome
      plane. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe
      a pair of quasi-two-dimensional Dirac cones near the Fermi level
      with a mass gap of 30 millielectronvolts, which correspond to
      massive Dirac fermions that generate Berry-curvature-induced Hall
      conductivity. We show that this behaviour is a consequence of the
      underlying symmetry properties of the bilayer kagome lattice in
      the ferromagnetic state and the atomic spin–orbit coupling. This
      work provides evidence for a ferromagnetic kagome metal and an
      example of emergent topological electronic properties in a
      correlated electron system. Our results provide insight into the
      recent discoveries of exotic electronic behaviour in
      kagome-lattice antiferromagnets8,9,10 and may enable lattice-model
      realizations of fractional topological quantum states11,12.<br>

      Itinerant electrons in a two-dimensional kagome lattice form a

      symmetries are broken by various periodic perturbations this
      semimetal is shown to spawn interesting nonmagnetic insulating
      phases. These include a two-dimensional topological insulator with
      a nontrivial Z2 invariant and robust gapless edge states, as well
      as dimerized and trimerized “Kekulé” insulators. The latter two
      are topologically trivial but the Kekulé phase possesses a complex
      order parameter with fractionally charged vortex excitations. A
      charge-density wave is shown to couple to the Dirac fermions as an

        <b>T Kida, et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      The kagome-bilayer material Fe3Sn2 has recently been shown to be
      an example of a rare class of magnet—a frustrated ferromagnetic
      metal. While the magnetism of Fe3Sn2 appears to be relatively
      simple at high temperature, with localized moments parallel to the
      c-axis (TC = 640 K), upon cooling the competing exchange
      interactions and spin frustration become apparent as they cause
      the moments to become non-collinear and to rotate towards the
      kagome plane, forming firstly a canted ferromagnetic structure and
      then a re-entrant spin glass (T_{\mathrm {f}}\simeq 80&nbsp; K).<br>
      <br>
      In this work we show that Fe3Sn2 possesses an unusual anomalous
      Hall effect. The saturated Hall resistivity of Fe3Sn2 is 3.2 µΩ cm
      at 300 K, almost 20 times higher than that of typical itinerant
      ferromagnets such as Fe and Ni. The anomalous Hall coefficient Rs
      is 6.7 × 10 − 9 Ω cm G − 1 at 300 K, which is three orders of
      magnitude larger than that of pure Fe, and obeys an unconventional
      scaling with the longitudinal resistivity, ρxx, of R_{{\mathrm
      {s}}} \propto \rho_{xx}^{3.15} . Such a relationship cannot be
      explained by either the conventional skew or side-jump mechanisms,
      indicating that the anomalous Hall effect in Fe3Sn2 has an
      extraordinary origin that is presumed to be related to the
      underlying frustration of the magnetism. These findings
      demonstrate that frustrated ferromagnets, whether based on bulk
      materials or on artificial nanoscale structures, can provide new
      routes to room temperature spin-dependent electron transport
      properties suited to application in spintronics. <br>

      <br>
      In a kagome lattice, the time reversal symmetry can be broken by a
      staggered magnetic flux emerging from ferromagnetic ordering and
      intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, leading to several well-separated
      nontrivial Chern bands and intrinsic quantum anomalous Hall
      effect. Based on this idea and ab initio calculations, we propose
      the realization of the intrinsic quantum anomalous Hall effect in
      the single layer Cs2Mn3F12 kagome lattice and on the (001) surface
      of a Cs2LiMn3F12 single crystal by modifying the carrier coverage
      on it, where the band gap is around 20 meV. Moreover, a simplified
      tight binding model based on the in-plane ddσ antibonding states
      is constructed to understand the topological band structures of
      the system.<br>

      with Cr as the magnetic dopant. They observed a plateau in the

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The quantized version of the anomalous Hall effect has been
      predicted to occur in magnetic topological insulators, but the
      experimental realization has been challenging. Here, we report the
      observation of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in thin
      films of chromium-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3, a magnetic topological
      insulator. At zero magnetic field, the gate-tuned anomalous Hall
      resistance reaches the predicted quantized value of h/e2,
      accompanied by a considerable drop in the longitudinal resistance.
      Under a strong magnetic field, the longitudinal resistance
      vanishes, whereas the Hall resistance remains at the quantized
      value. The realization of the QAH effect may lead to the
      development of low-power-consumption electronics.<br>

      “Fifteen years ago, the BBC reported that a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study found that adding vitamins [and essential
      fatty acids] to the diets of inmates at a maximum-security
      institution cut offenses by 25 percent. The greatest reduction was
      for serious offenses, including violence, which fell by 40
      percent. There was no such reduction for those on placebos. The
      study’s researchers claim that improving diets could be a
      cost-effective way of reducing crime in communities and also
      reducing the prison population. To quote lead study author Bernard
      Gesch, ‘The improvement was huge’.” [See (2002) British Journal of

      White spot lesions (WSL) and incipient caries on enamel surfaces
      are the earliest clinical outcomes for demineralization and
      caries. If left untreated, the caries can progress and may cause
      complex restorative procedures or even tooth extraction which
      destroys soft and hard tissue architecture as a consequence of
      connective tissue and bone loss. Current clinical practices are
      insufficient in treating dental caries. A long-standing practical
      challenge associated with demineralization related to dental
      diseases is incorporating a functional mineral microlayer which is
      fully integrated into the molecular structure of the tooth in
      repairing damaged enamel. This study demonstrates that small
      peptide domains derived from native protein amelogenin can be
      utilized to construct a mineral layer on damaged human enamel in
      vitro. Six groups were prepared to carry out remineralization on
      artificially created lesions on enamel: (1) no treatment, (2) Ca2+
      and PO43– only, (3) 1100 ppm fluoride (F), (4) 20?000 ppm F, (5)
      1100 ppm F and peptide, and (6) peptide alone. While the 1100 ppm
      F sample (indicative of common F content of toothpaste for
      homecare) did not deliver F to the thinly deposited mineral layer,
      high F test sample (indicative of clinical varnish treatment)
      formed mainly CaF2 nanoparticles on the surface. Fluoride,
      however, was deposited in the presence of the peptide, which also
      formed a thin mineral layer which was partially crystallized as
      fluorapatite. Among the test groups, only the peptide-alone sample
      resulted in remineralization of fairly thick (10 µm) dense
      mineralized layer containing HAp mineral, resembling the structure
      of the healthy enamel. The newly formed mineralized layer
      exhibited integration with the underlying enamel as evident by
      cross-sectional imaging. The peptide-guided remineralization
      approach sets the foundation for future development of biomimetic
      products and treatments for dental health care.<br>

      </b>Reagents and methods for whitening and remineralizing teeth
      using biomineralizing peptides are described.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Accumulation of various chromogcns/discolorants, for example, food
      and tobacco that come into contact daily onto tooth surfaces and
      their subsequent penetration into deeper regions (dentin), cause
      tooth discoloration. Furthermore, the process of aging, disease,
      trauma, certain medications, certain congenital conditions, and
      environmental effects can also cause teeth to become discolored.
      Although discolored teeth do not cause health problems, since
      bright white teem arc usually considered to be cosmetically
      desirable, there is a great deal of interest in developing
      compositions and methods for whitening teeth.<br>
      <br>
      There arc several techniques for whitening or bleaching of teeth.
      Professional whitening methods, also known as "in-clinic"
      whitening strategics, arc considered presently as the most
      effective methods. These in-clinic whitening strategies typically
      involve the application of high-concentration peroxide products
      (up to 35%) and other abrasive chemicals to the discolored area.
      These peroxide species penetrate the stained area (up to
      underlying dentin layer) and dissolve the accumulated discoloring
      agents through an oxidation process. To achieve desired effects
      more quickly, such oxidation reactions on teeth arc often assisted
      with external laser light application, which heats up the reaction
      site and thereby increases the rate oxidation reaction.
      Furthermore, utilization of titanium dioxide up to 10% is often
      preferred to facilitate these photo- catalytic reactions. Other
      in-clinic whitening techniques involve superficially removing the
      enamel layer with abrasive instruments or pumice followed by
      treatment with additional caustic agents.<br>
      <br>
      There arc several drawbacks of these in-clinic techniques. First
      of all, the abrasive chemicals and peroxide agents causes enamel
      demoralization and results with teeth sensitivity. In most cases
      sorc/injurcd gums as well as bad taste of the product itself cause
      much discomfort to the patients. Further, patients arc required to
      make a clinic appointment to get this medical service.<br>
      <br>
      Other existing products for at-home use contain considerably lower
      concentrations of active oxidizing agents and, thus, arc generally
      less effective than in- clinic whitening strategics and products.
      Therefore, dramatic whitening effect can only be achieved by the
      repeated applications of these reagents for several weeks. These
      treatments often assisted with bleaching trays (night-guard) in
      order to better localize bleaching products and, thereby, maximize
      the whitening effect However, even though these at home products
      contain active whitening agents in lower concentrations, similar
      side effects as those associated with professional treatments arc
      very common. In addition, there arc paint-on, at-home whitening
      products, also known as "tooth varnishes", as well as whitening
      strips intended to eliminate the need for dental trays. However,
      these products require more frequent applications, usually 3-timcs
      in a day, to complete whitening procedure. Finally, among the
      variety of at-home use products, whitening toothpastes and gels
      are the least effective form of whitening products due to their
      short contact time with the tooth surfaces. Although bleaching
      agent additives augment the effectiveness, the whitening effect is
      primarily as a result of removal of surface stains via mechanical
      action of brushing and other polishing ingredients (for example,
      silica particles).<br>
      <br>
      Dental caries is one of the major public health problems and it is
      a highly prevalent disease among the global population. Incipient
      caries and white spot lesions (WSL) as well as hypersensitivity,
      arc the earliest clinical evidence of enamel dcmincralization and
      dental caries. Dental caries occurs when tooth enamel is exposed
      to acid produced by cariogenic bacteria. As a result, acid
      diffuses into surface enamel and dissolves hydroxyapatite (HAp)
      mineral. Due to its non-rcgenerative nature, enamel is unable to
      heal and repair itself post-dcmincralization. Traditionally,
      fluoride (F) has been used as the key agent in prevention of
      caries. Fluoride functions primarily via topical mechanisms. It is
      believed that fluoride forms a thin layer of new but harder
      mineral, namely fluorapatitc (FAp) which is incorporated into the
      existing HAp mineral on the tooth surface. There is a trend of
      enhancing the rcmincralization effect of fluoride with calcium and
      phosphate supplementation in high risk individuals. Although
      controversial, the use of fluoride products remains the primary
      treatment modality for caries prevention and rcmincralization,
      with major limitations regarding the efficacy of these products
      for the reversal or prevention of dental caries. Fluoride delivery
      systems, therefore, arc not sufficient to overcome the high caries
      risk especially in younger and elderly population.<br>
      <br>
      There is presently an unmet need for tooth whitening and
      mineralization methods and products that reduce or eliminate the
      need for concentrated, abrasive oxidizing agents and attendant
      side effects such as dcmincralization-associatcd tooth sensitivity
      and gum line injuries.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENT</b>ION<br>
      <br>
      Herein we provide methods and compositions for whitening teeth
      where the natural color of teeth is restored and improved upon by
      generating newly formed thin mineral layer on discolored tooth
      surface using one or more biomineralizing polypeptides. Herein we
      also provide methods and compositions for mineralizing teeth.<br>
      <br>
      In a first aspect, the present application provides a method for
      whitening teeth, comprising administering to a subject in need
      thereof an amount effective to whiten the teeth of a
      biomineralizing polypeptide. In some embodiments, the method for
      whitening teeth comprises administering to a subject in need
      thereof an effective amount of a composition comprising a
      biomineralizing polypeptide. In some embodiments, the
      biomineralizing polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence
      selected from the group consisting of...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusion &amp; Significance:</b> We developed a peptide-based
      aqueous mineralization methodology to treat dental
      hypersensitivity by forming a continuous mineral layer on the
      exposed dentin of human teeth in vitro. This biomimctic treatment
      provides a unique solution to dentinal hypersensitivity which can
      be used as a platform technology for in- clinic and
      over-the-counter hypersensitivity treatments. <br>

      Aims: The dangerous portion of ultraviolet radiation is widely
      believed to be completely absorbed by the atmosphere before
      reaching Earth’s surface. Our objective is to make multiple
      measurements at Earth’s surface of the solar irradiance spectrum
      in the range 200-400 nm. <br>
      <br>
      Methods: We made numerous measurements of the solar irradiance
      spectrum in the range 200-400 nm at an elevation of 56 m with
      International Light Technologies ILT950UV Spectral Radiometer
      mounted on a Meade LXD55 auto guider telescope tripod and mount
      assembly.<br>
      <br>
      Results: Our multifold measurements of solar irradiance spectra
      demonstrate conclusively that all wavelengths in the spectral
      range 200-400 nm reach Earth’s surface, contrary to the widespread
      perception that all UV-C and the majority of UV-B never reach the
      surface. We confirm the surface UV-C measurements of D’Antoni et
      al. (2007) that were disputed, based on faulty computer model
      calculations of atmospheric ozone, and thereafter ignored by the
      geoscience community.<br>
      <br>
      Conclusions: The veracity of our data and D’Antoni et al. (2007)’s
      data call into question the validity of atmospheric ozone models.
      Further, we call into question the simplistic supposition of the
      Montreal Protocol that chloro-fluoro-hydrocarbons are the primary
      cause of ozone depletion, and point to the very heavy burden of
      halogens introduced into the atmosphere by ongoing jet-sprayed
      coal-fly-ash geoengineering. We demonstrate that satellite-based
      LISIRD solar spectra irradiance at the top of the atmosphere is
      badly flawed with some regions of the spectrum being less intense
      than measured at Earth’s surface. That calls into question any
      calculations made utilizing LISIRD data. We provide introductory
      information on the devastating effects of UV-B and UV-C on humans,
      phytoplankton, coral, insects and plants. These will be discussed
      in greater detail in subsequent articles.<br>

      It takes at least four years of college for an enlisted person in
      the military to become a military “officer,” which is quite a
      contrast from the mere nine months it takes for a police officer
      to earn the title. But according to a group of 10 former Austin
      Police Department recruits who wanted to become peace officers,
      just like the military, the Austin PD is training&nbsp; “warriors”
      instead of “guardians.”<br>
      <br>
      The former recruits are now blowing the whistle and claiming that
      the type of mentality they encountered is not what they signed up
      for and is not representative of the greater Austin community.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summer Spisak, a 38-year-old former tech
      employee who participated in nine weeks of the eight-month academy
      last year, said instructors told her and other cadets they would
      “punch them in the face” if they said they wanted to be police
      officers to help people.<br>
      <br>
      Spisak and others are now sounding the alarm for the public,
      saying police are being trained to view community members as the
      enemy and not as their fellow citizens. “It’s so different from
      what is portrayed…It’s so different from my expectation of the
      Austin Police Department,” Spisak concluded...<br>
      <br>
      Jonathan Murray, who now works in sales for Dell, said instructors
      repeatedly degraded the homeless and prostitutes, referring to
      them as “cockroaches” and suggesting they “find a transient” if
      they were bored and wanted a felony arrest....<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      Vaccines are being under investigation for the possible side
      effects they can cause. In order to supply new information, an
      electron-microscopy investigation method was applied to the study
      of vaccines, aimed at verifying the presence of solid contaminants
      by means of an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope equipped
      with an X-ray microprobe. The results of this new investigation
      show the presence of micro- and nanosized particulate matter
      composed of inorganic elements in vaccines’ samples which is not
      declared among the components and whose unduly presence is, for
      the time being, inexplicable. A considerable part of those
      particulate contaminants have already been verified in other
      matrices and reported in literature as non biodegradable and non
      biocompatible. The evidence collected is suggestive of some
      hypotheses correlated to diseases that are mentioned and briefly
      discussed.<br>

      </div>
      <b><br>
        Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Excess reactive oxygen species production by mitochondria is a key
      mechanism of age-related vascular dysfunction. Our laboratory has
      shown that supplementation with the mitochondrial-targeted
      antioxidant MitoQ improves vascular endothelial function by
      reducing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and ameliorates
      arterial stiffening in old mice, but the effects in humans are
      unknown. Here, we sought to translate our preclinical findings to
      humans and determine the safety and efficacy of MitoQ. Twenty
      healthy older adults (60–79 years) with impaired endothelial
      function (brachial artery flow–mediated dilation &lt;6%) underwent
      6 weeks of oral supplementation with MitoQ (20 mg/d) or placebo in
      a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design
      study. MitoQ was well tolerated, and plasma MitoQ was higher after
      the treatment versus placebo period (P&lt;0.05). Brachial artery
      flow–mediated dilation was 42% higher after MitoQ versus placebo
      (P&lt;0.05); the improvement was associated with amelioration of
      mitochondrial reactive oxygen species–related suppression of
      endothelial function (assessed as the increase in flow-mediated
      dilation with acute, supratherapeutic MitoQ [160 mg]
      administration; n=9; P&lt;0.05). Aortic stiffness (carotid–femoral
      pulse wave velocity) was lower after MitoQ versus placebo
      (P&lt;0.05) in participants with elevated baseline levels
      (carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity &gt;7.60 m/s; n=11). Plasma
      oxidized LDL (low-density lipoprotein), a marker of oxidative
      stress, also was lower after MitoQ versus placebo (P&lt;0.05).
      Participant characteristics, endothelium-independent dilation
      (sublingual nitroglycerin), and circulating markers of
      inflammation were not different (all P&gt;0.1). These findings in
      humans extend earlier preclinical observations and suggest that
      MitoQ and other therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial
      reactive oxygen species may hold promise for treating age-related
      vascular dysfunction.<br>

      <b>Sources and Structure</b><b><br>
      </b><b>1.1. Sources</b><b><br>
      </b>MitoQ is a term used to refer to mitoquinone mesylate ( with
      {10-(4,5-dimethoxy-2-methyl-3,6-dioxo-1,4-cycloheexadienlyl) decyl
      triphenylphosphonium methanesulfonate}) as the prolonged chemical
      name), which is a derivative of CoQ10 where said molecule is
      covalently bonded to a triphenylphosphonium cation.<br>
      <br>
      The CoQ10 moiety is delivered to the matrix side of the inner
      mitochondrial matrix,[1] which is the site of most mitochondrial
      oxidative stress.[2] Despite accumulation in the mitrochondria,
      however, MitoQ is a poor substrate for the electron transport
      chain (at complex I) and is not thought to contribute much to
      bioenergetics.[3][4]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Biological Significance</b><b><br>
      </b>Oral administration of MitoQ in otherwise healthy wild type
      mice over 28 weeks fails to significantly alter mitochondrial
      function or gene expression, and no overall influence on systemic
      energy metabolism.[5]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Neurology</b><b><br>
      </b><b>2.1. Dementia</b><b><br>
      </b>Alzheimer's is known to be associated with mitochondrial
      abnormalities in neurons associated with oxidative stress[6][7]<br>
      Beta-amyloid toxicity has been noted to be reduced in N2a cells
      with MitoQ incubation[8] and at 1-100nM mostly abolished cell
      death from amyloid proteins (no dose dependence noted).[9]<br>
      100μM of MitoQ daily to a mouse model of Alzheimer's has been
      noted to improve spatial memory and cognitive performance
      associated with a reduction in lipid peroxidation.[9]<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      Aquaporins are proteins that serve as water channels to regulate
      the flow of water across biological cell membranes. They also
      remove excess salt and impurities in the body, and it is this
      aspect that has led to much interest in recent years in how to
      mimic the biochemical processes of aquaporins potentially for
      water desalination systems...<br>
      <br>
      ...Through their experimental studies, Belfort and Petersen have
      found that not only does water exist in the imidazole water
      channel, but also that the imidazole ring construct induces the
      water molecules to self-assemble into a highly oriented linear
      chain structure -- or what the researchers have dubbed "water
      wires."<br>
      <br>
      "For the first time, we have made a direct observation of this
      unique water structure inside a synthetic water channel that
      mimics an aquaporin," Belfort said.<br>
      <br>
      Belfort and his colleagues also discovered that the chirality of
      the imidazole molecules orients the water molecules and could
      increase the permeability of water through the water channel
      compared with achiral (i.e., not chiral) imidazole molecules that
      they also assembled. Chirality happens when a mirror image of an
      object is not superimposable -- for example, your left and right
      hand...<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Aquaporins (AQPs) feature highly selective water transport through
      cell membranes, where the dipolar orientation of structured water
      wires spanning the AQP pore is of considerable importance for the
      selective translocation of water over ions. We recently discovered
      that water permeability through artificial water channels formed
      by stacked imidazole I-quartet superstructures increases when the
      channel water molecules are highly organized. Correlating water
      structure with molecular transport is essential for understanding
      the underlying mechanisms of (fast) water translocation and
      channel selectivity. Chirality adds another factor enabling unique
      dipolar oriented water structures. We show that water molecules
      exhibit a dipolar oriented wire structure within chiral I-quartet
      water channels both in the solid state and embedded in supported
      lipid bilayer membranes (SLBs). X-ray single-crystal structures
      show that crystallographic water wires exhibit dipolar
      orientation, which is unique for chiral I-quartets. The
      integration of I-quartets into SLBs was monitored with a quartz
      crystal microbalance with dissipation, quantizing the amount of
      channel water molecules. Nonlinear sum-frequency generation
      vibrational spectroscopy demonstrates the first experimental
      observation of dipolar oriented water structures within artificial
      water channels inserted in bilayer membranes. Confirmation of the
      ordered confined water is obtained via molecular simulations,
      which provide quantitative measures of hydrogen bond strength,
      connectivity, and the stability of their dipolar alignment in a
      membrane environment. Together, uncovering the interplay between
      the dipolar aligned water structure and water transport through
      the self-assembled I-quartets is critical to understanding the
      behavior of natural membrane channels and will accelerate the
      systematic discovery for developing artificial water channels for
      water desalting.<br>

      <br>
      Researchers have had a breakthrough in the central questions about
      #the origin of life. A collaboration of physicists and biologists
      in Germany has found a simple mechanism that might have enabled
      liquid droplets to evolve into living #cells in early Earth’s
      primordial soup.<br>
      <br>
      How did these first cells arose from primitive precursors? What
      were those precursors, dubbed “#protocells,” and how did they come
      alive?&nbsp;&nbsp; How could something as complex as a membrane
      start to self-replicate and proliferate, allowing #evolution to
      act on it?<br>
      <br>
      New work by David Zwicker along with the Max Planck Institute for
      the Physics of Complex Systems and the Max Planck Institute of
      Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, both in Dresden, may have an
      answer. The scientists studied the physics of “chemically active”
      droplets, which cycle chemicals in and out of the surrounding
      fluid, and discovered these droplets tend to grow to cell size and
      divide, just like cells, as well as move across cells via
      diffusion.&nbsp; This active droplet behavior is different from
      more familiar tendencies of oil droplets in water, which glom
      together into bigger and bigger droplets without dividing.<br>
      <br>
      Frank Jülicher, a biophysicist in Dresden and co-author of the new
      paper said, It makes it more plausible that there could have been
      spontaneous emergence of life from nonliving soup...<br>

      <br>
      &nbsp;Szostak begins his lecture with examples of the extreme
      environments in which life exists on Earth. He postulates that
      given the large number of earth-like planets orbiting sun-like
      stars, and the ability of microbial life to exist in a wide range
      of environments, it is probable that an environment that could
      support life exists somewhere in our galaxy. However, whether or
      not life does exist elsewhere, depends on the answer to the
      question of how difficult it is for life to arise from the
      chemistry of the early planets. Szostak proceeds to demonstrate
      that by starting with simple molecules and conditions found on the
      early earth, it may in fact be possible to generate a primitive,
      self-replicating protocell.<br>

      ...Study senior investigator David Sinclair, professor in the
      Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and co-director
      of the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biology of Aging at Harvard
      Medical School stated “we’ve discovered a way to reverse vascular
      aging by boosting the presence of naturally occurring molecules in
      the body that augment the physiological response to exercise.”...<br>
      <br>
      Abhirup Das, the studies first author, who conducted the work as a
      post-doctoral fellow in Sinclair’s lab, currently a visiting
      scholar in genetics at Harvard Medical School and a post-doctoral
      research fellow at the University of South New Wales School of
      Medical Sciences, said that “we reasoned that declining NAD+
      levels reduce SIRT1 activity and thus interfere with aging mice’s
      ability to grow new blood vessels.”<br>
      <br>
      The researchers then set their sights on the NAD+, which is a
      critical coenzyme for enzymes that fuel reduction-oxidation
      reactions, carrying electrons from one reaction to another, and as
      a cosubstrate for other enzymes such as the sirtuins and
      poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerases.<br>
      <br>
      The scientists used a chemical compound that’s an NAD+ booster
      called NMN (no not m&amp;m!) which plays a critical role in
      repairing cellular DNA as well as maintaining cell vitality to
      test what would happen.<br>
      <br>
      One of the results showed that treatment from NMN caused
      endothelial cells from humans and mice to have strong growth
      capacity and reduced cell death....<br>
      <br>
      The team then wondered what would happen to a group of mice that
      were 20 months old—the rough equivalent of 70 in human years given
      NMN. After a 2 month time span the results showed that NMN
      treatment restored the number of blood capillaries and capillary
      density to those seen in younger mice. Blood flow to the muscles
      also increased and was significantly higher than blood supply to
      the muscles seen in same-age mice that didn’t receive NMN.<br>
      <br>
      That wasn’t the most surprising result to the researchers however.
      What they discovered was that the aging mice showed in comparison
      to the entreated mice that they regained the capacity to exercise
      by 56 and 80% more. The untreated mice could only run 240 meters,
      or 780 feet, on average whereas the mice treated with NMN could
      run 430 meters, or about 1,400 feet, on average. This treatment
      could be an answer to humans who have lost the capacity to
      exercise due to other disabilities or age-related diseases.<br>
      <br>
      The next step for the researchers was to explore methods for
      boosting the activity of SIRT1. To do this the researchers added a
      second compound NaHS, sodium hydrosulfide, which is known to be a
      precursor of SIRT1.<br>
      <br>
      For four weeks a group of mice that were 32-month-old mice—the
      rough equivalent to 90 in human years—receiving the combo
      treatment. The results were significant! Not only were the mice
      able to run longer and faster but they were able to outperform the
      untreated mice by a longshot. The treated mice ran 1.6 times
      further than the untreated mice...<br>

      more acid to digest the next meal and for little-studied
      mesothelial cells sitting on the spleen to tell the fist-sized
      organ that there’s no need to mount a protective immune response.

      ...April 2, 2016... Physicist Sindre Zeiner-Gundersen, who
      revealed details of an operating experimental cold fusion device
      in Norway generating 20 times more energy than required to
      activate it! According to Scandinavian physicists ‘cold fusion’
      happens due to the formation of ultradense hydrogen/deuterium as
      described in the widely acclaimed work and theoretical
      understanding by professor Svein Olafsson and Norway’s Professor
      Svein Holmlid...<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;“I understand actually criticism from Röhrich well. We had a
      good discussion, and I agree that probably 95 percent of
      everything that has been done within the cold fusion field is
      experimental error. Most have only using luck managed to produce
      energy. But the last 5 percent is scientifically published.
      Röhrich do not know cold fusion literature and have not had time
      to go through all these experiments. Therefore he shows a healthy
      skepticism which I respect”, says Olafsson.<br>
      <br>
      “Holmlid experiments are structured so that any minimal sign of
      radioactivity is a simple, beautiful, strong and irrefutable
      evidence that reveals immediate consequences in the saga and
      mystery of cold fusion. Such cold fusion is observed in over 100
      published articles since 1989. But experiments where radioactivity
      can be turn on and off in a controlled manner – like his, is not
      possible by any known theory,” he says...<br>
