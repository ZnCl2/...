              Health Ranger posts heavy metals test results for 364 more
              water samples from across America: Lead, Copper, Arsenic
              and Aluminum numbers<br>
              <br>
              ...You can view the 2017 water sample test results chart,
              sorted by zip code, at the following link at the Natural

              Some of the more notable results we found are listed
              below. Many of these results violate EPA water quality
              limits and expose potentially millions of Americans to
              toxic heavy metals in municipal water. (Why is nobody else
              conducting these tests? Why does the EPA cover this up?)<br>

              New research suggests that the human brain is almost
              beyond comprehension because it doesn’t process the world
              in two dimensions or even three. No, the human brain
              understands the visual world in up to 11 different
              dimensions.<br>
              <br>
              The astonishing discovery helps explain why even
              cutting-edge technologies like functional MRIs have such a
              hard time explaining what is going on inside our noggins.
              In a functional MRI, brain activity is monitored and
              represented as a three-dimensional image that changes over
              time. However, if the brain is actually working in 11
              dimensions, looking at a 3D functional MRI and saying that
              it explains brain activity would be like looking at the
              shadow of a head of a pin and saying that it explains the
              entire universe, plus a multitude of other dimensions.<br>
              <br>
              The team of scientists led by a group from Scientists at
              the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in
              Switzerland detected the previously unknown complexities
              of the brain while working on the Blue Brain Project. The
              project’s goal is to create a biologically accurate
              recreation of the human brain.<br>
              <br>
              During their research, the scientists created simulations
              of the brain and applied an advanced form of mathematics,
              called algebraic topology, to their computer-generated
              models.<br>
              <br>
              “Algebraic topology is like a telescope and microscope at
              the same time. It can zoom into networks to find hidden
              structures — the trees in the forest — and see the empty
              spaces — the clearings — all at the same time,” said study
              author Kathryn Hess.<br>
              <br>
              What Hess and her colleagues found was that the brain
              processes visual information by creating multi-dimensional
              neurological structures, called cliques, which
              disintegrate the instant they are understood, according to
              Newsweek who first reported on the research that was
              published in the journal Frontiers in Computational
              Neuroscience.<br>
              <br>
              The cliques have up to 11 different dimensions and form in
              holes of space, called cavities. Once the brain
              understands the visual information, both the clique and
              cavity disappear.<br>
              <br>
              The appearance of high-dimensional cavities when the brain
              is processing information means that the neurons in the
              network react to stimuli in an extremely organized
              manner,” said researcher Ran Levi.<br>
              <br>
              “It is as if the brain reacts to a stimulus by building
              then razing a tower of multi-dimensional blocks, starting
              with rods (1D), then planks (2D), then cubes (3D), and
              then more complex geometries with 4D, 5D, etc. The
              progression of activity through the brain resembles a
              multi-dimensional sandcastle that materializes out of the
              sand and then disintegrates,” he said.<br>
              <br>
              Henry Markram, director of Blue Brain Project, explained
              just how momentous a discovery the multi-dimensional
              structures could be.<br>
              <br>
              “The mathematics usually applied to study networks cannot
              detect the high-dimensional structures and spaces that we
              now see clearly,” he said.<br>
              <br>
              “We found a world that we had never imagined. There are
              tens of millions of these objects even in a small speck of
              the brain, up through seven dimensions. In some networks,
              we even found structures with up to 11 dimensions.”<br>

              The lack of a formal link between neural network structure
              and its emergent function has hampered our understanding
              of how the brain processes information. We have now come
              closer to describing such a link by taking the direction
              of synaptic transmission into account, constructing graphs
              of a network that reflect the direction of information
              flow, and analyzing these directed graphs using algebraic
              topology. Applying this approach to a local network of
              neurons in the neocortex revealed a remarkably intricate
              and previously unseen topology of synaptic connectivity.
              The synaptic network contains an abundance of cliques of
              neurons bound into cavities that guide the emergence of
              correlated activity. In response to stimuli, correlated
              activity binds synaptically connected neurons into
              functional cliques and cavities that evolve in a
              stereotypical sequence toward peak complexity. We propose
              that the brain processes stimuli by forming increasingly
              complex functional cliques and cavities.<br>

              A study of a large group of children found a link between
              raised risk of autism spectrum disorder and their mothers

              with fevers reported during the second trimester.<br>

              The study - led by the Mailman School of Public Health at

              the risk of autism increased in line with the number of
              fevers reported after 12 weeks of gestation - rising to
              300 percent higher risk with reports of three or more
              fevers...<br>

              Some studies suggest that prenatal infection increases
              risk of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). This study was
              undertaken in a prospective cohort in Norway to examine
              whether we could find evidence to support an association
              of the prenatal occurrence of fever, a common
              manifestation of infection, with ASD risk. Prospective
              questionnaires provided maternal exposure data; case
              status was established from clinical assessments and
              registry linkages. In a large, prospectively ascertained
              cohort of pregnant mothers and their offspring, we
              examined infants born greater than or equal to32 weeks for
              associations between fever exposure in each trimester and
              ASD risk using logistic regression. Maternal exposure to
              second-trimester fever was associated with increased ASD
              risk, adjusting for presence of fever in other trimesters
              and confounders (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.40; 95%
              confidence interval, 1.09–1.79), with a similar, but
              nonsignificant, point estimate in the first trimester.
              Risk increased markedly with exposure to three or more
              fever episodes after 12 weeks' gestation (aOR, 3.12;
              1.28–7.63). ASD risk appears to increase with maternal
              fever, particularly in the second trimester. Risk
              magnified dose dependently with exposure to multiple
              fevers after 12 weeks' gestation. Our findings support a
              role for gestational maternal infection and innate immune
              responses to infection in the pathogenesis of at least
              some cases of ASD.<br>

              CANCER stem cells, which fuel the growth of fatal tumours,
              can be knocked out by a one-two combination of antibiotics
              and Vitamin C in a new experimental strategy, published by
              researchers at the University of Salford, UK.<br>
              <br>
              The antibiotic, Doxycycline, followed by doses of ascorbic
              acid (Vitamin C), were surprisingly effective in killing
              the cancer stem cells under laboratory conditions,
              according to the research published in the journal
              Oncotarget.<br>
              <br>
              In boxing terms, this would be the equivalent of two blows
              delivered in rapid succession; a left-hand jab, followed
              by a right cross.<br>
              <br>
              The researchers say their method offers a new explanation
              for how to prevent cancer cells from becoming
              treatment-resistant and how combinations therapies can be
              developed to overcome drug resistance.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Starve cancer cells </b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              Professor Michael Lisanti, who designed the study,
              explained: “We now know that a proportion of cancer cells
              escape chemotherapy and develop drug resistance; we
              established this new strategy to find out how they do it.<br>
              <br>
              “We suspected the answer lay in the fact that certain
              cancer cells – which we call metabolically flexible - are
              able to switch their fuel source. Thus, when the drug
              treatment reduces the availability of a particular
              nutrient, the flexible cancer cells can feed themselves
              with an alternative energy source.”<br>
              <br>
              This new combination approach prevents cancer cells from
              changing their diet (metabolically inflexible), and
              effectively starves them, by preventing them from using
              any other available types of bio-fuels.<br>
              <br>
              The team at the University of Salford’s Biomedical
              Research Centre, added Doxycycline in ever increasing
              doses over a three-month period, to induce metabolic
              inflexibility. The result was to leave the cancer cells
              alive, but severely attenuated and depleted, so that they
              would be much more susceptible to starvation, by a second
              metabolic “punch”.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Combination</b><br>
              <br>
              First, the researchers inhibited the tumour cell
              mitochondria, by restricting the cancer cells only to
              glucose as a fuel source; then, they took away their
              glucose, effectively starving the cancer cells to death.<br>
              <br>
              “In this scenario, Vitamin C behaves as an inhibitor of
              glycolysis, which fuels energy production in mitochondria,
              the “powerhouse” of the cell, explained co-author Dr
              Federica Sotgia.<br>
              <br>
              The Salford team recently showed Vitamin C to be up to ten
              times more effective at stopping cancer cell growth than
              pharmaceuticals such as 2-DG, but they say that when
              Vitamin C is combined with an antibiotic, it is up to ten
              times more effective, making it nearly 100 times more
              effective than 2-DG.<br>
              <br>
              As Doxycycline and Vitamin C are both relatively
              non-toxic, this could dramatically reduce the possible
              side-effects of anti-cancer therapy.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Clinical trials </b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              The Salford team also identified eight other drugs that
              could be used as a “second-punch” after the antibiotic
              regime, including berberine (a natural product) – and a
              number of cheap non-toxic FDA approved drugs.<br>
              <br>
              Professor Lisanti added: “This is further evidence that
              Vitamin C and other non-toxic compounds may have a role to
              play in the fight against cancer.<br>
              <br>
              “Our results indicate it is a promising agent for clinical
              trials, and a as an add-on to more conventional therapies,
              to prevent tumour recurrence, further disease progression
              and metastasis.”<br>

              </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              Here, we developed a new synthetic lethal strategy for
              further optimizing the eradication of cancer stem cells
              (CSCs). Briefly, we show that chronic treatment with the
              FDA-approved antibiotic Doxycycline effectively reduces
              cellular respiration, by targeting mitochondrial protein
              translation. The expression of four mitochondrial DNA
              encoded proteins (MT-ND3, MT-CO2, MT-ATP6 and MT-ATP8) is
              suppressed, by up to 35-fold. This high selection pressure
              metabolically synchronizes the surviving cancer cell
              sub-population towards a predominantly glycolytic
              phenotype, resulting in metabolic inflexibility. We
              directly validated this Doxycycline-induced glycolytic
              phenotype, by using metabolic flux analysis and label-free
              unbiased proteomics.<br>
              <br>
              Next, we identified two natural products (Vitamin C and
              Berberine) and six clinically-approved drugs, for
              metabolically targeting the Doxycycline-resistant CSC
              population (Atovaquone, Irinotecan, Sorafenib,
              Niclosamide, Chloroquine, and Stiripentol). This new
              combination strategy allows for the more efficacious
              eradication of CSCs with Doxycycline, and provides a
              simple pragmatic solution to the possible development of
              Doxycycline-resistance in cancer cells. In summary, we
              propose the combined use of i) Doxycycline (Hit-1:
              targeting mitochondria) and ii) Vitamin C (Hit-2:
              targeting glycolysis), which represents a new
              synthetic-lethal metabolic strategy for eradicating CSCs.<br>
              <br>
              This type of metabolic Achilles’ heel will allow us and
              others to more effectively “starve” the CSC population...<br>
              <br>
              A synthetic lethal strategy for eradicating DoxyR CSCs,
              using natural products (Vitamin C and Berberine) and other
              FDA-approved drugs<br>
              <br>
              Next, we tested the efficacy of glycolysis inhibitors,
              such as 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG) and Vitamin C (ascorbic
              acid). Treatment with 2-DG inhibited the propagation of
              DoxyR CSCs by &gt; 90% at 10 mM and 100% at 20 mM (Figure
              10). In addition, Vitamin C was more potent than 2-DG; it
              inhibited DoxyR CSC propagation by &gt; 90% at 250 µM and
              100% at 500 µM (Figure 10). As such, the IC-50 for Vitamin
              C in this context was between 100 to 250 µM, which are
              within the known achievable blood levels, when Vitamin C
              is taken orally. Previously, we showed that the IC-50 for
              Vitamin C was 1 mM for MCF7 CSC propagation [13].
              Therefore, DoxyR CSCs are between 4- to 10-fold more
              sensitive to Vitamin C than control MCF7 CSCs, under
              identical assay conditions.<br>
              <br>
              We also examined the efficacy of 4 other
              clinically-approved drugs that functionally behave as
              either OXPHOS inhibitors (Irinotecan, Sorafenib,
              Niclosamide) or glycolysis inhibitors (Stiripentol)
              (Figure 11). In this context, Stiripentol functions as an
              LDH inhibitor. Their rank order potency for inhibiting
              DoxyR CSC propagation is: Niclosamide (IC-50 ~ 100 nM)
              &gt; Irinotecan (IC-50 ~ 500 nM) &gt; Sorafenib (IC-50 ~
              0.5 to 1 µM) &gt; Stiripentol (IC-50 ~ 10 to 50 µM).<br>
              <br>
              Finally, we tested the efficacy of Berberine, which is a
              naturally occurring antibiotic that also behaves as an
              OXPHOS inhibitor. It was used as early as 3,000 B.C. in
              China, for medicinal purposes. Figure 11 shows that
              treatment with Berberine effectively inhibited the
              propagation of the DoxyR CSCs by &gt; 50% at 1 µM and &gt;
              80% at 10 µM...<br>
              <br>
              <b>Discussion</b><br>
              <br>
              In this report, we present new functional evidence to
              support a novel synthetic lethal strategy to eradicate
              CSCs. More specifically, we demonstrate that the use of
              Doxycycline, a clinically approved antibiotic, induces
              metabolic stress in cancer cells. This allows the
              remaining cancer cells to be synchronized towards a purely
              glycolytic phenotype, driving a form of metabolic
              inflexibility. This Doxycycline-driven aerobic glycolysis
              was further confirmed and validated, by employing
              high-resolution proteomics analysis and metabolic
              phenotyping. In addition, we discovered that both natural
              products and FDA-approved drugs could be re-purposed to
              eradicate the Doxycycline-resistant CSC population. These
              9 small molecules included: Vitamin C, Berberine, 2-DG,
              Atovaquone, Irinotecan, Sorafenib, Niclosamide,
              Chloroquine, and Stiripentol.<br>
              <br>
              Our new therapeutic strategy should provide for the more
              efficient eradication of CSCs using Doxycycline, as well
              as a practical means for solving the potential problem of
              Doxycycline resistance in CSCs. As such, we suggest a new
              synthetic lethal strategy for eradicating CSCs, by
              employing i) Doxycycline (to target mitochondria) and ii)
              Vitamin C (to target glycolysis) (Figure 12). Use of this
              combined metabolic strategy should help prevent CSCs from
              exploiting the essential nutrients that they normally
              derive from the tumor microenvironment.<br>
              <br>
              Overcoming resistance to Doxycycline in cancer cells,
              using metabolic inflexibility, synthetic lethality and
              Vitamin C<br>
              <br>
              Resistance to anti-cancer therapy remains as one of the
              key issues in cancer patient management. Treatment failure
              is regarded as an alarming outcome of numerous different
              therapeutic approaches. Indeed, the use of combination
              strategies aimed at hitting multiple aspects of tumor
              progression is currently considered as a promising tool to
              overcome resistance. Mounting evidence suggests that CSCs
              act as the main promoter of tumor recurrence and patient
              relapse [1-5]. Thus, a better understanding of the
              biological and biochemical behavior of CSCs during drug
              resistance may unveil new vulnerabilities, to be exploited
              in a therapeutic setting.<br>
              <br>
              In this context, our data indicates that a metabolic shift
              from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism represents an
              escape mechanism for breast cancer cells
              chronically-treated with a mitochondrial stressor like
              Doxycycline, as mitochondrial dys-function leads to a
              stronger dependence on glucose.<br>
              <br>
              Our current findings are in line with previous studies
              showing the highly plastic nature of CSCs allows them to
              adjust and adapt their metabolic environment, in order to
              maintain their distinctive properties, in a hostile tumor
              microenvironment, often characterized by an inadequate
              nutrient and oxygen supply (reviewed in [23]). Here, we
              have taken advantage of the glycolytic shift exhibited by
              DoxyR CSCs, as we have used several glycolysis inhibitors
              with the aim to turn their strict metabolic inflexibility,
              into a lethal phenotype. Among the agents tested in the
              our study, Vitamin C has been demonstrated to selectively
              kill cancer cells in vitro and to inhibit tumor growth in
              experimental mouse models [24, 25]. Remarkably, many of
              these actions have been attributed to the ability of
              Vitamin C to act as a glycolysis inhibitor, by targeting
              GAPDH and depleting the NAD pool [22, 26, 27].<br>
              <br>
              In this context, we have previously demonstrated that
              Vitamin C effectively inhibits 3D breast tumor spheroid
              formation, with an IC-50 of 1 mM, suggesting that this
              micronutrient also works as an inhibitor of CSCs [13],
              whose activity is critically dependent on an active
              mitochondrial TCA cycle and OXPHOS. In contrast, here we
              show that DoxyR CSCs are more vulnerable to the inhibitory
              effects of Vitamin C, at 4- to 10-fold lower
              concentrations, between 100 to 250 µM. These findings are
              further supported by clinical studies showing that the
              concurrent use of Vitamin C, with standard chemotherapy,
              reduces tumor recurrence and patient mortality [28, 29].<br>
              <br>
              It is worth noting that Vitamin C plasma levels vary
              considerably with the route of administration. For
              instance, pharmacokinetic studies performed by different
              research groups have assessed that, after oral
              administration, Vitamin C plasma levels reach
              concentrations of ~70-220 µM [reviewed in reference #30],
              which represents the maximum tolerated oral dose. By
              contrast, Padayatty and co-workers found that, compared to
              oral intake, intravenous administration results in 30- to
              70- fold higher plasma concentrations of Vitamin C [31].
              Furthermore, consumption of 5 to 9 servings of fruits and
              vegetables per day allows plasma levels of Vitamin C to
              reach up to 80 µM at steady-state, with peak values of 220
              µM [31]. Remarkably, an intravenous infusion of Vitamin C
              can reach plasma levels of 15,000 µM (i.e., 15 mM).
              Interestingly, doses of up to 50 grams per day, infused
              slowly, didn’t exhibit any toxic side effects on cancer
              patients [30]. These observations suggest that intravenous
              administration of Vitamin C may have a role in cancer
              treatment, as this route allows higher plasma
              concentrations than those achievable with the maximum
              tolerated oral dose.<br>
              <br>
              Previous studies have demonstrated that Vitamin C behaves
              as a potent dietary antioxidant, as well as a pro-oxidant.
              This pro-oxidant activity results from Vitamin C’s action
              on metal ions, which generates free radicals and hydrogen
              peroxide, and is associated with cell toxicity. Of note,
              it has been shown that high-dose Vitamin C is more
              cytotoxic to cancer cells than to normal cells [32, 33].
              This selectivity appears to be due to the higher catalase
              content observed in normal cells (~10-100 fold greater),
              as compared to tumor cells. Hence, Vitamin C may be
              regarded as a safe agent that selectively targets cancer
              cells.<br>
              <br>
              A recent study performed on a panel of cancer cells (A431,
              Panc-1, HeLa, HT29, and MCF7) showed that Vitamin C only
              affects cell viability at concentration of ~3 to 10 mM
              [34], thus providing more evidence to support a lack of
              toxicity for low micromolar concentrations of Vitamin C.<br>
              <br>
              Similarly, phase I and II clinical trials, designed to
              deliver high-dose intravenous Vitamin C, have shown a lack
              of toxic side effects for concentrations of up to 292 µM
              [35]. Taken together with these findings, our data suggest
              that Vitamin C’s action as a glycolytic inhibitor may
              represent a safe and effective strategy to be used in
              combination therapies, with conventional anticancer drugs,
              as well as with Doxycycline.<br>
              <br>
              Because of our success with 2-DG and Vitamin C, we
              explored additional FDA-approved drugs with
              glycolysis-inhibiting activity that could be repurposed to
              eradicate CSC propagation, in combination with
              Doxycycline. For example, we demonstrated that the LDH
              enzyme inhibitor Stiripentol is also effective at
              targeting DoxyR CSCs; this drug is currently used
              clinically as an anti-epileptic in children.<br>
              <br>
              We also further explored other suitable metabolic
              approaches to overcome Doxycycline resistance. In this
              context, we evaluated the efficacy of a panel of compounds
              that share the ability to impair mitochondrial function
              (OXPHOS), as a common off-target side-effect. This
              approach was based on the assumption that DoxyR cells,
              which exhibit altered oxidative metabolism, are extremely
              sensitive to the induction of additional mitochondrial
              dysfunction. These effective compounds included four
              FDA-approved drugs, such as Atovaquone, Irinotecan,
              Sorafenib, and Niclosamide, as well as the natural product
              Berberine.<br>
              <br>
              Interestingly, we observed that Chloroquine also reduces
              the spheroid forming efficiency of DoxyR cells, indicating
              that inhibition of autophagy may represent another
              effective combination strategy, to sensitize breast cancer
              cells to the actions of Doxycycline.<br>
              <br>
              We believe that the emerging functional relationship
              between metabolism and stemness, also known as
              “metabo-stemness” [36], holds great promise for the future
              of anti-cancer therapy. Thus, our novel findings may pave
              the way for the discovery and validation of more effective
              therapeutic strategies to fully eradicate CSCs, ultimately
              preventing treatment failure and minimizing metastatic
              dissemination.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Synergistic effects of Doxycycline and Vitamin C in the
                treatment of infectious disease states</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              Is there any precedent for the use of Doxycycline in
              combination with Vitamin C, in clinical trials?
              Interestingly, another group published a report on a
              randomized clinical trial of the effects of Vitamin C on
              dyspareunia and vaginal discharge, in women receiving
              Doxycycline and Triple sulfa for chlamydial cervicitis
              infections [37]. Importantly, they concluded that the cure
              rate was nearly 5-fold higher in the patients that
              received Vitamin C, together with antibiotic therapy [37].
              So, the concurrent use of Doxycycline and Vitamin C, in
              the context of this infectious disease, appeared to be
              highly synergistic in patients.<br>
              <br>
              Similarly, Goc et al., 2016, showed that Doxycycline is
              synergistic in vitro with certain phytochemicals and
              micronutrients, including Vitamin C, in the in vitro
              killing of the vegetative spirochete form of Borrelia
              spp., the causative agent underlying Lyme disease [38].
              Vitamin C has also been shown to be synergistic with
              Tetracycline and Chloramphenicol, against the pathogenic
              bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa [39]. However, in the
              above examples, no follow-up mechanistic studies were
              conducted to determine exactly why Doxycycline,
              Tetracycline and Vitamin C were somehow synergistic.<br>
              <br>
              Conclusions<br>
              <br>
              Numerous functional studies have now directly shown that
              mitochondria are an important new therapeutic target in
              cancer cells [3, 5, 8-21, 40-53]. Since Doxycycline, an
              FDA-approved antibiotic, behaves as an inhibitor of
              mitochondrial protein translation, it may have therapeutic
              value in the specific targeting of mitochondria in cancer
              cells. However, in this paper, we have identified a novel
              metabolic mechanism by which CSCs successfully escape from
              the anti-mitochondrial effects of Doxycycline, by assuming
              a purely glycolytic phenotype. Therefore, DoxyR CSCs are
              then more susceptible to other metabolic perturbations,
              because of their metabolic inflexibility, allowing for
              their eradication with natural products and other
              FDA-approved drugs. Thus, understanding the metabolic
              basis of Doxycycline-resistance has ultimately helped us
              to develop a new synthetic lethal strategy, for more
              effectively targeting CSCs. <br>

              The invention provides an application of doxycycline in
              the preparation of antitumor drugs. The invention
              discloses that doxycycline has an antitumor activity, and
              is capable of inhibiting the tumor growth, tumor transfer
              and tumor invasion. Through the inv-vitro cellular level
              experiments and animal level experiments, people find that
              doxycycline can inhibit the growth and transfer of
              malignant tumors such as breast cancer, liver caner,
              melanoma, lung cancer, pancreas cancer, colon cancer, and
              the like. At the same time, the antitumor effect of
              doxycycline on a tumor-bearing mouse model is also very
              good. Moreover, doxycycline has multiple unique
              advantages, and can be accepted by patients more easily,
              and the drug effect on patients can be conveniently
              observed. The conventional tumor chemotherapy drug market
              will be changed by doxycycline. Doxycycline can be used
              regularly, and is a clinical drug capable of effectively
              inhibiting tumor transfer, invasion, and relapse.<br>

        <font color="#660000"><font size="+1"><font color="#000000"><br>
              The next time you walk down the produce aisle of your
              grocery store, you may want to reach for red onions if you
              are looking to fight off cancer.<br>
              <br>
              In the first study to examine how effective Ontario-grown
              onions are at killing cancer cells, U of G researchers
              have found that not all onions are created equal.<br>
              <br>
              Engineering professor Suresh Neethirajan and PhD student
              Abdulmonem Murayyan tested five onion types grown in
              Ontario and discovered the Ruby Ring onion variety came
              out on top.<br>
              <br>
              Onions as a superfood are still not well known. But they
              contain one of the highest concentrations of quercetin, a
              type of flavonoid, and Ontario onions boast particularly
              high levels of the compound compared to onions grown
              elsewhere in the world.<br>
              <br>
              The Guelph study revealed that the red onion also contains
              high amounts of anthocyanin, which enriches the scavenging
              properties of quercetin molecules, said Murayyan, the
              study’s lead author.<br>
              <br>
              “Anthocyanin is instrumental in providing colour to fruits
              and vegetables, so it makes sense that the red onions,
              which are darkest in colour, would have the most
              cancer-fighting power.”<br>
              <br>
              Published recently in Food Research International, the
              study involved placing colon cancer cells in direct
              contact with quercetin extracted from the five onion
              varieties.<br>
              <br>
              “We found onions are excellent at killing cancer cells,”
              said Murayyan. “Onions activate pathways that encourage
              cancer cells to undergo cell death. They promote an
              unfavourable environment for cancer cells and they disrupt
              communication between cancer cells, which inhibits
              growth.”<br>
              <br>
              The researchers have also recently determined onions are
              effective at killing breast cancer cells.<br>
              <br>
              “The next step will be to test the vegetable’s
              cancer-fighting powers in human trials,” said Murayyan.<br>
              <br>
              These findings follow a recent study by the researchers on
              a new extraction technique that eliminates the use of
              chemicals, making the quercetin found in onions more
              suitable for consumption.<br>
              <br>
              Other extraction methods use solvents that can leave a
              toxic residue which is then ingested in food, said
              Neethirajan.<br>
              <br>
              “This new method that we tested to be effective only uses
              super-heated water in a pressurized container,” he said.
              “Developing a chemical-free extraction method is important
              because it means we can use onion’s cancer-fighting
              properties in nutraceuticals and in pill form.”<br>
              <br>
              While consumers may already add this superfood to their
              salads and burgers as a preventive measure, the
              researchers expect onion extract will eventually be added
              to food products such as juice or baked goods and be sold
              in pill form as a type of natural cancer treatment.<br>

              Fast essential transcription: For me it is quite easy to
              think in higher dimensioanl realms… For me it is quite
              easy to imagine higher dimensional biology,
              transdimensional beings and what I observed out of this
              point of view when I looked at Morgellons disease…it looks
              like a high dimensional being abusing humans to reproduce
              his own species and before these pseudomorphic fruiting
              bodies leave the body, they extract enough bio-photons
              from the forehead to ascend to a parallel dimension, from
              then on there are invisible, but they are still within the
              body and this now is pure science, this is what we found
              in the lab, this is what can be explained with the higher
              dimensional theories, but it also refers to mythology. If
              you have an invisible creature crawling through your body,
              trying to access your energetic system, this is very close
              to what one might call a demon or an archon and if you
              look at the descriptions of the archons, from 2500 years
              ago..the description of the biology is identical of what
              the morgellon victim was painting… It is described that
              they live as light parasites and this is basically what
              the entire black magic tradition is about...<br>

              It’s been a long time since I looked at a teaser ad from
              Global Resource Hunter over at Weiss Research, and it
              appears they’ve changed editors over the years — now
              heading it up is JR Crooks, who I don’t know much about
              (apparently his father is Jack Crooks, who I’ve seen
              mentioned a few times as a currency trader).<br>
              <br>
              And, more to the point, a bunch of Gumshoe readers have
              asked me about the latest ad from JR Crooks, which is all
              about turning every dollar into $60 by riding a “soon to
              be legendary” wave as an innovation alters “every layer of
              society.”<br>
              <br>
              So what’s he pitching? Well, we may not get a full answer
              for you today — the ad, which is selling Global Resource
              Hunter ($49) by pitching a “special report” called “The
              Pyramus Compound: Profiting From This $256.5 Billion Cash
              Grab,” is not all that detailed in hinting at the exact
              investments he’s recommending… but we can at least get you
              started, talk briefly about the “big picture” of the
              spiel, and name a few stocks that are likely in his
              report...<br>

              An antibody produced by an HIV-positive patient has been
              found to neutralize 98 percent of all HIV strains it was
              pitted against, including most of those resistant to other
              antibodies of the same class...<br>
              <br>
              [A] new antibody isolated by the US National Institutes of
              Health (NIH) called N6 has shown it can maintain its
              ability to recognize HIV even as the virus changes and
              breaks away from it. It is also an estimated 10 times more
              potent than VRC01, an antibody in the same class, which
              has passed to phase II clinical trials on human patients
              after protecting monkeys against the virus for six months.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The discovery and characterisation of
              this antibody with exceptional breadth and potency against
              HIV provides an important new lead for the development of
              strategies to prevent and treat HIV infection,” said
              Anthony S. Fauci from the US National Institute of Allergy
              and Infectious Diseases...<br>
              <br>
              N6 was tested on 181 different strains of HIV and
              destroyed 98% of the samples, including 16 out of 20
              strains immune to other antibodies of its class. For
              comparison, VRC01 is only effective against 90% of HIV
              strains. N6 brings not only a wider scope but also much
              greater potency, the researchers report...<br>

              <b>Summary</b><br>
              <br>
              Detailed studies of the broadly neutralizing antibodies
              (bNAbs) that underlie the best available examples of the
              humoral immune response to HIV are providing important
              information for the development of therapies and
              prophylaxis for HIV-1 infection. Here, we report a
              CD4-binding site (CD4bs) antibody, named N6, that potently
              neutralized 98% of HIV-1 isolates, including 16 of 20 that
              were resistant to other members of its class. N6 evolved a
              mode of recognition such that its binding was not impacted
              by the loss of individual contacts across the
              immunoglobulin heavy chain. In addition, structural
              analysis revealed that the orientation of N6 permitted it
              to avoid steric clashes with glycans, which is a common
              mechanism of resistance. Thus, an HIV-1-specific bNAb can
              achieve potent, near-pan neutralization of HIV-1, making
              it an attractive candidate for use in therapy and
              prophylaxis.<br>

            11-dimensional multiverse</b><br>
          <b>By Michael Blaustein</b><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        New research suggests that the human brain is almost beyond
        comprehension because it doesn’t process the world in two
        dimensions or even three. No, the human brain understands the
        visual world in up to 11 different dimensions.<br>
        <br>
        The astonishing discovery helps explain why even cutting-edge
        technologies like functional MRIs have such a hard time
        explaining what is going on inside our <br>
        <br>
        noggins. In a functional MRI, brain activity is monitored and
        represented as a three-dimensional image that changes over time.
        However, if the brain is actually working in 11 dimensions,
        looking at a 3D functional MRI and saying that it explains brain
        activity would be like looking at the shadow of a head of a pin
        and saying that it explains the entire universe, plus a
        multitude of other dimensions.<br>
        <br>
        The team of scientists led by a group from Scientists at the
        École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland detected
        the previously unknown complexities of the brain while working
        on the Blue Brain Project. The project’s goal is to create a
        biologically accurate recreation of the human brain.<br>
        <br>
        During their research, the scientists created simulations of the
        brain and applied an advanced form of mathematics, called
        algebraic topology, to their computer-generated models.<br>
        <br>
        “Algebraic topology is like a telescope and microscope at the
        same time. It can zoom into networks to find hidden structures —
        the trees in the forest — and see the empty spaces — the
        clearings — all at the same time,” said study author Kathryn
        Hess.<br>
        <br>
        What Hess and her colleagues found was that the brain processes
        visual information by creating multi-dimensional neurological
        structures, called cliques, which disintegrate the instant they
        are understood, according to Newsweek who first reported on the
        research that was published in the journal Frontiers in
        Computational Neuroscience.<br>
        <br>
        The cliques have up to 11 different dimensions and form in holes
        of space, called cavities. Once the brain understands the visual
        information, both the clique and cavity disappear.<br>
        <br>
        The appearance of high-dimensional cavities when the brain is
        processing information means that the neurons in the network
        react to stimuli in an extremely organized manner,” said
        researcher Ran Levi.<br>
        <br>
        “It is as if the brain reacts to a stimulus by building then
        razing a tower of multi-dimensional blocks, starting with rods
        (1D), then planks (2D), then cubes (3D), and then more complex
        geometries with 4D, 5D, etc. The progression of activity through
        the brain resembles a multi-dimensional sandcastle that
        materializes out of the sand and then disintegrates,” he said.<br>
        <br>
        Henry Markram, director of Blue Brain Project, explained just
        how momentous a discovery the multi-dimensional structures could
        be.<br>
        <br>
        “The mathematics usually applied to study networks cannot detect
        the high-dimensional structures and spaces that we now see
        clearly,” he said.<br>
        <br>
        “We found a world that we had never imagined. There are tens of
        millions of these objects even in a small speck of the brain, up
        through seven dimensions. In some networks, we even found
        structures with up to 11 dimensions.”<br>

        </div>
        <br>
        The lack of a formal link between neural network structure and
        its emergent function has hampered our understanding of how the
        brain processes information. We have now come closer to
        describing such a link by taking the direction of synaptic
        transmission into account, constructing graphs of a network that
        reflect the direction of information flow, and analyzing these
        directed graphs using algebraic topology. Applying this approach
        to a local network of neurons in the neocortex revealed a
        remarkably intricate and previously unseen topology of synaptic
        connectivity. The synaptic network contains an abundance of
        cliques of neurons bound into cavities that guide the emergence
        of correlated activity. In response to stimuli, correlated
        activity binds synaptically connected neurons into functional
        cliques and cavities that evolve in a stereotypical sequence
        toward peak complexity. We propose that the brain processes
        stimuli by forming increasingly complex functional cliques and
        cavities.<br>

        A study of a large group of children found a link between raised

        reported during the second trimester.<br>

        The study - led by the Mailman School of Public Health at
        Columbia University in New York City, NY - also found that the
        risk of autism increased in line with the number of fevers
        reported after 12 weeks of gestation - rising to 300 percent
        higher risk with reports of three or more fevers...<br>

        <br>
        Some studies suggest that prenatal infection increases risk of
        autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). This study was undertaken in a
        prospective cohort in Norway to examine whether we could find
        evidence to support an association of the prenatal occurrence of
        fever, a common manifestation of infection, with ASD risk.
        Prospective questionnaires provided maternal exposure data; case
        status was established from clinical assessments and registry
        linkages. In a large, prospectively ascertained cohort of
        pregnant mothers and their offspring, we examined infants born
        greater than or equal to32 weeks for associations between fever
        exposure in each trimester and ASD risk using logistic
        regression. Maternal exposure to second-trimester fever was
        associated with increased ASD risk, adjusting for presence of
        fever in other trimesters and confounders (adjusted odds ratio
        (aOR), 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.09–1.79), with a
        similar, but nonsignificant, point estimate in the first
        trimester. Risk increased markedly with exposure to three or
        more fever episodes after 12 weeks' gestation (aOR, 3.12;
        1.28–7.63). ASD risk appears to increase with maternal fever,
        particularly in the second trimester. Risk magnified dose
        dependently with exposure to multiple fevers after 12 weeks'
        gestation. Our findings support a role for gestational maternal
        infection and innate immune responses to infection in the
        pathogenesis of at least some cases of ASD.<br>

            “punch” for knocking-out cancer stem cells</b><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        CANCER stem cells, which fuel the growth of fatal tumours, can
        be knocked out by a one-two combination of antibiotics and
        Vitamin C in a new experimental strategy, published by
        researchers at the University of Salford, UK.<br>
        <br>
        The antibiotic, Doxycycline, followed by doses of ascorbic acid
        (Vitamin C), were surprisingly effective in killing the cancer
        stem cells under laboratory conditions, according to the
        research published in the journal Oncotarget.<br>
        <br>
        In boxing terms, this would be the equivalent of two blows
        delivered in rapid succession; a left-hand jab, followed by a
        right cross.<br>
        <br>
        The researchers say their method offers a new explanation for
        how to prevent cancer cells from becoming treatment-resistant
        and how combinations therapies can be developed to overcome drug
        resistance.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Starve cancer cells </b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Professor Michael Lisanti, who designed the study, explained:
        “We now know that a proportion of cancer cells escape
        chemotherapy and develop drug resistance; we established this
        new strategy to find out how they do it.<br>
        <br>
        “We suspected the answer lay in the fact that certain cancer
        cells – which we call metabolically flexible - are able to
        switch their fuel source. Thus, when the drug treatment reduces
        the availability of a particular nutrient, the flexible cancer
        cells can feed themselves with an alternative energy source.”<br>
        <br>
        This new combination approach prevents cancer cells from
        changing their diet (metabolically inflexible), and effectively
        starves them, by preventing them from using any other available
        types of bio-fuels.<br>
        <br>
        The team at the University of Salford’s Biomedical Research
        Centre, added Doxycycline in ever increasing doses over a
        three-month period, to induce metabolic inflexibility.&nbsp; The
        result was to leave the cancer cells alive, but severely
        attenuated and depleted, so that they would be much more
        susceptible to starvation, by a second metabolic “punch”.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Combination</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        First, the researchers inhibited the tumour cell mitochondria,
        by restricting the cancer cells only to glucose as a fuel
        source; then, they took away their glucose, effectively starving
        the cancer cells to death.<br>
        <br>
        “In this scenario, Vitamin C behaves as an inhibitor of
        glycolysis, which fuels energy production in mitochondria, the
        “powerhouse” of the cell, explained co-author Dr Federica
        Sotgia.<br>
        <br>
        The Salford team recently showed Vitamin C to be up to ten times
        more effective at stopping cancer cell growth than
        pharmaceuticals such as 2-DG, but they say that when Vitamin C
        is combined with an antibiotic, it is up to ten times more
        effective, making it nearly 100 times more effective than 2-DG.<br>
        <br>
        As Doxycycline and Vitamin C are both relatively non-toxic, this
        could dramatically reduce the possible side-effects of
        anti-cancer therapy.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Clinical trials </b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        The Salford team also identified eight other drugs that could be
        used as a “second-punch” after the antibiotic regime, including
        berberine (a natural product) – and a number of cheap non-toxic
        FDA approved drugs.<br>
        <br>
        Professor Lisanti added: “This is further evidence that Vitamin
        C and other non-toxic compounds may have a role to play in the
        fight against cancer.<br>
        <br>
        “Our results indicate it is a promising agent for clinical
        trials, and a as an add-on to more conventional therapies, to
        prevent tumour recurrence, further disease progression and
        metastasis.”<br>

        </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
        <br>
        Here, we developed a new synthetic lethal strategy for further
        optimizing the eradication of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Briefly,
        we show that chronic treatment with the FDA-approved antibiotic
        Doxycycline effectively reduces cellular respiration, by
        targeting mitochondrial protein translation. The expression of
        four mitochondrial DNA encoded proteins (MT-ND3, MT-CO2, MT-ATP6
        and MT-ATP8) is suppressed, by up to 35-fold. This high
        selection pressure metabolically synchronizes the surviving
        cancer cell sub-population towards a predominantly glycolytic
        phenotype, resulting in metabolic inflexibility. We directly
        validated this Doxycycline-induced glycolytic phenotype, by
        using metabolic flux analysis and label-free unbiased
        proteomics.<br>
        <br>
        Next, we identified two natural products (Vitamin C and
        Berberine) and six clinically-approved drugs, for metabolically
        targeting the Doxycycline-resistant CSC population (Atovaquone,
        Irinotecan, Sorafenib, Niclosamide, Chloroquine, and
        Stiripentol). This new combination strategy allows for the more
        efficacious eradication of CSCs with Doxycycline, and provides a
        simple pragmatic solution to the possible development of
        Doxycycline-resistance in cancer cells. In summary, we propose
        the combined use of i) Doxycycline (Hit-1: targeting
        mitochondria) and ii) Vitamin C (Hit-2: targeting glycolysis),
        which represents a new synthetic-lethal metabolic strategy for
        eradicating CSCs.<br>
        <br>
        This type of metabolic Achilles’ heel will allow us and others
        to more effectively “starve” the CSC population...<br>

        <b>A synthetic lethal strategy for eradicating DoxyR CSCs, using
          natural products (Vitamin C and Berberine) and other
          FDA-approved drugs</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Next, we tested the efficacy of glycolysis inhibitors, such as
        2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG) and Vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Treatment
        with 2-DG inhibited the propagation of DoxyR CSCs by &gt; 90% at
        10 mM and 100% at 20 mM (Figure 10). In addition, Vitamin C was
        more potent than 2-DG; it inhibited DoxyR CSC propagation by
        &gt; 90% at 250 µM and 100% at 500 µM (Figure 10). As such, the
        IC-50 for Vitamin C in this context was between 100 to 250 µM,
        which are within the known achievable blood levels, when Vitamin
        C is taken orally. Previously, we showed that the IC-50 for
        Vitamin C was 1 mM for MCF7 CSC propagation [13]. <br>
        <br>
        Therefore, DoxyR CSCs are between 4- to 10-fold more sensitive
        to Vitamin C than control MCF7 CSCs, under identical assay
        conditions.<br>
        <br>
        We also examined the efficacy of 4 other clinically-approved
        drugs that functionally behave as either OXPHOS inhibitors
        (Irinotecan, Sorafenib, Niclosamide) or glycolysis inhibitors
        (Stiripentol) (Figure 11). In this context, Stiripentol
        functions as an LDH inhibitor. Their rank order potency for
        inhibiting DoxyR CSC propagation is: Niclosamide (IC-50 ~ 100
        nM) &gt; Irinotecan (IC-50 ~ 500 nM) &gt; Sorafenib (IC-50 ~ 0.5
        to 1 µM) &gt; Stiripentol (IC-50 ~ 10 to 50 µM).<br>
        <br>
        Finally, we tested the efficacy of Berberine, which is a
        naturally occurring antibiotic that also behaves as an OXPHOS
        inhibitor. It was used as early as 3,000 B.C. in China, for
        medicinal purposes. Figure 11 shows that treatment with
        Berberine effectively inhibited the propagation of the DoxyR
        CSCs by &gt; 50% at 1 µM and &gt; 80% at 10 µM...<br>
        <br>
        <b>Discussion</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        In this report, we present new functional evidence to support a
        novel synthetic lethal strategy to eradicate CSCs. More
        specifically, we demonstrate that the use of Doxycycline, a
        clinically approved antibiotic, induces metabolic stress in
        cancer cells. This allows the remaining cancer cells to be
        synchronized towards a purely glycolytic phenotype, driving a
        form of metabolic inflexibility. This Doxycycline-driven aerobic
        glycolysis was further confirmed and validated, by employing
        high-resolution proteomics analysis and metabolic phenotyping.
        In addition, we discovered that both natural products and
        FDA-approved drugs could be re-purposed to eradicate the
        Doxycycline-resistant CSC population. These 9 small molecules
        included: Vitamin C, Berberine, 2-DG, Atovaquone, Irinotecan,
        Sorafenib, Niclosamide, Chloroquine, and Stiripentol.<br>
        <br>
        Our new therapeutic strategy should provide for the more
        efficient eradication of CSCs using Doxycycline, as well as a
        practical means for solving the potential problem of Doxycycline
        resistance in CSCs. As such, we suggest a new synthetic lethal
        strategy for eradicating CSCs, by employing i) Doxycycline (to
        target mitochondria) and ii) Vitamin C (to target glycolysis)
        (Figure 12). Use of this combined metabolic strategy should help
        prevent CSCs from exploiting the essential nutrients that they
        normally derive from the tumor microenvironment.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Overcoming resistance to Doxycycline in cancer cells, using
          metabolic inflexibility, synthetic lethality and Vitamin C</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Resistance to anti-cancer therapy remains as one of the key
        issues in cancer patient management. Treatment failure is
        regarded as an alarming outcome of numerous different
        therapeutic approaches. Indeed, the use of combination
        strategies aimed at hitting multiple aspects of tumor
        progression is currently considered as a promising tool to
        overcome resistance. Mounting evidence suggests that CSCs act as
        the main promoter of tumor recurrence and patient relapse [1-5].
        Thus, a better understanding of the biological and biochemical
        behavior of CSCs during drug resistance may unveil new
        vulnerabilities, to be exploited in a therapeutic setting.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        In this context, our data indicates that a metabolic shift from
        oxidative to glycolytic metabolism represents an escape
        mechanism for breast cancer cells chronically-treated with a
        mitochondrial stressor like Doxycycline, as mitochondrial
        dys-function leads to a stronger dependence on glucose.<br>
        <br>
        Our current findings are in line with previous studies showing
        the highly plastic nature of CSCs allows them to adjust and
        adapt their metabolic environment, in order to maintain their
        distinctive properties, in a hostile tumor microenvironment,
        often characterized by an inadequate nutrient and oxygen supply
        (reviewed in [23]). Here, we have taken advantage of the
        glycolytic shift exhibited by DoxyR CSCs, as we have used
        several glycolysis inhibitors with the aim to turn their strict
        metabolic inflexibility, into a lethal phenotype. Among the
        agents tested in the our study, Vitamin C has been demonstrated
        to selectively kill cancer cells in vitro and to inhibit tumor
        growth in experimental mouse models [24, 25]. Remarkably, many
        of these actions have been attributed to the ability of Vitamin
        C to act as a glycolysis inhibitor, by targeting GAPDH and
        depleting the NAD pool [22, 26, 27].<br>
        <br>
        In this context, we have previously demonstrated that Vitamin C
        effectively inhibits 3D breast tumor spheroid formation, with an
        IC-50 of 1 mM, suggesting that this micronutrient also works as
        an inhibitor of CSCs [13], whose activity is critically
        dependent on an active mitochondrial TCA cycle and OXPHOS. In
        contrast, here we show that DoxyR CSCs are more vulnerable to
        the inhibitory effects of Vitamin C, at 4- to 10-fold lower
        concentrations, between 100 to 250 μM. These findings are
        further supported by clinical studies showing that the
        concurrent use of Vitamin C, with standard chemotherapy, reduces
        tumor recurrence and patient mortality [28, 29].<br>
        <br>
        It is worth noting that Vitamin C plasma levels vary
        considerably with the route of administration. For instance,
        pharmacokinetic studies performed by different research groups
        have assessed that, after oral administration, Vitamin C plasma
        levels reach concentrations of ~70-220 μM [reviewed in reference
        #30], which represents the maximum tolerated oral dose. By
        contrast, Padayatty and co-workers found that, compared to oral
        intake, intravenous administration results in 30- to 70- fold
        higher plasma concentrations of Vitamin C [31]. Furthermore,
        consumption of 5 to 9 servings of fruits and vegetables per day
        allows plasma levels of Vitamin C to reach up to 80 μM at
        steady-state, with peak values of 220 μM [31]. Remarkably, an
        intravenous infusion of Vitamin C can reach plasma levels of
        15,000 μM (i.e., 15 mM). Interestingly, doses of up to 50 grams
        per day, infused slowly, didn’t exhibit any toxic side effects
        on cancer patients [30]. These observations suggest that
        intravenous administration of Vitamin C may have a role in
        cancer treatment, as this route allows higher plasma
        concentrations than those achievable with the maximum tolerated
        oral dose.<br>
        <br>
        Previous studies have demonstrated that Vitamin C behaves as a
        potent dietary antioxidant, as well as a pro-oxidant. This
        pro-oxidant activity results from Vitamin C’s action on metal
        ions, which generates free radicals and hydrogen peroxide, and
        is associated with cell toxicity. Of note, it has been shown
        that high-dose Vitamin C is more cytotoxic to cancer cells than
        to normal cells [32, 33]. This selectivity appears to be due to
        the higher catalase content observed in normal cells (~10-100
        fold greater), as compared to tumor cells. Hence, Vitamin C may
        be regarded as a safe agent that selectively targets cancer
        cells.<br>
        <br>
        A recent study performed on a panel of cancer cells (A431,
        Panc-1, HeLa, HT29, and MCF7) showed that Vitamin C only affects
        cell viability at concentration of ~3 to 10 mM [34], thus
        providing more evidence to support a lack of toxicity for low
        micromolar concentrations of Vitamin C.<br>
        <br>
        Similarly, phase I and II clinical trials, designed to deliver
        high-dose intravenous Vitamin C, have shown a lack of toxic side
        effects for concentrations of up to 292 μM [35]. Taken together
        with these findings, our data suggest that Vitamin C’s action as
        a glycolytic inhibitor may represent a safe and effective
        strategy to be used in combination therapies, with conventional
        anticancer drugs, as well as with Doxycycline.<br>
        <br>
        Because of our success with 2-DG and Vitamin C, we explored
        additional FDA-approved drugs with glycolysis-inhibiting
        activity that could be repurposed to eradicate CSC propagation,
        in combination with Doxycycline. For example, we demonstrated
        that the LDH enzyme inhibitor Stiripentol is also effective at
        targeting DoxyR CSCs; this drug is currently used clinically as
        an anti-epileptic in children.<br>
        <br>
        We also further explored other suitable metabolic approaches to
        overcome Doxycycline resistance. In this context, we evaluated
        the efficacy of a panel of compounds that share the ability to
        impair mitochondrial function (OXPHOS), as a common off-target
        side-effect. This approach was based on the assumption that
        DoxyR cells, which exhibit altered oxidative metabolism, are
        extremely sensitive to the induction of additional mitochondrial
        dysfunction. These effective compounds included four
        FDA-approved drugs, such as Atovaquone, Irinotecan, Sorafenib,
        and Niclosamide, as well as the natural product Berberine.<br>
        <br>
        Interestingly, we observed that Chloroquine also reduces the
        spheroid forming efficiency of DoxyR cells, indicating that
        inhibition of autophagy may represent another effective
        combination strategy, to sensitize breast cancer cells to the
        actions of Doxycycline.<br>
        <br>
        We believe that the emerging functional relationship between
        metabolism and stemness, also known as “metabo-stemness” [36],
        holds great promise for the future of anti-cancer therapy. Thus,
        our novel findings may pave the way for the discovery and
        validation of more effective therapeutic strategies to fully
        eradicate CSCs, ultimately preventing treatment failure and
        minimizing metastatic dissemination.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Synergistic effects of Doxycycline and Vitamin C in the
          treatment of infectious disease states</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Is there any precedent for the use of Doxycycline in combination
        with Vitamin C, in clinical trials? Interestingly, another group
        published a report on a randomized clinical trial of the effects
        of Vitamin C on dyspareunia and vaginal discharge, in women
        receiving Doxycycline and Triple sulfa for chlamydial cervicitis
        infections [37]. Importantly, they concluded that the cure rate
        was nearly 5-fold higher in the patients that received Vitamin
        C, together with antibiotic therapy [37]. So, the concurrent use
        of Doxycycline and Vitamin C, in the context of this infectious
        disease, appeared to be highly synergistic in patients.<br>
        <br>
        Similarly, Goc et al., 2016, showed that Doxycycline is
        synergistic in vitro with certain phytochemicals and
        micronutrients, including Vitamin C, in the in vitro killing of
        the vegetative spirochete form of Borrelia spp., the causative
        agent underlying Lyme disease [38]. Vitamin C has also been
        shown to be synergistic with Tetracycline and Chloramphenicol,
        against the pathogenic bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa [39].
        However, in the above examples, no follow-up mechanistic studies
        were conducted to determine exactly why Doxycycline,
        Tetracycline and Vitamin C were somehow synergistic.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Conclusions</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Numerous functional studies have now directly shown that
        mitochondria are an important new therapeutic target in cancer
        cells [3, 5, 8-21, 40-53]. Since Doxycycline, an FDA-approved
        antibiotic, behaves as an inhibitor of mitochondrial protein
        translation, it may have therapeutic value in the specific
        targeting of mitochondria in cancer cells. However, in this
        paper, we have identified a novel metabolic mechanism by which
        CSCs successfully escape from the anti-mitochondrial effects of
        Doxycycline, by assuming a purely glycolytic phenotype.
        Therefore, DoxyR CSCs are then more susceptible to other
        metabolic perturbations, because of their metabolic
        inflexibility, allowing for their eradication with natural
        products and other FDA-approved drugs. Thus, understanding the
        metabolic basis of Doxycycline-resistance has ultimately helped
        us to develop a new synthetic lethal strategy, for more
        effectively targeting CSCs. <br>

        <br>
        A promising avenue for the future of clean energy is to store it
        in the form of carbon-based fuels produced from renewable
        sources, effectively enabling the clean use of liquid fuels such
        as gasoline. A first step is the electrolysis of carbon dioxide
        into oxygen and carbon monoxide, which can be subsequently be
        transformed into liquid fuels. But current CO-forming catalysts
        are either not selective enough or too expensive to be
        industrially viable. EPFL scientists have now developed an
        Earth-abundant catalyst based on copper-oxide nanowires modified
        with tin oxide. A solar-driven system setup using this catalyst
        was able to split CO2 with an efficiency of 13.4%. The work is
        published in Nature Energy, and is expected to help worldwide
        efforts to synthetically produce carbon-based fuels from CO2 and
        water.<br>
        <br>
        The research was carried out by the lab of Michael Grätzel at
        EPFL. Grätzel is known worldwide for the invention of
        dye-sensitized solar cells ("Grätzel cells"). The new catalyst,
        developed by PhD student Marcel Schreier, postdoc Jingshan Luo,
        and several co-workers, is made by depositing atomic layers of
        tin oxide on copper oxide nanowires. Tin oxide suppresses the
        generation of side-products, which are commonly observed from
        copper oxide catalysts, leading to the sole production of CO in
        the electroreduction of CO2.<br>
        <br>
        The catalyst was integrated into a CO2 electrolysis system and
        linked to a triple-junction solar cell (GaInP/GaInAs/Ge) to make
        a CO2 photo-electrolyzer. Importantly, the system uses the same
        catalyst as the cathode that reduces CO2 to CO and the anode
        that oxidizes water to oxygen through what is known as the
        "oxygen evolution reaction." The gases are separated with a
        bipolar membrane. Using only Earth-abundant materials to
        catalyze both reactions, this design keeps the cost of the
        system low.<br>
        <br>
        The system was able to selectively convert CO2 to CO with an
        efficiency of 13.4% using solar energy. The catalyst also
        reached a Faradaic efficiency of up to 90%, which describes how
        efficiently electrical charge is transferred to the desired
        product in an electrocatalysis system like the one developed
        here. "The work sets a new benchmark for solar-driven CO2
        reduction," says Luo.<br>
        <br>
        "This is the first time that such a bi-functional and low-cost
        catalyst is demonstrated," adds Schreier. "Very few catalysts --
        except expensive ones, like gold and silver -- can selectively
        transform CO2 to CO in water, which is crucial for industrial

        &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        A process for making highly oxygenated drinking water includes
        initially preparing a stabilized hydrogen peroxide solution, and
        then adding a suitably small quantity of it to natural drinking
        water. The stabilized hydrogen peroxide solution is made by
        adding a complex polymer in the form of polyvinylpyrrolidone to
        a quantity of diluted hydrogen peroxide. Various different
        molecular weight compositions of polyvinylpyrrolidone are added
        at different times according to a preferred technique.<br>
        <br>
        <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><br>
        <br>
        It is well known that oxygen is essential for humans to sustain
        life. Pure oxygen, therefore, has been administered in various
        concentrations to facilitate breathing and to provide a sense of
        well-being.<br>
        <br>
        While the benefits of oxygen are well known, the administration
        of high concentrations of oxygen to human beings, has been
        heretofore substantially limited to gaseous administrations
        only. However, if a suitable highly oxygenated drinking water
        could be made, then one could easily and conveniently receive
        the benefits of oxygen by merely drinking such water. In this
        regard, such highly oxygenated drinking water could be readily
        bottled, and marketed in a similar manner to other conventional
        bottled drinking water. Drinking water is currently marketed in
        transparent or translucent glass or plastic bottles.<br>
        <br>
        However, due to the nature of oxygen, it would be extremely
        difficult to have highly oxygenated pure drinking water stored
        in a conventional bottle for long periods of time, and still
        retain its oxygenated nature at the same effective levels of
        concentration. In this regard, in order to have high quality
        drinking water, there can not be present any undesirably high
        concentrations of extraneous substances used to buffer or
        otherwise retain the oxygen.<br>
        <br>
        Such buffering or other substances could make the drinking water
        undesirable for human consumption. It would not be desirable to
        significantly alter the taste or color of the natural drinking
        water. Also, of course, any additives must not render the
        natural drinking water toxic or otherwise deteriorate the
        quality of the drinking water below accepted standards. Any
        additives should not, in any manner, adversely affect the taste
        or other qualities of the water.<br>
        <br>
        Also, the bottled drinking water must be able to be stored for
        long periods of time prior to consumption. Thus, in order to
        permit the oxygenated drinking water to stand for long periods
        of time, the oxygen content must remain in tact and be stable,
        and not undergo unwanted decomposition. Shelf life as well as
        storage and transportation, are important considerations for
        bottled drinking water. The storage in clear bottles could also
        present a significant problem. In this regard, light impinging
        on the oxygenated water could help accelerate decomposition of
        the highly oxygenated drinking water.<br>
        <br>
        One approach to highly oxygenated drinking water could be to add
        a very small concentration of hydrogen peroxide to natural
        drinking water. With such an additive, the hydrogen peroxide
        would achieve the desired result of adding the desired oxygen to
        the water. However, it is well known that hydrogen peroxide is
        very unstable, especially in the presence of water. For example,
        reference may be made to U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,480,557; 5,077,047;
        5,130,124; 5,206,385; and 5,312,619.<br>
        <br>
        The foregoing patents disclose various additives for use with
        hydrogen peroxide for stabilizing it, when used as an antiseptic
        agent or the like. Thus, it is quite clear that hydrogen
        peroxide is unstable, and thus its level of concentration will
        become diminished with time, unless stabilization steps are
        taken. However, in order to stabilize hydrogen peroxide in very
        minute concentration levels in drinking water, the stabilization
        problem is far more difficult, and has been heretofore
        unattainable.<br>
        <br>
        Hydrogen peroxide will disassociate in basic or acidic water
        conditions, as well as in the presence of metal ions. Thus, the
        pH of the water, as well as the metal ion content, is critical,
        should hydrogen peroxide be added. Since only minute quantities
        of hydrogen peroxide could be added to the drinking water to
        avoid alteration of the taste, the presence of impurities or
        other ingredients in the water create a highly unstable
        environment for the hydrogen peroxide.<br>
        <br>
        If buffering or other additives are employed in an attempt to
        stabilize the hydrogen peroxide, the taste of the resulting
        treated drinking water could be altered in an undesirable
        manner. Also, in view of the requirement of bottling drinking
        water in clear containers, achieving the stability of hydrogen
        peroxide in drinking water is extremely difficult.<br>
        <br>
        Thus, it would be extremely desirable to have a process for
        making highly oxygenated drinking water, which can be stored in
        clear containers for long periods of time and still maintain the
        desired levels of concentration of additional oxygen.<br>
        <br>
        <b>DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</b><br>
        <br>
        Therefore, the principal object of the present invention is to
        provide a new and improved method of formulating highly
        oxygenated drinking water, which can be stored for long periods
        of time, even in translucent containers, while maintaining
        desired levels of oxygenation.<br>
        <br>
        Another object of the present invention is to provide such a new
        and improved method of formulating highly oxygenated drinking
        water and the drinking water made by the method, wherein
        hydrogen peroxide is an additive and yet undue hydrogen peroxide
        breakdown does not occur during storage prior to consumption.<br>
        <br>
        Briefly, the above and further objects of the present invention
        are realized by providing a new and improved stabilized
        composition of highly oxygenated drinking water made by an
        inventive method.<br>
        <br>
        A process for making highly oxygenated drinking water includes
        initially preparing a stabilized hydrogen peroxide solution, and
        then adding a suitably small quantity of it to natural drinking
        water. The stabilized hydrogen peroxide solution is made by
        adding a complex polymer in the form of polyvinylpyrrolidone to
        a quantity of diluted hydrogen peroxide. Various different
        molecular weight compositions of polyvinylpyrrolidone are added
        at different times according to a preferred technique.<br>
        <br>
        It has been discovered, by following the inventive process, that
        highly oxygenated drinking water can be produced, and it
        contains many times more oxygen than conventional natural
        drinking water. The inventive drinking water can be stored
        conveniently in conventional clear bottles or other containers
        for long periods of time, without experiencing undue
        decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide. Also, the quality of the
        water is not compromised. The color and taste of the inventive
        drinking water is not adversely affected.<br>
        <br>
        <b>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        The following examples were given to aid in understanding the
        invention, but it is to be understood that the particular
        procedures, conditions and materials of these examples are not
        intended as limitations of the present invention.<br>
        <br>
        In accordance with the novel process of the present invention, a
        stabilized complex composition of hydrogen peroxide and is added
        to drinking water to formulate the inventive highly oxygenated
        water. According to the inventive process, the stabilized
        hydrogen peroxide solution is made by adding slowly a suitable
        quantity of a 35% by weight hydrogen peroxide concentrate to
        purified distilled water and mixing them together in small
        quantities at a time. The process requires the pouring of the
        concentrated 35% by weight H2 O2 over the purified water in a
        closed glass lined reactor with continuous agitation utilizing a
        stainless steel stirrer driven by a pneumatic or explosion proof
        motor until an aqueous solution containing 17.5% by weight
        hydrogen peroxide is formed.<br>
        <br>
        At the end of the dilution process, a sample of the diluted
        17.5% by weightH2 O2 is taken to verify pH, temperature, and
        concentration. Upon verification of the 17.5% solution, the
        resulting 17.5% hydrogen peroxide solution is refrigerated in
        the glass lined reactor by a recirculating pump. In this regard,
        the temperature of the 17.5% H2 O2 solution is lowered to a
        temperature between about 5 DEG C. and about 8 DEG C.<br>
        <br>
        A 15% by weight charge of polyvinylpyrrolidone K15 having a
        molecular weight of about 10,000 is then added slowly to the
        aqueous 17.5% hydrogen peroxide solution and continuously
        agitated for a sufficient amount of time of about 60 minutes
        until the K15 PVP charge is completely dissolved in the aqueous
        H2 O2 solution. When the K15 PVP is dissolved, a sample of the
        resulting 15% K15 PVP-H2 O2 solution is taken to verify pH,
        temperature, density and the concentration of the H2 O2.<br>
        <br>
        Next, a 50% by weight charge of polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 having
        a molecular weight of about 40,000 is then added slowly to the
        resulting aqueous 15% K15 PVP-H2 O2 complex solution with
        continuous agitation for another sufficient amount of time of
        about until the K30 PVP charge is completely dissolved therein.
        When the PVP is dissolved, a sample of the resulting 50% K30
        PVP-H2 O2 solution is taken to verify pH, temperature, density
        and H2 O2 concentration.<br>
        <br>
        After proper verification, a 5% by weight charge of
        polyvinylpyrrolidone having a molecular weight K90 is added to
        the resulting complex 50% K30 PVP-H2 O2 aqueous solution and
        agitated continuously for still yet another sufficient period of
        time of about 30 minutes until the K90 PVP charge is completely
        dissolved.<br>
        <br>
        Thereafter, the refrigeration is terminated. Agitation of the
        resulting 5% K90 PVP-H2 O2 complex solution, however, is
        continued for at least another period of time of about 8 hours.<br>
        <br>
        Thereafter, the resulting 5% K90 PVP-H2 O2 solution is held at
        rest for a rest period time of about 24 hours. The rest period
        allows bonding of the PVP molecules to the hydrogen peroxide,
        resulting in a stabilized aqueous PVP-H2 O2 solution containing
        about 17% by weight of hydrogen peroxide. Thereafter, the
        solution is again mixed for about another 2 hour period. The
        resulting solution at the end of the mixing period is a 17%
        stabilized H2 O2 solution. The solution is then sampled and
        tested to verify temperature, density and the concentration of
        the H2 O2 solution.<br>
        <br>
        The resulting stabilized solution may then be stored in a clean,
        perfectly degreased, high density polyethylene plastic container
        until the highly oxygenated water product is to be produced.<br>
        <br>
        Finally the highly oxygenated water is formulated for varying
        strengths of available oxygen in accordance with the following
        examples:<br>
        <br>
        <b>EXAMPLE I</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        For highly oxygenated water having four times the normal
        quantity of oxygen add 5 milligrams of the 17% stabilized H2 O2
        solution per liter of purified distilled water to form a desired
        oxygenated water product having about 4% stabilized oxygen.<br>
        <br>
        The resulting oxygenated water product is then transferred into
        a suitable number of clear plastic containers or the like for
        shipping and marketing purposes.<br>
        <br>
        This process of making Example I has been found to provide the
        minimum amount of oxygen to achieve the objects of the
        invention.<br>
        <br>
        <b>EXAMPLE II</b><br>
        <br>
        The composition of the present invention was tested to determine
        the maximum additive amount of the 17% stabilized PVP-H2 O2
        solution to purified water without causing an unpleasant taste
        or a mucous lining irritation.<br>
        <br>
        For highly oxygenated water having 20 times the normal quantity
        of oxygen add 25 milligrams or less of the stabilized aqueous
        PVP-H2 O2 solution per liter of purified distilled water and mix
        for at least 2 hours to form the desired oxygenated water
        product.<br>
        <br>
        The resulting oxygenated water product is then transferred into
        a suitable number of clear plastic containers or the like for
        storage and shipping purposes.<br>
        <br>
        In this example, it was noted that any greater quantity than 25
        milligrams per liter of the stabilized aqueous PVP-H2 O2
        solution results in an unpleasant taste and slight irritation to
        mucous linings.<br>
        <br>
        The process of making Example II is the preferred process and
        has been found to provide the maximum amount of stable oxygen to
        achieve the objects of the invention.<br>
        <br>
        <b>EXAMPLE III</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        As a final example, a suitable vat is prepared according to well
        known sterile protocols. Next 50 gallons of purified distilled
        spring water is added to about 15 cc of a 17% stable hydrogen
        peroxide concentrate prepared according to the prior enumerated
        protocol as specified in Example 1. The resulting solution is
        then gently agitated for about 60 seconds with a sterile paddle.
        The resulting solution is a concentration of about 79 parts per
        millions of hydrogen peroxide which is suitable for human
        consumption.<br>
        <br>
        In each of the above enumerated examples, the aqueous PVP-H2 O2
        solutions serve as active oxygen agents, while the purified
        water components serve as vehicles for transporting captured
        oxygen molecules to the blood stream of a person drinking the
        oxygenated water solution. Thus, in use, the PVP-H2 O2 solution
        when consumed provides an immediate and beneficial oxygen lift.<br>

        In other uses, depending upon the total parts per million of H2
        O2 concentrate added to purified water, the oxygenated water has
        a variety of applications. For example, the oxygenated water can
        function as a bacterial agent to preserve organic products such
        as meats, cheeses, vegetables, fruits and beverages from a
        significant number of bacteria without providing any undesired
        flavor and without altering the natural properties of the
        processed food and beverages.<br>

        </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
        </b><b>Objective</b><br>
        <br>
        No drug is yet approved to treat the core symptoms of autism
        spectrum disorder (ASD). Low-dose suramin was effective in the
        maternal immune activation and Fragile X mouse models of ASD.
        The Suramin Autism Treatment-1 (SAT-1) trial was a double-blind,
        placebo-controlled, translational pilot study to examine the
        safety and activity of low-dose suramin in children with ASD...<br>
        <br>
        Suramin has many actions. One of its best-studied actions is as
        an inhibitor of purinergic signaling. It is the oldest member of
        a growing class of antipurinergic drugs (APDs) in
        development.[31] Suramin was first synthesized in 1916,[32]
        making it one of the oldest manmade drugs still in medical use.
        It is used to treat African sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis),
        and remains on the World Health Organization list of essential
        medications. Concerns about the toxicity of high-dose suramin
        arose when the cumulative antitrypanosomal dose was increased 5
        times or more over several months to treat AIDS or kill cancer
        cells during chemotherapy. When blood levels were maintained
        over 150 µmol/L for 3–6 months at a time to treat cancer, a
        number of dose-limiting side effects were described.[32] These
        included adrenal insufficiency, anemia, and peripheral
        neuropathy. In contrast, mouse studies suggested that high-dose
        suramin was not necessary to treat autism-like symptoms. These
        studies showed that low-dose suramin that produced blood levels
        of about 5–10 µM was effective in treating ASD-like symptoms and
        did not produce toxicity even when used for at least 4
        months.[12, 14]...<br>
        <br>
        <b>Conclusions</b><br>
        <br>
        The SAT-1 trial examined the effects of low-dose suramin or
        placebo in 10 children with autism spectrum disorder. No safety
        concerns were found. A two-compartment pharmacokinetic model
        permitted accurate forecasting of plasma drug levels from 1 h to
        6 weeks after the infusion. Metabolomic studies confirmed the
        importance of the cell danger response (CDR)[8] and purinergic
        signaling.[12-14] A single intravenous dose of suramin was
        associated with improved scores for language, social
        interaction, and decreased restricted or repetitive behaviors
        measured by ADOS, ABC, ATEC, and CGI scores. None of these
        improvements occurred in the five children who received placebo.
        The generalizability of these findings is unknown. Future
        studies will be needed to confirm these findings in larger
        numbers of children with ASD, and to evaluate whether a few
        doses of suramin given over a few months are safe and might
        facilitate continued improvements.<br>

        <div align="center"><font size="+1"><b>Lead Coolant for Nuclear
              Reactors</b></font><br>
        </div>
        <b><br>
        </b>The use of lead as coolant for a nuclear reactor results in
        a so called "fast" neutron spectrum, which facilitates
        production of fissile fuel from U-238 with a conversion ratio
        larger than unity. Hence, fuel resources increase by two orders
        of magnitude, making nuclear power sustainable for thousands of
        years. Moreover, the fast neutron spectrum makes it possible to
        efficiently transmute the long-lived waste, such as americium
        and curium, into stable or short-lived fission products, with a
        minimum of negative side-effects on the safety of reactor and
        fuel-cycle facilities.<br>
        <br>
        The most important advantage of lead is that it allows to
        combine a closure of the fuel cycle with an outstanding set of
        safety features, including:<br>
        <br>
        No violent exothermic reaction with water<br>
        A very high boiling temperature, reducing the risk for loss of
        coolant<br>
        An excellent potential for decay heat removal by natural
        convection<br>
        Chemical retention of iodine and caesium, should a fuel failure
        occur<br>
        Inherent shielding of gamma radiation from fission products<b><br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Break-through innovation<br>
          <br>
        </b>A major disadvantage of using lead coolants is the risk for
        corrosion attack on fuel cladding and steam generator tubes. The
        high solubility of nickel in lead makes it necessary to form and
        maintain a protective oxide film on the surfaces of structural
        materials. However, chromium oxide scales forming on
        conventional stainless steels grow too thick after a year of
        full power operation in a lead-cooled reactor, making them
        mechanically unstable. Silicon or aluminium alloyed steels form
        thinner films of silicon and aluminium oxides, respectively,
        rendering the steels corrosion proof over longer exposure times.
        In Russia, a silicon alloyed steel has been developed for use in
        the SVBR-100 and BEST-300 reactors, whereas in Germany, a
        technique for surface alloying of steels with FeCrAlY has
        allowed to improve corrosion and fretting performance
        significantly.<br>
        <br>
        In collaboration with Swedish steel industry, LeadCold materials
        experts have developed an aluminium alloyed steel
        (Fe-10Cr-4Al-Zr) which exhibits perfect corrosion resistance
        during exposure to lead for more than 19 000 hours at T = 550°C.
        The addition of zirconium reduces the risk for formation of
        chromium carbides that may be detrimental for corrosion
        resistance, and allows to keep the aluminium concentration at a
        level low enough to ensure weldability of the material. Based on
        this break-through innovation, LeadCold has designed the SEALER
        reactor for commercial power production in off-grid
        applications.<b><br>

        </b>A new electric circuit system for electric cars, etc. is
        characterized as follows: a) a closed circuit system of two
        battery groups consisting of six batteries (1-3, 4-6) connected
        with each other in series, and likewise batteries (21-23, 24-26)
        also connected with each other in series; b) two condensers (9,
        10) in the one battery group separate batteries (1-3 and 4-6)
        from one another, and two other condensers (29, 30) in the other
        battery group which separate batteries (21, 23) and (24-26) from
        each other; c) that when alternating discharges between the
        negative poles of condensers (9, 10) and (29, 30) occur, a
        hitherto unknown alternating current is brought about which is
        without resistance, tension an loss of heat and which is not
        governed by Ohm's law.; This new alternating current is called
        "Cold Electricity". d) using this new electric circuit system
        the power of the electric car can be enhanced further if
        condensers (9, 10, 51, 52, 53, 54) are connected with each other
        in parallel. At the same time, however the number of thyristors
        is also increased.<br>
        <br>
        The object of this invention is 2 new electric circuit system,
        which during the period of research was christened "Cold<br>
        Electricity". Technicians in te electronics industry and the
        field of electricity have creamed cf a system which would enable
        electricity to move freely in a conductor without resistance and
        without any loss cf the input energy at normal room temperature.<br>
        <br>
        The NEW ELECTRIC CIRCUIT SYSTEM as proposed by the invention is
        based upon the use of two main groups consisting of six
        batteries in each group in which due to the unique construction
        there is a new type of electric current at normal room
        temperature.<br>
        <br>
        The new electric circuit system, which has the characteristics
        indicated in the claims below, is not subject to Chm's law. The
        new electric circuit will have applications which will have a
        world-wide market, such as street illumination,household and
        industrial applications and electric motors and electric cars...<br>

              Market-Charles Nenner</b></font><br>
          <br>
          <b>By Greg Hunter</b><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        Renowned financial and geopolitical analyst Charles Nenner is
        doubling down on his prediction last year that the financial
        markets will crash in the fall of 2017. Nenner says, “People not
        positioned correctly may lose everything.”&nbsp; Nenner points
        out, “We all know they say the market goes up 8% on a yearly
        basis.&nbsp; That’s based on the fact if I draw a line through
        the markets, it shows 8%.&nbsp; I don’t think anybody realizes
        how much we are above the line.&nbsp; In order to get back to
        8%, we have to go much below the line . . . So, it’s total
        nonsense to say we go up 8% a year when we are already 40% to
        50% above that trend line that averages 8%. This is almost the
        longest bull market in history.”<br>
        <br>
        Now, Nenner has additional research that backs up his position,
        and it involves the number 7. Nenner explains, “You go to my
        research that goes back to the 1800’s, 1900’s and 2000’s.&nbsp;
        Go back a little, and you will see the market topped in
        2017.&nbsp; The next year was 2007, which was clearly a
        high.&nbsp; If you go back to the next year that ends in 7,
        which was 1997, that was clearly a high.&nbsp; 1987 everybody
        knows about that, and I don’t have to go into it.&nbsp; Then go
        to ‘77 and ‘67, ‘57, ‘47 and ‘37.&nbsp; 1929 was a little
        aberration, it should have been ‘27.&nbsp; I still hold because
        it continued up and didn’t come down.&nbsp; That’s why they had
        the huge crash (in 1929) . . . . Based on the past, the future
        repeats.&nbsp; You have major correlation with major tops that
        are in years ending with a 7.&nbsp; If you are a reasonable
        person, you would say this is too much risk for me.&nbsp; If you
        are a super gambler, you say this time is different. . . . My
        cycle tops in September or October of 2017.”...<br>

        <br>
        A few weeks ago, there was a story circulating about a peer
        reviewed study that proved vaccinated children have a 5X higher
        rate of autism than non vaccinated children. I figured that was
        a low amount, and that unvaccinated children would have lower
        rates of autism than even that. No one linked to the study,
        anyone discussing the topic only talked about what the study
        said. I can see why - because the actual study will be difficult
        for most people to make sense of.<br>
        <br>
        Well, today Natural News linked the study. I read through it,
        and to cut to the chase, the most meaningful information is on
        pages 7, 8, and 9...<br>

        <b>Abstract</b><br>
        <br>
        Vaccinations have prevented millions of infectious illnesses,
        hospitalizations and deaths among U.S. children, yet the
        long-term health outcomes of the vaccination schedule remain
        uncertain. Studies have been recommended by the U.S. Institute
        of Medicine to address this question. This study aimed 1) to
        compare vaccinated and unvaccinated children on a broad range of
        health outcomes, and 2) to determine whether an association
        found between vaccination and neurodevelopmental disorders
        (NDD), if any, remained significant after adjustment for other
        measured factors. A cross-sectional study of mothers of children
        educated at home was carried out in collaboration with
        homeschool organizations in four U.S. states: Florida,
        Louisiana, Mississippi and Oregon. Mothers were asked to
        complete an anonymous online questionnaire on their 6- to
        12-year-old biological children with respect to
        pregnancy-related factors, birth history, vaccinations,
        physician-diagnosed illnesses, medications used, and health
        services. NDD, a derived diagnostic measure, was defined as
        having one or more of the following three closely-related
        diagnoses: a learning disability, Attention Deficient
        Hyperactivity Disorder, and Autism Spectrum Disorder. A
        convenience sample of 666 children was obtained, of which 261
        (39%) were unvaccinated. The vaccinated were less likely than
        the unvaccinated to have been diagnosed with chickenpox and
        pertussis, but more likely to have been diagnosed with
        pneumonia, otitis media, allergies and NDD. After adjustment,
        vaccination, male gender, and preterm birth remained
        significantly associated with NDD. However, in a final adjusted
        model with interaction, vaccination but not preterm birth
        remained associated with NDD, while the interaction of preterm
        birth and vaccination was associated with a 6.6-fold increased
        odds of NDD (95% CI: 2.8, 15.5). In conclusion, vaccinated
        homeschool children were found to have a higher rate of
        allergies and NDD than unvaccinated homeschool children. While
        vaccination remained significantly associated with NDD after
        controlling for other factors, preterm birth coupled with
        vaccination was associated with an apparent synergistic increase
        in the odds of NDD. Further research involving larger,
        independent samples and&nbsp; stronger research designs is
        needed to verify and understand these unexpected findings in
        order to optimize the impact of vaccines on children’s health...<br>

        An 11-year-old "cyber ninja" stunned an audience of security
        experts Tuesday by hacking into their bluetooth devices to
        manipulate a teddy bear and show how interconnected smart toys
        "can be weaponized".<br>
        <br>
        American wunderkind Reuben Paul, may be still only in 5th grade
        at his school in Austin, Texas, but he and his teddy bear Bob
        wowed hundreds at a timely cyber security conference in The
        Netherlands.<br>
        <br>
        "From airplanes to automobiles, from smart phones to smart
        homes, anything or any toy can be part of the" Internet of
        Things (IOT)," he said, a small figure pacing the huge stage at
        the World Forum in The Hague.<br>
        <br>
        "From terminators to teddy bears, anything or any toy can be
        weaponised."<br>
        <br>
        To demonstrate, he deployed his cuddly bear, which connects to
        the icloud via wifi and bluetooth smart technology to receive
        and transmit messages.<br>
        <br>
        Plugging into his laptop a rogue device known as a "raspberry
        pi" -- a small credit card size computer&nbsp; -- Reuben scanned
        the hall for available bluetooth devices, and to everyone's
        amazement including his own suddenly downloaded dozens of
        numbers including some of top officials.<br>
        <br>
        Then using a computer language programme, called Python, he
        hacked into his bear via one of the numbers to turn on one of
        its lights and record a message from the audience.<br>
        <br>
        "Most internet-connected things have a blue-tooth functionality
        ... I basically showed how I could connect to it, and send
        commands to it, by recording audio and playing the light," he
        told AFP later.<br>
        <br>
        "IOT home appliances, things that can be used in our everyday
        lives, our cars, lights refrigerators, everything like this that
        is connected can be used and weaponised to spy on us or harm
        us."<br>
        <br>
        They can be used to steal private information such as passwords,
        as remote surveillance to spy on kids, or employ a GPS to find
        out where a person is.<br>
        <br>
        More chillingly, a toy could say "meet me at this location and I
        will pick you up," Reuben said.<br>
        <br>
        His father, information technology expert Mano Paul, told how
        aged about six Reuben had revealed his early IT skills
        correcting him during a business call.<br>
        <br>
        Using a simple explanation from dad on how one smart phone game
        worked, Reuben then figured out it was the same kind of
        algorithm behind the popular video game Angry Birds.<br>
        <br>
        "He has always surprised us. Every moment when we teach him
        something he's usually the one who ends up teaching us," Mano
        Paul told AFP. <br>
        <br>
        But Paul said he been "shocked" by the vulnerabilities
        discovered in kids toys, after Reuben first hacked a toy car,
        before moving onto more complicated things.<br>
        <br>
        "It means that my kids are playing with timebombs, that over
        time somebody who is bad or malicious can exploit."<br>
        <br>
        Now the family has helped Reuben, who is also the youngest
        American to have become a Shaolin Kung Fu black belt, to set up
        his CyberShaolin non-profit organisation.<br>
        <br>
        Its aim is "to inform kids and adults about the dangers of cyber
        insecurity," Reuben said, adding he also wants to press home the
        message that manufacturers, security researchers and the
        government have to work together.<br>
        <br>
        Reuben also has ambitious plans for the future, aiming to study
        cyber security at either CalTech or MIT universities and then
        use his skills for good.<br>
        <br>
        Failing that maybe he could become an Olympian in gymnastics --
        another sport he excels in.<br>

        An ex illuminati member has penned a letter outlining the plans
        the secret society has in store for humanity in the next few
        years.<br>
        <br>
        After spending 47 years as a high-ranking illuminati member, the
        anonymous insider says that he wants to “reveal everything”
        after the burden of keeping it a secret became “too much to
        bear”...<br>
        <br>
        ...Scientists working for the Illuminati have found a way that
        they can “shut” off the sun. A weapon has been created that
        shoot a beam of high density radiation right into the heart of a
        planet or star. This beam of radiation penetrates through the
        planet creating a very large cylinder in the exact middle of it.
        The radiation that is left behind begins to eat at the star or
        planet and the effects spread like wildfire. This technology has
        been tested on various stars in our immediate solar system and
        is very effective. The first thing that occurs to the star is
        that the radiation eats a perfect cylinder through the middle of
        the star, the radiation left behind begins working its way
        outward degenerating anything in its path. The radiation
        continues to build and spread. Some stars hung on until they
        were totally deteriorated from the radiation; however, some
        stars became so unstable that they combusted at a certain point.<br>
        <br>
        Scientists are certain that this technology can be used on the
        sun, but also on other planets. One estimate that I overheard
        was that from the initial shot of radiation, it would take
        approximately nine years for the entire sun to be entirely
        consumed. We would begin seeing the effects of the radiation in
        approximately 3 and a half years however. The first signs would
        be shorter days and a decreased amount of sunlight during those
        days. The sun would start becoming unstable at about the seven
        year point, and we will begin seeing massive solar flares. Once
        the nine years is up, all life on earth will be dead...<br>

        The basic guaranteed income is one of those ideas, like land
        value taxation or the Tobin tax, that circles endlessly around.
        There are times when it’s obscure, and times when it’s being
        talked about again. It’s currently in the ascendant, and I
        suspect that it won’t be long before a country bites the bullet
        and puts a basic national income (BNI) or citizen’s income in
        place.<br>
        <br>
        To illustrate the broad and diverse support for a basic income,
        here are twenty people who have supported it over the ages. Not
        all of them stand for the BNI as currently understood, but their
        ideas have all fed into the debate in one form or another and
        give weight to the arguments for a guaranteed minimum income.<br>
        <br>
        Pericles – let’s start with the old school, and Pericles and
        Ephialtes. They came to power in Athens in 461 BC with plans for
        payments to citizens in return for public duties such as jury
        duty or public service.<br>
        <br>
        Sir Thomas More – coined the word Utopia in 1516 with his
        fictional account of an ideal island. The Utopia he describes
        included a basic income, and nobody ever needed to steal.<br>
        <br>
        Thomas Paine – this revolutionary and founding father of the
        United States argued for grants to young people and the elderly.<br>
        <br>
        Dennis and Mabel Milner – a number of Quaker activists called
        for the BNI. The best known are this husband and wife team who
        were influential in calling for a new settlement after the First
        World War.<br>
        <br>
        Lady Juliet Rhys-Williams – a Liberal Party campaigner and a
        member of the Beveridge Committee, the group that shaped
        Britain’s welfare state in 1942. Had she had won the argument,
        we might have had a basic income instead.<br>
        <br>
        Bertrand Russell – the philosopher and Nobel laureate argued
        that a basic income combined the best of socialism and
        anarchism.<br>
        <br>
        Martin Luther King – argued in his last book that “the solution
        to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed
        measure: the guaranteed income”.<br>
        <br>
        J K Galbraith – “We need to consider the one prompt and
        effective solution for poverty,” argued the economist, “which is
        to provide everyone with a minimum income.”<br>
        <br>
        Milton Friedman – not the same thing as a BNI but similar, the
        American economist and godfather of neoliberalism was an
        advocate of the negative income tax.<br>
        <br>
        Desmond Tutu – South Africa has trialed guaranteed incomes, and
        the social activist and bishop Desmond Tutu has campaigned for
        it.<br>
        <br>
        Margaret Mead – the influential anthropologist and cultural
        commentator believed that a guaranteed income “would provide
        dignity for every citizen and choice for every citizen”.<br>
        <br>
        Richard Nixon – not the only president to consider it, but Nixon
        got closer than most with his Family Assistance Plan, before it
        was killed by Democrats in the Senate.<br>
        <br>
        Marshall McLuhan – in his writing about technology, Marshall
        McLuhan debated the need for a guaranteed income to protect
        people from job losses from automation.<br>
        <br>
        Elon Musk – along similar lines, the pioneering technologist and
        businessman has come to the conclusion that the BNI is the best
        way to deal with robots taking human jobs.<br>
        <br>
        Gary Johnson – while he didn’t campaign on it, the libertarian
        candidate in the 2016 US election has spoken positively about
        the idea as a small government alternative to welfare.<br>
        <br>
        Tim Berners-Lee – “I think a basic income is one of the ways of
        addressing massive global inequality,” says the inventor of the
        internet.<br>
        <br>
        James Hansen – NASA’s leading climate expert suggests putting a
        tax on fossil fuels and distributing it equally as a dividend or
        basic income.<br>
        <br>
        Caroline Lucas – co-leader of the Green Party and Britain’s most
        useful MP, Caroline Lucas has long been a champion of the idea,
        and suggests the basic income “could be the big answer that
        everyone’s looking for”.<br>
        <br>
        Stephen Hawking – the legendary physicist believes that
        technological change and inequality may be best addressed
        through a basic income.<br>
        <br>
        Nicola Sturgeon – under her leadership the Scottish National
        Party has endorsed the BNI. If Scotland were to go independent,
        it may well choose this as part of its own welfare system.<br>

              Basic Income Fairly</b></font><br>

        A universal basic income (UBI) – an idea in which the government
        replaces all other forms of monetary assistance (welfare, social
        security, etc.) with yearly stipend – has enormous potential to
        radically transform our current unsustainable consumer economy
        based on individual ownership into a much more sustainable
        economy based on access if it is designed and funded carefully.
        Implementing a UBI would require a cultural shift in our
        attitudes towards work and money but in a world where money is
        access, the idea of granting everyone enough money to meet their
        basic needs has sound philosophical logic behind it.&nbsp;
        However, all of this potential is highly dependent on the way a
        UBI is funded. A poorly conceived plan may wind up doing far
        more harm to a society already ravaged by class divisions and
        extreme inequality.<br>
        <br>
        Properly conceived, a universal basic income could radically
        transform society.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Popular Criticisms Of A Universal Basic Income</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        The idea around a universal basic income is not a new idea. It
        has backers all across the political and economic spectrum. On
        the right, many people have rightly seen the potential in
        eliminating expensive bureaucratic government agencies and
        processes that exist primarily to determine eligibility for
        assistance programs. If everyone is eligible, the process is
        simplified greatly. On the left, people are recognizing the
        emerging “crisis of capitalism” in which the majority of people
        lose access to their purchasing power as most jobs are replaced
        by automation and robots. However, very few ideas actually
        consider how the UBI should be funded.<br>
        <br>
        The reason why many people are opposed to the idea of a UBI is
        because most plans use income tax as the source of the revenue
        that would fund it. More often than not, earning an income
        requires incredibly hard work and sacrifice and the idea that
        some people might be given the same monetary reward without
        having to work at all seems unfair.&nbsp; We begin to think “why
        should we have to give our lives to a job to earn money while
        others can live without giving anything?” The truth is the
        income tax really amounts to extortion – why should anyone else
        be entitled to the fruits of another’s labor? For this reason,
        funding a UBI through income tax is a terrible idea and will
        never get anywhere.<br>
        <br>
        Taxing one's labor is theft but taxing the use of resources that
        people did not create themselves is not.<br>
        <br>
        <b>We All Deserve Access To The Planet That Gave Birth To Us</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Instead, to fund the UBI in a way that is fair, we need to
        create a new narrative based on a different understanding of the
        principles of private ownership that our economy is founded
        upon. When the Europeans first came to North America, they
        wanted to try to buy the land from the Native Americans. But the
        native tribes couldn’t understand the logic behind owning land.
        “How could anyone own the land?” they thought, “for they did not
        create it.”<br>
        <br>
        The Native Americans saw land as the equivalent of both water
        and air. These are things that can’t belong to people. They
        believed all beings had a right to access these basic resources
        by virtue of the simple fact that they were born on this planet.
        The idea that because you owned land you had the right to
        exclude other people from occupying it was a radical idea to
        them. We need to realize that there are certain things that
        shouldn’t ever be able to be owned – things like air, water, and
        land – if that means giving some people the ability to exclude
        others from meeting their needs.<br>
        <br>
        A properly constructed UBI would be based on the idea that the
        resources that weren’t created by human labor – the land, the
        airwaves, our public spaces, the skies, and even money itself –
        belong to everyone. And therefore, if you want exclusive access
        to any of these resources either to live or to start a business,
        you should have to compensate the rest of humanity for their
        reduced access. These economic “rents” already exist in the form
        of property taxes, licenses, and interest payments. But instead
        of sharing this wealth (that no human being created) with
        everyone, the wealthy elites appropriate it all to themselves.
        This is what must change.<br>
        <br>
        What right does anyone have to own that which they did not
        create?<br>
        <br>
        <b>Giving Everyone A Base Level Of Access</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        The UBI ought to be funded from these “rent” payments. Just how
        much would that be? In the United States, the value of all the
        land (just the land itself, not the buildings or roads which
        were made from human labor) is estimated to be valued at $23
        trillion. A five percent “exclusivity fee” would generate $1.15
        trillion annually. Interest paid on money loaned ought to be
        another public asset. After all, no individual gives money its
        value. The value of money comes from our collective willingness
        to believe that it has value. Nearly $4 trillion was paid in
        collective interest from US households, businesses, governments,
        and non-profits in 2015. Instead of this money flowing to the
        shareholders of private banks, it, too, should form the
        collective pool that the UBI is drawn from. Combining these
        revenue sources into a $5 trillion yearly fund would yield a net
        of $18,000 a year for every adult and $9,000 a year for every
        child in the United States.<br>
        <br>
        To save money, some have proposed means testing the UBI by only
        giving it to those who make below a certain income. This, too,
        is a terrible idea. To avoid the disastrous social implications
        that have been applied to people on government assistance in the
        past, it is critical that the UBI be given to all, even those
        with well-off means. If the&nbsp; wealthy choose to donate their
        UBI allotment to a cause of their choice, that should be their
        decision to make. The UBI is not earned the way additional money
        would be earned by trading one’s labor for it. Instead, the UBI
        should be considered to be every human being’s inheritance from
        the gifts and toils of all previous generations.<br>
        <br>
        Everyone deserves the ability to meet their needs without having
        to be controlled.<br>
        <br>
        <b>It Is Far Cheaper To Feed The World Than It Is To Bomb It</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        But the true economic efficiency resulting from this form of a
        UBI comes much later. Today, enormous amounts of money are spent
        at both the collective and individual levels on various form of
        security.&nbsp; A typical response to the theft of a $30,000 car
        might be to put the thief in jail for 5 years at a total cost of
        $250,000. Wouldn’t it have been cheaper just to ensure that
        everyone had access to a car? The implementation of a UBI would
        likely spawn the creation of an entirely new $5 trillion a year
        “life services” market that would create unprecedented levels of
        access for the average person. In a society in which everyone
        has the ability to meet their basic needs, crime would be
        dramatically reduced. The main cause of crime and international
        conflict is scarcity. When people (and any animal really) can
        meet their needs, they are less likely to harm each other.
        Today, the US spends $39 billion a year on prisons, $350 billion
        a year on security, and $1100 billion a year on military. It
        isn’t hard to imagine that these expenditures could be
        drastically reduced in a world where people no longer had
        conflict over meeting their basic needs.<br>
        <br>
        Intuitively, I think we all know that it is far cheaper to feed
        the world than it is to bomb it. But our stories around private
        property, money, wealth, ownership, and access must evolve
        before we will have access to the tools that can solve the
        economic crises we face today. In our society, money is the fuel
        of creation. The rich know this very well. Given enough money,
        you can pay just about anyone to do just about anything. A
        universal basic income gives everyone the chance to find their
        place in this world. It will be important to educate people that
        the UBI is a gift that is given to them by the previous
        generations of human beings who toiled and sacrificed their
        blood, sweat, tears, and lives while they endured the growing
        pains of industrial civilization. Only by sharing in the fruits
        of our collective success will be able to continue evolving
        human society sustainably far into the future.<br>

        <br>
        With temperatures as cold as -270 °C, space is one hell of a
        heat sink.<br>
        <br>
        Physicists have achieved record levels of temperature reduction
        using the process of radiative cooling, by which heat is beamed
        from Earth’s surface into outer space. Zhen Chen and his
        colleagues at Stanford University lowered the temperature of a
        thermal emitter – a device designed to give out more heat than
        it takes in – to 42.2 °C below that of the surrounding air<br>
        <br>
        “To achieve high-performance cooling, the key is to couple
        whatever object you want to cool with outer space and to
        decouple it from the ambient environment,” says Chen. The
        researchers placed the emitter in a vacuum chamber, isolating it
        from the atmosphere and cutting off almost any heat transfer
        through conduction or convection, which could cause the emitter
        to warm up. Heat from the emitter was radiated out of a
        specially designed window on top of the vacuum chamber, which
        was directed at a clear patch of sky.<br>
        <br>
        Earth’s atmosphere allows thermal radiation of wavelengths
        between 8 and 13 micrometres to pass through it into outer space
        – but most objects release heat at different wavelengths. The
        Stanford emitter, however, was specifically designed so that
        most of the heat it emits falls within that range, meaning that
        on a clear day it will pass straight out into space without
        being bounced back by the atmosphere<br>
        <br>
        Within half an hour of pumping air out of the vacuum chamber,
        the temperature of the emitter plummeted to 40 °C below that of
        the surrounding air. Over the next 24 hours, it averaged 37 °C
        below the air temperature, and reached its biggest reduction of
        42.2 °C when exposed to the peak of the sun’s heat.<br>
        Bigger reduction<br>
        <br>
        Previous attempts at radiative cooling have achieved maximum
        temperature reductions of up to 20 °C, unless they are at high
        altitude and with very low humidity.<br>
        <br>
        Jeremy Munday at the University of Maryland in College Park,
        says the team’s record-breaking results are down to their use of
        vacuum chambers and sun shades, which prevent sunlight from
        directly hitting the emitter. “They’re getting significantly
        below water-freezing temperature during daylight by improving
        their set-up,” he says.<br>
        <br>
        Similar technology could be used to refrigerate food and
        medicine in areas where the ambient temperature is high, or in
        air-conditioning units on top of buildings, says Chen. To scale
        the technology up for these applications, however, they will
        need to find a cheaper alternative to the zinc selenide used in
        the window of the vacuum chamber, a material that is very
        effective at allowing radiation through at the right wavelengths
        to be transferred into space.<br>
        <br>
        For situations in which it is not necessary to achieve such
        dramatic levels of cooling, however, zinc selenide could be
        substituted for less effective materials. “In the real
        application, you don’t need such transparent material – you can
        use cheaper material such as silicon or aluminium,” says Chen.<br>
        <br>
        The researchers have launched a start-up company to explore
        commercial use of the technology, but Chen warns that it won’t
        be able to completely replace existing air-conditioning units
        because overcast skies almost eliminate the effect of radiative
        cooling.<br>

        </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
        <br>
        Radiative cooling technology utilizes the atmospheric
        transparency window (8–13?µm) to passively dissipate heat from
        Earth into outer space (3?K). This technology has attracted
        broad interests from both fundamental sciences and real world
        applications, ranging from passive building cooling, renewable
        energy harvesting and passive refrigeration in arid regions.
        However, the temperature reduction experimentally demonstrated,
        thus far, has been relatively modest. Here we theoretically show
        that ultra-large temperature reduction for as much as 60?°C from
        ambient is achievable by using a selective thermal emitter and
        by eliminating parasitic thermal load, and experimentally
        demonstrate a temperature reduction that far exceeds previous
        works. In a populous area at sea level, we have achieved an
        average temperature reduction of 37?°C from the ambient air
        temperature through a 24-h day–night cycle, with a maximal
        reduction of 42?°C that occurs when the experimental set-up
        enclosing the emitter is exposed to peak solar irradiance.<br>

        There have been numerous whistleblowers to warn of the negative
        effects of smart meters on human health but perhaps none has
        been so successful in scientifically proving this claim as
        Warren Woodward of Sedona, Arizona. He recently put AMI ‘smart’
        meters to the test, and using EKG technology, has proven that
        smart meters throw the human heart off its balanced beat....<br>

          </b><b> Patrick M. Sheridan, et al.</b><br>

        <br>
        Sparse representation of information provides a powerful means
        to perform feature extraction on high-dimensional data and is of
        broad interest for applications in signal processing, computer
        vision, object recognition and neurobiology. Sparse coding is
        also believed to be a key mechanism by which biological neural
        systems can efﬁciently process a large amount of complex sensory
        data while consuming very little power. Here, we report the
        experimental implementation of sparse coding algorithms in a
        bio-inspired approach using a 32 × 32 crossbar array of analog
        memristors. This network enables efﬁcient implementation of
        pattern matching and lateral neuron inhibition and allows input
        data to be sparsely encoded using neuron activities and stored
        dictionary elements. Different dictionary sets can be trained
        and stored in the same system, depending on the nature of the
        input signals. Using the sparse coding algorithm, we also
        perform natural image processing based on a learned dictionary.<br>

        </b><b> What is FreeShield and How Does it Work? </b><br>
        <br>
        FreeShield is the smallest product in a line of several amazing
        technologies. FreeShield uses advanced geometry and frequency
        equations to generate a full-spectrum vibration. <br>
        <br>
        This full-spectrum vibration helps harmonize and cancel out the
        harmful effects of disrup-<br>
        tive vibrations, such as those emitted by cell phones. <br>
        <br>
        Thorough mathematical research has proven that not only do
        different colors have different frequencies, but the same is
        true of angles. So by using a diverse combination of colors and
        angles, a very broad frequency range is achieved. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Is it Advanced... or Sacred Geometry? </b><b><br>
        </b><b> </b><br>
        FreeShield was developed through research into the unknown field
        of sacred geometry.<br>
        If the word “sacred” distresses you in any way, feel free to
        refer to it as advanced geometry—as FreeShield certainly is an
        advanced technology. <br>
        <br>
        You may have first heard of sacred geometry when it was featured
        on the hit MTV program, “Rob &amp; Big.” Pro skateboarder and
        host Rob Dyrdek liked sacred geometry so much that an entire
        episode was dedicated to what he popularized as “Sacred G.”
        Click here to watch <br>
        this episode. <br>
        <br>
        Although sacred geometry may strike you as unusual, you actually
        see it every day. Sacred geometry is found in many religious
        icons, the symbols of Freemasonryand ancient civilizations, and
        the works of the legendary Leonardo Da Vinci... <br>
        <br>
        <b>How Does FreeShield Work If I Can’t See It?</b><br>
        <br>
        One thing you might find curious is how FreeShield technology
        works even when hidden behind your cell phone battery cover,
        case or skin. To answer that question, we must realize that what
        the human can eye see is a very small fraction of the total
        light spectrum. <br>
        <br>
        A good analogy to consider is that of a high-pitched canine
        whistle that dogs can hear clearly, but we cannot. Similarly,
        although you may have placed FreeShield out of sight, it’s
        really only dark in terms of our perception. The vast majority
        of the total light spectrum is still interacting with FreeShield

        </div>
        <br>
        Autism. A very terrible problem. But this is a rather happy
        book. It was written in response to the debut of Ido Kedar’s
        book -- which I consider a historic event in the annals of
        science. He named his book "Ido in Autismland." Written at age
        16, if you please.<br>
        <br>
        My book, “A Balm in Gilead,” outlines the many cures and
        treatments for autism, yes, ones that have actually worked. But
        it also canvasses the possibility of using cures related to
        other illnesses such as Parkinson’s and multiple sclerosis.
        Quite a few surprises here.<br>
        <br>
        There is also a new theory, proposed by none other than Yours
        Truly, that autism is caused by a lentivrus. If you wish to see
        me put my case, go to Youtube here.<br>
        <br>
        Or why not just download the book for free right now?<br>

        <div align="center"><b>Scientists Reveal Ramen Noodles Cause
            Heart Disease, Stroke &amp; Metabolic Syndrome</b><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        The dangers of ramen noodles are self-evident to most, however
        there will always be those who will deny the dangers of
        consuming them. After all, it’s a staple food for college kids
        so how bad could it be? It can’t kill you right? New research
        from Baylor University and Harvard says it can. The noodles
        increase people’s risk of metabolic changes linked to heart
        disease and stroke, researchers found. Ramen noodles contain
        Tertiary-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ), which is a byproduct of the
        petroleum industry and food additive frequently to preserve
        cheap processed foods. A gastrointestinal specialist conducted
        an experiment with a time lapse video inside the stomach to what
        would happen after two hours of digesting ramen noodles and the
        results were staggering.<br>
        <br>
        In the most recent study in the Journal of Nutrition, women in
        South Korea who consumed more of the precooked blocks of dried
        noodles were more likely to have “metabolic syndrome” regardless
        of what else they ate, or how much they exercised, the
        researchers found. People with metabolic syndrome may have high
        blood pressure or high blood sugar levels, and face an increased
        risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. The dried noodle
        block was originally created by flash frying cooked noodles, and
        this is still the main method used in Asian countries, though
        air-dried noodle blocks are favoured in Western countries. The
        main ingredients of the dried noodle are wheat flour, palm oil,
        and salt. Common ingredients of the flavouring powder are salt,
        monosodium glutamate, seasoning, and sugar. A typical cup-type
        instant noodles contain 2700 mg of sodium.<br>
        <br>
        “Although instant noodle is a convenient and delicious food,
        there could be an increased risk for metabolic syndrome given
        [the food’s] high sodium, unhealthy saturated fat and glycemic
        loads,” said study co-author Hyun Shin, a doctoral candidate at
        the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston. Shin and his
        colleagues at Baylor University and Harvard analyzed the health
        and diet of nearly 11,000 adults in South Korea between ages 19
        to 64. The participants reported what they ate, and the
        researchers categorized each participant’s diet as centered on
        either traditional healthy food or fast food, as well as how
        many times weekly they ate instant noodles.<br>
        <br>
        The study focused on individuals in South Korea, Shin said, as
        the country has the highest per-capita number of instant noodle
        consumers in the world, and because, in recent years, health
        problems there, including heart disease and obesity, have been
        on the rise. But the findings appear to be quite relevant to
        consumers stateside too, as the United States ranked sixth
        globally in instant noodle sales, according to the World Instant
        Noodles Association, which found that the United States
        accounted for 4,300 billion units sold in 2013 (coming in just
        behind China, Indonesia, Japan, Vietnam, and India — and one
        spot above South Korea, in fact).<br>
        <br>
        Women who ate instant noodles twice a week or more had a higher
        risk of metabolic syndrome than those who ate ramen less, or not
        at all, regardless of whether their diet style fell into the
        traditional or fast-food category. The researchers found the
        association even among young women who were leaner and reported
        doing more physical activity.<br>
        <br>
        As for men, Shin and his colleagues guessed that biological
        differences between the genders, like the effect of sex hormones
        and metabolism, might account for the lack of an apparent
        association among males between eating instant noodles and
        developing metabolic syndrome. The study was conducted in South
        Korea, an area known to have the largest ramen consumption group
        in the world, where people consumed 3.4 billion packages of
        instant noodles in 2010. <br>

            GMO Detection Device</b><b><br>
          </b><b> </b><b><br>
          </b><b> By Pao Chang</b><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are becoming a big
        problem, because every year more GMOs are being created and sold
        on the public market without proper testing of how they affect
        the environment and the human body. As the published date (April
        6, 2017) of this article, there are no effective laws that
        require GMOs to be labelled in the USA. Fortunately, many other
        countries throughout the world have GMO labeling laws.<br>
        <br>
        The problem with GMOs is that they do not harmonize well with
        the energy and genes of our bodies. Scientific studies have
        linked GMOs to serious health problems, such as infertility,
        birth defects, immune disorders, growth and digestive problems,
        and premature aging. The health hazards of GMOs are becoming
        mainstream, causing one of the outlets of the mainstream media
        to admit that GMOs are health hazards.<br>
        <br>
        Because GMOs are health hazards and most of them are not
        labelled properly, we need to find alternative ways to detect
        GMOs. One alternative way is to use a GMO detection device.<br>
        <br>
        Here is an excerpt from LancasterOnline.com about a GMO
        detection device created by Gaurav Mittal, a 14 year old
        freshman at Manheim Township High School:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "While his classmates were playing video
        games or scrolling through Facebook, as many teenagers tend to
        do, Gaurav Mittal was creating a homemade polymerase chain
        reaction thermal cycler.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is, a device used to detect whether a
        food is genetically modified.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The 14-year-old’s invention earned him the
        honor of grand champion at the annual North Museum Science &amp;
        Engineering Fair, held Wednesday at Spooky Nook Sports."<br>
        <br>
        “I’m pretty proud,” Gaurav, a freshman at Manheim Township High
        School, said. “The fact that I can come this far and actually
        achieve a really big thing with this, it makes me happy.”<br>
        <br>
        Gaurav said he worked up to 20 hours a week since December
        trying to perfect the thermal cycler.<br>
        <br>
        In the end, the device, which uses varying temperatures to
        replicate and amplify a plant’s DNA in order to tell whether it
        is genetically modified, didn’t work as well as Gaurav hoped.<br>

        potent than VRC01, an antibody in the same class, which has

        ... Holl's method differs from the others in few significant
        ways.<br>
        <br>
        First, it uses two antennas: one fixed in place and another that
        moves. The fixed antenna records a Wi-Fi field's background, or
        reference, for the spot it's placed in. The other antenna is
        moved by hand to record the same Wi-Fi field from many different
        points.<br>
        <br>
        "These antennas don't need to be big. They can be very small,
        like the ones in a smartphone," Holl says.<br>
        <br>
        Second, both antennas record not only the intensity (or
        brightness) of a Wi-Fi signal, but also its phase: a property of
        light that comes from the fact it's a wave. Laser light is all
        one phase, for example (which makes it an excellent method to
        create holograms), while an incandescent bulb puts out a mix of
        different phases of light. Similar to lasers, Wi-Fi routers emit
        microwave radiation in discrete frequencies and phases.<br>
        <br>
        Finally, the signals from both antennas are simultaneously fed
        into a computer, and software teases out the differences of
        intensity and phase "more or less in real-time," Holl says.<br>
        <br>
        This is where the magic happens: The software builds many 2D
        images as one antenna is waved around and then stacks them
        together in a 3D hologram. And because Wi-Fi travels through
        most walls, those holograms are of objects inside a room... <br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Scientists at Johns Hopkins Medical School
        have identified a mysterious virus that literally makes people
        stupid, and it has so far been found in about 45% of the people
        tested.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The discovery of the “stupid” virus, normally
        found in algae, was revealed at the Proceedings of the National
        Academy of Sciences. The study, entitled “Chlorovirus ATCV-1 is
        part of the human oropharyngeal virome and is associated with
        changes in cognitive functions in humans and mice” is found at
        this link on the PNAS.org website.<br>

        <br>
        The rather shocking take away from the study is that the virus
        alters the gene expression of brain cells, literally making
        people perform more poorly on cognitive tests, visual processing
        and spatial awareness.<br>
        <br>
        So far, 90 people have been tested for the presence of the
        virus, and 40 tested positive, according to The Independent. [2]
        “Those who tested positive performed worse on tests designed to
        measure the speed and accuracy of visual processing. They also
        achieved lower scores in tasks designed to measure attention,”
        reports the paper.<br>
        <br>
        According to the study abstract, the virus alters gene
        expression relating to “…synaptic plasticity, learning, memory
        formation, and the immune response to viral exposure.”<br>
        <br>
        This virus, in other words, can truly suppress your brain
        function, memories and immune response. And it is apparently
        quite common in humans…”<br>

        A virus that infects human brains and makes us more stupid has
        been discovered, according to scientists in the US.<br>
        <br>
        The algae virus, never before observed in healthy people, was
        found to affect cognitive functions including visual processing
        and spatial awareness. <br>
        <br>
        Scientists at Johns Hopkins Medical School and the University of
        Nebraska stumbled upon the discovery when they were undertaking
        an unrelated study into throat microbes.<br>
        <br>
        Surprisingly, the researchers found DNA in the throats of
        healthy individuals that matched the DNA of a virus known to
        infect green algae.<br>
        <br>
        Dr Robert Yolken, a virologist who led the original study, said:
        “This is a striking example showing that the ‘innocuous’
        microorganisms we carry can affect behaviour and cognition.<br>
        <br>
        “Many physiological differences between person A and person B
        are encoded in the set of genes each inherits from parents, yet
        some of these differences are fuelled by the various
        microorganisms we harbour and the way they interact with our
        genes.”<br>

        <br>
        Human mucosal surfaces contain a wide range of microorganisms.
        The biological effects of these organisms are largely unknown.
        Large-scale metagenomic sequencing is emerging as a method to
        identify novel microbes. Unexpectedly, we identified DNA
        sequences homologous to virus ATCV-1, an algal virus not
        previously known to infect humans, in oropharyngeal samples
        obtained from healthy adults. The presence of ATCV-1 was
        associated with a modest but measurable decrease in cognitive
        functioning. A relationship between ATCV-1 and cognitive
        functioning was confirmed in a mouse model, which also indicated
        that exposure to ATCV-1 resulted in changes in gene expression
        within the brain. Our study indicates that viruses in the
        environment not thought to infect humans can have biological
        effects.<br>
        Abstract<br>
        <br>
        Chloroviruses (family Phycodnaviridae) are large DNA viruses
        known to infect certain eukaryotic green algae and have not been
        previously shown to infect humans or to be part of the human
        virome. We unexpectedly found sequences homologous to the
        chlorovirus Acanthocystis turfacea chlorella virus 1 (ATCV-1) in
        a metagenomic analysis of DNA extracted from human oropharyngeal
        samples. These samples were obtained by throat swabs of adults
        without a psychiatric disorder or serious physical illness who
        were participating in a study that included measures of
        cognitive functioning. The presence of ATCV-1 DNA was confirmed
        by quantitative PCR with ATCV-1 DNA being documented in
        oropharyngeal samples obtained from 40 (43.5%) of 92
        individuals. The presence of ATCV-1 DNA was not associated with
        demographic variables but was associated with a modest but
        statistically significant decrease in the performance on
        cognitive assessments of visual processing and visual motor
        speed. We further explored the effects of ATCV-1 in a mouse
        model. The inoculation of ATCV-1 into the intestinal tract of
        9–11-wk-old mice resulted in a subsequent decrease in
        performance in several cognitive domains, including ones
        involving recognition memory and sensory-motor gating. ATCV-1
        exposure in mice also resulted in the altered expression of
        genes within the hippocampus. These genes comprised pathways
        related to synaptic plasticity, learning, memory formation, and
        the immune response to viral exposure.<br>

        Digital computational circuit comprising a network made of a
        plurality of identical repetitive DNA-based conductive elements.
        The DNA-based elements used for the purposes of the invention
        employ a P-bridge as a tunnel junction for a net charge. The
        DNA-based element of which the circuit is made may be a DNA SET
        transistor. The circuit may comprise a DNA resistor built from a
        plurality of SET transistor elements a series, with a constant
        over-threshold gate voltage. The circuit may further comprise
        NOT and NOR gates. The NOT gate can be made of a DNA-based
        transistor and a resistor, and the resistor can be made by using
        a DNA SET transistor with a constant over-threshold gate
        voltage, and by placing a plurality of such DNA SET transistors
        in series until the resistivity reaches the desired value. The
        NOR gate, on the other hand, can be built from two NOT elements
        wherein the output of the first NOT element is connected to the
        resistor of the second NOT element as it voltage supply.<br>

        It’s almost impossible to think about the promises and
        shortcomings of the United States and not think in terms of the
        ‘American Dream’. US advertisers promote its seductions of
        individual freedom and material comfort, while school teachers
        use it to impart civic values. Even in the rough and tumble
        world of US Realpolitik there is a special place for the
        ‘American dream’. It’s what helped to inspire Martin Luther King
        Jr’s ‘I Have a Dream’ speech in 1963, animated Barack Obama’s
        memoir Dreams from My Father (1995), and gave the title to the
        2001 ‘Dream Act’ on immigration reform... <br>
        ...<br>
        No doubt, the prospect of an individual’s imagination as a
        preserve of freedom emboldened Scholl and Seeger. They believed
        that in safeguarding the boundaries of their innermost thoughts
        they were defying political domination. It is a very appealing
        notion. But is it accurate?<br>
        <br>
        In a totalitarian society, even sleep wasn’t a safe space for
        the private self.<br>
        <br>
        Charlotte Beradt’s The Third Reich of Dreams (1966) suggests
        that the verdict is ‘nein’. One of the most important modern
        collections of dreams from an oppressive political society,
        Beradt’s study reluctantly disproves the claim of a Nazi
        authority who maintained that ‘the only person in Germany who
        still leads a private life is the person who sleeps’. Beradt
        came to the idea of recording others’ dreams as a result of her
        own nightmares. Immediately after Hitler seized power in 1933,
        Beradt, a Jewish journalist living in Berlin, spent night after
        night being ‘hunted from pillar to post – shot at, tortured,
        scalped’ in her dreams. It occurred to her that she couldn’t
        possibly be the only one suffering through her sleep. So she set
        out to document as many dreams as she could of those who
        similarly faced oppression and possible persecution – namely
        Jews and critics of the regime – with the belief that ‘they
        might one day serve as evidence’ about ‘people’s deepest
        feelings and reactions as they became part of the mechanism of
        totalitarianism’...<br>

        How Bioenergy is measured in the body is done by means of a
        photomultiplier tube instrument that monitors a person’s
        bioenergy at the biophoton level. Sifu Cicero, an Instructor for
        the School of Chi Energy, who practices a nerve fiber building
        energy exercise that builds up her body’s nerve fiber system to
        release high levels of biophotons, did undergo this type of
        measurement.&nbsp; She was invited by the Rhine Center to have
        her level of biophoton emissions measured.&nbsp; Sifu Cicero was
        able to have her bio electromagnetic energy [chi] measured via a
        well-documented and innovative technique.<br>
        <br>
        Below you’ll watch a video of this experiment that shows Sifu
        Cicero undergoing this biophoton test as researchers at the
        Rhine Research Center, associated with Duke University, measured
        her electromagnetic output with a biophoton measuring machine.
        The Rhine Center uses “a multiphasic ultra-violet light detector
        which is designed to measure individual photons produced per
        half second, Rhine researchers were able to measure dramatic
        increases in the number of photons in the light-proof room when
        certain people were meditating, performing healings, or claiming
        to manipulate Chi.”<br>
        <br>
        The equipment used to measure bio-emissions are several special
        devices. The thermoelectric cooler is used to cool the
        photomultiplier tube to a negative 26 degrees centigrade.&nbsp;
        This is done to reduce interference from the electrical
        devices.. The baseline is taken for each individual before they
        begin their healing, meditation, or energy work.&nbsp; The
        photomultiplier tube actually measures the increase in photon
        emissions from the baseline for the individual being tested.
        Then it is the photomultiplier tube that measures biophotons.
        When one photon of light strikes this sensitive surface it
        dislodges several other electrons. The dislodged electrons
        accelerate striking many more electrons that cause a change
        reaction event...<br>
        <br>
        <b>Bio-Emissions Lab Experiment &amp; The Chi Energy Cultivation
          Method</b><br>
        <br>
        Sifu Cicero had the unique opportunity to have her bio
        electromagnetic energy (bioenergy) measured by the scientists at
        the Rhine Research Center. Sifu Cicero provided us with a video
        of the experiment as well as a first person account of her
        experience. Learn more about biophotons and energy healing: The
        School of Chi Energy Head Instructor Sifu Jones and Sifu Brown
        put together an mp3 that explains what biophotons or&nbsp;
        bioenergy is all about.&nbsp; You can listen online or download
        the mp3 for your convenience...<br>
        <br>
        Using very sensitive equipment in a controlled environment,
        including a photo multiplier tube and an EMI Shielded Room, the
        scientists at the Rhine Research Center counted the numbers of
        biophotons emitted by Sifu Cicero as well as their
        wavelength/frequency.<br>
        <br>
        As per the “Bio-emissions Lab Experiment” video and Sifu
        Cicero’s first person account, the scientists performing the
        experiment were markedly impressed with Sifu Cicero’s ability to
        raise, lower, and raise again her energy projections. In fact,
        Sifu Cicero is now the fifth person in 30 years with over
        thousands of men and women performing this experiment, to reach
        the energy levels of the Ultraviolet frequencies.<br>
        <br>
        Looking back to Figure 2, it is clear why the scientists were so
        very impressed. The Ultraviolet frequency/wavelength is not only
        very high in energy, but also incredibly hot. Sifu Cicero’s
        ability to raise her energy, at will, on demand and on command,
        to such a high level is impressive in and of itself. What raises
        the bar, is that at the same time, Sifu Cicero was able keep
        herself physically cool while projecting her energy within the
        Ultraviolet range; mindboggling indeed. Of course, students
        of&nbsp; the School Chi Energy engage in a methodology and
        curriculum architected in such a way that Sifu Cicero’s results
        are the norm, not the exception...<br>

            With temperatures as cold as -270 °C, space is one hell of a
            heat sink.<br>
            <br>
            Physicists have achieved record levels of temperature
            reduction using the process of radiative cooling, by which
            heat is beamed from Earth’s surface into outer space. Zhen
            Chen and his colleagues at Stanford University lowered the
            temperature of a thermal emitter – a device designed to give
            out more heat than it takes in – to 42.2 °C below that of
            the surrounding air<br>

            whatever object you want to cool with outer space and to
            decouple it from the ambient environment,” says Chen. The
            researchers placed the emitter in a vacuum chamber,
            isolating it from the atmosphere and cutting off almost any
            heat transfer through conduction or convection, which could
            cause the emitter to warm up. Heat from the emitter was
            radiated out of a specially designed window on top of the
            vacuum chamber, which was directed at a clear patch of sky.<br>
            <br>
            Earth’s atmosphere allows thermal radiation of wavelengths
            between 8 and 13 micrometres to pass through it into outer
            space – but most objects release heat at different
            wavelengths. The Stanford emitter, however, was specifically
            designed so that most of the heat it emits falls within that
            range, meaning that on a clear day it will pass straight out
            into space without being bounced back by the atmosphere<br>
            <br>
            Within half an hour of pumping air out of the vacuum
            chamber, the temperature of the emitter plummeted to 40 °C
            below that of the surrounding air. Over the next 24 hours,
            it averaged 37 °C below the air temperature, and reached its
            biggest reduction of 42.2 °C when exposed to the peak of the
            sun’s heat.<b><br>

              Bigger reduction<br>
              <br>
            </b>Previous attempts at radiative cooling have achieved
            maximum temperature reductions of up to 20 °C, unless they
            are at high altitude and with very low humidity.<br>
            <br>
            Jeremy Munday at the University of Maryland in College Park,
            says the team’s record-breaking results are down to their
            use of vacuum chambers and sun shades, which prevent
            sunlight from directly hitting the emitter. “They’re getting
            significantly below water-freezing temperature during
            daylight by improving their set-up,” he says.<br>
            <br>
            Similar technology could be used to refrigerate food and
            medicine in areas where the ambient temperature is high, or
            in air-conditioning units on top of buildings, says Chen. To
            scale the technology up for these applications, however,
            they will need to find a cheaper alternative to the zinc
            selenide used in the window of the vacuum chamber, a
            material that is very effective at allowing radiation
            through at the right wavelengths to be transferred into
            space.<br>
            <br>
            For situations in which it is not necessary to achieve such
            dramatic levels of cooling, however, zinc selenide could be
            substituted for less effective materials. “In the real
            application, you don’t need such transparent material – you
            can use cheaper material such as silicon or aluminium,” says
            Chen.<br>
            <br>
            The researchers have launched a start-up company to explore
            commercial use of the technology, but Chen warns that it
            won’t be able to completely replace existing
            air-conditioning units because overcast skies almost
            eliminate the effect of radiative cooling.<br>

              Abstract<br>
              <br>
            </b>Radiative cooling technology utilizes the atmospheric
            transparency window (8–13 μm) to passively dissipate heat
            from Earth into outer space (3 K). This technology has
            attracted broad interests from both fundamental sciences and
            real world applications, ranging from passive building
            cooling, renewable energy harvesting and passive
            refrigeration in arid regions. However, the temperature
            reduction experimentally demonstrated, thus far, has been
            relatively modest. Here we theoretically show that
            ultra-large temperature reduction for as much as 60 °C from
            ambient is achievable by using a selective thermal emitter
            and by eliminating parasitic thermal load, and
            experimentally demonstrate a temperature reduction that far
            exceeds previous works. In a populous area at sea level, we
            have achieved an average temperature reduction of 37 °C from
            the ambient air temperature through a 24-h day–night cycle,
            with a maximal reduction of 42 °C that occurs when the
            experimental set-up enclosing the emitter is exposed to peak
            solar irradiance.<b><br>

            There have been numerous whistleblowers to warn of the
            negative effects of smart meters on human health but perhaps
            none has been so successful in scientifically proving this
            claim as Warren Woodward of Sedona, Arizona. He recently put
            AMI ‘smart’ meters to the test, and using EKG technology,
            has proven that smart meters throw the human heart off its
            balanced beat....<br>
