          <div align="center"><b>The Gospel According To Q</b><br>
            <b>by Augen Guy</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>As readers have surmised, I am intrigued if not alarmed by
          the Q phenomenon, which I believe to be a classic, though
          highly sophisticated psy-op.&nbsp; My two previous articles
          appear here and here...<br>
          <br>
          In my view, Q is clearly "designed".&nbsp; It is not an
          organic outcropping of the culture, but something specifically
          manufactured to draw in as many people as possible.&nbsp; It
          is most certainly a psy-op - all the elements are there.&nbsp;
          Whether it is benign or not is a matter of argument,
          speculation and conjecture at this point; however, I would
          argue that anything which manipulates people's thinking
          without expressly stating that it is doing so is NOT benign.<br>
          <br>
          To this author's mind, the underlying assumption of Q is that
          government is a necessary thing, though it can be bent to Good
          or Evil.&nbsp; For this reason, I find the whole thing
          suspicious, since I place no trust in government of any kind
          for any reason.&nbsp; Any socio-cultural movement that has
          only two possible sides is a product of the Hegelian
          Dialectic, and artificially limits the conversation to a
          choice where the author of the dialectic is the only winner.<br>
          <br>
          In the end, the Q phenomenon is clearly what it appears to be
          - a new type of religious-style movement designed to
          placate/passify the masses and prevent a mass uprising while
          the factions of the Deep State hash out their
          differences.&nbsp; In other words, the Ruling Paradigm must be
          preserved and enforced, even as the Rulers figure out who will
          take the reins/reigns for the foreseeable future.<br>
          <br>
          Though Q clearly labels certain elements as "White Hats," and
          others as "Black Hats," it is a value judgement that
          ultimately rests on the spectator's ability to reason
          critically.&nbsp; I personally make no distinction between the
          two sides, as they are both defending the same paradigm.<br>
          <br>
          I personally opt for a third alternative that is notably
          abscent from this operation - that of self-government and
          individual responsibility.&nbsp; In the interest of full
          disclosure, my viewpoint is not a popular one, but it allows
          me a certain dispassion when analyzing things like Q.<br>
          <br>
          " That said, it does not ameliorate my
          suspicions, nor diffuse my curiosity and interest in watching
          this drama unfold.&nbsp; The sophistication of the design and
          the effectiveness of its dissemination in just the last nine
          months is a marvel of modern marketing.&nbsp; From a purely
          professional standpoint, I admire the marketing design and the
          fervor with which a great number of people have taken it
          up.&nbsp; If only Leni Riefenstahl were alive to see this, she
          would be green with envy.<br>
          <br>
          Edward Bernays would be so proud of the creature he unleashed
          on an unsuspecting world. <b><br>

          <div align="center"><b>If you think the tech giants merely
              want to ban Infowars, think again: Here’s the list of what
              they’ll ban next</b><br>
            <b>by Mike Adams</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>The left-wing media has become a dangerous lynch mob,
          desperately calling for Infowars to be completely
          “deplatformed” (blacklisted) from all prominent online
          platforms.<br>
          <br>
          The calls for such drastic censorship action against Infowars
          censor around an array of utterly false accusations which
          fraudulently assert that Alex Jones claimed no children died
          in the Parkland shootings — a claim that is utterly false and
          fraudulent. Jones never uttered any such thing, and no one has
          produced a single video clip of him making such an assertion.<br>
          <br>
          Regardless of your opinion of Alex Jones and Infowars, what’s
          at stake for all of us is far greater than one man and one
          network. Our very right to express any dissenting view is now
          being threatened. Infowars is simple the precedent, you see:
          If they succeed in blacklisting Infowars, then Natural News
          and hundreds of other independent media publishers are next.<br>
          <br>
          If the tech giants are not reeled in with aggressive
          legislative, regulatory or law enforcement action, you will
          soon be blocked from expressing any online opinion whatsoever
          about the following topics:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vaccine safety / vaccine ingredients /
          vaccine side effects<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discussion of the health benefits of CBD
          oil or cannabis medicine<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Criticisms of Democrats or the liberal
          media<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Medication side effects and dangers of
          psychiatric drugs<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-reliance and prepping instruction /
          survival videos<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natural cures and herbal remedies<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Political discussions that aren’t
          “approved” by the authoritarian Left<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investigations into censorship itself<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pro-liberty discussions of history /
          America / the Constitution / Bill of Rights<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any criticism of transgenderism or the LGBT
          agenda<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protecting national borders / border
          security<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-defense via firearms / Second
          Amendment<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opposing abortion / protecting the lives of
          unborn babies<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Home schooling<br>
          <b><br>
          </b>This is only a partial list, obviously, as there are a
          great many other topics that will also be banned from all the
          dominant online platforms.<br>
          If we don’t demand an end to the tech giants’ outrageous
          censorship, we will soon wake up and find ourselves living in
          a world where only a single “official” opinion is allowed to
          be expressed on any given topic. Even worse, that opinion will
          be decided by a deranged left-wing activist group with no
          loyalty to reality.<br>
          <br>
          So, what can we do to fight back against the aggressive,
          destructive censorship being carried out by tech giants?<br>
          <br>
          From my report “The Censorship Master Plan Decoded,” available
          at this link (PDF), here’s a list of 13 potential solutions
          that need to be urgently explored by lawmakers, regulators and
          President Trump:<b><br>

          </b>The internet, and the astounding degree of personal

          But at the same time, it makes me nostalgic for the days when

          We live in an era now where the shitty thoughts of the great
          and powerful are broadcast out to the world on a whim, instead
          of being delivered, with equal parts vitriol and airborne
          spittle, to some spirit-dead assistant. If you doubt this,
          just look at what went down with Elon Musk this weekend.<br>

              Installed Remote-Access Software on Systems Sold to States</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Remote-access software and modems on election equipment 'is
          the worst decision for security short of leaving ballot boxes
          on a Moscow street corner.'<br>
          <br>
          The nation's top voting machine maker has admitted in a letter
          to a federal lawmaker that the company installed remote-access
          software on election-management systems it sold over a period
          of six years, raising questions about the security of those
          systems and the integrity of elections that were conducted
          with them.<br>
          <br>
          In a letter sent to Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) in April and
          obtained recently by Motherboard, Election Systems and
          Software acknowledged that it had "provided pcAnywhere remote
          connection software … to a small number of customers between
          2000 and 2006," which was installed on the election-management
          system ES&amp;S sold them.<br>
          <br>
          The statement contradicts what the company told me and fact
          checkers for a story I wrote for the New York Times in
          February. At that time, a spokesperson said ES&amp;S had never
          installed pcAnywhere on any election system it sold. "None of
          the employees, … including long-tenured employees, has any
          knowledge that our voting systems have ever been sold with
          remote-access software," the spokesperson said.<br>
          <br>
          ES&amp;S did not respond on Monday to questions from
          Motherboard, and it’s not clear why the company changed its
          response between February and April. Lawmakers, however, have
          subpoena powers that can compel a company to hand over
          documents or provide sworn testimony on a matter lawmakers are
          investigating, and a statement made to lawmakers that is later
          proven false can have greater consequence for a company than
          one made to reporters....<br>

            Analysis of R. M. Santilli Article <br>
            <br>
            1. The Ruggero and Carla Santilli lawsuit against Frank
            Israel and Pepijn van Erp<br>
          </b>I am a physicist interested in the research by Prof.
          Ruggero Maria Santilli (see Biographical Notes, Full
          Curriculum, Outline of Works, and Scientific Awards and
          Nominations) because they are the only really new vistas
          around. I cannot publish papers in the field to prevent my
          academic job being slashed, as it was the case for other
          dissident scientists. According to the Ruggero and Carla
          Santilli Lawsuit in U. S. Federal Court against Frank Israel
          and Pepijin van Erp, and according to comments circulating in
          the academic community, the Santilli's filed the lawsuit
          because of their conviction that the unprovoked attacks they
          suffered for years from Frank Israel and Pepijn van Erp had
          been commissioned by Wikipedia's Editors and their Google
          associates in support of the disqualification of research in
          the Wikipedia Article on R. M. Santilli. I must confess that,
          at first, I was quite skeptic about such a view since
          Wikipedia and Google appear at first sight to be run very
          professionally. However, the more I analyzed the Article,
          investigated the case, and studied Santilli's works, I had to
          change my mind. The findings of my analysis are outlined below
          for whatever their value.<br>
          <b><br>
            2. Heading<br>
          </b>As it is well known, the indicated Wikipedia Article
          begins by calling Santilli's studies as being "fringe" science
          following the profile by C. Weimar [1] (references in square
          brackets are those in the Article), and this dubbing has been
          stubbornly maintained by the Editors since 2007, despite
          corrections attempted by numerous physicists including myself
          (anybody doubting this should try to remove the "fringe"
          dubbing in said Article). Why calling "fringe" research that
          has been the motivation for important awards, including Prof.
          Santilli being KNIGHTED twice by different countries, the only
          scientist I know with a "double title of Sir" (Scientific
          Awards and Nominations)? I became curious. Weimar called
          Santilli for an "interview" which he granted under the
          condition that the interview would deal with his magnegas
          technology (www.magnegas.com) since, at that time (2007) he
          was collaborating with associates in Israel to see whether
          said technology could assist in the Israel Country achieving
          fuel independence (a task worth pursuing nowadays for the
          stability of the Middle East). By contrast, Weimar never
          mentioned the magnegas technology during "interview" [1] which
          resulted to be a hostile "profile" according to the website
          Anti-America and anti-Israel conduct by C. Weimar, as well as
          according to letters of complaint published by the St.
          Petersburg Times (where profile [1] had been published).
          Weimar's unprovoked hostility made me more curious,
          particularly in view of the known allegiance of Wikipedia's
          Editors, as well as Weimar's herself, to the Country of
          Israel. I had to know its motivation.<b><br>
            <br>
            3. Magnecule "theory" (the emphasis on theory is mine)<br>
          </b>The sole references quoted at first mentioning "magnegas
          and magnehydrogen" are commercial websites, such as Refs.
          [8][9][10]. Later on, there is the citation of one scientific
          paper, Ref. [15], which, however, is not published in a
          refereed journal. By comparison, the widely known scientific
          reference of the new chemical species of magnecules is
          Santilli's 2001 post, Ph. D. monograph Foundations of Hadronic
          Chemistry, which is listed in the section of Scientific
          Publications but it's content is not reviewed. Also missing
          are independent contributions in the field, such as the review
          Foundation of Chemistry, DOI 10.1007/s10698-015-9218-z (March
          24, 2015) and the experimental verifications The Open Physical
          Chemistry Journal Vol. 5, 1-16 (2013). The evident disparity
          between the sole quotation of commercial websites versus post
          Ph. D. refereed theoretical and experimental publications
          indicates a very skillful intent by the Wikipedia Editors to
          portray the impression of reporting the information, while
          pre-conditioning non-expert readers on an alleged fake
          character of Santilli's magnecule "theory." Perhaps more
          insidious is the lack of indication of the main feature of
          magnecules, namely, that their bond is weaker than the
          conventional molecular bond as a necessary condition to
          achieve full combustion (see below)....<br>

            Abstract<br>
          </b>Aberration-corrected optics have made electron microscopy
          at atomic resolution a widespread and often essential tool for
          characterizing nanoscale structures. Image resolution has
          traditionally been improved by increasing the numerical
          aperture of the lens (α) and the beam energy, with the
          state-of-the-art at 300 kiloelectronvolts just entering the
          deep sub-ångström (that is, less than 0.5 ångström) regime.
          Two-dimensional (2D) materials are imaged at lower beam
          energies to avoid displacement damage from large momenta
          transfers, limiting spatial resolution to about 1 ångström.
          Here, by combining an electron microscope pixel-array detector
          with the dynamic range necessary to record the complete
          distribution of transmitted electrons and full-field
          ptychography to recover phase information from the full phase
          space, we increase the spatial resolution well beyond the
          traditional numerical-aperture-limited resolution. At a beam
          energy of 80 kiloelectronvolts, our ptychographic
          reconstruction improves the image contrast of single-atom
          defects in MoS2 substantially, reaching an information limit
          close to 5α, which corresponds to an Abbe diffraction-limited
          resolution of 0.39 ångström, at the electron dose and imaging
          conditions for which conventional imaging methods reach only
          0.98 ångström.<br>

          <b><br>
          </b>Dust is everywhere: under the bed, on the stairs and even
          inside of plasmas. A team of researchers from Auburn
          University, the University of Iowa and the University of
          California, San Diego, using the new Magnetized Dusty Plasma
          Experiment (MDPX), the first U.S. experiment of its kind,
          recently discovered a new form of crystalline-like matter in
          strongly magnetized dusty plasma.<br>
          <br>
          A feature of dusty plasmas is that under the proper
          conditions, usually at higher gas pressures, the dust
          particles can form self-organized, hexagonal structures--a
          configuration known as a "plasma crystal."<br>
          <br>
          The striking aspect of the newly discovered crystal structures
          is that the lattice (spacing between crystal particles)
          properties can be imposed arbitrarily by an external grid/mesh
          structure. These new made-to-order crystals can have any
          geometric pattern, making them distinct from the crystal
          lattices of ordinary solids and traditional plasma crystals,
          which are self-organized structures not imposed by external
          boundary conditions...<br>

          High-performance lithium ion batteries face a major problem:
          Lithium will eventually start to run out as batteries are
          deployed in electric cars and stationary storage units.
          Researchers have now discovered an alternative: the “fool’s
          gold battery”. It consists of iron, sulfur, sodium and
          magnesium – all elements that are in plentiful supply. This
          means that giant storage batteries could be built on the cheap
          and used stationary in buildings or next to power plants, for
          instance. ..<br>

          Laboratory for Thin Films and Photovoltaics have now managed
          to pull off the unthinkable: by combining a magnesium anode
          with an electrolyte made of magnesium and sodium ions.
          Nanocrystals made of pyrite -- more commonly known as fool's
          gold -- serve as the cathode. Pyrite is crystalline iron
          sulfide. The sodium ions from the electrolyte migrate to the
          cathode during discharging. When the battery is recharged, the
          pyrite re-releases the sodium ions. This so-called
          sodium-magnesium hybrid battery already works in the lab and
          has several advantages: The magnesium as the anode is far
          safer than highly flammable lithium. And the test battery in
          the lab already withstood 40 charging and discharging cycles
          without compromising its performance, calling for further
          optimization....<b><br>

          </b>We present a hybrid intercalation battery based on a
          sodium/magnesium (Na/Mg) dual salt electrolyte, metallic
          magnesium anode, and a cathode based on FeS2 nanocrystals
          (NCs). Compared to lithium or sodium, metallic magnesium anode
          is safer due to dendrite-free electroplating and offers
          extremely high volumetric (3833 mAh cm–3) and gravimetric
          capacities (2205 mAh g–1). Na-ion cathodes, FeS2 NCs in the
          present study, may serve as attractive alternatives to Mg-ion
          cathodes due to the higher voltage of operation and fast,
          highly reversible insertion of Na-ions. In this
          proof-of-concept study, electrochemical cycling of the Na/Mg
          hybrid battery was characterized by high rate capability, high
          Coulombic efficiency of 99.8%, and high energy density. In
          particular, with an average discharge voltage of ~1.1 V and a
          cathodic capacity of 189 mAh g–1 at a current of 200 mA g–1,
          the presented Mg/FeS2 hybrid battery delivers energy densities
          of up to 210 Wh kg–1, comparable to commercial Li-ion
          batteries and approximately twice as high as state-of-the-art
          Mg-ion batteries based on Mo6S8 cathodes. Further significant
          gains in the energy density are expected from the development
          of Na/Mg electrolytes with a broader electrochemical stability
          window. Fully based on Earth-abundant elements, hybrid Na–Mg
          batteries are highly promising for large-scale stationary
          energy storage.<br>

          </div>
          <b><b><br>
            </b></b>IQ scores have been steadily falling for the past
          few decades, and environmental factors are to blame, a new
          study says.<br>
          <br>
          The research suggests that genes aren’t what’s driving the
          decline in IQ scores, according to the study, published
          Monday.<br>
          <br>
          Norwegian researchers analyzed the IQ scores of Norwegian men
          born between 1962 and 1991 and found that scores increased by
          almost 3 percentage points each decade for those born between
          1962 to 1975 — but then saw a steady decline among those born
          after 1975.<br>
          <br>
          Similar studies in Denmark, Britain, France, the Netherlands,
          Finland and Estonia have demonstrated a similar downward trend
          in IQ scores, said Ole Rogeberg, a senior research fellow at
          the Ragnar Frisch Center for Economic Research in Norway and
          co-author of the new study.<br>
          <br>
          “The causes in IQ increases over time and now the decline is
          due to environmental factors,” said Rogeburg, who believes the
          change is not due to genetics.<br>
          <br>
          “It’s not that dumb people are having more kids than smart
          people, to put it crudely. It’s something to do with the
          environment because we’re seeing the same differences within
          families,” he said.<br>
          <br>
          These environmental factors could include changes in the
          education system and media environment, nutrition, reading
          less and being online more, Rogeberg said.<br>
          <br>
          The earlier rise in IQ scores follows the “Flynn effect,” a
          term for the long-term increase in intelligence levels that
          occurred during the 20th century, arguably the result of
          better access to education, according to Stuart Ritchie, a
          postdoctoral fellow in cognitive ageing at the University of
          Edinburgh whose research explores IQ scores and intelligence
          and who was not involved in the new study.<br>
          <br>
          Researchers have long preferred to use genes to explain
          variations in intelligence over environmental factors.
          However, the new study turns this thinking on its head.<br>
          <br>
          Intelligence is heritable, and for a long time, researchers
          assumed that people with high IQ scores would have kids who
          also scored above average. Moreover, it was thought that
          people with lower scores would have more kids than people with
          high IQ scores, which would contribute to a decline in IQ
          scores over time and a “dumbing down” of the general
          population, according to Rogeberg.<br>
          <br>
          Anyone who has seen the film “Idiocracy” might already be
          familiar with these ideas. In the scientific community, the
          idea of unintelligent parents having more kids and
          dumbing-down the population is known as the dysgenic fertility
          theory, according to Ritchie.<br>
          <br>
          The study looked at the IQ scores of brothers who were born in
          different years. Researchers found that, instead of being
          similar as suggested by a genetic explanation, IQ scores often
          differed significantly between the siblings.<br>
          <br>
          “The main exciting finding isn’t that there was a decline in
          IQ,” Ritchie said. “The interesting thing about this paper is
          that they were able to show a difference in IQ scores within
          the same families.”<br>
          <br>
          The study not only showed IQ variance between children the
          same parents but because the authors had the IQ scores of
          various parents, it demonstrated that parents with higher IQs
          tended to have more kids, ruling out the dysgenic fertility
          theory as a driver of falling IQ scores and highlighting the
          role of environmental factors instead.<br>
          <br>
          What specific environmental factors cause changes in
          intelligence remains relatively unexplored.<br>
          <br>
          Access to education is currently the most conclusive factor
          explaining disparities in intelligence, according to Ritchie.
          In a separate study that has not been released, he and his
          colleagues looked at existing research in an effort to
          demonstrate that staying in school longer directly equates to
          higher IQ scores.<br>
          <br>
          But more research is needed to better understand other
          environmental factors thought to be linked to intelligence.
          Robin Morris, a professor of psychology at Kings College in
          London who was not involved in Ritchie’s research, suggests
          that traditional measures of intelligence, such as the IQ
          test, might be outmoded in today’s fast-paced world of
          constant technological change.<br>
          <br>
          “In my view, we need to recognize that as time changes and
          people are exposed to different intellectual experiences, such
          as changes in the use of technology, for example, social
          media, the way intelligence is expressed also changes.
          Educational methods need to adapt to such changes,” Morris
          said.<br>

                from fishing by 85 percent</b></b><br>
          </div>
          <b><b><br>
            </b></b>Illuminating fishing nets with low-cost lights could
          reduce the terrible impact they have on seabirds and
          marine-dwellers by more than 85 percent, new research has
          shown. <br>
          <br>
          A team of international researchers, led by Dr Jeffrey Mangel
          from the University of Exeter, has shown the number of birds
          caught in gillnets can be drastically reduced by attaching
          green battery-powered light-emitting diodes (LEDs).<br>
          <br>
          For the study, the researchers compared 114 pairs of gillnets
          -- which are anchored in fixed positions at sea and designed
          to snare fish by the gills -- in fishing waters off the coast
          of Peru.<br>
          <br>
          They discovered that the nets fitted with the LEDs caught 85
          per cent fewer guanay cormorants -- a native diving bird that
          commonly becomes entangled in nets -- compared with those
          without lights.<br>
          <br>
          Coupled with previous research conducted by the same team,
          that showed LED lighting also reduced the number of sea
          turtles caught in fishing nets by 64 per cent, the researchers
          believe the lights offer a cheap, reliable and durable way to
          dramatically reduce the capture and death of birds and
          turtles, without reducing the intended catch of fish...<br>

                as missing ingredient for next-gen batteries</b></b><br>

          higher capacity lithium-ion batteries<br>
          <br>
          For years, scientists have seen silicon as a hugely promising
          material in the world of lithium-ion batteries. The primary
          reason for this is that using it as the anode could mean
          batteries with 10 times the capacity of current versions – at
          least in theory. But in reality, it easily breaks apart as the
          battery goes through its charging cycles. Scientists at
          Norway's Institute for Energy Technology are now claiming to
          have overcome this problem with a new material they call
          SiliconX...<br>
          <br>
          The problem with using regular silicon as an anode is that the
          particles expand by as much as 400 percent as the battery
          charges, and then return to normal as it discharges, which
          causes them to rupture. The scientists at the Institute for
          Energy Technology say they have overcome this problem with a
          new silicon alloy that uses a careful mix of silicon
          nanoparticles and an unnamed material, with work underway to
          patent the technology...<br>

          Xianming Shi, associate professor in WSU’s Department of Civil

          The team used graphene oxide, a recently discovered

          material. The graphene oxide rearranges atoms and molecules in
          a solution of fly ash and chemical activators like sodium
          silicate and calcium oxide. The process creates a
          calcium-aluminate-silicate-hydrate molecule chain with

              <br>
            </b></b>To divert fly ash from hazardous waste stream to
          beneficial uses, this work aims to improve the solidification
          of fly ash as a geopolymer material by using graphene oxide
          (GO). The hydration precursors, morphology, elemental
          composition, mineralogy, chemical structure and ordering of
          GO-modified fly ash geopolymer were investigated by means of
          Raman spectroscopy, SEM/BSE, EMPA, XRD/TGA and 29Si/27Al
          MAS-NMR, respectively, to unravel the role of GO. The
          experimental results suggest that GO regulated the Ca/Si,
          Si/Al and Ca/(Si + Al) mole ratios to facilitate the formation
          of fly ash hydrates with improved mechanical strength, as GO
          showed the ability to selectively affect the distribution of
          different hydration precursors. GO also promoted the formation
          of low quartz and jennite-like hydrates. Overall, the 28-day
          compressive strength of fly ash geopolymer (w/b = 0.35) in
          this study was improved by 23% (from 33.6 MPa to 41.4 MPa)
          with GO admixed at 0.02% by mass of fly ash. The NMR study
          showed that GO improved the polymerization degree of fly ash
          geopolymer by increasing the total Q3 and Q4 Si-tetrahedrons,
          which suggests potential for improving the immobilization of
          heavy metals in fly ash.<b><b><br>

            <b><b>by Joshua Worth</b></b><br>
          </div>
          <b><b><br>
            </b></b>...At high temperatures, alloys can react violently
          with their environment, quickly causing the materials to fail
          by corrosion. To protect against this, all high temperature
          alloys are designed to form a protective oxide scale, usually
          consisting of aluminium oxide or chromium oxide. This oxide
          scale plays a decisive role in preventing the metals from
          corroding. Therefore, research on high temperature corrosion
          is very focused on these oxide scales – how they are formed,
          how they perform at high heat, and how they sometimes fail.<br>
          <br>
          The article in Nature Materials answers two classical issues
          in the area. One applies to the very small additives of
          so-called ‘reactive elements’ – often yttrium and zirconium –
          found in all high-temperature alloys. The second issue is
          about the role of water vapour.<br>
          <br>
          “Adding reactive elements to alloys results in a huge
          improvement in performance – but no one has been able to
          provide robust experimental proof why,” says Nooshin
          Mortazavi, materials researcher at Chalmers’ Department of
          Physics, and first author of the study. “Likewise, the role of
          water, which is always present in high-temperature
          environments, in the form of steam, has been little
          understood. Our paper will help solve these enigmas.”<br>
          <br>
          In this paper, the Chalmers researchers show how these two
          elements are linked. They demonstrate how the reactive
          elements in the alloy promote the growth of an aluminium oxide
          scale. The presence of these reactive element particles causes
          the oxide scale to grow inward, rather than outward, thereby
          facilitating the transport of water from the environment,
          towards the alloy substrate. Reactive elements and water
          combine to create a fast-growing, nanocrystalline, oxide
          scale.//<br>

          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>IQ scores have been steadily falling for the past few
          decades, and environmental factors are to blame, a new study
          says.<br>
          <br>
          The research suggests that genes aren’t what’s driving the
          decline in IQ scores, according to the study, published
          Monday.<br>
          <br>
          Norwegian researchers analyzed the IQ scores of Norwegian men
          born between 1962 and 1991 and found that scores increased by
          almost 3 percentage points each decade for those born between
          1962 to 1975 — but then saw a steady decline among those born
          after 1975.<br>
          <br>
          Similar studies in Denmark, Britain, France, the Netherlands,
          Finland and Estonia have demonstrated a similar downward trend
          in IQ scores, said Ole Rogeberg, a senior research fellow at
          the Ragnar Frisch Center for Economic Research in Norway and
          co-author of the new study.<br>
          <br>
          “The causes in IQ increases over time and now the decline is
          due to environmental factors,” said Rogeburg, who believes the
          change is not due to genetics.<br>
          <br>
          “It’s not that dumb people are having more kids than smart
          people, to put it crudely. It’s something to do with the
          environment because we’re seeing the same differences within
          families,” he said.<br>
          <br>
          These environmental factors could include changes in the
          education system and media environment, nutrition, reading
          less and being online more, Rogeberg said.<br>
          <br>
          The earlier rise in IQ scores follows the “Flynn effect,” a
          term for the long-term increase in intelligence levels that
          occurred during the 20th century, arguably the result of
          better access to education, according to Stuart Ritchie, a
          postdoctoral fellow in cognitive ageing at the University of
          Edinburgh whose research explores IQ scores and intelligence
          and who was not involved in the new study.<br>
          <br>
          Researchers have long preferred to use genes to explain
          variations in intelligence over environmental factors.
          However, the new study turns this thinking on its head.<br>
          <br>
          Intelligence is heritable, and for a long time, researchers
          assumed that people with high IQ scores would have kids who
          also scored above average. Moreover, it was thought that
          people with lower scores would have more kids than people with
          high IQ scores, which would contribute to a decline in IQ
          scores over time and a “dumbing down” of the general
          population, according to Rogeberg.<br>
          <br>
          Anyone who has seen the film “Idiocracy” might already be
          familiar with these ideas. In the scientific community, the
          idea of unintelligent parents having more kids and
          dumbing-down the population is known as the dysgenic fertility
          theory, according to Ritchie.<br>
          <br>
          The study looked at the IQ scores of brothers who were born in
          different years. Researchers found that, instead of being
          similar as suggested by a genetic explanation, IQ scores often
          differed significantly between the siblings.<br>
          <br>
          “The main exciting finding isn’t that there was a decline in
          IQ,” Ritchie said. “The interesting thing about this paper is
          that they were able to show a difference in IQ scores within
          the same families.”<br>
          <br>
          The study not only showed IQ variance between children the
          same parents but because the authors had the IQ scores of
          various parents, it demonstrated that parents with higher IQs
          tended to have more kids, ruling out the dysgenic fertility
          theory as a driver of falling IQ scores and highlighting the
          role of environmental factors instead.<br>
          <br>
          What specific environmental factors cause changes in
          intelligence remains relatively unexplored.<br>
          <br>
          Access to education is currently the most conclusive factor
          explaining disparities in intelligence, according to Ritchie.
          In a separate study that has not been released, he and his
          colleagues looked at existing research in an effort to
          demonstrate that staying in school longer directly equates to
          higher IQ scores.<br>
          <br>
          But more research is needed to better understand other
          environmental factors thought to be linked to intelligence.
          Robin Morris, a professor of psychology at Kings College in
          London who was not involved in Ritchie’s research, suggests
          that traditional measures of intelligence, such as the IQ
          test, might be outmoded in today’s fast-paced world of
          constant technological change.<br>
          <br>
          “In my view, we need to recognize that as time changes and
          people are exposed to different intellectual experiences, such
          as changes in the use of technology, for example, social
          media, the way intelligence is expressed also changes.
          Educational methods need to adapt to such changes,” Morris
          said.<b><br>

              from fishing by 85 percent</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>Illuminating fishing nets with low-cost lights could
          reduce the terrible impact they have on seabirds and
          marine-dwellers by more than 85 percent, new research has
          shown. <br>
          <br>
          A team of international researchers, led by Dr Jeffrey Mangel
          from the University of Exeter, has shown the number of birds
          caught in gillnets can be drastically reduced by attaching
          green battery-powered light-emitting diodes (LEDs).<br>
          <br>
          For the study, the researchers compared 114 pairs of gillnets
          -- which are anchored in fixed positions at sea and designed
          to snare fish by the gills -- in fishing waters off the coast
          of Peru.<br>
          <br>
          They discovered that the nets fitted with the LEDs caught 85
          per cent fewer guanay cormorants -- a native diving bird that
          commonly becomes entangled in nets -- compared with those
          without lights.<br>
          <br>
          Coupled with previous research conducted by the same team,
          that showed LED lighting also reduced the number of sea
          turtles caught in fishing nets by 64 per cent, the researchers
          believe the lights offer a cheap, reliable and durable way to
          dramatically reduce the capture and death of birds and
          turtles, without reducing the intended catch of fish...<b><br>

          </div>
          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>The human body literally glimmers. The intensity of the
          light emitted by the body is 1000 times lower than the
          sensitivity of our naked eyes. Ultraweak photon emission is
          known as the energy released as light through the changes in
          energy metabolism. We successfully imaged the diurnal change
          of this ultraweak photon emission with an improved highly
          sensitive imaging system using cryogenic charge-coupled device
          (CCD) camera. We found that the human body directly and
          rhythmically emits light. The diurnal changes in photon
          emission might be linked to changes in energy metabolism...<br>
          <b><br>
            Results and Discussion<br>
          </b>A cooled CCD camera operated at -120°C with slow scanning
          mode read-out was used with a specially designed
          high-throughput lens system. The camera was placed in a
          light-tight room in complete darkness (schematic illustration
          of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1A). Five healthy
          male volunteers, in their 20's, were subjected to normal
          light-dark conditions and allowed to sleep from 0:00–7:00. On
          the days of photon imaging, volunteers were kept in a room
          (400 lux) adjacent to the dark room. For imaging purposes, the
          body surface was wiped and the subject was left 15 minutes in
          the dark room for dark adaptation, after which the naked
          subject in sitting position was exposed for 20 minutes to the
          CCD camera. Measurements were carried out in every 3 hours
          from 10:00 to 22:00 and continued for 3 days. Just before and
          after the measurements, the surface body (thermography) and
          oral temperature were taken. Saliva was also collected after
          the photon measurements for the analysis of cortisol level as
          a biomarker of endogenous circadian rhythms. Temporal
          variation of photon emission intensity was calculated from
          image data with extraction of the face and body intensity...<br>

          </b>There are some things in life that shouldn’t be messed
          around with and the internal wiring of the human body is one
          of them. Most men who pursue vasectomies do so to freely
          engage in sexual intercourse without the consequence of
          procreation. Few are aware of the negative health effects.
          Large studies have confirmed the link between vasectomy and

          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>No need for 'Russian spies', when 'stupid boy' UK
          ministers have smartphones <br>
          <br>
          It was one of the funniest things we'd ever seen in
          Parliament. UK Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson was heckled
          by his own mobile phone while giving a statement on Syrian
          "democratic forces" last week.<br>
          <br>
          But amid the laughter, the incident raises some serious
          security concerns about new technology, which up to now have
          largely been ignored.<br>
          <br>
          At the time of the Profumo affair (when it was revealed that
          the Minister of War John Profumo had been sleeping with a
          model who was also sleeping with the Russian naval attache),
          the joke doing the rounds was that the government had spent so
          much time looking for Reds under the bed, it had forgotten to
          look inside the bed.<br>
          <br>
          Fast forward to 2018 and the joke is this: The UK Defense
          Minister has spent so much time warning us about the Russian
          "threat" to UK cyber security, he forgot to switch Siri off on
          his new iPhone.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          For those who aren't au fait with the latest Apple technology
          Siri is the voice-controlled virtual assistant that "is ready
          to help throughout your day." Siri is the 2018 equivalent of
          Jeeves the butler, except it can't (at least not yet) make you
          a cup of tea or bring in breakfast.<br>
          <br>
          "The idea is that you talk to her as you would a friend and
          she aims to help you get things done, whether that be making a
          dinner reservation or sending a message", explain tech writers
          Britta O'Boyle and Dan Grabham.<br>
          <br>
          Siri is great, but the security implications of the UK Defense
          Minister keeping the software switched on are clear for all to
          see.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, there's nothing wrong from a security point of view
          with @GavinWilliamson having this iPhone Siri set to "always
          listen". I mean, that's fine. He's not even in a job where
          security is an issue, is he? ?? https://t.co/aPQ2wBsAzK&nbsp;

          <br>
          Last year, researchers at Zhejiang University found that
          hackers could control digital voice assistants using secret
          commands that were inaudible to humans.<br>
          <br>
          In May, researchers at Berkeley in California came to the same
          conclusion.<br>
          <br>
          "feels like the security implications of @GavinWilliamson
          having siri running in the background have yet to be
          understood by any grownups.&nbsp; urgent Qs such as which
          meetings / briefings have been recorded and for how long need

          Even if we take Siri – and other digital assistants out of the
          equation, there are still the other functions of today's
          smartphones to consider. It's never been easier to
          surreptitiously record meetings and conversations. Conversely,
          confidentiality has never been so difficult to maintain.
          Smartphones are pocket cameras too, making it oh-so-easy to
          take a quick photo of a document that we're not meant to take
          a copy of. Today's equivalents of Agent 007, whoever they are
          working for, don't need gadgetry from 'Q' any more, all they
          require is the latest phone and they're in business.<br>
          <br>
          If a phone of a leading government minister is hacked, or
          stolen, imagine what information is likely to be contained in
          it. I was at a party about ten years ago when a quite
          well-known MP dropped his phone and it slid across the floor.
          He thought it was lost. I found it, and of course, I returned
          it. But let's suppose I had been an unscrupulous political
          opponent of the MP in question. I could easily have checked
          the photos on it, and the numbers to try and find something
          incriminating. Imagine if that happened today, and it was a
          smart phone that was lost?<br>

          The fact that the UK Defense Secretary didn't turn Siri off is
          hardly reassuring. Media Mole of the New Statesman cites
          information security expert Rodolfo Rosini, who told Computer
          Business Review: "In itself leaving Siri on is not a huge
          risk. What it shows [though] is that the guy has no OPSEC
          [operational security] so if he sets Siri on always listening,
          he may have s*** security on his home computers, download
          dodgy apps etc. It's inexcusable for someone in his position.
          Basically the problem is that he signaled he is an easy target
          with no clue."<br>
          <br>
          What makes this all the more ironic is the time Gavin
          Williamson has spent warning the rest of us about the
          'cyber-security' threat coming from Russia. In January, he
          said that Russian disruption of Britain's electricity
          interconnectors, which could come about via a cyber-attack,
          would kill "thousands and thousands and thousands" of people.<br>
          <br>
          In February, he declared that Britain had entered a "new era
          of warfare" with the Kremlin. He said that the UK and its
          allies must "be primed and ready to tackle online threats to
          energy, infrastructure, finance and public services."<br>
          <br>
          In March, he said that Russia's cyber operations were "active
          and brazen".<br>
          <br>
          Russia has said that Williamson's claim of an attack threat on
          Britain's infrastructure was "like something out of Monty
          Python".<br>
          <br>
          But it's not the only comedy analogy that's been made about
          the UK's Defense Minister.<br>
          <br>
          We've learnt that Williamson's nickname is 'Private Pike'
          after the accident-prone character in Britain's best-loved
          sitcom, Dad's Army. In the series, which celebrates its 50th
          anniversary this month, Captain Mainwaring would look at Pike,
          when he'd made another mistake, and say to him "You stupid
          boy!". <br>
          <br>
          It would have been the perfect response to this historic
          Parliamentary interruption.<br>

          <div align="center"><b>Twitter revelation: Metadata can
              identify even secret users 'with 96.7% accuracy'</b><br>
            <b>by Fabrizio Bensch / Reuters</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>Twitter’s metadata contains an array of revealing
          information on its users, a new study proves, and can be used
          to identify a user with unnerving accuracy – even those who go
          to great lengths to hide that information.<br>
          <br>
          Researchers at University College London and the Alan Turing
          Institute found they could correctly identify a Twitter user
          from a group of 10,000 with 96.7 percent accuracy, using just
          their tweets and publicly available metadata.<br>
          <br>
          The goal was “to determine if the information contained in
          users’ metadata is sufficient to fingerprint an account,” and
          the results reveal how much identifying information is tied to
          Twitter accounts, whose users may believe they are tweeting
          anonymously. A single tweet contains about 144 fields of
          metadata...<br>
          <br>
          “That’s the mentality with metadata,” the study’s lead
          co-author Beatrice Perez of University College London told
          Wired. “People think it’s not a big deal.”<br>
          <br>
          Researchers took 14 pieces of metadata from 5 million Twitter
          accounts – including the date the account was created, its
          followers, the accounts it follows and the tweets it likes –
          and ran it through three machine-learning algorithms. The
          researchers found the most basic algorithm had the most
          accuracy.<br>
          <br>
          The methods of identifying users could be used if an account
          changes its name, if a user has created multiple accounts or
          to tell if legitimate accounts have been taken over by
          malicious users.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers also found obfuscation strategies are
          ineffective, as even when 60 percent of the data was muddled
          or altered, the user was able to be classified with an
          accuracy of more than 95 percent.<br>
          <br>
          When the researchers widened their scope and searched for the
          10 most likely candidates, their accuracy was 99.22 percent.<br>
          <br>
          While the study uses Twitter as its subject, its authors note
          “the methods presented in this work are generic and can be
          applied to a variety of social media platforms with similar
          characteristics in terms of metadata.”<br>
          <br>
          The researchers say the results have strong implications in
          terms of “the design of metadata obfuscation strategies” not
          just for Twitter, but for most social media platforms.<br>

          problems of children learning.&nbsp; At one time he said maybe
          teachers should be paid by how well they teach.&nbsp; How do
          you teach children using aspartame and are depleted in
          serotonin.&nbsp; It's gotten so bad that here in Georgia
          several teachers were sent to prison for cheating.&nbsp; They
          were falsifying test scores:&nbsp; <br>

          CHILDREN?"&nbsp; It said:&nbsp; "Four mothers lingered after
          the PTA meeting at a private school in New York City
          whispering about their third grade children, each of whom had
          been diagnosed with a different psychological problem.&nbsp;
          The first had attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
          and had also been prescribed Prozac for his mood swings.&nbsp;
          The second was seeing a therapist for depression after his
          parents were divorced.&nbsp; The third was being assessed for
          a conduct disorder, due to his continued rowdiness&nbsp; in
          class.&nbsp; The fourth was taking St. John's Wort, an
          alternative herbal remedy for dysthymia, a milder form of
          depression, under a doctor's supervision.&nbsp; One mom
          commented that out of 40 students in the grade, she could
          count three or four more who had been similarly
          diagnosed.&nbsp; "that makes nearly twenty percent of our
          class,"she said stunned.&nbsp; "We're good parents," the first
          mother lamented.&nbsp; "Why aren't our children normal?"<br>
          <br>
          Parents Magazine continues: "Even before the tragic school
          shootings in Jonesboro and Littleton, parents were waking up
          to the reality that something is desperately wrong.&nbsp;
          their children - and their children's classmates - are being
          diagnosed with mental health problems at an alarming
          rate.&nbsp; The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)
          estimates that there are 12 million children under 18 with
          mental disorders.&nbsp; At least 3 to 5 percent of American
          school age children suffer from ADHD, for example, and 5
          percent show signs of depression.&nbsp; by the end of high
          school, one in four teems will have seriously considered
          suicide."<br>
          <br>
          Dr. H. J. Roberts says in "Aspartame Disease: An Ignored
          Epidemic", page 292, "Decreased brain serotonin has been
          associated with insomnia, depression, anxiety, panic attacks,
          hallucinations, suicidal attempts, hostility and psychopathic
          states."&nbsp; He says further, "Aspartame and its components
          can lower brain serotonin levels through several
          mechanisms.&nbsp; Dr. Richard Wurtman demonstrated that
          aspartame inhibits the carbohydrate-induced synthesis of
          serotonin (Congressional Record - Senate 1985a, p.S
          5511).&nbsp; Serotonin is an important component of the
          feedback system that helps limit one's consumption of
          carbohydrate to appropriate levels by blunting the
          carbohydrate craving.&nbsp; The amino acid tyrosine, derived
          from phenylalanine, reduces the amount of tryptophan that can
          cross the blood-brain barrier for utilization in serotonin
          production." <br>
          <br>
          Dr. Roberts on page 515 gives some case histories:<br>
          <br>
          "A grandmother visited her 12 year old grandson only once or
          twice a year.&nbsp; Having been "a very bright child when
          three or four years old," she was shocked to discover his
          learning disability. The response of his parents was even more
          disturbing.&nbsp; "They shrugged at my reprimand for allowing
          him to drink diet colas all through the day - even for
          breakfast!&nbsp; I can't help but believe these sodas are the
          cause of his problem."<br>
          <br>
          "The dismay over grandchildren with congenital deformities and
          other disorders is great.&nbsp; For example, a man wrote
          concerning his grandson born with spina bifida.&nbsp; "We give
          him food and drinks with aspartame to help keep his weight
          down.&nbsp; Our family doctor says your ideas are wrong.&nbsp;
          Who do we believe." <br>
          <br>
          In the most horrible scandal, the FDA made a deal with G. D.
          Searle, to seal their teratology studies which showed spina
          bifida, cleft palate and neural tube defects for starters. FDA
          Jerome Bressler who did the famous Bressler Report exposing
          Searle's studies told me FDA had removed the information from
          his report and it had to be added back, pregnant women were
          consuming this poison.&nbsp; I had called him and thanked him
          when he retired.&nbsp; It took me 8 years to find the studies.
          The sealed information was then added back to the Bressler
          Report:&nbsp; <br>

          violated the Delaney Amendment.&nbsp; Aspartame caused brain
          tumors and brain cancer.&nbsp; Dr. Gross said the FDA should
          not have been able to even set an allowable daily intake but

          violates its own laws who is left to protect the public?"<br>

          https://rense.com//general96/ asparautism.html He discusses
          the FDA deal with the manufacturer.&nbsp; Can you even imagine
          an FDA who knew aspartame would cause horrible birth defects
          and refused to add a pregnancy warning and allowed this
          teratogen in children's drugs to destroy their health.&nbsp;

          impact of aspartame on catecholamine and indolamine

          "The brain edema and vascular stasis due to chronic methanol

          juice laced with aspartame, and many developed "abnormal
          restlessness, lack of concentration, irritability and
          depression."&nbsp; When Dr. Baret removed it "The results were
          astonishing.&nbsp; Their symptoms disappeared in 4-6 days in

          fraud and dedicated to the proposition that profit is ALL that
          matters!&nbsp; Here is the FDA's own report of 92 symptoms
          including death.&nbsp; <br>

          </b>Aspartame destroys young minds!&nbsp; More and more
          educators rely on Ritalin, Prozac, and other psychoactive
          drugs to bring order to the classrooms.&nbsp; So education is
          becoming medication.&nbsp; The generic for Ritalin even has
          aspartame in it.&nbsp; Do firemen fight smoke?&nbsp; Aspartame
          is the fire, attention deficit discover (ADD) is the smoke
          from a raging atrocity consuming the brains and lives of our
          children!&nbsp; As this blazing conflagration spreads
          throughout the world the FDA even ignores the&nbsp; harm to
          babies and children.&nbsp; After once asking for the
          indictment of the manufacturer and revoking the petition for
          approval on my web site, www.mpwhi.com they now lie to the
          public and say its safe.&nbsp; While products like Coke and
          Pepsi are labeled "Diet" with consumers getting fatter and
          fatter from the obesity triggered by aspartame six class
          actions have been filed for deceptive advertising.&nbsp; The
          National Health Federation published the indepth story in
          "Health Freedom News", Winter 2017/Volume 35.&nbsp; In "Sweet
          Remedy" a documentary on aspartame the ADD people were
          interviewed and admitted that before aspartame was approved
          they hardly used the term "ADD".&nbsp; <br>

                      the whistle on vaccinations By: Jay Greenberg<br>

                <font size="+1">&nbsp;The former vice president of the
                  world’s largest pharmaceutical company has blown the
                  whistle to expose the true dangers of mandatory
                  vaccinations. Dr. Peter Rost lifted the lid on
                  vaccines and revealed that the Gardasil inoculation,
                  in particular, is in fact, “deadly”. In a shocking
                  exposé from one of the highest-ranking whistleblowers
                  to date, Rost has also claimed that Big Pharma is
                  purposely keeping the public unhealthy so they can
                  make a fortune from continual treatments of illnesses
                  rather than curing them. Dr. Rost made the revelations
                  during an interview for the “One More Girl”
                  documentary in which he candidly discussed how the
                  main objective for vaccines and pharmaceutical drugs
                  is to keep the public in a constant state of disease.<br>
                  &nbsp;<br>
                  Rost also likened mandatory vaccinations to “child
                  abuse” saying; “I would never vaccinate my
                  children.”...<b><br>

                  </b>This video shows FEMA agents telling new recruits
                  that our founding fathers were "the first terrorists"
                  and that any activist civilians who are dissatisfied
                  with their current government are considered domestic
                  terrorists by the CIA. The U.S. government, under a
                  program called REX 84, runs approximately 3,708
                  detention camps nationwide. They are all fully
                  operational and ready to recieve prisoners should the
                  US government institute matial law. The Rex 84 Program
                  was initially established as a way to deal with a mass
                  exodus of illegal aliens crossing the Mexican/US
                  border, they would be quickly rounded up and detained
                  in detention centers by FEMA (Federal Emergency
                  Management Agency). Rex 84 allowed many military bases
                  to be closed down and to be turned into prisons.
                  Operation Cable Splicer and Garden Plot are the two
                  sub programs which will be implemented once the Rex 84
                  program is initiated for its proper purpose. Garden
                  Plot is the program to control the population. Cable
                  Splicer is the program for an orderly takeover of the
                  state and local governments by the federal government.
                  FEMA is the executive arm of the coming police state
                  and thus will head up all operations. The Presidential
                  Executive Orders already listed on the Federal
                  Register also are part of the legal framework for this
                  operation. The camps all have railroad facilities as
                  well as roads leading to and from the detention
                  facilities. Many also have an airport nearby. The
                  majority of the camps can house a population of 20,000
                  prisoners. Currently, the largest of these facilities
                  is just outside of Fairbanks, Alaska. The Alaskan
                  facility is a massive mental health facility and can
                  hold approximately 2 million people. INFO ON ONE
                  MILLION FEMA COFFINS: For an aerial view of these FEMA
                  coffins, look it up in google maps (maps.google.com)
                  or google earth by pasting in the following
                  coordinates: 33°33'57.36"N 83°29'6.26"W This facility
                  is located off Lions Club Road in Madison, GA. They
                  allegedly will not answer inquiries about the
                  purported use of the boxes. These coffins are stacked
                  on pallets, upside down on each other (about 17 per
                  pallet). Apparently the Government is expecting a
                  million people to die relatively soon, and the Atlanta
                  Airport is a major airline traffic hub, probably the
                  biggest in the country, which means Georgia is a prime
                  base to conduct military operations and coordination.
                  It is also the home of the CDC, the Center for Disease
                  Control. One million plastic coffins "just in case
                  something happens". When has our government every been
                  so efficient? There are over 3,700 FEMA (Federal
                  Emergency Management Agency) camps over the United
                  States all fully staffed and operational, just waiting
                  to take in the noncompliant population under the

                <font size="+1"><b><br>
                  </b>Purdue researchers have observed a way that the
                  brittle nature of ceramics can be overcome as they
                  sustain heavy loads, leading to more resilient
                  structures such as aircraft engine blade coatings and
                  dental implants.<br>
                  <br>
                  While inherently strong, most ceramics tend to
                  fracture suddenly when just slightly strained under a
                  load unless exposed to high temperatures. Structural
                  ceramic components also require high temperatures to
                  form in the first place through a lengthy process
                  called sintering, in which a powdered material
                  coalesces into a solid mass.<br>
                  <br>
                  These issues are particularly problematic for ceramic
                  coatings of metal engine blades intended to protect
                  metal cores from a range of operational temperatures.
                  A study published in Nature Communications
                  demonstrates for the first time that applying an
                  electric field to the formation of yttria-stabilized
                  zirconia (YSZ), a typical thermal barrier ceramic,
                  makes the material almost as plastic, or easily
                  reshaped, as metal at room temperature. Engineers
                  could also see cracks sooner since they start to
                  slowly form at a moderate temperature as opposed to
                  higher temperatures, giving them time to rescue a
                  structure.<br>
                  <br>
                  “In the past, when we applied a high load at lower
                  temperatures, a large number of ceramics would fail
                  catastrophically without warning,” said Xinghang
                  Zhang, professor of materials engineering. “Now we can
                  see the cracks coming, but the material stays
                  together; this is predictable failure and much safer
                  for the usage of ceramics.”<br>
                  <br>
                  Recent studies have shown that applying an electric
                  field, or “flash,” significantly accelerates the
                  sintering process that forms YSZ and other ceramics,
                  and at much lower furnace temperatures than
                  conventional sintering. Flash-sintered ceramics also
                  have very little porosity, which makes them more dense
                  and therefore easier to deform. None have yet tested
                  the ability of flash-sintered ceramics to change shape
                  at room temperature or increasingly higher
                  temperatures.<br>
                  <br>
                  “YSZ is a very typical thermal barrier coating – it
                  basically protects a metal core from heat,” said
                  Haiyan Wang, Purdue’s Basil S. Turner Professor of
                  Engineering. “But it tends to suffer from a lot of
                  fractures when an engine heats up and cools down due
                  to residual stresses.”<br>
                  ductile-ceram In-situ compression tests revealed that
                  ceramics are almost as ductile as metals at room
                  temperature and increasingly higher temperatures.

                  <br>
                  What allows metals to be fracture-resistant and easy
                  to change shape is the presence of “defects,” or
                  dislocations – extra planes of atoms that shuffle
                  during deformation to make a material simply deform
                  rather than break under a load.<br>
                  <br>
                  “These dislocations will move under compression or
                  tension, such that the material doesn’t fail,” said
                  Jaehun Cho, a graduate research assistant in materials
                  engineering.<br>
                  <br>
                  Ceramics normally don’t form dislocations unless
                  deformed at very high temperatures. Flash-sintering
                  them, however, introduces these dislocations and
                  creates a smaller grain size in the resulting
                  material.<br>
                  <br>
                  “Smaller grains, such as nanocrystalline grains, may
                  slide as the ceramic material deforms, helping it to
                  deform better,” Wang said.<br>
                  <br>
                  Pre-existing dislocations and small grain sizes
                  enabled a flash-sintered YSZ sample thinner than human
                  hair to grow increasingly plastic between room
                  temperature and 600 degrees Celsius when compressed,
                  with cracks starting to slowly spread at 400 degrees
                  as opposed to conventionally sintered YSZ that
                  requires 800 degrees and higher to plastically deform.<br>
                  <br>
                  Improved plasticity means more stability during
                  operation at relatively low temperatures. The sample
                  could also withstand almost as much compression strain
                  as some metals do before cracks started to appear.<br>
                  <br>
                  “Metals can be compressed to 10 or 20 percent strain,
                  no problem, but ceramics often fracture into pieces if
                  you compress them to less than 2-3 percent strain,”
                  Zhang said. “We show that flash-sintered ceramics can
                  be compressed to 7-10 percent without catastrophic
                  fracture.”<br>
                  <br>
                  Even when the sample did begin to crack, the cracks
                  formed very slowly and did not result in complete
                  collapse as would typically happen with conventional
                  ceramics. The next steps would be using these
                  principles to design even more resilient ceramic
                  materials.<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;The researchers would not have been able to
                  perform in-situ experiments of a micron-sized ceramic
                  sample without an in-situ nanomechanical testing tool
                  inside a high-resolution scanning electron microscope
                  equipped with a focused iron beam tool at Purdue’s
                  Life Science Microscopy Center and an FEI Talos 200X
                  electron microscope facility in Purdue’s Materials
                  Engineering facility. Both microscopes were provided
                  by Purdue’s Office of the Executive Vice President for
                  Research and Partnerships and the Colleges of
                  Engineering and Science. Purdue is expecting an even
                  higher-resolution aberration-corrected microscope that
                  the researchers will soon use for future nanomaterials
                  research.<b><br>

                    <br>
                  </b>PM2·5 air pollution is associated with increased
                  risk of diabetes; however, a knowledge gap exists to
                  further define and quantify the burden of diabetes
                  attributable to PM2·5 air pollution. Therefore, we
                  aimed to define the relationship between PM2·5 and
                  diabetes. We also aimed to characterise an integrated
                  exposure response function and to provide a
                  quantitative estimate of the global and national
                  burden of diabetes attributable to PM2·5.<br>

                    Evidence before this study<br>
                    <br>
                  </b>Previous epidemiological evidence suggests that
                  environmental exposure to PM2·5 is associated with
                  risk of diabetes. However, the Lancet Commission on
                  pollution and health identified knowledge gaps and
                  outlined several research recommendations including
                  the need to further “define and quantify the burden of
                  diabetes attributable to PM2·5 air pollution”.<b><br>
                    <br>
                    Added value of this study<br>
                    <br>
                  </b>This study addresses the research recommendation
                  and provides evidence that ambient PM2·5 pollution is
                  associated with increased risk of diabetes. We
                  examined the association in a longitudinal cohort of
                  about 1·7 million US veterans, in which we control for
                  relevant individual-level variables and ecological
                  characteristics. We tested a positive control, as well
                  as negative outcome and exposure controls to address
                  concern about spurious causal inference. The study
                  synthesised previous evidence to build an integrated
                  exposure response function to characterise the risk of
                  diabetes across all PM2·5 concentrations experienced
                  by humans. The integrated exposure response function
                  was non-linear in that risk increased substantially
                  above PM2·5 concentrations of 2·4 µg/m3, and then
                  exhibited a more moderate increase in risk at
                  concentrations above 10 µg/m3. Additionally, the study
                  suggests that in 2016, there were about 3·2 million
                  cases of incident diabetes, and about 8·2 million
                  healthy life years lost due to diabetes attributable
                  to air pollution. The burden varied substantially by
                  geography and was most pronounced in less developed
                  countries.<b><br>
                    <br>
                    Implications of all the available evidence<br>
                    <br>
                  </b>Taken together, the findings address the knowledge
                  gap outlined in the Lancet Commission on pollution and
                  health to “define and quantify the burden of diabetes
                  attributable to PM2·5 air pollution”. Most
                  importantly, the study shows that substantial risk
                  exists at concentrations well below those outlined in
                  the air quality standards of WHO and national and
                  international regulatory agencies. Although the
                  non-linearity of the integrated exposure response
                  function suggests modest reduction in risk unless
                  PM2·5 is decreased substantially in high-pollution
                  areas, given the considerable number of people living
                  in heavily polluted geographies, even incremental
                  reductions in PM2·5 will ameliorate the burden of
                  diabetes. Finally, we observed that the burden of
                  diabetes attributable to PM2·5 exhibited substantial
                  geographical variability, and was more skewed towards
                  regions that are least prepared to cope with the
                  consequences of this excess burden. The results will
                  possibly be helpful to promote the public's awareness
                  about the effect of PM2·5 pollution on the risk of
                  diabetes, and serve to inform and guide policy making
                  aimed at addressing health consequences of
                  environmental air pollution.<b><br>

                  </b>Twitter user @tahkion has discovered a new way to
                  beat facial recognition systems, computer programs
                  that analyze images or videos of people's faces for
                  the purposes of identifying them.<br>
                  <br>
                  In a series of tweets on Saturday, the computer
                  science blogger for WonderHowTo described how the face
                  makeup favored by Juggalos - die-hard fans of the
                  musical group Insane Clown Posse - confuses the
                  systems to the point they can't accurately identify

                  <br>
                  According to @tahkion, the key to the success of the
                  makeup is where you put the paint. Blacking out the
                  area below the mouth but above the chin - as many
                  Juggalos do - tricks facial recognition systems into
                  identifying jawline much closer to the mouth than it
                  really is.<br>
                  <br>
                  This prevents the system from accurately connecting a
                  person in Juggalo makeup to an image of that person
                  without the makeup on.<b><br>

                  </b>This is a research done in the late nineties until

                  the official NIST data of nuclear energies indicates
                  that there is a possibility atomic nuclei may be held
                  together by electric forces rather than the special
                  nuclear forces that are postulated in the standard
                  model. This data, if confirmed by other researchers,
                  could lead to a re-thinking and simplification of
                  particle physics. The troublesome weak and strong

                  surprising conclusions...<br>
                  <br>
                  This analysis of the precise NIST data seems to
                  indicate that there is NO energy which exists within
                  any atomic nuclei to account for the existence of ANY
                  pi-mesons, OR for the necessary Binding Energy of any
                  neutrons, OR of any ultra-powerful Strong Nuclear
                  Force, or any Neutrinos. This research has resulted in
                  a far simpler and more logical description of atomic
                  nuclei. It also entirely complies with the known Laws
                  of Science! NO (unseen) Strong Nuclear Force which
                  allegedly works at an Inverse-Fifth-Power distance,
                  except then also REVERSES its effect at really short
                  dimensions, is either necessary or represented by any
                  energy source. This analysis will show that when the
                  total Rest masses of the component protons and
                  electrons are added together for any atomic nucleus,
                  plus a specific amount of relatively consistent
                  (relativistic) kinetic energy for each of the
                  Migrating internal electrons, virtually all of the
                  Rest Mass of ANY nucleus can be described (and
                  therefore mathematically predicted quite accurately).
                  That kinetic energy of the internal Migrating
                  electrons is exactly like the kinetic energy (which we
                  call Binding Energy) that orbiting electrons have. In
                  both cases, the kinetic energy arose as a result of
                  the electron falling from an infinite distance to its
                  functional radius of orbit, whether inside or outside
                  the nucleus, which therefore Conserves Energy. Angular
                  Momentum is also Conserved in very simple and obvious
                  ways.<br>

                  algorithms that identify new drug molecules — worked
                  exponentially faster?<br>

                  Computer scientists at the Harvard John A. Paulson
                  School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have
                  developed a completely new kind of algorithm, one that
                  exponentially speeds up computation by dramatically
                  reducing the number of parallel steps required to
                  reach a solution.<br>
                  <br>
                  The theoretical research was presented at the ACM
                  Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC), June 25-29
                  and the experimental research will be presented at the

                  A lot of so-called optimization problems, problems
                  that find the best solution from all possible
                  solutions, such as mapping the fastest route from
                  point A to point B, rely on sequential algorithms that
                  haven’t changed since they were first described in the
                  1970s.&nbsp; These algorithms solve a problem by
                  following a sequential step-by-step process. The
                  number of steps is proportional to the size of the
                  data. But this has led to a computational bottleneck,
                  resulting in lines of questions and areas of research
                  that are just too computationally expensive to
                  explore.<br>
                  <br>
                  “These optimization problems have a diminishing
                  returns property,” said Yaron Singer, Assistant
                  Professor of Computer Science at SEAS and senior
                  author of the research.&nbsp; “As an algorithm
                  progresses, its relative gain from each step becomes
                  smaller and smaller.”&nbsp; <br>

                  Singer and his colleague asked: what if, instead of
                  taking hundreds or thousands of small steps to reach a
                  solution, an algorithm could take just a few leaps?<br>
                  <br>
                  “This algorithm and general approach allows us to
                  dramatically speed up computation for an enormously
                  large class of problems across many different fields,
                  including computer vision, information retrieval,
                  network analysis, computational biology, auction
                  design, and many others,” said Singer. “We can now
                  perform computations in just a few seconds that would
                  have previously taken weeks or months.”<br>
                  <br>
                  “This new algorithmic work, and the corresponding
                  analysis, opens the doors to new large-scale
                  parallelization strategies that have much larger
                  speedups than what has ever been possible before,”
                  said Jeff Bilmes, Professor in the Department of
                  Electrical Engineering at the University of
                  Washington, who was not involved in the research.
                  “These abilities will, for example, enable real-world
                  summarization processes to be developed at
                  unprecedented scale.”<br>
                  <br>
                  Traditionally, algorithms for optimization problems
                  narrow down the search space for the best solution one
                  step at a time. In contrast, this new algorithm
                  samples a variety of directions in parallel. Based on
                  that sample, the algorithm discards low-value
                  directions from its search space and chooses the most
                  valuable directions to progress towards a solution.<br>
                  <br>
                  Take this toy example:<br>
                  <br>
                  You’re in the mood to watch a movie similar to The
                  Avengers. A traditional recommendation algorithm would
                  sequentially add a single movie in every step which
                  has similar attributes to those of The Avengers. In
                  contrast, the new algorithm samples a group of movies
                  at random, discarding those that are too dissimilar to
                  The Avengers. What’s left is a batch of movies that
                  are diverse (after all, you don’t want ten Batman
                  movies) but similar to The Avengers. The algorithm
                  continues to add batches in every step until it has
                  enough movies to recommend.<br>
                  <br>
                  This process of adaptive sampling is key to the
                  algorithm’s ability to make the right decision at each
                  step.<br>
                  <br>
                  “Traditional algorithms for this class of problem
                  greedily add data to the solution while considering
                  the entire dataset at every step,” said Eric
                  Balkanski, a graduate student at SEAS and co-author of
                  the research. “The strength of our algorithm is that
                  in addition to adding data, it also selectively prunes
                  data that will be ignored in future steps.”<br>
                  <br>
                  In experiments, Singer and Balkanski demonstrated that
                  their algorithm could sift through a data set which
                  contained 1 million ratings from 6,000 users on 4,000
                  movies and recommend a personalized and diverse
                  collection of movies for an individual user 20 times
                  faster than the state-of-the-art.<br>
                  <br>
                  The researchers also tested the algorithm on a taxi
                  dispatch problem, where there are a certain number of
                  taxis and the goal is to pick the best locations to
                  cover the maximum number of potential customers. Using
                  a dataset of two million taxi trips from the New York
                  City taxi and limousine commission, the
                  adaptive-sampling algorithm found solutions 6 times
                  faster.<br>
                  <br>
                  “This gap would increase even more significantly on
                  larger scale applications, such as clustering
                  biological data, sponsored search auctions, or social
                  media analytics,” said Balkanski.<br>
                  <br>
                  Of course, the algorithm’s potential extends far
                  beyond movie recommendations and taxi dispatch
                  optimizations. It could be applied to:<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; designing clinical trials for drugs
                  to treat Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis, obesity,
                  diabetes, hepatitis C, HIV and more<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; evolutionary biology to find good
                  representative subsets of different collections of
                  genes from large datasets of genes from different
                  species<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; designing sensor arrays for medical
                  imaging<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; identifying drug-drug interaction
                  detection from online health forums<br>
                  <br>
                  This process of active learning is key to the
                  algorithm’s ability to make the right decision at each
                  step and solves the problem of diminishing returns.<br>
                  <br>
                  “This research is a real breakthrough for large-scale
                  discrete optimization,” said Andreas Krause, professor
                  of Computer Science at ETH Zurich, who was not
                  involved in the research. “One of the biggest
                  challenges in machine learning is finding good,
                  representative subsets of data from large collections
                  of images or videos to train machine learning
                  models.&nbsp; This research could identify those
                  subsets quickly and have substantial practical impact
                  on these large-scale data summarization problems.”<br>
                  <br>
                  Singer-Balkanski model and variants of the algorithm
                  developed in the paper could also be used to more
                  quickly assess the accuracy of a machine learning
                  model, said Vahab Mirrokni, a principal scientist at
                  Google Research, who was not involved in the research.<br>
                  <br>
                  “In some cases, we have a black-box access to the
                  model accuracy function which is time-consuming to
                  compute,” said Mirrokni.&nbsp; “At the same time,
                  computing model accuracy for many feature settings can
                  be done in parallel. This adaptive optimization
                  framework is a great model for these important
                  settings and the insights from the algorithmic
                  techniques developed in this framework can have deep
                  impact in this important area of machine learning
                  research."<br>
                  <br>
                  Singer and Balkanski are continuing to work with
                  practitioners on implementing the algorithm.<br>

                  It’s the smartphone conspiracy theory that just won’t
                  go away: Many, many people are convinced that their
                  phones are listening to their conversations to target
                  them with ads. Vice recently fueled the paranoia with
                  an article that declared “Your phone is listening and
                  it’s not paranoia,” a conclusion the author reached
                  based on a 5-day experiment where he talked about
                  “going back to uni” and “needing cheap shirts” in
                  front of his phone and then saw ads for shirts and
                  university classes on Facebook.<br>
                  <br>
                  (For what it’s worth, I also frequently see ads for
                  shirts on Facebook, but I’m past the age of the target
                  audience for back-to-school propaganda.)<br>
                  <br>
                  Some computer science academics at Northeastern
                  University had heard enough people talking about this
                  technological myth that they decided to do a rigorous
                  study to tackle it. For the last year, Elleen Pan,
                  Jingjing Ren, Martina Lindorfer, Christo Wilson, and
                  David Choffnes ran an experiment involving more than
                  17,000 of the most popular apps on Android to find out
                  whether any of them were secretly using the phone’s
                  mic to capture audio. The apps included those
                  belonging to Facebook, as well as over 8,000 apps that
                  send information to Facebook.<br>
                  <br>
                  Sorry, conspiracy theorists: They found no evidence of
                  an app unexpectedly activating the microphone or
                  sending audio out when not prompted to do so. Like
                  good scientists, they refuse to say that their study
                  definitively proves that your phone isn’t secretly
                  listening to you, but they didn’t find a single
                  instance of it happening. Instead, they discovered a
                  different disturbing practice: apps recording a
                  phone’s screen and sending that information out to
                  third parties.<br>
                  <br>
                  Of the 17,260 apps the researchers looked at, over
                  9,000 had permission to access the camera and
                  microphone and thus the potential to overhear the
                  phone’s owner talking about their need for cat litter
                  or about how much they love a certain brand of
                  gelato....<br>

                  </b>...For more than 100 years, TNT has been the
                  premier mixture of chemicals for blowing things up,
                  and it's even used as a metric to measure the yield of
                  nuclear explosions and other monumental blasts. But
                  new research out of Los Alamos National Laboratory and
                  the Army Research Laboratory has discovered a new
                  chemical, bis-oxadiazole (C6H4N6O8), that has many of
                  the advantages of TNT, is thought to be less toxic to
                  produce, and makes a bigger bang.<br>
                  <br>
                  "It would be about 1.5 times the power of TNT," says
                  David Chavez, an explosives chemist at Los Alamos who
                  worked on the new molecule. "So fairly energetic,
                  quite a nice improvement compared to TNT."...<br>
                  <br>
                  Searching for a substitute has been an ongoing effort
                  spanning decades, and in 2016, ARL synthesized a
                  compound with some promising results. Bis-isoxazole,
                  as the compound is known, proved to be cleaner than
                  TNT and melt-castable, but not as powerful. Working
                  with Los Alamos, the Army set out to tweak the recipe.<br>
                  <br>
                  Bis-isoxazole consists of two five-atom rings with
                  three carbon atoms, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. By
                  swapping out a carbon atom for another nitrogen, the
                  chemists knew they would produce a compound with a
                  higher explosive yield, though they did not know if it
                  would be melt-castable. "There is really no way to
                  predict melting point," Sabatini says. ..<b><br>

                  diffractometry, calculations of its explosive

                  to optimize the synthesis process and to improve
                  yields of the dinitrate are also discussed.
                  Bis(1,2,4-oxadiazole)bis(methylene) dinitrate has a
                  calculated detonation pressure 50% higher than that of
                  TNT. The dinitrate compound exhibits a relatively high
                  decomposition temperature that is rarely observed for
                  nitrate-based compounds. The dinitrate was found to
                  have lower sensitivities to impact and friction
                  compared with RDX. It is believed that intramolecular
                  hydrogen bonding observed in the crystal lattice
                  assists in the relatively high thermal stability and
                  relatively low sensitivity of the material.<b><br>

                  ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. (May 3, 2016) — Army
                  scientists are on the trail of new high-performing
                  energetic materials.Scientists at the U.S. Army
                  Research Laboratory recently synthesized a new
                  material called bis-isoxazole tetranitrate, or BITN,
                  with potential applications in propulsion and
                  lethality.“BITN has a strong potential for improving
                  insensitive munitions characteristics for gun and
                  rocket propellants” said Dr. Jesse J. Sabatini, team
                  leader of the Energetics Synthesis Team within ARL’s
                  Weapons and Materials Research Directorate.Insensitive
                  munitions are chemically stable enough to withstand
                  mechanical shocks, fire and impact by shrapnel, but
                  still explode as intended to destroy their targets, he
                  said.The Joint Insensitive Munitions Technology
                  Program funds efforts to improve response to several
                  scenarios, such as slow cook-off, bullet and fragment
                  impact.“It’s been extremely challenging due to the
                  bulk of sensitive energetic ingredients typically used
                  in many of these munitions,” Sabatini said.In an
                  effort to develop even denser, higher-performing
                  energetic ingredients for propellant and explosive
                  applications, Army researchers are now making
                  derivatives of BITN. Sabatini predicted the
                  derivatives will have high densities, detonation
                  pressures and detonation velocities.“In assessing
                  whether BITN and its derivatives are suitable targets
                  to be synthesized, we have been consulting with
                  colleagues at the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile
                  Research, Development and Engineering Center at
                  Redstone Arsenal, Alabama,” Sabatini said. “The
                  collaboration serves as a prime example as to what can
                  be accomplished when organizations work together.
                  AMRDEC approached us with a particular need, and we
                  were honored to play a role in helping them.”<br>

                  </b>&nbsp;There may have been a major scientific
                  breakthrough in understanding aging, as scientists
                  have identified a gene that plays a key role in
                  kick-starting the process that makes cells start
                  turning "old."<br>
                  <br>
                  Researchers from the University of Buffalo in New York
                  have discovered that one particular gene, CD36,
                  triggers the beginning of the phenomenon of
                  senescence. After it is activated, cells stop dividing
                  and start to wither.<br>
                  <br>
                  Senescence is a natural occurrence in the life cycle
                  of every cell. It has long been the focus of medical
                  research, because senescent cells are thought to
                  contribute to a range of ailments, from heart disease
                  and cataracts to arthritis.<br>
                  <br>
                  The new study, published in the journal Molecular
                  Omics, found that CD36 was particularly active in
                  older, senescent cells. The scientists were also able
                  to cause young, healthy cells to quickly act as if
                  they were old by increasing their CD36 activity.<br>
                  <br>
                  “What we found was very surprising,” one of the
                  researchers, Ekin Atilla-Gokcumen, explained.
                  “Senescence is a very complex process, and we didn’t
                  expect that altering expression of one gene could
                  spark it, or cause the same effect in surrounding
                  cells.”<br>
                  <br>
                  The researchers did not set out to investigate CD36.
                  Rather, they wanted to catalogue all genes related to
                  the aging of cells. They were particularly interested
                  in the lipid-related genes that are involved in this
                  process, because previous studies have shown that
                  lipids play an important role in cellular aging.<br>
                  <br>
                  CD36 quickly emerged as a gene of interest because it
                  repeatedly popped up in different tests designed to
                  capture the factors that cause cell aging.<br>
                  <br>
                  While the discovery is exciting, the gene’s exact role
                  in the aging process remains shrouded in mystery.
                  Scientists know that CD36 guides the body in building
                  a protein that sits on the surface of cells, but what
                  exactly the protein does is still being studied. The
                  researchers say the gene represents an exciting topic
                  for deeper research into how cells age.<br>
                  <br>
                  “Our research identifies CD36 as a candidate for
                  further study. Senescence is a fundamental aspect of
                  being a cell, but there is still a lot that we don’t
                  know about it,” said Omer Gokcumen, one of the paper’s
                  authors. “Senescence seems to have implications for
                  old age and cancer, so understanding it is very
                  important.”<b><br>

                  cold. This temperature difference causes heat flow
                  from the equator to poles. As the Arctic warms like
                  crazy, heat flow there slows, thus jet streams slow
                  and are wavier; the same slowing and waviness increase
                  happens with ocean currents. If sluggish ocean
                  currents (slowing of Atlantic Meridional Overturning

                    " </b>The flow of science in this
                  modern age is largely controlled by just six corporate
                  publishing groups, which by calculated design have
                  been gobbling up the journal market since at least the
                  1970s. And a new study out of Canada reveals that this
                  mass consolidation of publishing power is, to a large
                  extent, skewing what passes as scientific progress.<br>
                  <br>
                  Researchers from the University of Montreal pored
                  through the whole of scientific literature published
                  between 1973 and 2013 and found that the publishing
                  realm has changed dramatically during this time. Many
                  smaller publishers have been absorbed into larger
                  ones, for instance, and academic research groups have
                  become increasingly beholden to the interests of these
                  major publishers, which tend to favor large industries
                  like pharmaceuticals and vaccines.<br>
                  <br>
                  Much of the independence that was once cherished
                  within the scientific community, in other words, has
                  gone by the wayside as these major publishers have
                  taken control and now dictate what types of content
                  get published. The result is a publishing oligopoly in
                  which scientists are muzzled by and overarching trend
                  toward politically correct, and industry-favoring,
                  "science."<br>
                  <br>
                  "Overall, the major publishers control more than half
                  of the market of scientific papers both in the natural
                  and medical sciences and in the social sciences and
                  humanities," said Professor Vincent Lariviere, lead
                  author of the study from the University of Montreal's
                  School of Library and Information Science.<br>
                  <br>
                  "Furthermore, these large commercial publishers have
                  huge sales, with profit margins of nearly 40%. While
                  it is true that publishers have historically played a
                  vital role in the dissemination of scientific
                  knowledge in the print era, it is questionable whether
                  they are still necessary in today's digital era."..<b><br>
                    <br>
                    Six major publishers control fields of chemistry,
                    psychology and social sciences<br>
                    <br>
                  </b>The fields most controlled by this academic
                  oligarchy include those dealing with chemistry,
                  psychology, social sciences and the professional
                  fields. On the flip side, biomedical research,
                  physics, and the arts and humanities are influenced to
                  a much lesser degree by these six corporate
                  publishers, according to the study.<b><br>
                  </b><br>
                  What this suggests is that, over time, certain
                  disciplines have become more corrupted than others as
                  they've been absorbed into the corporate publishing
                  fold. Such content, though often skewed, is highly
                  profitable for publishers which not only don't have to
                  pay for the articles they publish but also resell such
                  content digitally at profit margins upwards of 40%.<br>
                  <br>
                  "As long as publishing in high impact factor journals
                  is a requirement for researchers to obtain positions,
                  research funding, and recognition from peers, the
                  major commercial publishers will maintain their hold
                  on the academic publishing system," added Lariviere.<br>
                  <br>
                  Publishing in one of "Big Six" corporate journals
                  doesn't add value, study finds<br>
                  But does publishing in high-impact journals really
                  make much of a difference in terms of article exposure
                  and the quantity of citations? Not really, the
                  researchers found. The reach is roughly the same, they
                  found, except that smaller publishers are less likely
                  to be actively promoting a special interest agenda,
                  and are thus less likely censor science that doesn't
                  correspond with the official narrative.<br>
                  <br>
                  "One would expect that a major publisher acquiring a
                  journal would have the effect of increasing the
                  latter's visibility," said Lariviere. "However, our
                  study shows that there is no clear increase in terms
                  of citations after switching from a small to large
                  publisher."<br>
                  <br>
                  "Our findings question the real added value of big
                  publishers. Ultimately, the question is whether the
                  services provided to the scientific community by these
                  publishers warrant the growing share of university
                  budgets allocated to them."<br>

                  to the battery of the phone.<br>
                  <br>
                  It is just the 1st practical example of many other
                  uses that may be given in the future to this new
                  source of alternative energy, said Céspedes, a
                  professor at the Technological Institute of Costa Rica
                  (ITCR).<br>
                  <br>
                  According to him, little energy was obtained (the
                  mobile phone could be charged by 30%). They were able
                  to verify that it is possible to imitate what the
                  vegetation does, that is, capture the sunlight and
                  convert this energy light in chemical energy, which is
                  what plants then use to perform all of their
                  functions.<br>
                  <br>
                  “From now on, the challenge is to enhance this energy.
                  I hope that in a few years, maybe 2, we can develop
                  more advanced equipment that allows us to obtain high
                  amounts of clean energy, which can be used in our
                  electronic equipment such as computers and appliances
                  and other practical uses,” said the scientist.<br>
                  <br>
                  The so-called spins (a property of the electron)
                  located in the leaves are, in fact, responsible
                  throughout this process of energy generation.<br>

                    <br>
                  </b>But, what does it consist of? Céspedes explains it
                  in a simple way. There are several components which
                  interact in photosynthesis; sunlight, for example,
                  generates a reaction in the plant where the electrons
                  intervene and, within them, there are the spins.
                  These, in turn, react due to the magnetic field of the
                  Earth, generating electric energy.<br>
                  <br>
                  “This is the 1st time that the influence of spins on
                  photosynthetic organisms and magnetic fields close to
                  our planet is measured. With this discovery, it opens
                  a door to a number of practical applications, using
                  spins as an alternative energy source, which is not
                  only safe but clean”, said the researcher.<br>
                  <br>
                  Previously, other findings around the world had made
                  experiments on organisms that made photosynthesis but
                  at very high magnetic fields. These results gave
                  useful information but were not practical. The
                  challenge was to look for lower magnetic fields,
                  although there is the recent discovery of the Costa
                  Rican scientist to imitate what plants do.<b><br>
                    <br>
                    1st steps<br>
                    <br>
                  </b>The history of his findings dates back 4 years ago
                  when he was doing his 1st research with the nuclear
                  magnetic resonance teams in the Netherlands (in
                  Europe). There, he realized the role that spins have
                  during photosynthesis and that, perhaps, energy could
                  be obtained from them. With this concern, he returned
                  to Costa Rica to continue his research and join the
                  national efforts to look for alternative energy
                  sources.<br>
                  <br>
                  In order to achieve this, he sought support from other
                  scientists at the University of Leipzig, Germany.
                  Engineers from Bruker Biospin (a company that
                  manufactures scientific instrumentation), and ITCR
                  professionals, specifically from the School of
                  Chemistry and Environmental Engineering, finally
                  joined his project. Currently, the research involves
                  an interdisciplinary team composed of chemists,
                  electrical engineers, physicists, mathematicians, and
                  biochemists.<br>
                  <br>
                  “There is much to do. You have to study different
                  plants (up to now, only aquatic plants have been used)
                  and organisms that produce photosynthesis, and analyze
                  the chemical reactions of their spins in order to
                  generalize our discovery to the whole plant world. We
                  have to scale up what we have obtained in the
                  laboratory, that is, be able to design and build a
                  team that imitates the photosynthetic process and
                  generates a considerable amount of energy”, the Costa
                  Rican scientist concluded.<b><br>

                  </b>When topological nodal semimetals are placed in a
                  strong magnetic field, they become very good at
                  converting heat current into electric power. That’s
                  the new result from researchers at the Massachusetts
                  Institute of Technology, who say that the efficiency
                  of these materials in fact becomes much higher than
                  the upper limits known to exist for any other class of
                  thermoelectric material known today.<br>
                  <br>
                  “This is exciting because if we can get really good at
                  converting heat current to electric power by
                  exploiting the thermoelectric effect, this will allow
                  for a lot of useful technologies,” says physicist
                  Brian Skinner, who led this research effort together
                  with colleague Liang Fu. “For example, we could
                  recover the waste heat from a car engine or a power
                  plant and use this heat to power electrical devices.
                  Or we could make new kinds of refrigerators or heaters
                  that are very efficient and have no moving parts.”<br>
                  Boosting the thermoelectric effect<br>
                  <br>
                  A temperature gradient applied across a solid material
                  containing free charge carriers (electrons and holes)
                  produces a voltage gradient as the carriers migrate
                  from the hot side of the material to the cold side.
                  The strength of this thermoelectric effect is
                  characterized by its thermopower (or Seebeck
                  coefficient), which is the ratio of the voltage
                  difference to the temperature difference across a
                  material.<br>
                  <br>
                  Finding materials with a large thermopower is crucial
                  for developing devices that can transform waste heat
                  into useful electric power. Most thermoelectric
                  materials made thus far don’t have a very large
                  thermopower, and so can’t be used in real-world
                  practical applications. This is partly because it is
                  difficult to provide enough thermal energy to
                  electrons so that they can cross the material’s energy
                  bandgap and migrate across the material.<br>
                  <br>
                  Skinner and Fu have now found that they can overcome
                  this problem by applying a strong magnetic field to
                  doped nodal semimetals. “We studied the generic
                  behaviour of these materials theoretically, and then
                  looked specifically at <b>lead tin selenide (PbSnSe)</b>,”














                  explains Skinner. “The thermoelectric properties of
                  this material have been found to have interesting
                  features under intense magnetic fields of 35 Tesla.”<br>
                  <br>
                  In PbSnSe, electrons and holes move in opposite
                  directions under a strong magnetic field, explains
                  Skinner. “Electrons move towards the cold side of the
                  material and holes towards the hot side. Since both
                  holes and electrons contribute additively to the
                  thermopower under a high magnetic field (rather than
                  subtractively as in the absence of a field), in
                  principle you could get a bigger and bigger voltage
                  out of the same material just by making the magnetic
                  field stronger.”<br>

                  <b>18% of heat converted into electricity</b><b><br>
                  </b><br>
                  Thanks to theoretical simulations, the researchers
                  were able to calculate the material’s figure of merit,
                  the ZT, which is a measure of how close a material is
                  to the theoretical limit for generating power from
                  heat. They found that under a magnetic field of around
                  30 Tesla, PbSnSe can reach a ZT of around 10. This is
                  about five times larger than the value for the best
                  thermoelectric materials available today, they say.<br>
                  <br>
                  “This means that if the material is heated to about
                  500 K (around 227 °C), under such a high field, it
                  should be able to convert 18% of that heat into
                  electricity,” adds Skinner. “To compare, materials
                  with a ZT of 2 can only convert 8%.”<br>
                  <br>
                  But a magnetic field of 30 Tesla is huge, admits
                  Skinner, and for such materials to be practical in
                  everyday applications they would need to work in the
                  1-2 Tesla range. “To achieve this, we would need
                  extremely clean topological semimetal materials
                  containing few impurities,” says Skinner. “Although
                  PbSnSe is relatively clean, there might be better
                  materials that could generate the same amount of
                  thermopower under a smaller magnetic field.”<br>
                  <b><br>
                  </b>The researchers, reporting their work in Science
                  Advances, say they will now be looking at other
                  classes of materials. “In the present study, we
                  investigated the ‘Dirac semimetals’, but there are new
                  classes of materials that have been discovered
                  recently that might be just as good for the
                  applications we have in mind,” Skinner continues.
                  “What we’re hoping is that our results will kick off a
                  flurry of activity investigating thermoelectric
                  effects in semimetals under large magnetic fields.”<b><br>

                    Abstract<br>
                  </b>The thermoelectric effect is the generation of an
                  electrical voltage from a temperature gradient in a
                  solid material due to the diffusion of free charge
                  carriers from hot to cold. Identifying materials with
                  a large thermoelectric response is crucial for the
                  development of novel electric generators and coolers.
                  We theoretically consider the thermopower of
                  Dirac/Weyl semimetals subjected to a quantizing
                  magnetic field. We contrast their thermoelectric
                  properties with those of traditional heavily doped
                  semiconductors and show that, under a sufficiently
                  large magnetic field, the thermopower of Dirac/Weyl
                  semimetals grows linearly with the field without
                  saturation and can reach extremely high values. Our
                  results suggest an immediate pathway for achieving
                  record-high thermopower and thermoelectric figure of
                  merit, and they compare well with a recent experiment
                  on Pb1–xSnxSe.<b><br>

                    &nbsp;</b>The former vice president of the world’s
                  largest pharmaceutical company has blown the whistle
                  to expose the true dangers of mandatory vaccinations.
                  Dr. Peter Rost lifted the lid on vaccines and revealed
                  that the Gardasil inoculation, in particular, is in
                  fact, “deadly”. In a shocking exposé from one of the
                  highest-ranking whistleblowers to date, Rost has also
                  claimed that Big Pharma is purposely keeping the
                  public unhealthy so they can make a fortune from
                  continual treatments of illnesses rather than curing
                  them. Dr. Rost made the revelations during an
                  interview for the “One More Girl” documentary in which
                  he candidly discussed how the main objective for
                  vaccines and pharmaceutical drugs is to keep the
                  public in a constant state of disease.<br>
                  &nbsp;<br>
                  Rost also likened mandatory vaccinations to “child

                  </b>This video shows FEMA agents telling new recruits
                  that our founding fathers were "the first terrorists"
                  and that any activist civilians who are dissatisfied
                  with their current government are considered domestic
                  terrorists by the CIA. The U.S. government, under a
                  program called REX 84, runs approximately 3,708
                  detention camps nationwide. They are all fully
                  operational and ready to recieve prisoners should the
                  US government institute matial law. The Rex 84 Program
                  was initially established as a way to deal with a mass
                  exodus of illegal aliens crossing the Mexican/US
                  border, they would be quickly rounded up and detained
                  in detention centers by FEMA (Federal Emergency
                  Management Agency). Rex 84 allowed many military bases
                  to be closed down and to be turned into prisons.
                  Operation Cable Splicer and Garden Plot are the two
                  sub programs which will be implemented once the Rex 84
                  program is initiated for its proper purpose. Garden
                  Plot is the program to control the population. Cable
                  Splicer is the program for an orderly takeover of the
                  state and local governments by the federal government.
                  FEMA is the executive arm of the coming police state
                  and thus will head up all operations. The Presidential
                  Executive Orders already listed on the Federal
                  Register also are part of the legal framework for this
                  operation. The camps all have railroad facilities as
                  well as roads leading to and from the detention
                  facilities. Many also have an airport nearby. The
                  majority of the camps can house a population of 20,000
                  prisoners. Currently, the largest of these facilities
                  is just outside of Fairbanks, Alaska. The Alaskan
                  facility is a massive mental health facility and can
                  hold approximately 2 million people. INFO ON ONE

                  coffins, look it up in google maps (maps.google.com)

                  is located off Lions Club Road in Madison, GA. They
                  allegedly will not answer inquiries about the
                  purported use of the boxes. These coffins are stacked
                  on pallets, upside down on each other (about 17 per
                  pallet). Apparently the Government is expecting a
                  million people to die relatively soon, and the Atlanta
                  Airport is a major airline traffic hub, probably the
                  biggest in the country, which means Georgia is a prime
                  base to conduct military operations and coordination.
                  It is also the home of the CDC, the Center for Disease
                  Control. One million plastic coffins "just in case
                  something happens". When has our government every been
                  so efficient? There are over 3,700 FEMA (Federal
                  Emergency Management Agency) camps over the United
                  States all fully staffed and operational, just waiting
                  to take in the noncompliant population under the

                  </b>Purdue researchers have observed a way that the
                  brittle nature of ceramics can be overcome as they
                  sustain heavy loads, leading to more resilient
                  structures such as aircraft engine blade coatings and
                  dental implants.<br>
                  <br>
                  While inherently strong, most ceramics tend to
                  fracture suddenly when just slightly strained under a
                  load unless exposed to high temperatures. Structural
                  ceramic components also require high temperatures to
                  form in the first place through a lengthy process
                  called sintering, in which a powdered material
                  coalesces into a solid mass.<br>
                  <br>
                  These issues are particularly problematic for ceramic
                  coatings of metal engine blades intended to protect
                  metal cores from a range of operational temperatures.
                  A study published in Nature Communications
                  demonstrates for the first time that applying an
                  electric field to the formation of yttria-stabilized
                  zirconia (YSZ), a typical thermal barrier ceramic,
                  makes the material almost as plastic, or easily
                  reshaped, as metal at room temperature. Engineers
                  could also see cracks sooner since they start to
                  slowly form at a moderate temperature as opposed to
                  higher temperatures, giving them time to rescue a
                  structure.<br>
                  electric-field Applying an electric field to ceramics
                  during their formation gives them the metal-like
                  characteristics needed for sustaining heavy loads
                  without sudden collapse. (Purdue University

                  “In the past, when we applied a high load at lower
                  temperatures, a large number of ceramics would fail
                  catastrophically without warning,” said Xinghang
                  Zhang, professor of materials engineering. “Now we can
                  see the cracks coming, but the material stays
                  together; this is predictable failure and much safer
                  for the usage of ceramics.”<br>
                  <br>
                  Recent studies have shown that applying an electric
                  field, or “flash,” significantly accelerates the
                  sintering process that forms YSZ and other ceramics,
                  and at much lower furnace temperatures than
                  conventional sintering. Flash-sintered ceramics also
                  have very little porosity, which makes them more dense
                  and therefore easier to deform. None have yet tested
                  the ability of flash-sintered ceramics to change shape
                  at room temperature or increasingly higher
                  temperatures.<br>
                  <br>
                  “YSZ is a very typical thermal barrier coating – it
                  basically protects a metal core from heat,” said
                  Haiyan Wang, Purdue’s Basil S. Turner Professor of
                  Engineering. “But it tends to suffer from a lot of
                  fractures when an engine heats up and cools down due
                  to residual stresses.”<br>
                  ductile-ceram In-situ compression tests revealed that
                  ceramics are almost as ductile as metals at room
                  temperature and increasingly higher temperatures.

                  What allows metals to be fracture-resistant and easy
                  to change shape is the presence of “defects,” or
                  dislocations – extra planes of atoms that shuffle
                  during deformation to make a material simply deform
                  rather than break under a load.<br>
                  <br>
                  “These dislocations will move under compression or
                  tension, such that the material doesn’t fail,” said
                  Jaehun Cho, a graduate research assistant in materials
                  engineering.<br>
                  <br>
                  Ceramics normally don’t form dislocations unless
                  deformed at very high temperatures. Flash-sintering
                  them, however, introduces these dislocations and
                  creates a smaller grain size in the resulting
                  material.<br>
                  <br>
                  “Smaller grains, such as nanocrystalline grains, may
                  slide as the ceramic material deforms, helping it to
                  deform better,” Wang said.<br>
                  <br>
                  Pre-existing dislocations and small grain sizes
                  enabled a flash-sintered YSZ sample thinner than human
                  hair to grow increasingly plastic between room
                  temperature and 600 degrees Celsius when compressed,
                  with cracks starting to slowly spread at 400 degrees
                  as opposed to conventionally sintered YSZ that
                  requires 800 degrees and higher to plastically deform.<br>

                  Improved plasticity means more stability during
                  operation at relatively low temperatures. The sample
                  could also withstand almost as much compression strain
                  as some metals do before cracks started to appear.<br>
                  <br>
                  “Metals can be compressed to 10 or 20 percent strain,
                  no problem, but ceramics often fracture into pieces if
                  you compress them to less than 2-3 percent strain,”
                  Zhang said. “We show that flash-sintered ceramics can
                  be compressed to 7-10 percent without catastrophic
                  fracture.”<br>
                  <br>
                  Even when the sample did begin to crack, the cracks
                  formed very slowly and did not result in complete
                  collapse as would typically happen with conventional
                  ceramics. The next steps would be using these
                  principles to design even more resilient ceramic
                  materials.<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;The researchers would not have been able to
                  perform in-situ experiments of a micron-sized ceramic
                  sample without an in-situ nanomechanical testing tool
                  inside a high-resolution scanning electron microscope
                  equipped with a focused iron beam tool at Purdue’s
                  Life Science Microscopy Center and an FEI Talos 200X
                  electron microscope facility in Purdue’s Materials
                  Engineering facility. Both microscopes were provided
                  by Purdue’s Office of the Executive Vice President for
                  Research and Partnerships and the Colleges of
                  Engineering and Science. Purdue is expecting an even
                  higher-resolution aberration-corrected microscope that
                  the researchers will soon use for future nanomaterials
                  research.</font><br>

          Fertility specialists around the world are now aware that
          since the advent of aspartame for human consumption that human
          and only human sperm quality is precipitously falling.
          Animal's sperm quality has not been so affected even though
          the human has been given the "worst of everything" including
          aspartame and preservatives which animals get little of, if
          any.&nbsp; A preservative by definition has to kill everything
          of a microscopic nature that moves, reproduces or has a
          metabolism; otherwise it couldn't "preserve" things. <br>
          <br>
          The chemical sensitivity engendered by NutraSweet makes the
          damage from toxins like preservatives, perfumes, etc. millions
          of times worse, i.e. the Persian Gulf Syndrome. The other
          factors known to damage sperm quality in humans are tobacco
          smoking and heavy metal poisoning. <br>
          <br>
          The major sperm damaging agents in tobacco smoking just happen
          to be the same as a couple of the major toxins from NutraSweet
          - methyl alcohol and formaldehyde.&nbsp; A pat up-front reason
          that aspartame was kept off the market for forty years after
          it was developed as a chemical warfare agent in “Operation
          Paper Clip" was that it was a patent chelating agent of toxic
          heavy metals, and if a Nutra-sweetened drink was ever poured
          into a metal or ceramic container before consumption it would
          chelate the toxic heavy metals from the container and, in
          chelated form, they would be directly absorbed by the body.
          Aluminum is an example. <br>
          <br>
          The human body will not absorb dietary aluminum but if
          chelated it slips right into the body. Billions of aluminum
          cans of Nutra Sweetened pop are now being consumed annually
          and the establishment is peremptorily destroying any scientist
          who tries to even measure the amount of chelated aluminum
          coming out of the can into the human body or speak out about
          it. <br>
          <br>
          Little surprise that human spermatozoa are on the wane.&nbsp;
          185% of human spermatozoa now produced are genetically
          damaged.&nbsp; They are sluggish, lack motility and are
          fragmented, damaged DNA which scientists attribute to chemical
          and free radicals; and the exposure to electromagnetic
          radiation from the many appliances with which humans surround
          themselves.&nbsp; This poor quality of spermatozoa not only
          yields male infertility but does not bode well for the progeny
          of such sperm which makes procedures such as in vitro
          fertilization of questionable value because the only
          protective factor that was tended to, thus far, lessens damage
          to progeny is the sperm race to the first sperm to get to the
          ovum and fertilize it. <br>
          <br>
          The rest of this article&nbsp; will dwell largely on how the
          genetically damaged sperm are damaged in their fertility and
          ability to win the race to the egg and fertilize it, and will
          include as illustrations other relevant medical problems and
          medical science related to aspartame and its congeners.&nbsp;
          <br>
          <br>
          (Just an aside&nbsp; - don't use sucralose or Splenda it's a
          biochemical analog of DDT that isn't even legal to allow into
          the environment and could hardly be conceived to be any less
          damaging to fertility than aspartame. Sugar - sucrose is the
          safest sweetener, and if you think you must have low calorie
          sweetener, saccharin or Stevia would be the safest although no
          calorie reduced sweeteners are truly safe because all
          non-nutritive sweeteners must be
          neuroexcitotoxins.&nbsp;&nbsp; They must stimulate and damage
          those specialized nerve cells in the tongue to report sugar in
          the food when none is there. Anything that so severely damages
          normal neurologic functioning really doesn't belong in your
          diet...&nbsp; "Just Like Sugar" is safe because it's made
          organically. <br>
          <br>
          Now that aspartame has chemically hyper sensitized a large
          part of our population, even saccharin and Stevia can and do
          sometimes cause severe problems, so the only truly safe course
          is to stay away from all artificial sweeteners.<br>
          <br>
          If something sounds "too good to be true," it not only is not
          true but as in the case, NutraSweet, is a cover for very
          dangerous lies. "High tech" does not carry any guarantee
          whatsoever of safety, and the time has come that your health
          demands that you seek out organically grown, preservative-free
          and additive-free food to protect your body.<br>
          <br>
          By the way, "natural flavorings" on a food ingredient label
          merely means that it is not natural and they are not going to
          tell you what the name of the chemical or additive is! The end
          result is that dumb animals who cannot read labels have
          healthy sperm while "smart"&nbsp; human beings have rapidly
          declining sperm quality and their offspring are now
          experiencing childhood brain cancers and leukemia as well as
          testicular cancers in their youth (just to mention a few of
          the exemplary damages to the progeny of damaged sperm).<br>
          <br>
          Not only does Aspartame toxicity in addition to all its many
          other congeners (minor chemical constituents, especially ones
          that gives a distinctive character to a wine or liquor or is
          responsible for some of its physiological effects) produce the
          same tissue damages that electromagnetic radiation does.<br>
          <br>
          However, the U.S. government, under prompting of the utilities
          industry, set up the U.S. electrical grid on a sixty cycle per
          second system which exposes us&nbsp; in the U.S. to about 16
          times as much electromagnetic radiation than is produced by
          the far safer fifty cycles per second system as are used in
          most developed countries. That is just the basic math of the
          emissions of EMR as the cycle rate of AC conducted electricity
          is increased. This additive EMR effect, of course, makes
          aspartame toxicity even more severe in the U.S.A., but, as I
          will elaborate, Aspartame is bad for everyone everywhere!<br>
          <br>
          My previous article on DORway ("Aspartame is Genocide")
          describes the several well identified and distinct tasks that
          human spermatozoa have to excel at if they are to have any
          chance to win the race to the egg and fertilize it.&nbsp; (
          www.dorway.com data are now on www.mpwhi.com because the site
          was hacked because of its factual info on aspartame.&nbsp;
          Dave Rietz started the web site, and later died from
          aspartame.) <br>
          <br>
          The remarkable increase in spermatic dysfunction since the
          release of Aspartame for human consumption should come as no
          surprise in light of the known toxicities of Aspartame, it's
          components&nbsp; and its congeners (congeners&nbsp; = all the
          problematic compounds, reactions and problems that aspartame
          afflicts on the human organism from the time it is produced
          and on worlds ad infinitum). <br>
          <br>
          As mentioned above, Aspartame damages spermatozoa through many
          toxic mechanisms.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will further elaborate on two
          that are common to the most aspartame epidemics:&nbsp;&nbsp;
          DNA damage especially Mt DNA (Mitochondrial DNA), causing a
          resulting persistent spermatic mitochondrial dysfunction and
          immunologic damage with hypersensitivity/ autoimmunity from
          formaldehyde induced adjuvency /antigenicity, which results in
          the production of anti-sperm antibodies.<br>
          <br>
          Anti-sperm antibodies are a fairly common fertility problem
          ever precious to and in the absence of Aspartame because the
          spermatozoa are anti-genetically distinct from the male who
          produces them. The spermatozoa is a haploid having only half
          of each pair of chromosomes from the male progenitor which
          then are, in the case of each chromosome, either from the
          father or mother on a random basis.&nbsp; Thus, the antigens
          produced are different and distinct from those of the
          progenitor.<br>
          <br>
          Anything that calls this genetic difference to the attention
          of the immune system is likely to endanger the production of
          anti-sperm antibodies. One example is vasectomy, which often
          endangers anti-sperm antibodies because the sperm are impacted
          in the male genital system. Wives often become sensitized to
          their husbands' sperm and the couple thereby rendered
          infertile. Aspartame's well-known tendency to produce
          autoimmunity and hypersensitivity could only anticipate such
          an immune attack on the spermatozoa and afterwards in the
          female. The production of denatured protein by the endogenous
          "nascent"&nbsp; formaldehyde from the obligatory&nbsp;
          metabolism of methanol makes the aspartame derived nascent
          formaldehyde far more potent an adjuvant&nbsp; than the
          exogenous, such as is commonly used as an adjuvant in vaccines
          to make them rapidly and patently
          immunosensitizing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the generation of
          nascent formaldehyde occurs in the cell and inside the
          mitochondrion, the individual subcellular structures such as
          the mitochondria are likely to become discrete targets of the
          ensuing immune holocaust.<br>
          <br>
          Anti-nuclear antibodies, ANA, as in Lupus erythematosus, etc.,
          were one of the first to be recognized, and discussed
          previously in my articles.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anti-mitochondrial
          antibody hepatitis appeared on the medical scene with the
          advent of NutraSweet. Fatty degeneration of the liver was
          renamed "steatohepatitis." Cirrhosis of the liver long noted
          to follow is typically an anti-mitochondrial antibody
          phenomenon.<br>
          <br>
          This does not bode well for the 3% of our young people who now
          have steatohepatitis, thanks to Aspartame. The mitochondria
          suffer more extensive damage from the
          methanol/formaldehyde/formic acid/formate toxic axis than
          other structures because the mitochondria are the minute
          "furnaces" in the cell that&nbsp; much like a furnace in a
          house, function to protect the cell from the processes of
          combustion which otherwise would destroy the cell. The
          mitochondria within their own confines carry out two intensely
          dangerous steps in the metabolic oxidation process essential
          to the production of cellular energy which would and do
          destroy the cell if they escape the confines&nbsp; of the
          mitochondria and which if not have properly because of
          mitochondrial damage or metabolic insult result in the
          production of dangerous super oxide free radicals that damage
          the mitochondria, the DNA, and the cell.<br>
          <br>
          The first of these is to break down fat into radicals that can
          be safely and completely broken down for energy by processes
          such as the one called beta oxidation.&nbsp; The second is to
          harmonize and perform the safe oxidation of these and other
          substrates via agencies such as the citric and cycle which
          yields manageable forms of energy such as that buffered with
          phosphate in ATP that the rest of the cell can then safely
          utilize (a bit like your stove safely burning gas to cook your
          food to make it safe and digestible). When the mitochondrion
          or its DNA is damaged, the cell is functionally impaired and
          endangered by the metabolic processes and the production of
          free radicals. If the mitochondria break down and release
          their enzymes and substrates into the cell it is doomed, just
          as a house would be doomed if the gas from the stove were
          allowed to leak into the house and then ignited by a defective
          stove. If the mitochondrial DNA function is impaired or the
          mitochondria damaged by free radicals&nbsp; the result is a
          vicious circle and the production of even more&nbsp; super
          oxide&nbsp; free radicals.&nbsp; Since on a per mass basis,
          the mitochondria produce at least five times as much nascent
          formaldehyde than the cyta al&nbsp; of the cell, the
          formaldehyde and formate damage is far more concentrated in
          the mitochondria. This correlates with the epidemic of
          mitochondrial related degenerative diseases that are epidemic
          from aspartame use such as cardiomyopathy, cirrhosis of the
          liver, premature graying, diabetes, etc.<br>
          <br>
          The Net DNA is located within the mitochondria where large
          amounts of nascent formaldehyde are formed while the nuclear
          DNA is inside the nucleus where no methanol is metabolized to
          formaldehyde. The mitochondrial DNA, moreover, lacks the
          protective and repair mechanisms afforded the nuclear DNA. The
          only repair processes for mt DNA cross linked by formaldehyde
          or fragmented by formate are excisional; simply deleting
          entire segments that have damaged areas.&nbsp; This makes the
          net damage to mitochondrial DNA thousands of times greater
          than that to nuclear DNA from aspartame poisoning and it makes
          mt DNA damage highly cumulative.<br>
          <br>
          Ultimately, virtually the whole aging process with all of its
          associated changes, results from cumulative damage to mt DNA.
          It is also passed on to subsequent generations of sperm and
          ova in a random distribution through the maternal line which
          explains why some pregnancy losses are due to "blighted ova"
          or "blighted" embryos, and why various children of mothers who
          carry large loads of damaged mt DNA are blighted in a random
          manner some having pervasive developmental disorders such as
          autism while others may have myopathies or obesity/ energy
          deficient syndromes, premature graying, progeria, etc.
          NutraSweet is a cumulative poison in every sense of the word.<br>
          <br>
          Regarding the immunologic damage: another - the accumulation
          of Aspartame congeners bound to tissue components another.
          Other by processes that yield cumulative damage are the
          ongoing destruction of tissues that are not replaceable such
          as the neurons and the production of physical
          barriers&nbsp;&nbsp; to regeneration such as the Alzheimer's
          plague (dealt with in numerous articles)&nbsp; and the
          progression of steatohepatitis to cryptic cirrhosis because of
          scarring and inflammation around the hepatic ducts in these
          young people which leaves no place for properly hepatocytes to
          regenerate and function properly leading to a vicious circle
          of more chemical damages and more inflammation and scarring
          and more tissue disruption ... . Another example of cumulative
          toxicity from Aspartame which can be only made worse&nbsp; by
          ingesting preservatives, food additives, agricultural
          chemicals and exposure to perfumes and environmental
          chemicals.<br>
          <br>
          The spermatozoa produced by the aspartame consumer inherit on
          a random basis from their progenitor varying amounts of
          damaged mitochondria which in turn have their DNA damaged in
          different segments and to varying extents making the sperm
          damage that results quite pleomorphic in manifestation.<br>
          <br>
          A spermatozoon receives only about twenty mitochondria as
          compared to about 100,000 in the ovum which leads to great
          randomness of expression, rather lessening the averaging
          effect. So if&nbsp; as is now common, only 15% leave vigorous
          motility. The greatly excessive numbers of spermatozoa may
          allow for a few to make a good attempt at fertilization; thus,
          is probably why aging fathers seem to pass on only their
          merits and not their defects to their offspring as is quite
          the converse for the female. So far as the individual
          spermatozoa&nbsp; is concerned there is no margin for error.
          If only a few of the twenty mitochondria are defective, the
          spermatozoa will have little chance of spontaneously
          fertilizing an ovum. The spermatic mitochondria exists only to
          provide the energy to wag the tail, propel the sperm and
          energize it to enter the ovum. At that point, if not already
          destroyed&nbsp; in the "go for broke" effort, they are
          destroyed by the ovum, not being allowed to contribute
          anything to the net DNA content of the embryo. [Who says it's
          a man's world?]<br>
          <br>
          Is it any wonder that many&nbsp; men are now showing
          rates&nbsp; of sperm motility&nbsp;&nbsp; as low as 15%?&nbsp;
          The other 85% of spermatozoa already have so much damaged mt
          DNA that they can't even wiggle.<br>
          <br>
          The poisonous sequence resulting of the metabolism of methanol
          does not end with the cross linking and plasticizing&nbsp; of
          tissue components by formaldehyde. DNA and to an even greater
          extent RNA is damaged&nbsp; by this cross linking&nbsp; and is
          not able to replicate or take and give information&nbsp; until
          repaired. The next toxic&nbsp; step is the metabolism of
          formaldehyde to formic&nbsp; acid which then reaches a
          buffered equilibrium with formate in the body.&nbsp;
          Formate&nbsp; [fire ant sting venom], is an even more potent
          mitochondrial DNA poison leading to fragmentation of the DNA
          and the mitochondria it is contained in and subsequently then
          the breakdown and loss of the cell. This "blister agent"
          poison is so severe a hypersensitization&nbsp;&nbsp; agent
          that sensitized adult humans have died from the sting of a
          single fire ant only 1/8" long and weighing only a milligram
          or two; this is illustrative of the sensitization potential of
          Aspartame. The formic acid, as well as its toxic cousins,
          fluoride and cyanide, and its fellow chemical warfare agent,
          nitrogen mustard, are called "blister agents" because they
          kill the cells leaving only "blisters" of dead tissue.
          Fluoride&nbsp; and cyanide share a common toxic mechanism with
          formate.&nbsp; All three block the action of the enzyme,
          "cytochrome oxidase,” thus preventing the mitochondria from
          utilizing oxygen, a bit like carbon monoxide blocking the
          entrance and absorption of oxygen into the red cell, thus
          eventually suffocating the body. <br>
          <br>
          Incidentally, aspartame also blocks the entrance of oxygen
          into the red cell through three mechanisms.&nbsp; One,
          endogenous carbon monoxide is formed&nbsp; during&nbsp; the
          metabolism of formate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the hemoglobin is
          denatured by meth hemoglobinemia, and thirdly the basic cyta
          chrome oxidase-like structure is also present in the "heme" of
          hemoglobin. <br>
          <br>
          Back to the mitochondria: since the action of the enzyme,
          cytochrome oxidase is blocked, only the very partial anaerobic
          metabolism of fats and carbohydrates is possible "glycolysis"
          breaks down the carbohydrates to lactic acid.&nbsp; "Beta
          oxidation" breaks down the fats to keto acids and these&nbsp;
          doses&nbsp; are additive to the acidosis from the formic
          acid/formate. <br>
          <br>
          Not only is the sperm damaged due to the mt DNA damage
          permanent, persistent and cumulative because it is perpetuated
          in the DNA, but also because of the immunological
          hypersensitivities, the anti-sperm immunologic attack is
          likely to return at any time, because the chemical
          hypersensitivity engendered by aspartame will flare it up, on
          exposure to a large array of chemicals this creating yet
          another chronicity of life long duration.<br>
          <br>
          How cruel, that the perfume the lady uses could perpetuate her
          infertility. Cosmetics commonly use over 400 chemicals that
          are carcinogens and over 2500 that are known toxins;&nbsp; all
          of which are absorbed through the skin and upon inhalation.
          These toxins flare up the hyper immune reaction from
          aspartame.&nbsp; What the aspartame experience so vividly
          portrays here is that the cosmetics industry probably wouldn't
          be any better if the government made a pretense of regulating
          it, as the FDA does for food additives, and that we simply do
          not live in the same world that we did before we were exposed
          to aspartame.&nbsp; Not being able to rely on the government,
          nor corporate integrity, we must listen carefully to our
          bodies and carefully scrutinize what we put upon them or into
          them and the environment in which we place ourselves or
          find&nbsp; ourselves.<br>
          <br>
          An interesting example of how aspartame sensitivity can
          produce atypical and perpetuations of disease syndromes is
          presented in my previous article on Lyme Disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;

          Aspartame" by Dr. J. Brua and Dr. A. Bal -&nbsp; "Journal of

          <b><br>
          </b><b>Who is Dr. James Bowen?</b><br>
          <br>
          For 28 years I've alerted the world that aspartame is a
          chemical poison for no reason except to save lives.&nbsp;
          Chapters in 45 countries also work free. I've worked with the
          true experts on aspartame and in my eyes they are all
          extraordinary heroes who have given up much to save
          others.&nbsp; Dr. Bowen is more than a hero.&nbsp; His sister
          said he was a chemical genius at age 9.&nbsp; He is a
          biochemist as well as a physician and surgeon. <br>
          <br>
          The first time I met him in Oregon, he drove me around to show
          me what aspartame had cost him.&nbsp; He had drunk Diet
          Kool-Aid in the desert just after aspartame was approved in
          1981 through the&nbsp; political chicanery of Don
          Rumsfeld.&nbsp; He said if he had seen the formula he never
          would have touched it.&nbsp; After drinking a great deal of
          this drink, in short order, he developed ALS,&nbsp; Lou
          Gehrig's , a horrible disease.&nbsp; As he slurred his words
          from the free methyl alcohol in aspartame, he was put in a
          mental hospital because he was thought to be on alcohol or
          drugs. But off of aspartame, the slurring went away; he became
          normal again and found out what aspartame can do as it
          destroys the body.<br>
          <br>
          As we drove around he pointed to a beautiful home with a fruit
          orchard.&nbsp; It looked like paradise.&nbsp; He said, "That
          was my home I lost to aspartame."&nbsp; Further away he
          pointed out a clinic.&nbsp; He said, "that is where I worked,
          in my clinic that I lost because I exposed aspartame.” Dr.
          Bowen could not be silenced as he tried to help people from
          all walks of life. They took away his license, only because he
          told the people the truth, that aspartame is poison.&nbsp;
          Even without a job or a place to live he kept warning.&nbsp;
          He wrote a letter to the FDA telling them they were mass
          poisoning the public.&nbsp; The agent from the FDA was upset
          over the letter and he insisted she take 29 more cases of
          aspartame poisoning back to the FDA.<br>
          <br>
          To read his letter: it is at the bottom of his note to New
          Mexico State<br>
          Senator Ortiz y Pino when New Mexico's legislature seriously
          considered<br>
          banning aspartame, an effort which was overwhelmed by all of
          the seditious corporate-serving lobbyists imaginable:<br>
          <b>http://www.wnho.net/letter_to_ senator_goyp_concerning_
            aspartame.htm</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Everywhere Dr. Bowen went, he alerted the public and nobody
          could quiet him.&nbsp; So he was put in prison with no
          charges.&nbsp; He has no criminal record because there were no
          charges.&nbsp; It took him 3 years to get
          out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A mole in the FDA gave him some of the
          original studies showing they knew how poisonous aspartame
          is.&nbsp; He said someone broke in and stole all those
          records.<br>
          <br>
          He almost died from the cancer aspartame gave him.&nbsp; Using
          herbs at least cured that.&nbsp; He sent me this handwritten
          article above even from his bedside to save more of the
          public.&nbsp; His entire life, or what he has left of it, has
          been focused on preventing more victims of aspartame
          poisoning.<br>
          <br>
          Don't leave it to somebody else.&nbsp; Save a
          life.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do your part to warn andplay it forward. You
          can see Dr. Bowen in "Sweet Misery: A Poisoned World" on
          YouTube. <b>https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=ZI7_8FDzuJE</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          In conclusion, take the time please to also read Dr. Bowen's
          excellent treatise from 2005, THE LETHAL SCIENCE OF SPLENDA, A
          POISONOUS CHLOROCARBON<br>
          <br>
          <b>http://www.wnho.net/splenda_ chlorocarbon.htm</b><b><br>
          </b><b><br>
          </b><b>Excerpts:</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          "Splenda/sucralose is simply chlorinated sugar; a
          chlorocarbon. Common chlorocarbons include carbon
          tetrachloride, trichlorethelene and methylene chloride, all
          deadly. Chlorine is nature's Doberman attack dog, a highly
          excitable, ferocious atomic element employed as a biocide in
          bleach, disinfectants, insecticide, WWI poison gas and
          hydrochloric acid.<br>
          <br>
          "Sucralose is a molecule of sugar chemically manipulated to
          surrender three hydroxyl groups (hydrogen + oxygen) and
          replace them with three chlorine atoms. Natural sugar is a
          hydrocarbon built around 12 carbon atoms. When turned into
          Splenda it becomes a chlorocarbon, in the family of
          Chlorodane, Lindane and DDT.<br>
          <br>
          "Unlike sodium chloride, chlorocarbons are never nutritionally
          compatible with our metabolic processes and are wholly
          incompatible with normal human metabolic functioning. When
          chlorine is chemically reacted into carbon-structured organic
          compounds to make chlorocarbons, the carbon and chlorine atoms
          bind to each other by mutually sharing electrons in their
          outer shells. This arrangement adversely affects human
          metabolism because our mitochondrial and cellular enzyme
          systems are designed to completely utilize organic molecules
          containing carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and other
          compatible nutritional elements.<br>
          <br>
          "By this process chlorocarbons such as sucralose deliver
          chlorine directly into our cells through normal
          metabolization. This makes them effective insecticides and
          preservatives. Preservatives must kill anything alive to
          prevent bacterial decomposition."<br>

          The MEDICAL TOKEN CURRENCY (MTC), is the mean to interact with
          the blockchain enabled healthcare platform currently under
          development by Docademic. It allows the interested parties to

          that is used to acquire services or products. It encourages
          the use of the blockchain as a trustful repository for
          health-related information and motivates the common user to
          exchange their data for benefits provided by third parties.<br>
          <br>
          It’s a win-win model where all related participants receive
          value in exchange for the token they possess. Hospitals,
          doctors, governments, pharmaceutics and patients from all over
          the world will be able to interact between them exchanging
          data, services and products with the help of MTC as the medium
          to exchange the value of their assets. Additionally, MTC is

          We built a 'clear' series-cell Brown's Gas electrolyzer, using
          the instructions in my Brown's Gas Book Two. Below is a
          picture of the actual electrolyzer used to discover the ExW
          constituent of BG. This electrolyzer has evolved into our ER50
          design.<br>
          <br>
          We found, as we'd expect in a bipolar electrolyzer design,
          oxygen gas being formed on the positive side of each plate and
          hydrogen gas being formed on the negative side of each plate
          but we also saw a third ASTONISHING thing.<br>
          <br>
          We can see (and we see it every time) a THIRD gas being formed
          exactly in the middle BETWEEN the plates . . . in the fluid
          itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no connection between the bubbles
          coming off the plates and the line of bubbles coming out of
          the fluid; the fluid is clear.<br>
          <br>
          You have never seen THIS in your high school physics
          class.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can see gas being formed exactly midway
          BETWEEN the plates in my transparent series-cell
          electrolyzers. It starts as a line of bubbles from the top to
          the bottom of the cell, so solid that it looks like another
          plate. This line of bubbles becomes visible in about three
          seconds from the time the electrolyzer is turned on. The line
          of bubbles then widens till it meets the bubbles being formed
          on the plates and the cell is full of bubbles (this takes
          about eleven seconds).<br>
          <br>
          I think the gas formed in the fluid is a unique component of
          Brown's Gas (BG).&nbsp;&nbsp; My new theory is that Brown's
          Gas contains 6 constituents H2, O2, H2O (as water vapor), H2O
          (as 'electrically expanded water' (ExW)) H and O.&nbsp;&nbsp;

          conversion of water and CO2 to O2 and sugar at a broad range
          of wavelengths and light intensities. These cells also
          metabolize sugars using a respiratory system that functionally
          overlaps the photosynthetic apparatus. In this study, we
          describe the harvesting of photocurrent used for hydrogen
          production from live cyanobacteria. A non-harmful gentle
          physical treatment of the cyanobacterial cells enables
          light-driven electron transfer by an endogenous mediator to a
          graphite electrode in a bio-photoelectrochemical cell, without
          the addition of sacrificial electron donors or acceptors. We
          show that the photocurrent is derived from photosystem I and
          that the electrons originate from carbohydrates digested by
          the respiratory system. Finally, the current is utilized for
          hydrogen evolution on the cathode at a bias of 0.65 V. Taken
          together, we present a bio-photoelectrochemical system where
          live cyanobacteria produce stable photocurrent that can
          generate hydrogen.<br>

          Ferromagnetic (FM) ordering in transition-metal systems
          (solids, surface layers, nanoparticles) arises from partially
          filled d shells. Thus, recent observations of FM Au
          nanoclusters was unexpected, and an explanation has remained
          elusive. Here we report first-principles density-functional
          spin-polarized calculations for Au and Ag nanoclusters. We
          find that the highest-occupied level is highly degenerate and
          partially filled by s electrons with spins aligned according
          to Hund's rule. The nanoclusters behave like "superatoms",
          with the spin-aligned electrons being itinerant on the outer
          shell of atoms.<br>

          FIELD OF INVENTION: This invention is a process of improving
          gold ore porosity prior to lixiviant exposure in the
          traditional heap leaching Merrill Crowe method of gold
          recovery used in worldwide mining operations. Apparatus
          generates low frequency electromagnetic energy to induce a
          periodic vibratory kinetic strain within the metallic
          particles in the ore fragments, thereby destabilizing the
          silica encapsulation surrounding said metallic particles. The
          process directly targets the metals and not the silica matrix,
          it being transparent to said electromagnetic energy. It
          targets the ferromagnetic, diamagnetic and magnetostrictive
          properties of the metals in the ore fragments directly with
          electromagnetic energy from a remote stand off source. Only
          the microscopic metallic particles in the ore respond
          kinetically to the applied electromagnetic fields and
          subsequently generate micro-fractures and fissures in the
          surrounding silica matrix. In turn, these micro- fissures and
          fractures, increase the aqueous porosity of the ore fragments
          and thus improves the ingress of the liquid lixiviant,
          typically, sodium cyanide. The Au and Ag recovery improvements
          are evident after 13 days of bottle roll cyanidation. <br>

              make for better batteries</b><br>
            <b>by Leah Small</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Virginia Commonwealth University researchers have discovered a
          novel strategy for creating superatoms — combinations of atoms
          that can mimic the properties of more than one group of
          elements of the periodic table. These superatoms could be used
          to create new materials, including more efficient batteries
          and better semiconductors; a core component of microchips,
          transistors and most computerized devices.<br>
          <br>
          Batteries and semiconductors rely on the movement of charges
          from one group of atoms to another. During this process,
          electrons are transferred from donor atoms to acceptor atoms.
          Forming superatoms that can supply or accept multiple
          electrons while maintaining structural stability is a key
          requirement for creating better batteries or semiconductors,
          said Shiv Khanna, Ph.D., Commonwealth Professor and chair of
          the Department of Physics in the College of Humanities and
          Sciences. The ability of superatoms to effectively move
          charges while staying intact is attributed to how they mimic
          the properties of multiple groups of elements.<br>
          <br>
          "We have devised a new approach in which one can synthesize
          such metal-based superatoms," Khanna said.<br>
          <br>
          In a paper published in Nature Communications last week,
          Khanna theoretically proved a method of building superatoms
          that could result in the creation of more effective energetic
          materials. The work was funded by the Air Force Office of
          Scientific Research.<br>
          <br>
          "Semiconductors are used in every sphere of life," Khanna
          said. "Superatoms that could substantially enhance electron
          donation would be a significant societal benefit."<br>
          <br>
          Currently, alkali atoms, which form the first column of the
          periodic table, are optimal for donating electrons. These
          naturally occurring atoms require a low amount of energy to
          donate an electron. However, donating more than one electron
          requires a prohibitively high amount of energy.<br>
          <br>
          Khanna and colleagues Arthur Reber, associate professor of
          physics, and Vikas Chauhan, a postdoctoral fellow in the
          Department of Physics, have created a process by which
          clusters of atoms can donate or receive multiple electrons
          using low levels of energy.<br>
          <br>
          "The possibility of having these building blocks that can
          accept multiple charges or donate multiple charges would
          eventually have wide-ranging applications in electronics,"
          Khanna said.<br>
          <br>
          While such superatoms already have been made, there has never
          been a guiding theory for doing so effectively. Khanna and his
          colleagues theorize that organic ligands—molecules that bind
          metal atoms to protect and stabilize them—can improve the
          exchange of electrons without compromising energy levels.<br>
          <br>
          They considered this theory using groups of aluminum clusters
          mixed with boron, carbon, silicon and phosphorous, paired with
          organic ligands. Using computational analysis, they
          demonstrated the cluster would use even less energy to donate
          an electron than francium, the strongest naturally occurring
          alkali electron donor.<br>
          <br>
          "We could use ligands to take any cluster of atoms and turn it
          into either a donor or acceptor of electrons," Khanna said.
          "We could form electron donors that are stronger than any
          element found on the periodic table."<br>

          </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
          Alkali atoms have unusually low ionization energies because
          their electronic structures have an excess electron beyond
          that of a filled electronic shell. Quantum states in metallic
          clusters are grouped into shells similar to those in atoms,
          and clusters with an excess electron beyond a closed
          electronic may also exhibit alkali character. This approach
          based on shell-filling is the way alkali species are formed as
          explained by the periodic table. We demonstrate that the
          ionization energy of metallic clusters with both filled and
          unfilled electronic shells can be substantially lowered by
          attaching ligands. The ligands form charge transfer complexes
          where the electronic spectrum is lifted via crystal field like
          effect. We demonstrate that the effect works for the weakly
          bound ligand, N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidone (EP?=?C6H11NO), and that
          the effect leads to a dramatic lowering of the ionization
          energy independent of the shell occupancy of the cluster.<br>

          The physical and chemical properties of cluster systems at the
          subnano and nanoscale are often found to differ from those of
          the bulk and display a unique dependence on size, geometry,
          and composition. Indeed, most interesting are systems which
          have properties that vary discontinuously with the number of
          atoms and composition, rather than scale linearly with size.
          This realm of cluster science where “one atom makes a
          difference” is undergoing an explosive growth in activity, and
          as a result of extensive collaborative activities through
          theory at VCU and experiment at PSU, our groups are recognized
          as pioneers in this area in which we have been active for many
          years. Herein we provide an overview of the field with primary
          focus on our joint undertakings which have spawned the
          superatom concept, giving rise to a 3-D periodic table of
          cluster elements and the prospect of using these as building
          blocks of new nanoscale materials with tailored properties.<br>

              Effects on Reactivity</b><br>
            <b>Arthur C. Reber and Shiv N. Khanna</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Conspectus</b><br>
          The relative role of electronic and geometric effects on the
          stability of clusters has been a contentious topic for quite
          some time, with the focus on electronic structure generally
          gaining the upper hand. In this Account, we hope to
          demonstrate that both electronic shell filling and geometric
          shell filling are necessary concepts for an intuitive
          understanding of the reactivity of metal clusters. This work
          will focus on the reactivity of aluminum based clusters,
          although these concepts may be applied to clusters of
          different metals and ligand protected clusters. First we
          highlight the importance of electronic shell closure in the
          stability of metallic clusters. Quantum confinement in small
          compact metal clusters results in the bunching of quantum
          states that are reminiscent of the electronic shells in atoms.
          Clusters with closed electronic shells and large HOMO–LUMO
          (highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied
          molecular orbital) gaps have enhanced stability and reduced
          reactivity with O2 due to the need for the cluster to
          accommodate the spin of molecular oxygen during activation of
          the molecule.<br>
          <br>
          To intuitively understand the reactivity of clusters with
          protic species such as water and methanol, geometric effects
          are needed. Clusters with unsymmetrical structures and defects
          usually result in uneven charge distribution over the surface
          of the cluster, forming active sites. To reduce reactivity,
          these sites must be quenched. These concepts can also be
          applied to ligand protected clusters. Clusters with ligands
          that are balanced across the cluster are less reactive, while
          clusters with unbalanced ligands can result in induced active
          sites. Adatoms on the surface of a cluster that are bound to a
          ligand result in an activated adatom that reacts readily with
          protic species, offering a mechanism by which the defects will
          be etched off returning the cluster to a closed geometric
          shell. The goal of this Account is to argue that both
          geometric and electronic shell filling concepts serve as
          valuable organizational principles that explain a wide variety
          of phenomena in the reactivity of clusters.<br>
          <br>
          These concepts help to explain the fundamental interactions
          that allow for specific clusters to be described as
          superatoms. Superatoms are clusters that exhibit a
          well-defined valence. A superatom cluster’s properties may be
          intuitively understood and predicted based on the energy
          gained when the cluster obtains its optimal electronic and
          geometric structure. This concept has been found to be a
          unifying principle among a wide variety of metal clusters
          ranging from free aluminum clusters to ligand protected noble
          metal clusters and even metal–chalcogenide ligand protected
          clusters. Thus, the importance of electronic and geometric
          shell closing concepts supports the superatom concept, because
          the properties of certain clusters with well-defined valence
          are controlled by the stability that is enhanced when they
          retain their closed electronic and geometric shells.<br>
