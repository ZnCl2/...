          as good as the car you dream of possessing.<br>
          <br>
          2. When you start looking into a microscope or doing some
          experiment you are asking nature certain questions; therefore
          look and listen only to what nature has to tell you, and not
          what the head of your bacteriological department expects you
          to see. Forget for awhile what you have learned in school. It
          may be wrong. After having carefully looked and listened, then
          compare what you have seen with what you have learned.<br>
          <br>
          3. Don't try to be smart and clever. Be humble!<br>
          <br>
          4. Do not try being a scientific worker when you are afraid of
          what your neighbor might say to what you have seen. Forget
          your neighbor for awhile.<br>
          <br>
          5. Do not try to "control" experiments. Understand them first,
          then per form them faithfully according to their exact
          description. Never alter an experimental setup before having
          understood it and having become capable of handling it well.
          Later on any change will be only fruitful, but not at the
          start.<br>
          <br>
          6. Trust your senses fully if you are sure of yourself. But
          control the results of your sense impressions by devices which
          are independent of your senses. First rely on your feeling
          heat at the orgone energy accumulator's inner walls. Then use
          a thermometer to confirm the feeling.<br>
          <br>
          7. Never try to develop ideas about something you have never
          seen.<br>
          <br>
          8. Judge any thing or process from the standpoint of its own
          existence and functioning. Never try to judge an airplane by
          what you know about a pressure cooker. And don't forget: A
          steam locomotive is much more than a wheelbarrow. You won't
          believe it, but it is true that some "authorities" try to
          judge an alive earth bion from what they know about a
          Gram-stained staphylococcus, or to judge the cosmic orgone
          energy from what they know about "static," instead of the
          other way around.<br>
          <br>
          9. If you learn of a new basic function in nature be ready to
          revise your well set ideas.<br>
          <br>
          10. Do not try to hide your mistakes, speak about them
          frankly, and be proud of knowing your mistakes. Do not try to
          be perfect. Your mistakes are your most reliable signposts on
          your road.<br>
          <br>
          11. In research it is of paramount importance to know exactly
          what you do not know.<br>
          <br>
          12. An "authority" is the one who knows what he is dealing
          with, and not the one who never has learned what he thinks he
          already knows. A bacteri ologist is no authority on bions
          unless he has diligently studied bions, and a cancer
          researcher is not an authority on orgonomic cancer research
          beyond his own field unless he has diligently learned to see
          the developments of protozoa from disintegrating tissue,
          T-Bacilli, etc.<br>

          <br>
          Nature has begun to fight back against the vast piles of filth
          dumped into its soils, rivers and oceans by evolving a
          plastic-eating bacteria â the first known to science.<br>
          <br>
          In a report published in the journal Science, a team of
          Japanese researchers described a species of bacteria that can
          break the molecular bonds of one of the worldâs most-used
          plastics - polyethylene terephthalate, also known as PET or
          polyester.<br>
          <br>
          The Japanese research team sifted through hundreds of samples
          of PET pollution before finding a colony of organisms using
          the plastic as a food source.<br>
          <br>
          Further tests found the bacteria almost completely degraded
          low-quality plastic within six weeks. This was voracious when
          compared to other biological agents; including a related
          bacteria, leaf compost and a fungus enzyme recently found to
          have an appetite for PET.<br>
          <br>
          âThis is the first rigorous study â it appears to be very
          carefully done â that I have seen that shows plastic being
          hydrolyzed [broken down] by bacteria,â said Dr Tracy Mincer, a
          researcher at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.<br>
          <br>
          The molecules that form PET are bonded very strongly, said
          Prof Uwe Bornscheuer in an accompanying comment piece in
          Science. âUntil recently, no organisms were known to be able
          to decompose it.â<br>
          <br>
          In a Gaian twist, initial genetic examination revealed the
          bacteria, named Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, may have evolved
          enzymes specifically capable of breaking down PET in response
          to the accumulation of the plastic in the environment in the
          past 70 years.<br>
          <br>
          Such rapid evolution was possible, said Enzo Palombo, a
          professor of microbiology at Swinburne University, given that
          microbes have an extraordinary ability to adapt to their
          surroundings. âIf you put a bacteria in a situation where
          theyâve only got one food source to consume, over time they
          will adapt to do that,â he said.<br>
          <br>
          âI think we are seeing how nature can surprise us and in the
          end the resiliency of nature itself,â added Mincer.<br>
          <br>
          The bacteria took longer to eat away highly crystallised PET,
          which is used in plastic bottles. That means the enzymes and
          processes would need refinement before they could be useful
          for industrial recycling or pollution clean-up.<br>
          <br>
          âItâs difficult to break down highly crystallised PET,â said
          Prof Kenji Miyamoto from Keio University, one of the authors
          of the study. âOur research results are just the initiation
          for the application. We have to work on so many issues needed
          for various applications. It takes a long time,â he said.<br>
          <br>
          A third of all plastics end up in the environment and 8m
          tonnes end up in the ocean every year, creating vast
          accumulations of life-choking rubbish.<br>
          <br>
          PET makes up almost one-sixth of the worldâs annual plastic
          production of 311m tons. Despite PET being one of the more
          commonly recycled plastics, the World Economic Forum (WEF)
          reports that only just over half is ever collected for
          recycling and far less actually ends up being reused.<br>
          <br>
          Advances in biodegradable plastics and recycling offer hope
          for the future, said Bornscheuer, âbut [this] does not help to
          get rid of the plastics already in the environmentâ.<br>
          <br>
          However the potential applications of the discovery remain
          unclear. The most obvious use would be as a biological agent
          in nature, said Palombo. Bacteria could be sprayed on the huge
          floating trash heaps building up in the oceans. This method is
          most notably employed to combat oil spills.<br>
          <br>
          This particular bacteria would not be useful for this process
          as it only consumes PET, which is too dense to float on water.
          But Bornscheuer said the discovery could open the door to the
          discovery or manufacture of biological agents able to break
          down other plastics.<br>
          <br>
          Palombo said the discovery suggested that other bacteria may
          have already evolved to do this job and simply needed to be
          found.<br>
          <br>
          âI would not be surprised if samples of ocean plastics
          contained microbes that are happily growing on this material
          and could be isolated in the same manner,â he said.<br>
          <br>
          But Mincer said breaking down ocean rubbish came with dangers
          of its own. Plastics often contain additives that can be toxic
          when released. WEF estimates that the 150m tonnes of plastic
          currently in the ocean contain roughly 23m tonnes of
          additives.<br>
          <br>
          âPlastic debris may have been less toxic in the whole
          unhydrolyzed form where it would ultimately have been buried
          in the sediments on a geological timescale,â said Mincer.<br>
          <br>
          Beyond dealing with the plastic already fouling up the
          environment, the bacteria could potentially be used in
          industrial recycling processes.<br>
          <br>
          âCertainly, the use of these microbes or enzymes could play a
          role in remediation of plastic in a controlled reactor,â said
          Mincer.<br>
          <br>
          Miyamotoâs team suggested that the environmentally-benign
          constituents left behind by the bacteria could be the same
          ones from which the plastic is formed. If this were true and a
          process could be developed to isolate them, Bornscheuer said:
          âThis could provide huge savings in the production of new
          polymer without the need for petrol-based starting materials.â
          According to the WEF, 6% of global oil production is devoted
          to the production of plastics.<br>
          <br>
          But the plastics industry said the potential for a new
          biological process to replace or augment the current
          mechanical recycling process was very small.<br>
          <br>
          âPET is 100% recyclable,â said Mike Neal, the chairman of the
          Committee of PET Manufacturers in Europe. âI expect that a
          biodegradation system would require a similar engineering
          process to chemical depolymerisation and as such is unlikely
          to be economically viable,â he said.</font><b><font

          outside a bottle-recycling facility can break down and
          metabolize plastic. The proliferation of plastics in consumer
          products, from bottles to clothing, has resulted in the
          release of countless tons of plastics into the environment.
          Yoshida et al. show how the biodegradation of plastics by
          specialized bacteria could be a viable bioremediation strategy
          (see the Perspective by Bornscheuer). The new species,
          Ideonella sakaiensis, breaks down the plastic by using two
          enzymes to hydrolyze PET and a primary reaction intermediate,
          eventually yielding basic building blocks for growth.<br>

            <br>
          </font></b><font color="#000000">Poly(ethylene terephthalate)
          (PET) is used extensively worldwide in plastic products, and
          its accumulation in the environment has become a global
          concern. Because the ability to enzymatically degrade PET has
          been thought to be limited to a few fungal species,
          biodegradation is not yet a viable remediation or recycling
          strategy. By screening natural microbial communities exposed
          to PET in the environment, we isolated a novel bacterium,
          Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, that is able to use PET as its
          major energy and carbon source. When grown on PET, this strain
          produces two enzymes capable of hydrolyzing PET and the
          reaction intermediate, mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid.
          Both enzymes are required to enzymatically convert PET
          efficiently into its two environmentally benign monomers,
          terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol.<br>

            BACKGROUND:<br>
            <br>
          </font></b><font color="#000000">Cutinases are serine
          hydrolases that degrade cutin, a polyester of fatty acids that
          is the main component of plant cuticle. These biocatalysts
          have recently attracted increased biotechnological interest
          due to their potential to modify and degrade polyethylene
          terephthalate (PET), as well as other synthetic polymers.<br>
        </font><b><font color="#000000"><br>
            METHODS:<br>
            <br>
          </font></b><font color="#000000">A cutinase from the
          mesophilic fungus Fusarium oxysporum, named FoCut5a, was
          expressed either in the cytoplasm or periplasm of Escherichia
          coli BL21. Its X-ray structure was determined to 1.9Ã
          resolution using molecular replacement. The activity of the
          recombinant enzyme was tested on a variety of synthetic esters
          and polyester analogues.<br>
        </font><b><font color="#000000"><br>
            RESULTS:<br>
            <br>
          </font></b><font color="#000000">The highest production of
          recombinant FoCut5a was achieved using periplasmic expression
          at 16Â°C. Its crystal structure is highly similar to previously
          determined Fusarium solani cutinase structure. However, a more
          detailed comparison of the surface properties and amino acid
          interactions revealed differences with potential impact on the
          biochemical properties of the two enzymes. FoCut5a showed
          maximum activity at 40Â°C and pH 8.0, while it was active on
          three p-nitrophenyl synthetic esters of aliphatic acids (C(2),
          C(4), C(12)), with the highest catalytic efficiency for the
          hydrolysis of the butyl ester. The recombinant cutinase was
          also found capable of hydrolyzing PET model substrates and
          synthetic polymers.<br>

          </font></b><font color="#000000">1. Your microscope should be
          as good as the car you dream of possessing.<br>
          <br>
          2. When you start looking into a microscope or doing some
          experiment you are asking nature certain questions; therefore
          look and listen only to what nature has to tell you, and not
          what the head of your bacteriological department expects you
          to see. Forget for awhile what you have learned in school. It
          may be wrong. After having carefully looked and listened, then
          compare what you have seen with what you have learned.<br>
          <br>
          3. Don't try to be smart and clever. Be humble!<br>
          <br>
          4. Do not try being a scientific worker when you are afraid of
          what your neighbor might say to what you have seen. Forget
          your neighbor for awhile.<br>
          <br>
          5. Do not try to "control" experiments. Understand them first,
          then per form them faithfully according to their exact
          description. Never alter an experimental setup before having
          understood it and having become capable of handling it well.
          Later on any change will be only fruitful, but not at the
          start.<br>
          <br>
          6. Trust your senses fully if you are sure of yourself. But
          control the results of your sense impressions by devices which
          are independent of your senses. First rely on your feeling
          heat at the orgone energy accumulator's inner walls. Then use
          a thermometer to confirm the feeling.<br>
          <br>
          7. Never try to develop ideas about something you have never
          seen.<br>
          <br>
          8. Judge any thing or process from the standpoint of its own
          existence and functioning. Never try to judge an airplane by
          what you know about a pressure cooker. And don't forget: A
          steam locomotive is much more than a wheelbarrow. You won't
          believe it, but it is true that some "authorities" try to
          judge an alive earth bion from what they know about a
          Gram-stained staphylococcus, or to judge the cosmic orgone
          energy from what they know about "static," instead of the
          other way around.<br>
          <br>
          9. If you learn of a new basic function in nature be ready to
          revise your well set ideas.<br>
          <br>
          10. Do not try to hide your mistakes, speak about them
          frankly, and be proud of knowing your mistakes. Do not try to
          be perfect. Your mistakes are your most reliable signposts on
          your road.<br>
          <br>
          11. In research it is of paramount importance to know exactly
          what you do not know.<br>
          <br>
          12. An "authority" is the one who knows what he is dealing
          with, and not the one who never has learned what he thinks he
          already knows. A bacteri ologist is no authority on bions
          unless he has diligently studied bions, and a cancer
          researcher is not an authority on orgonomic cancer research
          beyond his own field unless he has diligently learned to see
          the developments of protozoa from disintegrating tissue,
          T-Bacilli, etc.<br>

          provide the best balance of your daily nutritional
          requirements â and they found a few surprises.<br>
          <br>
          Imagine the ideal food. One that contains all the nutrients
          necessary to meet, but not exceed, our daily nutrient demands.
          If such a food existed, consuming it, without eating any
          other, would provide the optimal nutritional balance for our
          body. Such a food does not exist. But we can do the next best
          thing.<br>
          <br>
          The key is to eat a balance of highly nutritional foods, that
          when consumed together, do not contain too much of any one
          nutrient, to avoid exceeding daily recommended amounts.<br>
          <br>
          Scientists studied more than 1,000 foods, assigning each a
          nutritional score. The higher the score, the more likely each
          food would meet, but not exceed your daily nutritional needs,
          when eaten in combination with others.<br>
          <br>

          </font></b><font color="#000000">A new DNA structure inside
          human cells known as the âi-motifâ, has been identified by
          scientists.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          This form resembles a twisted âknotâ of DNA, instead of the
          well-known double helix first described by James Watson and
          Francis Crick.<br>
          <br>
          Lab work has previously suggested the existence of DNA in this
          form, but this is the first time it has been observed in
          living cells.<br>
          <br>
          The scientists are not exactly sure what the function the
          i-motif is, but they suspect it is involved with the process
          of âreadingâ DNA sequences and converting them into useful
          substances.<br>
          <br>
          âWhen most of us think of DNA, we think of the double helix,â
          said Professor Daniel Christ, a molecular biologist at the
          Garvan Institute of Medical Research, who co-led the study
          describing the new findings. <br>
          <br>
          âThis new research reminds us that totally different DNA
          structures exist â and could well be important for our cells.â<br>
          <br>
          While i-motifs have previously been observed under artificial
          conditions in laboratories, prior to this work it was unclear
          whether they existed in living cells.<br>
          <br>
          The findings of Professor Christ and his team were published
          in the scientific journal Nature Chemistry...<br>

          four-stranded âknotâ of DNA,â said Professor Marcel Dinger,
          the studyâs other co-leader. âIn the knot structure, C
          [cytosine] letters on the same strand of DNA bind to each
          other â so this is very different from a double helix, where
          âlettersâ on opposite strands recognise each other, and where
          Cs bind to Gs [guanines].â..</font><b><font color="#000000"><br>

      <font color="#660000"><font color="#000000">What is a âMockupâ?<br>
          And what does the SEG Mockup demonstrate?<br>
          First, we must look at John Searl's claims.<br>
          Then isolate each claim, prove it out, and demonstrate it.<br>
          There are many concepts the SEG Mock Up proves.<br>
          Letâs look at it from an electrical engineering point of
          view... The factors isolated in the demonstration units are:<br>
          â¢ To show 3 vectors of forces. Magnetic (axial), Motion
          (Orbital), and Electric (Radial).<br>
          â¢ To show the motorability of the design. (how smoothly it
          moves)<br>
          â¢ To show the rollers spin together as one, stay on track and
          remain equidistant. (while not attached to any crank shafts,
          armatures, belts, commutators, etc.)<br>
          â¢ To show the eddy current repulsion after a certain RPM which
          makes for the roller to hover AND spin.<br>
          â¢ To show simultaneous attraction and repulsion between roller
          and stator, resulting in frictionless magnetic bearings.<br>
          â¢ To show unique waveforms imprinted on the magnet rings.<br>
          â¢ To show the reason why the rollers spin without touching the
          surface is because of the waveforms.<br>
          â¢ To show why the rollers move in an orbit is because a radial
          electric current is present.<br>
          â¢ To show that, indeed, unique waveforms exist in
          magnetization and can be duplicated repeatedly.<br>
          â¢ To show the homopolar/unipolar quality of the design with no
          need to alternate poles to maintain 360Ë rotation. (homopolar
          refers to the electric field. Not some magnetic âmonopoleâ)<b><br>
          </b>Claim #1: The SEG is a valid Motor/Generator Design.<br>
          What do you need in a viable motor/generator?<br>
          You need relative motion. That means 1 part needs to be
          stationary (stator) and another part must move around (rotor/
          magnetic rollers)...<br>

      A hat salesman from Hollywood, Chester Holifield, got elected to

      <div align="center"><b>Junk DNA may actually be essential for
          human survival </b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      When biologists first examined the landscape of human genes they
      were perplexed by the, seemingly useless pieces of DNA that
      floated in the structure. It was labelled âjunk DNAâ and the name
      stuck.<br>
      <br>
      However, new research suggests it may not be junk at all. In fact
      the DNA, which is now called satellite DNA, plays a crucial role
      in holding the genome together and, by extension, the survival of
      much of life on Earth.<br>
      <br>
      The study, which has been published in the journal eLife, outlines
      that the âjunkâ is actually essential for the cellâs survival
      because it performs the vital function of ensuring that
      chromosomes bundle correctly inside the cellâs nucleus.<br>
      <br>
      âWe were not quite convinced by the idea that this is just genomic
      junk,â lead author on the study, Yukiko Yamashita, said. âIf we
      donât actively need it, and if not having it would give us an
      advantage, then evolution probably would have gotten rid of it.
      But that hasnât happened.â<br>
      <br>
      Yamashita and her colleagues decided to see what would happen if
      cells could not use the satellite DNA.<br>
      <br>
      Because it exists in long, repetitive sequences, the researchers
      could not simply mutate or cut the entire satellite DNA out of the
      genome so they removed a small part of the DNA from fruit fly
      cells.<br>
      <br>
      They quickly found that the germ cells, which ultimately develop
      into sperm or eggs, were losing their ability to form a complete
      nucleus and were dying.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      âItâs like forming a bouquet,â explains Yamashita, who is also a
      research professor at the University of Michigan. âThe protein has
      multiple binding sites. So it can bind onto multiple chromosomes
      and package them together in one place, preventing individual
      chromosomes from floating out of the nucleus.â<br>
      <br>
      The researchers carried out similar experiments using mouse cells
      and got the same findings, again the cells began to die off.<br>
      <br>
      The results lead Yamashita and her colleagues to conclude that
      so-called Junk DNA is essential for cellular survival, not just in
      model organisms, but for any species that embeds DNA into the
      nucleus â even humans.<br>

      Hello Jeff - Now we find prion disease in Dromedary aka Camels in
      Algeria.&nbsp; I am sure prion disease will be found in other
      parts of the world among camels.&nbsp;&nbsp; More studies will be
      needed and testing for Mad Camel disease will be needed at

      identified as having Mad Camel disease.&nbsp; That is the tip of
      the iceberg, I am sure.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Prions cause fatal and transmissible neurodegenerative diseases,
      including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, scrapie in small
      ruminants, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).<br>
      <br>
      After the BSE epidemic, and the associated human infections, began
      in 1996 in the United Kingdom, general concerns have been raised
      about animal prions.<br>
      <br>
      We detected a prion disease in dromedary camels (_Camelus
      dromedarius_) in Algeria. Symptoms suggesting prion disease
      occurred in 3.1 percent of dromedaries brought for slaughter to
      Ouargla abattoir in [2015-2016]. We confirmed diagnosis by
      detecting pathognomonic neurodegeneration and disease-specific
      prion protein (PrPSc) in brain tissues from 3 symptomatic animals.
      Prion detection in lymphoid tissues is suggestive of the
      infectious nature of the disease. PrPSc biochemical
      characterization showed differences with BSE and scrapie.<br>
      <br>
      Our identification of this prion disease in a geographically
      widespread livestock species requires urgent enforcement of
      surveillance and assessment of the potential risks to human and
      animal health. ...<br>

      There are some basic truisms that must be established before
      presenting the case that American society is about to be overrun
      by a combination of the same terrorist forces and paramilitary
      gorups that have overrun Mexico. These forces would be the end
      result of the marriage between the cartels and the most infamous
      terrorists in the world. Mix in the Russians and American Deep
      State support and one has the makings of a quite an army, a Red
      Dawn Army.<br>
      <br>
      In previous articles during the course of April 2018, available
      through the search engine at the Common Sense Show (ie search
      term-Red Dawn), I established the fact that a two phase invasion
      of America, was coming out of Central American paramilitary base
      camps and it was going to engulf America.<br>
      <br>
      As previously cited, phase one of this invasion force will
      consists of massive terrorism and its forces will be well-trained
      MS-13 and ISIS allies which have been merged together by the
      Sanchez-Peredes drug cartel out of Peru, the largest in the world.
      There is Russian money and influence as well Deep State and George
      Soros influence and resources associated with these groups.<br>
      <br>
      Phase two of the Red Dawn invasion is designed to attack America
      after the country has engaged the bulk of its military in
      conflicts on foreign soil, thus leaving America less protected.<br>
      <br>
      As I begin to build this case, we can clearly see that Mexico is
      the clear victim of phase one violence. The cartels and their
      MS-13 allies control the entire Mexican political system. America
      is next.<br>

      Randy god becomes heroic Christian martyr<br>
      <br>
      In a curious recycling of ancient piety, Priapus metamorphosed
      into a noble Christian saint!<br>
      <br>
      Supposedly, the first bishop of Lyons was "Pothinus", who (in his
      90th year, no less) was cruelly martyred by that dastardly Marcus
      Aurelius, actually the most sublime of Roman emperors.<br>
      <br>
      His death, along with a claimed fifty others, became a cause
      cÃ©lÃ¨bre of Christian heroics, the "martyrs of Lyons" â though we
      are indebted to the 4th century propagandist Eusebius as our
      witness to this doubtful episode.<br>
      <br>
      Pothin's name in time became Foutin, giving rise to the verb
      foutre (âto fuckâ). Shrines to Saint Foutin sprang up all over the
      region.<br>
      <br>
      Scrapings from the saint's wooden phallus were made into a

      the center of said gyroscope. A support structure connects the
      gyroscope to the vehicle. Gyroscopes are used to cause the first
      gyroscope to follow a path which involves at least one
      precession-dominated portion and at least one
      translation-dominated portion, wherein in the precession-dominated
      portion, the mass of the first gyroscope is transferred and
      associated movement of the mass of the remainder of the system in
      a given direction occurs, and, in the translation-dominated
      portion, the mass of the first gyroscope moves with an associated
      second movement of the mass of the remainder of the system in
      substantially the opposite direction, wherein the movement owing
      to the translation-dominated portion and is larger than the

      </b><br>
      This work describes performed experiments on device-device and
      operator-device interactions at distances of &gt;1 km, &gt;100 km
      and &gt;10000 km. Experimental setup involves several types of
      receiving sensors and transmitting optical generators as well as a
      group of human operators. We analyzed the structure of setup,
      establishing a connection between receiver and emitter, and
      multiple effects appeared. The experiments suggest a common
      character of operator- and device- interactions that point to
      possible âneuro-quantum mechanismsâ underling both systems. This
      approach replicates and extends early experiments from 80x and
      90x, and can be considered as a novel unconventional communication
      system.<br>

      Is the CDC Trustworthy in Overseeing Vaccine Safety?<br>
      <br>
      Do you trust the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to oversee
      vaccine safety when they have an annual budget of over $4 billion
      to purchase vaccines from drug companies? In 2015, they want to
      increase that amount by another half a billion dollars (see chart
      above).<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Brian Hooker says the CDC should not be trusted to oversee
      vaccine safety, and after 10 years of fighting legal battles with
      the CDC via Freedom of Information requests to secure raw data on
      vaccine safety studies, he now has solid evidence to back up his
      claim of fraud within the CDC...<br>

      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Tensor Rings can utilize Cubit fractions and combinations of
      1/8, 1/4, 1/2<br>
      <br>
      â144 MHZ Cubit~aka Sacred or Royal Cubit. Comes from the King's
      Chamber of the Great Pyramid. Slim Spurling's Cubit.&nbsp; Known
      for its work in the Physical.<br>
      20.63 inches ~ 52.4 cm<br>
      <br>
      177 MHZ Cubit~ aka Lost Cubit.&nbsp; Discovered by Hans Becker and
      Slim Spurling.&nbsp; This Cubit length was created out of a
      mathematical formula.&nbsp; The 177 MHz Tensor Field is known for
      its connection with the Etheric and Emotional bodies.<br>
      23.49 inches ~ 59.67 cm<br>
      <br>
      188 MHZ Cubit~ Synergizes well with the 144 and 177.&nbsp;
      Resonates with and decalcifies the Pineal, helps release Programs
      and Beliefs.âââ Brought to us by a Master Dowser. Was also given
      to Slim Spurling before he passed; his widow calls it the
      Empowerment Cubit.<br>
      28.85748 inches ~ 73.3 cm<br>
      <br>
      333 MHZ Cubit~ Changes the color of sound and works well with
      Sound Healing. Brought in by a Master Dowser. It seems it may have
      a relation to King Solomon's Temple. Works as a Straight Line
      Cubit.<br>
      39.3131568 inches ~ 99.8554 cm <br>
      <br>
      764 MHZ Cubit~ One side of the 27" Ringâ has a Black Whole, or
      absence of energy, while the other side creates a tornado style
      field.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tornado field always travels toward
      magnetic North.&nbsp; You can change the "polarity" if the output
      simply by intention.&nbsp;&nbsp; Possible uses of teleportation
      and tornado wrestling.&nbsp; Pulls in and transmutes dense
      energy.&nbsp; Brought in by a Master Dowser.<br>
      77.55836 inches ~ 196.9982344 cm<br>
      <br>
      Galactic Cubit~ Two dowsers connect to Source and ask for a Cubit
      length they could use- they received something that works unlike
      any other Tensor Ring. The Galactic Cubit connects with the Higher
      Soul Self and works with all of the Soul's Aspect.&nbsp; At each
      twist you will find a Tube Torus.&nbsp; Each individual tube torus
      pulls in positive and negative energy, sending it out as a
      non-dualistic energy ~ a whole and complete energy.&nbsp; These
      tiny toroids also act as DNA scrubbers. Soul is the consciousness
      that is in control of frequencies and Light that come through the
      ring.<br>
      61.8728 cm <br>
      <br>
      Standard Teotihuacan Unit (STU)-&nbsp; There is much information
      about this cubit measure: where it came from, the creation of the
      etheric template, and what it can do.&nbsp; The Balance and
      Harmony Ring is the result.&nbsp; Here are the details.<br>
      <br>
      The Rings cut from this Cubit can be used in 1/4, 1/2, etc., just
      as standard Tensor Rings,<br>
      as well as in the 1/3 increments to create a working Ring. <br>
      41.7086614" or 105.94 cm<br>

      <div align="center"><b>The Rediscovery of Ancient Technology</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Slim Spurling Re-Discovered Tensor Ring technology in 1991.
      Slim knew of John Wheelerâs extensive work with closed loops. John
      Archibald Wheeler, who coined the term black hole, came up with
      the mathematical theory of the âTensorâ field, which is found
      inside the ring. Wheeler called the field created by the loop a
      tensor field. Hans Becker, an astrophysicist who extensively
      tested the Spurling Rings, found the ring to oscillate at 144MHZ,
      a harmonic of the speed of light. He said that âWhen you create a
      closed loop coil, energy begins to flow and the laws of physics go
      out the window. They may be the simplest, most efficient source of
      energy there isâ¦gathering it and condensing it freely from space.â<br>
      <br>
      Tensor fields create an anti-gravity field. Grebennikovâs work
      supports this hypothesis as well as Muellerâs global scaling,
      where Tensor Rings emit a harmonic to a specific gravitational
      wave. We also demonstrate cancellation of electromagnetic fields
      within a Ring through GDV photoimaging.<br>
      <br>
      Tensor Fields restructure electromagnetics to where they are
      beneficial to the human body.&nbsp; A recent bio-feedback study
      with the Cell Phone Tab shows that using a smart phone with the
      Cell Tab affixed to the phone case, aligns Chakras and energy
      bodies, as well as makes organs function better.<b>..<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>This is an excellent article that explains what we are up
      against.&nbsp; When I first started exposing aspartame in 1990 I
      thought all you needed were the facts, and didn't realize to what
      depths industry would go to keep a chemical poison on the market
      to cause mass poisoning of its users.,&nbsp; When we tried to get
      aspartame banned in New Mexico the lobbyists, flacks, and front
      groups just flowed out of their swamp.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      These creatures would tell a lie even if the truth would do. <br>
      <br>
      Almost 30 years ago I didn't realize the FDA operated above the
      law to the extent it does.&nbsp; Even a top FDA scientist, Dr.
      Adrian Gross, let the Senate know that aspartame is illegally on
      the market because it violates the Delaney Amendment, as it causes
      cancer. In 2009 several scientists wrote to Obama saying they were
      broken and feared reprisals if they spoke out. I&nbsp; was
      astonished that companies like Calorie Control&nbsp; would operate
      to defend the manufacturer no matter what the facts showed. [ <b>http://www.wnho.net/mh_

      Front Groups:&nbsp; Take the American&nbsp; Council on Science and
      Health.&nbsp; Michael F. Jacobson&nbsp;&nbsp; (Center for Science
      in the Public's Interest)&nbsp; said of ACSH, '"This organization
      promotes confusion among consumers about what is safe and what
      isn't.... ACSH is using a slick scientific veneer to obscure and
      deny truths that virtually everyone else agrees with."&nbsp; As
      Ralph Nader said of the organization:&nbsp;&nbsp; "ACSH is a
      consumer front organization for its business backers. It has
      seized the language and style of the existing consumer
      organizations, but its real purpose, you might say, is to glove
      the hand that feeds it." <br>
      <br>
      Then you have a research front group, ILSI.&nbsp; The Institute of
      Life Sciences.&nbsp; The "US Right To Know" people said:&nbsp;
      "But some independent scientists and food industry activists
      consider ILSI to be a front group aimed at advancing the interests
      of the food industry. It was founded by Coca-Cola scientific and
      regulatory affairs leader Alex Malaspina in 1978. ILSI has had a
      long and checkered relationship with the World "... As one
      aspartame victim who worked for ILSI told me, "You have to pay to
      play"! After all, even though Donald Rumsfeld forced approval of
      this poison the aspartame industry knew when it started causing
      problems independent researchers would start doing studies
      themselves and then it would be obvious to the world.&nbsp; Now if
      a university or study institute needs research funds&nbsp; they
      know where to go.&nbsp;&nbsp; Somebody always has their hand out.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Ralph Walton did research for 60 Minutes and showed that 92%
      of all independent studies on aspartame showed the problems.&nbsp;
      Then if you eliminate 6 that the FDA had something to do with and
      one pro-industry summary,&nbsp; 100% of independent scientific
      peer reviewed studies show the problems that aspartame triggers or
      precipitates. Here is that research:&nbsp; <b>http://www.
        lightenyourtoxicload.com/wp- content/uploads/2014/07/Dr-
        Walton-survey-of-aspartame- studies.pdf</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The next question would have to be, if 100% of independent
      studies, peer reviewed, show aspartame not to be safe, how can
      100% of industry funded studies show aspartame to be safe?&nbsp;
      The only way to get the facts is if you only consider independent
      studies that have no motive.&nbsp;&nbsp; Industry's original
      studies were the target of indictment for fraud, so if you had to
      cheat once why would anyone not consider them doing it again? <br>
      <br>
      There has even been a study on bias of industry studies:&nbsp; <b>https://www.smh.com.au/

          Hydrogen Electrolysizer</b><br>

      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Here, revealed in print for the very first time, are many of
      the super secret insidertechniques to absolutely and totally ruin
      the performance of an onboard auto or truck hydrogen electrolysis
      generator.<br>
      <br>
      Please note that while any one of these by themselves is clearly a
      fatal flaw, using them in combination is strongly recommended to
      be absolutely sure your device ends up utterly and truly
      worthless...<br>
      <br>
      1. Completely ignore the inescapable fact that increasing the
      electrical load on an alternator disproportionately increases its
      mechanical input load on the engine.<br>
      2. Completely ignore the inescapable fact that the primary product
      of an onboard electrolysizer is useless low grade heat. Which can
      create a DYNAMIC BRAKE that is the equivalent of leaving your
      emergency brake partially set at all times.<br>
      3. Use an ordinary fan belt whose maximum additional mechanical
      load capability is a few hundred watts at most.<br>
      4. Use an ordinary alternator whose efficiency will be lucky to
      approach 45 percent near full loading.<br>
      5. Leave off the crucial computer controlled switchmode voltage to
      current converter so that most of the electrical energy gets
      burned up in the alternator source rather than being sent to its
      electrolysis load.<br>
      6. Make the electrolysizer way too small so it has to operate in
      its lossy exothermic region, rather than being thermoneutral or
      endothermic.<br>
      7. Be sure to use stainless steel electrodes with their low energy
      passivated surfaces and their hydrogen overvoltage of iron instead
      of platinum.<br>
      8. Always make "not even wrong" pulse measurements by failing to
      use true rms techniques of acceptable crest factors.<br>
      9. Studiously avoid any and all labwork. Especially any that is
      objectively and competently done with sophisticated enough
      instruments.<br>
      10. Ignore the "Carnot Squared" ludicrosity of sending the SAME
      energy through a highly inefficient heat engine TWICE.<br>
      11. Ignore the fact that cascading system losses will make the
      stored hydrogen energy a joke compared to the input. Perhaps a
      recoverable 70 watts mechanical energy for every 1000 watts of
      mechanical input.<br>
      12. Fail to provide the 31.25 liters per minute required for the
      5% hydrogen injection needed at 50 horsepower.<br>
      13. Charge more than the $13 total per percent mpg improvement
      that is demanded for a reasonable return on your investment.<br>
      14. Ignore the EPA law that makes it a felony to tamper with any
      emission control device. Such as is inevitable with hydrogen
      injection...<br>

      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Rocks could hold key to carbon storage and improved global
      climate projections<br>
      <br>
      For centuries, the prevailing science has indicated that all of
      the nitrogen on Earth available to plants comes from the
      atmosphere. But a study from the University of California, Davis,
      indicates that more than a quarter comes from Earth's bedrock.<br>
      <br>
      The study, to be published April 6 in the journal Science, found
      that up to 26 percent of the nitrogen in natural ecosystems is
      sourced from rocks, with the remaining fraction from the
      atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      Before this study, the input of this nitrogen to the global land
      system was unknown. The discovery could greatly improve climate
      change projections, which rely on understanding the carbon cycle.
      This newly identified source of nitrogen could also feed the
      carbon cycle on land, allowing ecosystems to pull more emissions
      out of the atmosphere, the authors said.<br>
      <br>
      "Our study shows that nitrogen weathering is a globally
      significant source of nutrition to soils and ecosystems
      worldwide," said co-lead author Ben Houlton, a professor in the UC
      Davis Department of Land, Air and Water Resources and director of
      the UC Davis Muir Institute. "This runs counter the centuries-long
      paradigm that has laid the foundation for the environmental
      sciences. We think that this nitrogen may allow forests and
      grasslands to sequester more fossil fuel CO2 emissions than
      previously thought."...<br>

      </b>A family from Limpopo is mourning the death of three sons who
      took unimaginable risk to cure an embarrassing family problem,
      they wrestled a river monster and got killed, as reported by
      mzansi life below. <br>
      <br>
      The quest to become bedroom warriors turned into tragedy after a
      Limpopo family lost three sons in a crocodile attack. A family
      known for its bedroom curse of failing to perform when it matters
      most (during intercourse) fell in deadly jaws of the strongest
      reptile after a Sangoma gave them muthi and instructed them to go
      and rape a female crocodile. The old aged weeping father who lost
      three sons during the ritual reveals that the muthi was supposed
      to act as a shield that weakens the reptiles after being dissolved
      in stagnant water to make it easy for his boys to catch and
      complete the ritual by taking turns to rape a crocodile.<b><br>

      Moses Murandu, from Zimbabwe, grew up watching his father use

      The treatment is thought to work because applying sugar to a wound

          Pope Francis</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Francis Bergoglio, a Jesuit, has been admonished, warned
      several times to distance himself from heresies. However, he
      obstinately rejects any repentance. He continues to cause extreme
      offence not only to the believers of the Roman Catholic Church but
      also to all Christians and unbelievers. By abusing the supreme
      church authority through heresies, he intensely promotes the
      self-destruction of the Church, in matters of both faith and
      morals. It concerns the following heresies: Francis Bergoglio <br>
      <br>
      1) denied the universally valid moral norms in the exhortation
      Amoris Laetitia. <br>
      <br>
      2) did not distance himself from heresies of syncretism with
      paganism which place the redemptive death of Christ on the same
      level as the sacrifice to pagan gods, de facto demons. He thus
      destroys true mission. <br>
      <br>
      3) promotes a so-called dynamic approach to the deposit of faith,
      whereby he makes heresies equal with the apostlesâ doctrine. <br>
      <br>
      4) neither identified nor condemned Vatican II heresies promoting
      syncretism with paganism and declaring Allah to be the same God as
      Yahweh (LG 16, Nostra Aetate declaration). <br>
      <br>
      5) participates in crimes against humanity of the New World Order
      (NWO). <br>
      <br>
      6) works towards dechristianization of Europe by intensively
      promoting Islamization. <br>
      <br>
      7) is silent on the stealing of children by the juvenile justice
      system. <br>
      <br>
      8) approves and promotes homosexualism and other gender
      deviations, which is contrary to the teaching of the Scriptures
      and Tradition. <br>
      <br>
      For these heresies, Francis Bergoglio excluded himself from the
      Catholic Church. Therefore, the Byzantine Catholic Patriarchate,
      by authority of the apostolic and prophetic office, in the name of
      the Triune God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, declares
      Francis Bergoglio to be excommunicated from the Catholic Church.
      Unless the person concerned shows repentance at least in the hour
      of death, he will be eternally condemned. Every Catholic who is in
      unity with him in heresy is likewise excommunicated from the
      Catholic Church. Therefore, let the priests and bishops no longer
      mention the name of this excommunicated apostate Francis in the
      Divine Liturgy. <b><br>

      </b>The EMF Protection paint is a conductive paint that blocks RF

      colour of the paint is black and is applied as regular paint. In
      most&nbsp; cases one layer of the EMF Paint is sufficient for
      blocking EMF, however, applying second coat will provide even
      belter protection from EMF. Once the EMF paint has dried, a

      <b>Abstract<br>
        <br>
      </b>We report injectable nanoengineered hemostats for enhanced
      wound healing and tissue regeneration. The nanoengineered system
      consists of the natural polysaccharide, ?-carrageenan (?CA),
      loaded with synthetic two-dimensional (2D) nanosilicates.
      Nanoengineered hydrogels showed shear-thinning characteristics and
      can be injected for minimally invasive approaches. The injectable
      gels can be physically crosslinked in presence of monovalent ions
      to form mechanically strong hydrogels. By controlling the ratio
      between ?CA and nanosilicates, compressive stiffness of
      crosslinked hydrogels can be modulated between 20 and 200?kPa.
      Despite high mechanical stiffness, nanocomposite hydrogels are
      highly porous with an interconnected network. The addition of
      nanosilicates to ?CA increases protein adsorption on nanocomposite
      hydrogels that results in enhance cell adhesion and spreading,
      increase platelets binding and reduce blood clotting time.
      Moreover, due to presence of nanosilicates, a range of therapeutic
      biomacromolecules can be deliver in a sustain manner. The addition
      of nanosilicates significantly suppresses the release of entrap
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and facilitate in vitro
      tissue regeneration and wound healing. Thus, this multifunctional
      nanocomposite hydrogel can be used as an injectable hemostat and
      an efficient vehicle for therapeutic delivery to facilitate tissue
      regeneration.<b><br>

      Date: Apr 4, 2018 8:30 AM<br>
      <br>
      Dear fellow scientist,<br>
      <br>
      I send you this mail because you have shown some interest in
      Alternative Physics Theories and I think that this new paper will
      be of your interest.<br>
      <br>
      We present a new semiclassical âHidden variable theoryâ of the
      electron. This new model is an extension of both the Parson Ring
      Model and the Hestenes Zitterbewegung Model.<br>
      <br>
      This work is published in a peer reviewed journal (Progress in
      Physics) and we anticipate a new feature of the electron that is
      not predicted by Quantum Mechanics. This prediction is the
      existence of a Electron Toroidal Moment with a value of 10^(-40)

      <b> </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      âA new semiclassical model of the electron with helical solenoid
      geometry is presented. This new model is an extension of both the
      Parson Ring Model and the Hestenes Zitterbewegung Model. This
      model interprets the Zitterbewegung as a real motion that
      generates the electronâs rotation (spin) and its magnetic moment.
      In this new model, the g-factor appears as a consequence of the
      electronâs geometry while the quantum of magnetic flux and the
      quantum Hall resistance are obtained as model parameters. The
      Helical Solenoid Electron Model necessarily implies that the
      electron has a toroidal moment, a feature that is not predicted by
      Quantum Mechanics. The predicted toroidal moment can be tested
      experimentally to validate or discard this proposed model.â<br>

        <b>by Moray B. King</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Physicist King expands, with diagrams, on how zero-point water
      energy can be used with the tremendous fluctuations of electrical
      field energy embedded within the fabric of space. King explains
      how gas emitted from popular water electrolyzer projects manifests
      unusual energetic anomalies, which include vaporizing tungsten
      when used in a welding torch, and running internal combustion
      engines on small quantities of the gas. Some claim to run
      generators in closed loop fashion solely on the gas from the
      electrolyzer, which is powered solely from the generator. Most
      investigators believe the energy comes from burning hydrogen. A
      hypothesis is proposed that the dominant energy does not come from
      hydrogen, but rather it comes from charged water gas clusters,
      which activate and coherently trap zero-point energy. Cavitating
      the water in the electrolyzers appears to maximize gas and energy
      production. Packed with diagrams, patents and photos.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      Tesla claimed to have developed his own physical principle
      regarding matter and energy that he started working on in 1892 and
      in 1937, at age 81, claimed in a letter to have completed a
      "dynamic theory of gravity" that "[would] put an end to idle
      speculations and false conceptions, as that of curved space" This
      theory is based on the work and ideas of Tesla although the main
      manuscript is lost many of his ideas and concepts on a
      gravitational theory can still be found. This video gives us an
      objective understanding of the electromagnetic force explaining
      gravity as a secondary force to the EM force (Tesla dynamic theory
      of gravity). In this theory electrical potential, gravitational
      potential and human potential are all linked by one universal
      process! Also curved space is never empty because electric charge
      is an innate part of matter, there is always electromagnetic
      fields. Nikola Tesla: "There is nothing endowed with lifeâfrom
      man, who is enslaving the elements, to the nimblest creatureâin
      all this world that does not sway in its turn. Whenever action is
      born from force, no matter how small it is the cosmic balance is
      upset and the universal motion results".<br>

      Originally called the Magic Cube, the puzzle was licensed by Rubik
      to be sold by Ideal Toy Corp. in 1980 via businessman Tibor Laczi
      and Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer, and won the German Game of the
      Year special award for Best Puzzle that year. As of January 2009,
      350 million cubes had been sold worldwide making it the world's

          Fusion-Powered Fighter Jet</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Lockheed Martin has secretly been developing a game-changing
      compact nuclear fusion reactor that could potentially fit into a
      fighter jet. The Maryland-based defense contractor recently
      obtained a patent associated with its design for a fully compact
      fusion reactor, after filing for the patent in 2014.<br>
      <br>
      If the latest patent from the defense company serves as a
      benchmark, nuclear fusion technology could revolutionize the
      aeronautic industry and eventually begin the quantum leap from
      fossil fuels to compact fusion reactors for the industry.<br>
      <br>
      According to CBS Washington, the prototype system would be the
      size of a normal shipping container but capable of producing
      enough energy to power 80,000 residential homes or a Nimitz-class
      aircraft carrier, sometime in the next year or so.<br>
      <br>
      The patent, tilted âEncapsulating Magnetic Fields for Plasma
      Confinement,â is dated Feb. 15, 2018. CBS indicates that Skunk
      Works, also known as Lockheed Martinâs Advanced Development
      Programs or its advanced R&amp;D group, has reportedly been
      developing the compact fusion reactor since about 2014, with
      latest reports suggesting the technology could be ready for
      production by 2019...<br>

      A border line mental case that Jeff Rense has on frequently is a
      character name Tim Rifat, alias "Terrible Tim."&nbsp; This guy
      points out a unique fact of nuclear physics that is not an
      immediate problem but does not bode well for humanity in a "worst
      case scenario."<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      All Tesla Motor company's batteries use Cobalt59.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      One of the most instantly deadly radiation elements isCobalt
      60.&nbsp; Separate, Cobalt 59 is harmless.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      But if Cobalt 59 is exposed to a nuclear flash from detonation of
      Plutonium 239, the Cobalt 59 becomes Cobalt 60.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      In the chaos of a nuclear blast, this would spread Cobalt60 into
      the stratosphere and circumvent the world by jet stream and
      tradewinds.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      So Terrible Tim claims Elon Musk, by selling so many Teslacars
      into high value target locations, has sealed the doom of humanity
      and iswhy he wants to go to Mars.&nbsp; Each Tesla Model S
      contains 32 pounds of Cobalt 59.&nbsp; It only takes a gram of
      Cobalt 60 to be lethal.<br>

      Today is Easter, an important Christian holiday. But it is not
      marked on the calendar that is part of the Apple software that
      came with my Apple computer lap top. Today is also April Fools
      day, and that is marked on the Apple-supplied calendar. For
      Appleâs programmers, April Fools Day trumps Easter.<br>
      <br>
      How can it be that an American company, Apple, can remember to
      mark on the calendar Cinco de Mayo (May 5), Mexicoâs commemoration
      of a Mexican army victory of the French in the Battle of Puebla in
      1862, but not Easter?<br>
      <br>
      Hanukkah on December 13, but not Easter?<br>
      <br>

      Eid al-Adha, the Muslim Sacrifice Feast, on August 20, but not
      Easter?<br>
      <br>
      Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, on September 10, but not
      Easter?<br>
      <br>
      Yom Kippur, Jewish holiday on September 19, but not Easter?<br>
      <br>
      Ashura, Muslim holiday, on September 20, but not Easter?<br>
      <br>
      Diwali, the Hindu Festival of Lights, on November 7, but not
      Easter?<br>
      <br>
      This is how our culture is stolen and our memories are dimmed. In
      my day the spring holiday was known as Easter Holiday. Today it is
      known as Spring Break, a time for drunken and sexually promiscuous
      bacchanal on Floridaâs beaches.<br>
      <br>
      The United States was founded as a Christian nation. It did not
      mean that a citizen had to be a Christian or be punished or sent
      off in exile if they were not. It meant simply that you had to
      consider others and to be able to look yourself in the mirror in
      the morning. Christianity gave American culture a moral tone. Yes,
      I know, there were many hypocrites and many evil things done, but
      there was a standard by which to judge. Where is a standard today
      to judge Washingtonâs destruction entirely on the basis of lies of
      numerous countries and millions of peoples in the 21st century?
      Except for a handful of people, nothing is said critical of
      Washingtonâs massive ongoing war crimes. The American media
      celebrates the war crimes.<br>
      <br>
      Today an American, or one in the important cities, cannot look
      himself or herself in the mirror unless they have ripped off some
      trusting or powerless person or persons. Judging by the carnage
      that Americans have inflicted in the 21st century alone on
      Afghans, Iraqis, Libyans, Syrians, Pakistanis, Somalias, Serbians,
      and, by supporting Israel and Saudi Arabia, on Palestinians and
      Yemenis, Americans have ceased to consider others except as
      unexceptional and dispensable people, who can be driven into the
      ground without upsetting any Americanâs concept of right and
      wrong.<br>
      Indeed, American âdiplomatsâ tell other governments, âdo as I say
      or we will bomb you into the Stone Age.â<br>
      <br>
      Little wonder the second most important Christian
      celebrationâEasterâhas disappeared from Apple Computerâs calendar
      and that one or two atheists and a handful of Jews have managed to
      prevent Christmas from any longer being a public celebration.
      Today Christmas has been reduced to a spending spree.<br>
      <br>
      A country without a unifying moral culture is no longer a country.
      Yet, what pretends to be a country, the US, is being led into war
      against Russia, a real country. There is no chance whatsoever of
      the US prevailing in the oncoming war.<br>

      <br>
      The shameless liars that comprise the US media intentionally
      exaggerated the marchers against âgun violanceâ by four times the
      acutal number.<br>
      <br>
      Why?<br>
      <br>
      Why are the media presstitutes involved in advocacy of agendas and
      not in reporting factual news?<br>
      <br>
      Recent polls show that a majority of Americans believe that gun
      ownership makes people safer. Americans do not believe that people
      should be denied safety because of an occasional nutcase or a
      staged shooting to advance the gun control agenda. Indeed, they
      wonder who is behind the gun control agenda. They wonder about the
      dumbshits who are protesting the Second Amendment instead of
      Washingtonâs rush into conflict with Russia...<br>

      <br>
      Primary water, the original source of our oceans, is still being
      created by geological forces. That water, usually in a potable
      form, comes to the earthâs surface in thousands of places, some
      well known like Jericho and Bahrain where it has provided drinking
      water for thousands of people for thousands of years. It pours
      into deep mines all over the world. Hundreds of houses on the
      rocky shores of Maine get their fresh water from wells drilled
      into the shoreline granite. Copenhagen gets all its water from a
      few wells. In Northern Europe, water that can be tapped by wells
      that do not depend on aquifers is called âground waterâ. The
      hallmark of new, or primary, water springs and wells is that they
      provide water at constant temperature and flow...<br>

      </b><b>Subject: RE: immigration of Alexander Frolov to US</b><b><br>
      </b>Mar 26," 2018 9:01 AM<br>
      <br>
      ...Hereâs my suggestion. After butting my head against the
      bureaucratic wall at DOE and NRC for more than 25 years, I have
      learned some things about the process. We are all asking the same
      question â if we could neutralize radioactive waste materials,
      would we? We keep hearing the same answer â of course, we would.
      We are failing to ask the next and perhaps more important question
      â If we did, what would happen? I know what would happen â it has
      happened repeatedly to me and others who have worked with me over
      the past 25 years. In 2005 our team was threatened with arrest
      under FISA as terrorists unless we stopped developing high level
      nuclear waste remediation technologies. In 2010, after W was
      elected and Chu became Secây of DOE, I was invited to make a
      closed-door classified presentation to all 26 department heads at
      DOE regarding the methodology we developed for remediating
      radioactive emissions propagated by spent nuclear fuel wastes.
      After a yearâs preparation, the briefing was summarily cancelled
      by order of the Secây himself - DOEâs nuclear contractors refused
      to have the briefing and the validated evidence that a real
      solution had been developed become a matter of record at DOE.<br>
      <br>
      When I was co-moderating the Fukushima Solutions conference with
      Dr. John Apsley at Univ Texas @ Austin in April 2014, we released
      HD satellite images that proved weapons grade plutonium pencils
      were being stored in the cooling pond beneath Daiichi #4. In spite
      of the fact that the Mainichi Shimbun published an official
      response issued by Japanâs Ministry of Nuclear Affairs, admitting
      that our conclusions were totally correct and verifying that 376
      Kg of Pl-239 pencils were stored at Daiichi #4, the only thing
      that happened was that the nuke contractors built a tent over the
      top of the pond so no one else could take photographic images of
      what was going on down there. <br>
      <br>
      The bottom line is that the nuke world is politically and
      economically controlled by the community of multi-national nuclear
      contractors. They have been converting depleted uranium to weapons
      grade plutonium on-site for decades â civilian power plants are
      the feed stock for this abomination. <br>
      <br>
      We have been summarily prevented from solving the nuclear waste
      problem because our solution encroaches on their political and
      economic turf. Itâs simply not going to happen by anyone, by any
      means in the foreseeable future. Game over. <br>
      <br>
      Does that mean we have to throw up our hands and give up? No. I
      have been working with others (you may know them) to provide an
      industrial scale solution to the problem of NORM. The oil and gas
      industry spends billions each year complying with regulations and
      propping up their spin-doctored PR bubble relative to this issue.
      We know how to remediate NORM with virtually 100% effectiveness â
      a demonstration project that puts the technique and the data in a
      form that could be independently tested and validated could be
      done quickly and cost-effectively. I donât care where the project
      is executed or who does the work as long as we can work together
      to make it happen. FYI, I have attached a copy of the grant
      proposal submitted to Dr. John Reid and the FRIM group for your
      review and comment. <br>
      <br>
      If we attack the problem at the NORM level, several barriers can
      be avoided with a high probability of economic success. 1st, the
      oil &amp; gas industry needs a real solution. They have a problem
      that none of their propeller heads have figured out how to
      resolve. The industry is coming underincreasing pressure to
      develop a solution. 2nd, by solving the NORM problem, we avoid
      running afoul of the nuke community â they donât give a damn about
      NORM because it cannot be weaponized. 3rd, a scalable treatment
      system would save the industry several billion dollars a year.
      Thatâs not trivial even in the wildcat world of hydraulic
      fracturing. So, please take a look at the this proposal â if you
      want to get in the game, this plan could be hammered together,
      funded and executed by the end of the year. Then we would have
      something to talk about.<br>

      from occurring in new plants by connecting a 1.5 volt battery
      between the roots and the stem, which indicates that an
      atmospheric DC voltage has gone missing in the area of my
      home.&nbsp; I am now interested to see if I can reverse the
      retardation effects in previously electromagnetic radiation

          Newfound 'organ' had been missed by standard method for
          visualizing anatomy</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A newfound organ, the interstitium, is seen here beneath the top
      layer of skin, but is also in tissue layers lining the gut, lungs,
      blood vessels, and muscles. The organ is a body-wide network of
      interconnected, fluid-filled compartments supported by a meshwork
      of strong, flexible proteins...<br>
      <br>
      Researchers have identified a previously unknown feature of human
      anatomy with implications for the function of all organs, most
      tissues and the mechanisms of most major diseases.<br>
      <br>
      Published March 27 in Scientific Reports, a new study co-led by an
      NYU School of Medicine pathologist reveals that layers of the body
      long thought to be dense, connective tissues -- below the skin's
      surface, lining the digestive tract, lungs and urinary systems,
      and surrounding arteries, veins, and the fascia between muscles --
      are instead interconnected, fluid-filled compartments.<br>
      <br>
      This series of spaces, supported by a meshwork of strong
      (collagen) and flexible (elastin) connective tissue proteins, may
      act like shock absorbers that keep tissues from tearing as organs,
      muscles, and vessels squeeze, pump, and pulse as part of daily
      function...<br>
      <br>
      The study findings are based on newer technology called
      probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy, which combines the
      slender camera-toting probe traditionally snaked down the throat
      to view the insides of organs (an endoscope) with a laser that
      lights up tissues, and sensors that analyze the reflected
      fluorescent patterns. It offers a microscopic view of living
      tissues instead of fixed ones....<br>
      <br>
      <b>A New Bodily Space</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      For the current study, the team collected tissue specimens of bile
      ducts during twelve cancer surgeries that were removing the
      pancreas and the bile duct. Minutes prior to clamping off blood
      flow to the target tissue, patients underwent confocal microscopy
      for live tissue imaging.<br>
      <br>
      Once the team recognized this new space in images of bile ducts,
      they quickly recognized it throughout the body, wherever tissues
      moved or were compressed by force. The cells lining the space are
      also unusual, perhaps responsible for creating the supporting
      collagen bundles around them, say the authors. The cells may also
      be mesenchymal stem cells, says Theise, which are known to be
      capable of contributing to the formation of scar tissue seen in
      inflammatory diseases. Lastly, the protein bundles seen in the
      space are likely to generate electrical current as they bend with
      the movements of organs and muscles, and may play a role in
      techniques like acupuncture, he says...<br>

          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>Banning the closed loop nuclear fuel cycle put an end to
          America's free energy future and created a nuclear nightmare
          that was never supposed to happen.<br>
          <br>
          Americans have been told their nuclear waste must go
          somewhere. Americans have been told their spent reactor fuel
          needs to be stored inside a mountain in the desert, where it
          will sit as a threat and menace to the world for millions of
          years. Americans have been told there is nothing they can do
          about it. But what if they have been told a lie? What if that
          "spent fuel" was not spent at all? What if a technology
          existed which allowed the same fuel to be used over and over,
          twenty times in fact, and expended so fully that fuel rods
          would be safe enough to handle directly out of the reactor?
          Think any "spent fuel pools" would be full? And even if this
          technology never existed,<br>
          <br>
          What if foreign nations, (France was one) offered to buy this
          fuel from America for billions of dollars only to have the
          American Government refuse the offer for no reason at all?
          Certainly allowing France to have it would solve the problem
          of getting rid of it. And the final question, WHY would the
          American Government want so much nuclear material sitting
          around the country - enough to make countless atomic bombs -
          only to have it become a threat to America's national
          security? Could it be that for many years America has not had
          a legitimate government, and instead has had a band of
          invaders in power who have intentionally set America up for a
          fall? After reading this report, I believe you will be
          inclined to think so.<b><br>
            <br>
          </b>This report consists of hard scientific fact and even
          harder answers.<br>
          <br>
          During my journey of discovery in my investigation into the
          Fukushima disaster, I interviewed an 85 year old nuclear
          engineer who worked in the nuclear industry during America's
          glory days, an engineer who earned GE over 100 patents. He was
          one of the engineers who designed Fukushima, so naturally when
          conducting an investigation into such a disaster a journalist
          would want that type of reference. He was surprised when my
          prior study of reactor systems was so thorough that he had no
          information about Fukushima I did not already dig up, and he
          was very surprised when I told him details about the inner
          workings of his own reactor design he never expected anyone in
          the media to know.<br>
          <br>
          When I started to think I was going to walk away with nothing
          new, he began to talk about an entirely different subject. He
          began his new direction in the discussion with the phrase "My
          team succeeded in closing the nuclear loop, and Carter banned
          our miracle with an executive order<br>
          <br>
          Here is what followed that introductory line, and an enormous
          reason why Americans need to seriously question the current
          government structure and possibly start over.<br>
          <br>
          "I started in the American nuclear program all the way back at
          the time of the Manhattan project, and have been involved in
          reactor design and nuclear engineering my whole life. There
          was one answer we all searched for, and it was how to close
          the nuclear loop.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b>When a reactor such as a boiling water reactor uses fuel,
          the waste products, which are highly radioactive isotopes that
          have a different fission characteristic than the original
          fuel, build up in the fuel and change the nature of the
          nuclear reaction. A reactor such as a boiling water reactor
          can only use the fuel until it gets contaminated by these
          isotopes enough to change the nature of the nuclear reactions
          taking place. The reaction environment inside a boiling water
          reactor is only one such environment which will work to
          trigger a chain reaction, and if that spent fuel is put into a
          reactor made from different materials, those materials can
          favor the burning of the isotopes which interfere with the
          chain reactions in the boiling water reactor and use these
          interfering isotopes as fuel until they are consumed. After
          this process, which restores the fuel to it's original state
          is complete, the fuel can go back into the boiling water
          reactor and used as new with no reprocessing - the exact same
          rods can be exchanged between reactors.<br>
          <br>
          We perfected the second reactor design which used liquid
          sodium as a coolant and the reactor ran much hotter - 1100
          farenheit as opposed to 550 in a boiling water reactor. The
          liquid sodium circulated inside the reactor instead of water,
          with the heat of the reaction being removed from the system by
          a heat exchanger which produced steam outside the reactor for
          use in producing electricity. The temperature difference and
          coolant characteristics in the complimentary reactor
          facilitated the burning of the isotopes, and you got to use
          both sides of the reaction - the boiling water reactor
          produced electricity while producing unwanted isotopes, and
          the sodium cooled reactor produced electricity while burning
          the unwanted isotopes out. This process could be repeated 20
          times, and when it was finished the fuel was DEAD and no
          longer hazardous because all of it's radiological potential
          was used up. It was a clean energy dream come true, and Carter
          banned it by executive order!"<b><br>
            <br>
          </b>He specifically stated that the burn down was so complete
          that the spent fuel was safe to handle directly with bare
          hands, and needed no special care or maintenance at all, and
          after I questioned him about exactly how safe, said you could
          safely sleep on it. I questioned him several times, saying he
          must be exaggerating, but he said ALL radiological potential
          was used, and the fuel was completely inert at the end of the
          final cycle.<br>
          <br>
          Many people know about the liquid sodium breeder reactor
          developed by General Electric in the late 1970's but few
          people know the real story about this reactor, which this
          engineer developed. To back stab the public image of this
          reactor, it was stated that it's rods would stick and that
          liquid sodium was too dangerous to use as a coolant. But this
          engineer, the man who developed it, stated that this media
          campaign was a pure psy op which like many things the media
          and government says had no truth to it at all.<br>
          <br>
          He then went on to lament about what a waste of money it was
          to have the technology banned because nuclear fuel is
          expensive and they were only able to use it to about five
          percent of its total potential without implementing this
          technology. He lamented the fact that his life's greatest
          accomplishment got banned for no good reason, and it was a
          tremendous waste of money to not use the technology his team
          developed. Electricity would have been cheap. So cheap that
          homes would not have been heated with oil or natural gas,
          electricity would have been the only sensible choice.
          Furthermore, with a reduction in the price of electricity by
          at least 10X, electric cars would have quickly become a
          standard.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b>This would have been America's free energy future, with
          the only real cost being maintenance of infrastructure.<br>
          <br>
          He was sad that we were now paying too much for electricity. I
          guess that's how an engineer thinks. He had read my article
          about Fukushima and liked it, so it is an easy guess that his
          eyes were open to the global conspiracy. But I think he missed
          the obvious in what he said.<br>
          <br>
          Here is what I think about this technology being banned, and
          it has nothing to do with preservation of resources or free
          energy.<br>
          Nuclear reactors are huge. They have an enormous amount of
          nuclear material in them. One boiling water reactor core the
          size of the ones at Fukushima, which have a thermal potential
          of three gigawatts and an electrical generating capacity of
          one gigawatt can easily hold enough fissionable material to
          make many atomic bombs. And with the technology that makes
          re-using that fuel illegal, it builds up in the cooling pools
          at a rate of 25 tons per electrical gigawatt YEAR. This means
          that after 40 years of fuel buildup even small 500 megawatt
          facilities have approximately a million pounds of highly
          radioactive fuel sitting in their pools waiting for the right
          combination of problems to cause a disaster.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b>Because the Japanese were at least allowed by their
          government to use a reprocessing technology inferior to what
          this engineer spoke of, Fukushima only had approximately
          250,000 pounds of "spent" fuel at each reactor site, which
          remained intact throughout the disaster. But because in
          America no reprocessing is allowed at all in any form, the
          fukushima equivalents in America, such as TVA operated Browns
          Ferry and NSP operated Prairie Island have no fewer than two
          million pounds of "spent" fuel at each reactor site, which
          means that Browns Ferry alone could, in a worst case scenario,
          far exceed the damage done by Fukushima.<br>

          Contrary to what the scamming mainstream press has reported,
          Fukushima reactor 3 was destroyed entirely while at 3,000 PSI
          (far beyond specifications) which resulted in a complete core
          expulsion. This threw approximately 100,000 pounds of fuel
          into the environment, much of it in the form of brown dust
          that badly contaminated the entire surrounding area and was
          found around the world. Seldom reported in the press is the
          fact that the Fukushima site was so badly contaminated that it
          could not be approached, and remote control and robots were
          used in the months following the disaster to get the radiation
          down to a survivable level after the first three people to
          explore the site died. At 100,000 pounds of expelled material,
          reactor 3 could have produced at most 2 percent of the total
          contamination possible from a large American nuclear facility.
          This puts the possible disaster from Browns ferry at 50 to 100
          times worse than Fukushima. Multiply that by Prairie Island
          and the over 100 other similar sized nuclear facilities in
          America and it is not hard to calculate that a serious
          national security threat exists.<b><br>
            <br>
            America's nuclear waste problem was intentionally created<br>
            <br>
          </b>When GE and others designed the nuclear facilities both in
          America and abroad, they had calculated that they would indeed
          succeed in closing the nuclear loop. So they designed the
          nuclear facilities with an approximate 20X safety margin in
          the fuel pools, because they did not have a clear date on when
          the technology would be perfected. It was my impression from
          this engineer that they got it sooner than expected. So
          fortunately the fuel pools were over built, but despite being
          over built they were never designed to withstand the fuel
          burdens that would result from a political decision to destroy
          the closed loop fuel cycle technology altogether.<br>
          <br>
          So now, 40 years after the ban, America has fuel pools around
          the country that are so full that they have exceeded even the
          extremely generous safety margins they were originally
          designed to have, and even modest pools often have over 400
          tons of highly active isotope ridden "spent" fuel in them.<br>
          <br>
          Having functional fuel pool cooling systems was never intended
          to be necessary. GE and others wanted only a fractional core
          of fuel sitting in a pool at any one time, with at most one or
          two entire cores, not 15 or 20. If all cooling systems failed
          with only the intended maximum of one or two cores sitting in
          a pool there would be no boiling of the water in the pool, no
          pending disaster possible from equipment failure no matter how
          severe. But the way it is now, if there is any sort of attack
          or disaster which prevents fuel pool maintenance at any of the
          facilities in America for a period exceeding three days, the
          water will boil off, the fuel will catch fire and a nuclear
          disaster of unimaginable magnitude far in excess of Fukushima
          will take place. And it never needed to be this way, in fact,
          the situation is criminal.<br>
          <b><br>
            Foreign nations offered help, but the American government
            said NO<br>
            <br>
          </b>Upon recognizing the lunacy of America's Federally
          mandated nuclear sabotage, countries like France and Germany
          offered to buy America's 5% spent fuel for billions of
          dollars. They were not held political hostage by a hostile
          government, and could certainly use a source of cheap fuel.
          But rather than accept this offer,the American government
          mandated NO transport of the fuel to foreign nations, no
          further use whatsoever. American nuclear facilities were
          forced by Federal regulation to use approximately 5 percent of
          the fuel's radiological potential, leaving 95 percent of the
          radiological hazard remaining, and subsequently forced to keep
          it in a fuel pool that needs continuous maintenance. While
          arguing against this report, shills have said it was the
          import/export restrictions which caused such a dangerous
          situation in America, but since those laws were written by the
          same government that banned the closing of the "nuclear loop",
          the export restrictions are only a further indictment of the
          FED for causing this problem.<br>
          <br>
          Simultaneous with the intentional building of the threat from
          having so much nuclear material sitting around came all the
          government scandals and lies about needing to put the fuel
          somewhere. Inside a mountain in the desert. Inside a dry cask.
          Maybe in the ocean, all the while the general American public
          was kept oblivious to the obvious answer: If they were not
          allowed to use it because of a nonsensical piece of
          legislation, why not let someone else have it, when other
          nations are willing to even pay for it?<br>
          <b><br>
            Here is what I believe is the answer. And this answer needs
            to be spread far and wide.<br>
            <br>
          </b>Whatever you think of Kennedy, on the day of his death he
          was America's last hope. No President since has been anything
          other than a puppet for an enemy infiltrator, The enemy is not
          only inside the gates, it has been taking a paycheck from the
          American people for over 45 years.<br>
          <br>
          Consider this: America's government intentionally put in place
          policies that de-industrialized America. That's an act of war.
          The American government put in place policies that
          intentionally destroyed America's schools. That's an act of
          war. And I consider forcing via mandate the buildup of
          hundreds of thousands, if not millions of nuclear warheads
          worth of perfectly good reactor fuel just waiting for a
          disaster to be an act of war as well - Only an enemy would
          intentionally mandate the creation of such a threat, who on
          earth would, other than someone who hated America? Not only
          did America lose a marvelous clean virtually free energy
          future, that future got converted into a threat that could
          very easily destroy the nation and take much of the world with
          it. All it would take to kill America, with America's nuclear
          facilities drastically overloaded with 5% spent fuel, is 150
          smart bombs. One successful bombing run and it is over. And
          that's not even taking into consideration other disaster
          scenarios, such as earthquakes and computer virus attacks.<br>
          <b><br>
            The enemy of America is now in complete control of the
            nation<br>
            <br>
          </b>Ever since Kennedy's assassination America has not had a
          true representative government, especially starting with
          Carter. When I worked for the NSA, I saw a few computers which
          were identical to the early vote counting computers, and they
          could be set to loop a single ballot over and over again. With
          a scammed vote, America got over-run by outsiders who wanted
          the country destroyed. Prior to 1973 America was only going
          upward, and anyone who wanted to see America destroyed or
          enslaved would never permit Americans to get virtually free
          energy. The enemy would lose oil profits. They would
          potentially lose control of energy, leaving the financial
          system the only means of forced social compliance outside of a
          hot war and the enemy wanted control options. True clean
          energy had to be stopped.<br>
          <br>
          The enemy of America is a sinister enemy. It is a small group
          of religiously "elite" people who weaponize everything. They
          have weponized sympathy, victim status, water systems,
          vaccines, genetically modified organisms and even terror -
          anything they have been able to think of, and have used these
          things and many more to cause destruction. And the nuclear
          industry, now blocked from a dream come true technology, can
          be used as a weapon.<b><br>
            <br>
            The truth in this is undeniable<br>
            <br>
          </b>There is plenty of proof. No shill can stop people from
          checking out the history of other nations, such as Germany,
          France and Russia offering America BILLIONS for this not so
          "spent" fuel, which can only sit as a hazard after a political
          decision banning technologies which allow for it's
          purification at the same time additional political decisions
          have banned it's export. This hazard has been unnecessarily
          and intentionally accumulating for years. It's the equivalent
          of keeping a 5,000 gallon tank of petrol in your bedroom.
          Better hope all is well with it.<br>
          <br>
          I honestly feel that banning this miracle technology; you
          should have heard the sparkle, the awe in the old man's voice
          when he said they closed the "nuclear loop", and the sadness,
          despair and anger expressed at it's being banned; I feel it
          was an act of war against America. There were never any
          accidents associated with this technology, according to this
          engineer everything negative said about it was a bold faced
          lie spoken by people of ill intent. America's nuclear waste
          problem is not scientific, it is political.<br>
          <br>
          I believe this nuclear engineer opened up and told me about
          this because I was the first journalist he ever encountered
          that actually understood nuclear technology. He knew I would
          understand what he said and subsequently bring this story to
          the public. But outside of making the public aware by telling
          his story in an article such as this, what more can I do? <b><br>

          changers for planet Earth? Who knows?<br>
          <br>
          Buckle up. Here we go.<br>
          <br>
          From FAS (Federation of American Scientists), Secrecy News,
          Oct. 21, 2010, âInvention Secrecy Still Going Strong,â by
          Steven Aftergood:<br>
          <br>
          âThere were 5,135 inventions that were under secrecy orders at
          the end of Fiscal Year 2010, the U.S. Patent and Trademark
          Office told Secrecy News last week. Itâs a 1% rise over the
          year before, and the highest total in more than a decade.â<br>
          <br>
          âUnder the Invention Secrecy Act of 1951, patent applications
          on new inventions can be subject to secrecy orders restricting
          their publication if government agencies believe that
          disclosure would be âdetrimental to the national securityâ.â<br>
          <br>
          âThe current list of technology areas that is used to screen
          patent applications for possible restriction under the
          Invention Secrecy Act is not publicly available and has been
          denied under the Freedom of Information Act. (An appeal is
          pending.)â¦â<br>
          <br>
          âMost of the listed technology areas are closely related to
          military applications. But some of them range more widely.â<br>
          <br>
          âThus, the 1971 list indicates that patents for solar
          photovoltaic generators were subject to review and possible
          restriction IF THE PHOTOVOLTAICS WERE MORE THAN 20% EFFICIENT.
          Energy conversion systems were likewise subject to review and
          possible restriction IF THEY OFFERED CONVERSION EFFICIENCIES
          âIN EXCESS OF 70-80%â.â (Emphasis is mine.)<br>
          <br>
          âOne may fairly ask if disclosure of such technologies could
          really have been âdetrimental to the national security,â or
          whether the opposite would be closer to the truth. One may
          further ask what comparable advances in technology may be
          subject to restriction and non-disclosure today. But no
          answers are forthcoming, and the invention secrecy system
          persists with no discernible external review.â<br>
          <br>
          If youâre one of those people who maintains that advanced
          technology is being held away from the public, here is an
          overall smoking gun that validates your stance.<br>
          <br>
          And you can see that breakthrough energy tech, which would
          radically lessen the need for oil, would be on the
          secrecy-do-not-release list.<br>
          <br>
          What else is on the list? Old Tesla patents, for example?<br>
          <br>
          The US Patent Office is an official chokepoint for the
          âplanned societyââor should we say the ârestricted society.â<br>
          <br>
          But this is not to say advanced technology is always shelved
          or scuttled. The patent applications, in suspended animation
          at the US Patent Office, can be quietly disclosed, for
          example, to government researchers engaged in black-budget
          projects, where the data and the research are turned to âother
          uses.â<br>
          <br>
          Innovative inventors, who can revolutionize society for the
          good, incur risks if they submit their patent applications to
          the State. Getting trapped in limbo, while outright theft of
          their research occurs, is one of those risks.<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand, if a giant corporation has an invention
          that deploys the genetic engineering of food crops, and adds
          millions of tons of toxic pesticides to the environment, its
          patent application sails through review at the Patent Office.<b><br>

          year upon notification by the head of the department or the
          chief officer of the agency who caused the order to be issued
          that an affirmative determination has been made that the
          national interest continues so to require. An order in effect,
          or issued, during a time when the United States is at war,
          shall remain in effect for the duration of hostilities and one

          may rescind any order upon notification by the heads of the
          departments and the chief officers of the agencies who caused
          the order to be issued that the publication or disclosure of
          the invention is no longer deemed detrimental to the national

            <br>
            <b>by Damian Carrington</b><br>

          <b><br>
          </b>Fifty years after the publication of his controversial
          book The Population Bomb, biologist Paul Ehrlich warns
          overpopulation and overconsumption are driving us over the
          edge<br>
          <br>
          The toxification of the planet with synthetic chemicals may be
          more dangerous to people and wildlife than climate change,
          says Ehrlich.<br>
          <br>
          A shattering collapse of civilisation is a ânear certaintyâ in
          the next few decades due to humanityâs continuing destruction
          of the natural world that sustains all life on Earth,
          according to biologist Prof Paul Ehrlich.<br>
          <br>
          In May, it will be 50 years since the eminent biologist
          published his most famous and controversial book, The
          Population Bomb. But Ehrlich remains as outspoken as ever.<br>
          <br>
          The worldâs optimum population is less than two billion people
          â 5.6 billion fewer than on the planet today, he argues, and
          there is an increasing toxification of the entire planet by
          synthetic chemicals that may be more dangerous to people and
          wildlife than climate change.<br>
          <br>
          Ehrlich also says an unprecedented redistribution of wealth is
          needed to end the over-consumption of resources, but âthe rich
          who now run the global system â that hold the annual âworld
          destroyerâ meetings in Davos â are unlikely to let it happenâ.<br>
          <br>
          The Population Bomb, written with his wife Anne Ehrlich in
          1968, predicted âhundreds of millions of people are going to
          starve to deathâ in the 1970s â a fate that was avoided by the
          green revolution in intensive agriculture.<br>
          <br>
          Many details and timings of events were wrong, Paul Ehrlich
          acknowledges today, but he says the book was correct overall.<br>
          <br>
          âPopulation growth, along with over-consumption per capita, is
          driving civilisation over the edge: billions of people are now
          hungry or micronutrient malnourished, and climate disruption
          is killing people.â<br>
          <br>
          Ehrlich has been at Stanford University since 1959 and is also
          president of the Millennium Alliance for Humanity and the
          Biosphere, which works âto reduce the threat of a shattering
          collapse of civilisationâ.<br>
          <br>
          âIt is a near certainty in the next few decades, and the risk
          is increasing continually as long as perpetual growth of the
          human enterprise remains the goal of economic and political
          systems,â he says. âAs Iâve said many times, âperpetual growth
          is the creed of the cancer cellâ.â<br>
          <br>
          It is the combination of high population and high consumption
          by the rich that is destroying the natural world, he says.
          Research published by Ehrlich and colleagues in 2017 concluded
          that this is driving a sixth mass extinction of biodiversity,
          upon which civilisation depends for clean air, water and food.<br>
          <br>
          The solutions are tough, he says. âTo start, make modern
          contraception and back-up abortion available to all and give
          women full equal rights, pay and opportunities with men.<br>
          <br>
          âI hope that would lead to a low enough total fertility rate
          that the needed shrinkage of population would follow. [But] it
          will take a very long time to humanely reduce total population
          to a size that is sustainable.â <br>
          <br>
          He estimates an optimum global population size at roughly 1.5
          to two billion, âBut the longer humanity pursues business as
          usual, the smaller the sustainable society is likely to prove
          to be. Weâre continuously harvesting the low-hanging fruit,
          for example by driving fisheries stocks to extinction.â<br>
          <br>
          Ehrlich is also concerned about chemical pollution, which has
          already reached the most remote corners of the globe. âThe
          evidence we have is that toxics reduce the intelligence of
          children, and members of the first heavily influenced
          generation are now adults.â<br>
          <br>
          He treats this risk with characteristic dark humour: âThe
          first empirical evidence we are dumbing down Homo sapiens were
          the Republican debates in the US 2016 presidential elections â
          and the resultant kakistocracy. On the other hand,
          toxification may solve the population problem, since sperm
          counts are plunging.â<br>
          <br>
          Reflecting five decades after the publication of The
          Population Bomb (which he wanted to be titled Population,
          Resources, and Environment), he says: âNo scientist would hold
          exactly the same views after a half century of further
          experience, but Anne and I are still proud of our book.â It
          helped start a worldwide debate on the impact of rising
          population that continues today, he says.<br>
          <br>
          The bookâs strength, Ehrlich says, is that it was short,
          direct and basically correct. âIts weaknesses were not enough
          on overconsumption and equity issues. It needed more on
          womenâs rights, and explicit countering of racism â which Iâve
          spent much of my career and activism trying to counter.<br>
          Empty half the Earth of its humans. It's the only way to save
          the planet<br>
          <br>
          âToo many rich people in the world is a major threat to the
          human future, and cultural and genetic diversity are great
          human resources.â<br>
          <br>
          Accusations that the book lent support to racist attitudes to
          population control still hurt today, Ehrlich says. âHaving
          been a co-inventor of the sit-in to desegregate restaurants in
          Lawrence, Kansas in the 1950s and having published books and
          articles on the biological ridiculousness of racism, those
          accusations continue to annoy me.â<br>
          <br>
          But, he says: âYou canât let the possibility that ignorant
          people will interpret your ideas as racist keep you from
          discussing critical issues honestly.â<b><br>

            <b>Marco Fontani, Mariagrazia Costa, Mary Virginia Orna -

          <b><br>
          </b>The Periodic Table of Elements hasn't always looked like
          it does now, a well-organized chart arranged by atomic number.
          In the mid-nineteenth century, chemists were of the belief
          that the elements should be sorted by atomic weight. However,
          the weights of many elements were calculated incorrectly, and
          over time it became clear that not only did the elements need
          rearranging, but that the periodic table contained many gaps
          and omissions: there were elements yet to be discovered, and
          the allure of finding one had scientists rushing to fill in
          the blanks. Supposed "discoveries" flooded laboratories, and
          the debate over what did and did not belong on the periodic
          table reached a fever pitch. With the discovery of
          radioactivity, the discourse only intensified. Throughout its
          formation, the Periodic Table of Elements has seen false
          entries, good-faith errors, retractions, and dead ends. In
          fact, there have been more falsely proclaimed elemental
          discoveries throughout history than there are elements on the
          table as we know it today. The Lost Elements: The Periodic
          Table's Shadow Side collects the most notable of these
          instances, stretching from the nineteenth century to the
          present. The book tells the story of how scientists have come
          to understand elements, by discussing the failed theories and
          false discoveries that shaped the path of scientific progress.
          We learn of early chemists' stubborn refusal to disregard
          alchemy as a legitimate practice, and of one German's supposed
          discovery of an elemental metal that breathed. As elements
          began to be created artificially in the twentieth century, we
          watch the discovery climate shift to favor the physicists,
          rather than the chemists. Along the way, Fontani, Costa, and
          Orna introduce us to the key figures in the development of
          today's periodic table, including Lavoisier and Mendeleev.
          Featuring a preface from Nobel Laureate Roald Hoffmann, The
          Lost Elements is an expansive history of the wrong side of
          chemical discovery-and reveals how these errors and gaffes
          have helped shape the table as much as any other form of
          scientific progress. <br>

          </b>...In 2014, Yaghi and his colleagues synthesized a MOF
          that excelled at absorbing water, even under low-humidity
          conditions. That led him to reach out to Evelyn Wang, a
          mechanical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of
          Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, with whom he had previously
          worked on a project to use MOFs in automobile air
          conditioning. After synthesizing the new zirconium-based MOF,
          dubbed MOF-801, Yaghi met Wang at MIT and said, âEvelyn we
          have to come up with a water-harvesting device.â She agreed to
          give it a shot...<br>

            Solar heat helps harvest humidity<br>
          </b><br>
          Atmospheric humidity and droplets constitute a huge freshwater
          resource, especially at the low relative humidity (RH) levels
          typical of arid environments. Water can be adsorbed by
          microporous materials such as zeolites, but often, making
          these materials release the water requires too much energy to
          be practical. Kim et al. used a metal-organic framework (MOF)
          material that has a steep increase in water uptake over a
          narrow RH range to harvest water, using only ambient sunlight
          to heat the material. They obtained 2.8 liters of water per
          kilogram of MOF daily at 20% RH.<br>

            Abstract<br>
          </b><br>
          Atmospheric water is a resource equivalent to ~10% of all
          fresh water in lakes on Earth. However, an efficient process
          for capturing and delivering water from air, especially at low
          humidity levels (down to 20%), has not been developed. We
          report the design and demonstration of a device based on a
          porous metal-organic framework {MOF-801,
          [Zr6O4(OH)4(fumarate)6]} that captures water from the
          atmosphere at ambient conditions by using low-grade heat from
          natural sunlight at a flux of less than 1 sun (1 kilowatt per
          square meter). This device is capable of harvesting 2.8 liters
          of water per kilogram of MOF daily at relative humidity levels
          as low as 20% and requires no additional input of energy.<br>
