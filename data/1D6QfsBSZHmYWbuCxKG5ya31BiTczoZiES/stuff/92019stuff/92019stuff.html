            </b>Red flag gun laws are an outrageous violation of 2nd
            amendment rights, but the fact that Dems want known gang
            members exempted from any proposed red flag laws really
            exposes their true agenda – disarming the law abiding while
            making sure the criminal class is armed to the teeth...<br>

            Comments: <br>
            They want to disarm potential Enemies, not THEIR Allies. <br>
            They might as well admit that red flag laws only target
            white people<br>

            No that can't be true.&nbsp; LA has strict gun laws so that
            can't happen. <br>
            Just more evidence that white men are held to a higher

            <b> Abstract<br>
            </b>Numerical-simulation studies are undertaken to
            investigate how Helmholtz resonance affects the interaction
            of nominally inactive micro-jet actuators with a laminar
            boundary layer. Two sets of numerical simulations are
            carried out. The first set models the response of an
            actuator in ambient conditions to a small jump in its
            internal pressure. These results verify our theoretical
            criterion for Helmholtz resonance. In the second set of
            simulations, two-dimensional Tollmien-Schlichting waves,
            with frequency comparable with, but not particularly close
            to, the Helmholtz resonant frequency, are incident on a
            nominally inactive micro-jet actuator. The simulations show
            that under these circumstances the actuator acts as a strong
            source of 3D Tollmien-Schlichting waves. It is surmised that
            in the real-life aeronautical applications with turbulent
            boundary layers, broadband disturbances of the pressure
            field would cause nominally inactive actuators to act as
            strong disturbance sources. Should this be true, it would
            probably be disastrous for engineering applications of such
            massless microjet actuators for flow control.<br>

                isolated</b><br>
            </div>
            <b> <br>
            </b>Using genetic sequencing, University of California San
            Diego School of Medicine researchers have identified a
            principal cellular player controlling HIV reproduction in
            immune cells which, when turned off or deleted, eliminates
            dormant HIV reservoirs.<br>
            <br>
            "This is one of the key switches that the HIV field has been
            searching for three decades to find," said Tariq Rana, PhD,
            professor of pediatrics and genetics at UC San Diego School
            of Medicine. "The most exciting part of this discovery has
            not been seen before. By genetically modifying a long
            noncoding RNA, we prevent HIV recurrence in T cells and
            microglia upon cessation of antiretroviral treatment,
            suggesting that we have a potential therapeutic target to
            eradicate HIV and AIDS."<br>
            <br>
            HIV spreads through certain bodily fluid attacking the
            immune system and preventing the body from fighting off
            infections. If left untreated, the virus leads to the
            disease AIDS.<br>
            <br>
            Antiretroviral therapy is used to prevent and treat HIV,
            allowing patients to live long and healthy lives. However,
            the medication does not cure patients. Instead, the virus
            remains inactive in the body. If therapy is discontinued,
            the virus awakens and multiplies rapidly.<br>
            <br>
            In a study published online on September 24, 2019 in the
            journal mBio, Rana and colleagues report the first
            genome-wide expression analysis of long noncoding RNA
            (lncRNA) in HIV-infected macrophages -- specialized immune
            cells that promote tissue inflammation, stimulate the immune
            system and rid the body of foreign debris. In general,
            lncRNAs do not encode the recipe for proteins the way other
            RNAs do, but instead help control which genes are turned
            "on" or "off" in a cell.<br>
            <br>
            The team described how a single lncRNA dubbed HIV-1
            Enchanced LncRNA (HEAL) is elevated in people with HIV. HEAL
            appears to be a recently emerged gene that regulates HIV
            replication in immune cells, such as macrophages, microglia
            and T cells.<br>
            <br>
            Using a combination of genomic, biochemical and cellular
            approaches, they found that silencing HEAL or removing it
            with CRISPR-Cas9 prevented HIV from recurring when
            antiretroviral treatment was stopped. Additional research to
            confirm these effects in animal models will be performed.<br>
            <br>
            "Our results suggest that HEAL plays a critical role in HIV
            pathogenesis," said Rana. "Further studies are needed to
            explain the mechanism that leads to HEAL expression after an
            individual is infected by HIV, but this finding could be
            exploited as a therapeutic target."<br>

            </b>Are we about to see U.S. financial markets go
            crazy?&nbsp; That is what Goldman Sachs seem33s to think,
            and it certainly wouldn’t be the first time that great
            financial chaos has been unleashed during the month of
            October.&nbsp; When the stock market crashed in October
            1929, it started the worst economic depression that we have
            ever witnessed.&nbsp; In October 1987, the largest single
            day percentage decline in U.S. stock market history rocked
            the entire planet.&nbsp; And the nightmarish events of
            October 2008 set the stage for a “Great Recession” that we
            still haven’t fully recovered from.&nbsp; So could it be
            possible that something similar may happen in October
            2019?&nbsp; According to CNBC, Goldman Sachs is warning that
            the stock market could soon “go crazy again”… <b><br>

            Voller. “It’s a supercapacitor that performs like a
            battery,” Voller said. “The conventional supercapacitor is
            great at charging really fast but doesn’t hold onto its
            energy for very long.”<br>
            <br>
            The breakthrough came when Zap&amp;Go used carbon nanotube
            technology to combine the fast charging benefits of

            toxic chemicals like the cobalt that underpins many of

            <b><br>
            </b>Our mission is to enable the wide scale adoption of
            sustainable hydrogen fuel by introducing a novel water
            splitting technology<br>
            <br>
            E-TAC (Electrochemical, Thermally Activated Chemical) is a
            revolutionary method for splitting water. Similar to
            electrolysis, E-TAC uses electricity to split water into
            hydrogen and oxygen. However, unlike conventional
            electrolysis, hydrogen and oxygen are generated separately
            at different phases - an Electrochemical phase and a
            Thermally Activated Chemical phase.<b><br>
              <br>
              Phase 1<br>
            </b>In the Electrochemical Phase, electricity is consumed
            and hydrogen is generated. At the same time, the
            nickel-based anode, similar to the one found in Ni-MH
            batteries - is “charged”.<br>
            <b><br>
              Phase 2<br>
              In the Thermally Activated phase, the anode is heated up -
              spontaneously “discharging” it, releasing oxygen.<br>
              Energy Efficiency</b> -- The process is highly energy
            efficient. E-TAC doesn’t require expensive rare-earth
            metals, and is relatively simple to manufacture, promising
            low capital costs. The solution’s architecture yields longer
            durability as well as an overall more robust system. As
            such, H2PRO’s solution is expected to become the most
            efficient and effective way to produce sustainable hydrogen
            at scale.<br>

            </b>When the Kenai Peninsula Borough Assembly in Alaska
            responded to a court ruling by allowing representatives of
            non-traditional religious groups to deliver the invocation
            at its meetings, a self-declared Satanist volunteered.<br>
            <br>
            Now a "pastafarian," a member of the satirical Church of the
            Flying Spaghetti Monster, has taken his turn.<br>
            <br>
            Wearing a colander on his head, Barrett Fletcher introduced
            himself at Tuesday's meeting in Homer, about 125 miles south
            of Anchorage, as "the founding pastor of the First Lower
            Peninsula Congregation of Pastafarians."<br>
            <br>
            "We're gathered here to do the business of our Kenai
            Peninsula borough. We make the rules of behavior and
            property, levy taxes, and determine how to disperse them
            wisely. Fund education, waste management, law enforcement,
            transportation, and health. And attempt to settle disputes
            by the petty or substantial," he said.<br>
            <br>
            "A few of the Assembly members seem to feel they can’t do
            this work without being overseen by a higher authority. So
            I’m called to invoke the power of the true inebriated
            creator of the universe, the drunken tolerator of the all
            lesser and more recent gods, and maintainer of gravity here
            on Earth," said Fletcher.<br>
            <br>
            "May the great Flying Spaghetti Monster rouse himself from
            his stupor, and let his noodly appendages ground each
            assembly member in their seats, reminding them of the
            purpose of their election to this body, and helping them to
            stay focused on the tasks at hand. And may he help them to
            easily equip each of these tasks, avoiding any pettiness and
            irrelevant disagreement, and may he provide each of them
            satisfaction in the perception of accomplishment, and allow
            them true relaxation and an ample supply of their favorite
            beverage at the end of this evening’s work."<br>
            <br>
            He ended with "Ramen."...<br>

            </b>Appearing by telepresence robot, Edward Snowden speaks
            at TED2014 about surveillance and Internet freedom. The
            right to data privacy, he suggests, is not a partisan issue,
            but requires a fundamental rethink of the role of the
            internet in our lives — and the laws that protect it. "Your
            rights matter," he say, "because you never know when you're
            going to need them." Chris Anderson interviews, with special
            guest Tim Berners-Lee.<br>

            </b>The by default highly questionable set options
            concerning privacy and data protection in Windows 10 brought
            me to the idea to develop this program. Microsoft generously
            enables everybody to change the concerning settings, but
            hides them in countless menus, where a normal user does not
            want to search for!<br>
            <br>
            The program should therefore be a help, to display the
            available settings relatively clearly and to set the desired
            options if necessary.<br>
            <br>
            The primary focus is on settings for Windows 10 and its apps
            (for example the new browser "Edge"). The program will be
            expanded gradually, if possible and available, with the
            corresponding Windows 8.1 features in the future.<br>

            realize and both in past and in the present depression,
            sluggish circulation played a major and negative role. The
            most obvious way of increasing the velocity of money is
            Silvio Gesell’s demurrage, a negative interest rate, in
            effect a tax on holding money. This is not just theory.
            There is a famous case in which it was implemented. The
            Wörgl experiment showed truly extraordinary results and is
            legendary in Interest-Free Economics. <br>
            <br>
            It’s relevant today too, with the Danish Central Bank this
            week setting a negative interest rate for the first time in
            history....<br>
            <br>
            Quoting from Fritz Schwarz, who originally documented the
            Wörgl case:<br>
            <br>
            “On the 31st of July 1932 the town administration purchased
            the first lot of Bills from the Welfare Subcommittee for a
            total face value of 1000 Schillings and used them to pay
            wages. The 1000 Schilling official money paid to the Welfare
            for the Bills were deposited at the local “Reiffeisenkasse”
            (where they were held until someone offered the bills to
            convert them back to Schilling, which could be done at any
            time at a cost of 2% of the nominal value of the bills, AM).<br>
            <br>
            The first wages paid out, to the amount of 1000 Schillings,
            returned to the coffers of the community almost on the same
            day. Taxes were being paid! On the third day somebody came
            running and shouting, “Mr. Mayor! Our Bills are being
            counterfeited. We have only issued 1000 Schilling so far,
            but the amount of overdue taxes paid with them has already
            reached 5,100 Schillings! Somebody must have counterfeited
            the Bills!”<br>
            <br>
            The Mayor smiled forgivingly. He knew that bigger men would
            make the same mistake. Even Professor Dr. Bundsmann,
            lecturer of macro-economics at the University of Innsbruck
            and honored with the Austrian title of “Honorary Civil
            Servant” would call the success of Wörgl with its fast
            circulating money a hoax, because he could not understand
            how 5100 Schilling in taxes could be paid from an issue of
            only 1000 Schillings. That was beyond the expectancy of the
            Mayor himself. But every Schilling coming as Bill was
            re-circulated right away to pay an invoice, and was back and
            out again in short order, because this money attracted a
            penalty when idle. At that time the National Bank of Austria
            kept in circulation a constant amount of about 914 million
            Schillings for a population of some 6 million, or 153
            Schillings per person. At the issuing peak, the value of
            Wörgl Bills was 7443, less than 2 Schillings per person. But
            these 2 Schillings gave more income and profit to each
            person than the 153 Schillings of the National Bank. Why?
            Because they were designed to entice people into using them,
            which is what money is for: to pay, to do business, to
            exchange. A. Hornung, who was against this “free money” and
            the whole experiment, reported grudgingly: “The issue of
            relief money was back in the coffers of the municipality
            within days. From there it could be re-used for payments...
            <br>
            <br>
            The Bills are being accepted everywhere alongside with the
            official money. Prices have not gone up. …… One cannot but
            agree with the Mayor that the new money performs its
            function far better than the old one. I leave it to the
            experts to establish if there is inflation despite the 100%
            cover. Incidentally price increases, the first sign of
            inflation, do not occur.”<br>
            <br>
            <b>Aftermath<br>
            </b>As a result of the incredible success of
            Unterguggenberger’s experiment, hundreds of Austrian towns
            planned on implementing the scheme. As a result the Austrian
            National Bank panicked and forbade the experiment. Vienna
            crushed the resentment with the threat of military
            intervention. Within a short while Wörgl was suffering
            again...<br>

            <b> ABSTRACT<br>
            </b>Pranic agriculture is an ancient science and art of
            healing that helps in enhancement of plant growth. The aim
            of the present study was to understand the morphological
            qualities (plant length, stem diameter and fruit yield) of
            pranic treated cucumber. This study has given an insight
            into the changes in the morphology characteristics of the
            pranic cucumber as compared to the non-treated cucumber,
            referred to as control group. Increase in length of cucumber
            plants by 97% was noticed in pranic cucumber plants when
            compared to control. Also, pranic cucumber stem was 31.7%
            more diameter than control group. When group-wise yield was
            verified, pranic cucumber yielded 20.8% significantly more
            than control group. Further studies are warranted to
            evaluate the difference in nutritional composition of pranic
            and control cucumber fruits.<br>
            <b><br>
              INTRODUCTION<br>
            </b>Pranic healing is a traditional science and art of
            treatment using subtle energy of prana. Prana is universal,
            even though for most people imperceptible. Every object
            including man, plants and trees are surrounded by an energy
            field called bioplasmic body1. Scientists with the help of
            Kirlian’s photography have rediscovered the bioplasmic
            body2. This energy body keeps the animals and plants healthy
            and alive. Sun, air and soil are the major sources of prana.
            Plants and trees absorb prana from the sun, air, water and
            ground...<br>
            <br>
            Pranic agriculture works on holistic concept of
            environment-friendly farming systems. It consist of the
            entire invisible subtle energy which is an essential and
            significant part of nature system. The purely energetic side
            of pranic agriculture can be applied by anybody with some
            familiarity of pranic energies. According to master Sui1,
            pranic treatment can be applied to plants to enhance faster
            growth. Few reports about application of pranic agriculture
            on plants have been published. Pranic treatment
            significantly enhanced seed germination of green gram, when
            compared to control3. Wheat and pea seedling germination
            also improved significantly when qi energy was projected4.
            Antioxidant activity and polyphenol content of pranic
            treated cucumber were found to be higher than control5.<br>
            <br>
            Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) belongs to the Cucurbitaceae
            family. It is a major vegetable crop used in raw form as
            salads worldwide. It is a creeper which roots in the ground
            and climbs with the help of thin, spiraling tendrils. The
            fruit is cylindrical, elongated with tapering ends. Cucumber
            is rich in minerals and vitamins in addition it is
            delicious, tasty with good medicinal value5. The present
            study compares the impact of pranic agriculture on the
            physical quality of cucumber by determining plant length,
            stem diameter and fruit yield against control group.<br>
            <b><br>
              RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<br>
            </b>Effect of pranic treatment on plant length: As far as
            the length of plant was considered (Table 1), repeated
            measure ANOVA revealed a significant difference from visit
            1-7 (F = 56.355; p&lt;0.001). Further, when group-wise
            length was verified, pranic treated group obtained a length
            of 28.77 inches compared to control group which had a length
            of only 14.60 inches. It was clear that plants which
            received pranic treatment had 97% more plant length than
            control group.<br>
            <br>
            Effect of pranic treatment on stem diameter: Repeated
            measure ANOVA discovered a significant difference from visit
            1-7, where (F = 11.888; p&lt;0.001), pranic treated plant
            had a diameter of 7.45 mm and control group had 5.65 mm at
            visit 7 (Table 2). It was clear that plants which were given
            pranic treatment had significantly more diameter (31.72%)
            than control group.<br>
            <br>
            Effect of pranic treatment on overall fruit yield: As far as
            the yield is considered (Table 3), repeated measure ANOVA
            revealed a significant difference from visit 08-13 (F =
            14.874; p&lt;0.001). Further, when total yield was verified,
            pranic treated group obtained a yield of 63.84 kg compared
            to control group which yielded only 52.85 kg. It is clear
            that plants which received pranic treatment yielded
            significantly more with an increase of 20.77% as compared to
            control group. The reason behind such improvements in
            cucumber morphology is probably due to the fact that pranic
            treatment can alter the molecular structure of treated
            cells, affect nucleotide polymerization, gene expression and
            enzyme activity. It should also be noted that application of
            energy would help in increased rate of cellular growth and
            division. It also increases ATPase activity during seed
            germination of the dividing cells. These results in more
            energy supply to the cells during cell division, growth and
            differentiation probably resulting in enhanced growth of
            pranic treated cucumber.<br>

            <b>Abstract<br>
            </b>So called primitive peoples of the world share a
            philosophy that human interaction via ceremony or ritual can
            affect the natural world. Is it possible to affect the
            germination and growth of plants by imbuing them with an
            intent to stimulate or inhibit them? We conducted a double
            blind series of experiments to determine whether a process
            of meditation on the water (referred to as "treated") given
            to a controlled planting of green peas or wheat would affect
            their germination. Peas were given water treated with
            stimulating intent. Statistical analysis was done using
            contingency table, Fisher's test, and Mantel-Haenszel
            analysis. The germination rate of 504 seeds receiving
            treated water with stimulating intent was 60.3% compared to
            51.8% for the 504 controls (p = 0.006, 0.047, 0.003
            respectively). A similar experiment was conducted with wheat
            with the intent of inhibiting germination. The germination
            rate of 2970 wheat seeds receiving treated water with
            inhibitory intent was 70.7% versus 74.9% for 2970 controls
            (p &lt; 0.001, 0.0001, 0.001 respectively). During the sixth
            run of the wheat (inhibition) experiment, the seedlings were
            harvested and individually weighed on the tenth day after
            planting to determine whether there was any difference in
            growth. The mass of the treated seedlings was statistically
            significantly lower (mean = 97 mg versus 106 mg for the
            controls) when compared by analysis of variance (p =
            0.000056). We conclude that meditation upon the water
            supplied to green peas and wheat can affect their
            germination rates and growth.<br>

            </b>In this study, researchers from Shuguang Hospital, which
            is affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese
            Medicine, investigated whether or not huang qi decoction
            (HQD) prevents liver fibrosis by affecting the Notch
            signaling pathway. The results of their study were published
            in The American Journal of Chinese Medicine...<br>

            The researchers concluded that HQD can prevent biliary liver

            </div>
            <b><br>
            </b>A team of researchers at MIT has come up with a new way
            of manufacturing the material that could eliminate these
            emissions altogether, and could even make some other useful
            products in the process.<br>
            <br>
            The findings are being reported today in the journal PNAS in
            a paper by Yet-Ming Chiang, the Kyocera Professor of
            Materials Science and Engineering at MIT, with postdoc Leah
            Ellis, graduate student Andres Badel, and others.<br>
            <br>
            “About 1 kilogram of carbon dioxide is released for every
            kilogram of cement made today,” Chiang says. That adds up to
            3 to 4 gigatons (billions of tons) of cement, and of carbon
            dioxide emissions, produced annually today, and that amount
            is projected to grow. The number of buildings worldwide is
            expected to double by 2060, which is equivalent to “building
            one new New York City every 30 days,” he says. And the
            commodity is now very cheap to produce: It costs only about
            13 cents per kilogram, which he says makes it cheaper than
            bottled water.<br>
            <br>
            So it’s a real challenge to find ways of reducing the
            material’s carbon emissions without making it too expensive.
            Chiang and his team have spent the last year searching for
            alternative approaches, and hit on the idea of using an
            electrochemical process to replace the current
            fossil-fuel-dependent system.<br>
            <br>
            Ordinary Portland cement, the most widely used standard
            variety, is made by grinding up limestone and then cooking
            it with sand and clay at high heat, which is produced by
            burning coal. The process produces carbon dioxide in two
            different ways: from the burning of the coal, and from gases
            released from the limestone during the heating. Each of
            these produces roughly equal contributions to the total
            emissions. The new process would eliminate or drastically
            reduce both sources, Chiang says. Though they have
            demonstrated the basic electrochemical process in the lab,
            the process will require more work to scale up to industrial
            scale.<br>
            <br>
            First of all, the new approach could eliminate the use of
            fossil fuels for the heating process, substituting
            electricity generated from clean, renewable sources. “In
            many geographies renewable electricity is the lowest-cost
            electricity we have today, and its cost is still dropping,”
            Chiang says. In addition, the new process produces the same
            cement product. The team realized that trying to gain
            acceptance for a new type of cement — something that many
            research groups have pursued in different ways — would be an
            uphill battle, considering how widely used the material is
            around the world and how reluctant builders can be to try
            new, relatively untested materials.<br>
            <br>
            The new process centers on the use of an electrolyzer,
            something that many people have encountered as part of high
            school chemistry classes, where a battery is hooked up to
            two electrodes in a glass of water, producing bubbles of
            oxygen from one electrode and bubbles of hydrogen from the
            other as the electricity splits the water molecules into
            their constituent atoms. Importantly, the electrolyzer’s
            oxygen-evolving electrode produces acid, while the
            hydrogen-evolving electrode produces a base.<br>
            <br>
            In the new process, the pulverized limestone is dissolved in
            the acid at one electrode and high-purity carbon dioxide is
            released, while calcium hydroxide, generally known as lime,
            precipitates out as a solid at the other. The calcium
            hydroxide can then be processed in another step to produce
            the cement, which is mostly calcium silicate.<br>
            <br>
            The carbon dioxide, in the form of a pure, concentrated
            stream, can then be easily sequestered, harnessed to produce
            value-added products such as a liquid fuel to replace
            gasoline, or used for applications such as oil recovery or
            even in carbonated beverages and dry ice. The result is that
            no carbon dioxide is released to the environment from the
            entire process, Chiang says. By contrast, the carbon dioxide
            emitted from conventional cement plants is highly
            contaminated with nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, carbon
            monoxide and other material that make it impractical to
            “scrub” to make the carbon dioxide usable.<br>
            <br>
            Calculations show that the hydrogen and oxygen also emitted
            in the process could be recombined, for example in a fuel
            cell, or burned to produce enough energy to fuel the whole
            rest of the process, Ellis says, producing nothing but water
            vapor.<br>
            <br>
            In their laboratory demonstration, the team carried out the
            key electrochemical steps required, producing lime from the
            calcium carbonate, but on a small scale. The process looks a
            bit like shaking a snow-globe, as it produces a flurry of
            suspended white particles inside the glass container as the
            lime precipitates out of the solution.<br>
            <br>
            While the technology is simple and could, in principle, be
            easily scaled up, a typical cement plant today produces
            about 700,000 tons of the material per year. “How do you
            penetrate an industry like that and get a foot in the door?”
            asks Ellis, the paper’s lead author. One approach, she says,
            is to try to replace just one part of the process at a time,
            rather than the whole system at once, and “in a stepwise
            fashion” gradually add other parts.<br>
            <br>
            The initial proposed system the team came up with is “not
            because we necessarily think we have the exact strategy” for
            the best possible approach, Chiang says, “but to get people
            in the electrochemical sector to start thinking more about
            this,” and come up with new ideas. “It’s an important first
            step, but not yet a fully developed solution.”<b><br>

            <b><br>
              Abstract<br>
            </b>Cement production is currently the largest single
            industrial emitter of CO2, accounting for &#8764;8% (2.8 Gtons/y)
            of global CO2 emissions. Deep decarbonization of cement
            manufacturing will require remediation of both the CO2
            emissions due to the decomposition of CaCO3 to CaO and that
            due to combustion of fossil fuels (primarily coal) in
            calcining (&#8764;900 °C) and sintering (&#8764;1,450 °C). Here, we
            demonstrate an electrochemical process that uses neutral
            water electrolysis to produce a pH gradient in which CaCO3
            is decarbonated at low pH and Ca(OH)2 is precipitated at
            high pH, concurrently producing a high-purity O2/CO2 gas
            mixture (1:2 molar ratio at stoichiometric operation) at the
            anode and H2 at the cathode. We show that the solid Ca(OH)2
            product readily decomposes and reacts with SiO2 to form
            alite, the majority cementitious phase in Portland cement.
            Electrochemical calcination produces concentrated gas
            streams from which CO2 may be readily separated and
            sequestered, H2 and/or O2 may be used to generate electric
            power via fuel cells or combustors, O2 may be used as a
            component of oxyfuel in the cement kiln to improve
            efficiency and lower CO2 emissions, or the output gases may
            be used for other value-added processes such as liquid fuel
            production. Analysis shows that if the hydrogen produced by
            the reactor were combusted to heat the high-temperature
            kiln, the electrochemical cement process could be powered
            solely by renewable electricity.<b><br>

            everyone should drink silicon-rich mineral water every day
            to remove toxic aluminium from their bodies and brains.<br>
            <br>
            Over the last 10 years, my team at Keele University has been
            looking into the effectiveness of drinking water high in
            silicon to help remove aluminium from the body. Aluminium is
            a toxin which has been strongly linked to the development of
            Alzheimer’s as well as other human diseases including
            Parkinson’s disease and Multiple Sclerosis.<br>
            <br>
            Unfortunately, aluminium is found widely in our environment.
            We live in the ‘aluminium age’ and our bodies accumulate it
            over time, especially in our brains.<br>
            <br>
            What we have found in&nbsp; clinical trials, involving both
            healthy individuals and individuals with disease, is that
            drinking around a litre of silicon-rich mineral water every
            day can speed up the removal of toxic aluminium from the
            body via the kidneys and ultimately urine. In fact, our
            studies showed that individuals&nbsp; experienced
            significant reductions in their body burden of aluminium,
            including falls of up to 70% in one case, over a 12 week
            period.<br>
            <br>
            Silicon-rich mineral waters help to remove aluminium from
            the body because they are actually rich in soluble silicon
            or silicic acid. This form of silicon immediately follows
            water molecules through the gut wall and into the
            bloodstream&nbsp; where it forms a complex with aluminium
            called an hydroxyaluminosilicate. This form of aluminium can
            be easily filtered from the blood by the kidney. Hence,
            silicon-rich mineral waters increase the excretion of
            aluminium in the urine.<br>
            <br>
            Our efforts now are focused on establishing without doubt
            that these reduced levels of aluminium can be directly
            related to improvement in patient symptoms and indeed in
            overall health. In the case of Alzheimer’s, we recently
            found that drinking silicon-rich water over only 12 weeks
            produced significant improvements in cognitive function
            without any known or observed side effects.&nbsp; This means
            that simply drinking silicon-rich water is a completely
            non-invasive way to remove aluminium from the body and
            something which can potentially benefit everyone including
            people with diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.<br>
            <br>
            Now, I am keen to encourage everyone to drink more
            silicon-rich mineral water in their daily lives. There are
            already two brands of silicon-rich mineral water available
            in the UK including Fiji water and Volvic. There are several
            others across Europe and the rest of the world. What you
            need to look for is a minimum concentration of 30 mg/L or 30
            ppm written as ‘silica’ on the label.<br>
            <br>
            We do find it difficult to obtain funding for our research,
            so the actual water that we have used in all our clinical
            studies, (and so proven scientifically to be effective), is
            also now commercially available in the UK and Europe, with a
            proportion of the sales of this water being redirected to
            research into aluminium at Keele. If you would like to
            support us, and boost your own health, please purchase
            ACILIS water from the website, www.silicawaters.com. It is
            natural, artesian bottled water from Malaysia and it is very
            rich in silicon containing approximately 55 mg/L or 55 ppm
            silica. We have shown that ACILIS (called SPRITZER in
            Malaysia) is effective in helping to remove aluminium from
            the human body and it can be effective for everyone in
            helping themselves to protect against the possible future
            toxicity of aluminium. I drink it myself!<b><br>

            ...He told a story his grandfather told him about a
            spaceship that crashed on the property. Harrison said:<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I saw the ship, I went aboard it. It was
            a long cylinder about 30 feet wide and 60 feet long. I
            measured it by pacing it off. Most of it stuck inside a
            butte, close to the water level. It was well camouflaged.
            You can’t see the butte now, it was covered by water when
            the Corps of Engineers flooded the valley creating the
            reservoir...<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The crash shook the ground so hard that
            Gramps thought the house was going to collapse. You can
            still see a crack in the foundation of the log cabin that
            Gramps said occurred when the spaceship crashed. The horses
            were so frightened that it took a month to round them up,
            and even then they were constantly trying to escape. At
            first, Gramps thought it was an earthquake, but when he
            cleared, he saw the craft. It hit with such force that only
            a small section stuck out of the butte, but Gramps not only
            had a keen eye, he knew this land like the back of his hand.
            The smallest disturbance caught his attention. For the
            longest time he sat on the butte watching for any sign of
            life. He kept a vigil for days. Finally after a week or so,
            he ventured to the place of impact.”<br>
            <br>
            His grandfather told him that the “star men” who crashed and
            survived there lived in their craft for approximately 5
            months before another ship came and rescued them.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the time of the crash, the closest
            ranch to our place was 10 miles away, and as fate would have
            it those neighbours had moved out of state days before the
            crash occurred. Gramps delighted in keeping the star men’s
            presence a secret.<br>
            <br>
            Harrison explained that the first time his grandfather
            approached them, he did so by taking them an offering of
            food. They told him they do not eat flesh. He described them
            as taller than humans, at least 7-8 feet tall and very
            white. Harrison said:<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He described them as being so white that
            you could almost see inside them. I’m not sure what he meant
            by that except he said their skin was thin. They had long
            slender fingers, much longer than humans. Their hair was
            white. When the sun shined on it, Gramps said it looked like
            a halo surrounded their heads. He said that sometimes they
            looked like the angels depicted in the paintings of his
            bible, except they did not wear gowns. Their eyes, too. He
            said they changed color depending on the light.<br>
            <br>
            Furthermore, Harrison’s grandfather described to him what
            they wore:<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He was particularly interested in their
            clothes. They wore a one-piece light green outfit. He told
            me there were times he saw them wading in the river, and
            when he approached them their suits were dry. He told me he
            wished he had a suit like that. When I think of the old man
            and how he viewed the star visitors, he did his best to
            describe what he saw. I’m sure if the same thing occurred
            today, the observers might offer a more sophisticated
            perspective."<br>
            <br>
            Harrison went on to explain that there were fourteen of
            them, and how his “Gramps” wasn’t sure if all survived the
            crash. Harrison says that when he arrived in the summer,
            after the visitors had left, he went on board the craft and
            there were seventeen seats.<br>
            <br>
            As far as why they were here, Harrison said:<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Gramps said that he often saw the Star
            People picking up rocks and plants. At first, when they saw
            him, they vanished before his eyes. He never discovered an
            explanation for that, but he wished that he had that power,”
            Harrison laughed. “Gramps thought that was the ultimate
            trait-simply to vanish in thin air when you wanted. I can’t
            imagine how he planned to use it. As time passed, Gramps
            said the star men realized he meant no harm and they didn’t
            disappear when he approached. Overtime, it became clear to
            him that they were concerned about their craft. They did not
            want it discovered.”<br>
            <br>
            His grandfather told him that the beings lived there from
            late November until April. According to him, another
            spaceship appeared on April 17th, 1945 and he never saw them
            again.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He knew they were waiting for a rescue
            craft, so he expected it. He told me their spaceship was one
            of four exploring the Earth. They had been dropped off by a
            bigger ship that was circling Earth. The big ship would
            return for them but not for some time. They just had to
            wait. They were not afraid they would be discovered, they
            could make themselves invisible, but they could not do the
            same with their spaceship."<br>
            <br>
            He said that his grandfather witnessed the pick-up.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He watched as they prepared to leave.
            Each of the stranded star travellers came to him and bowed
            before they left. He understood they appreciated his
            discretion."<br>
            <br>
            As far as why they were here:<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gramps said they were voyagers and
            traveled the universe observing life on other worlds. They
            had been coming to Earth for thousands of years observing,
            collecting and noting changes. One day, they took him aboard
            their craft and showed him pictures from their home. As he
            described it, I suspect it was some kind of a TV or
            computer, but in my grandfather’s day there was no such
            thing, so he was enthralled by what he called “a picture
            machine.” He talked about flashing pictures that showed a
            place different from Earth. It reminded him of the
            Bad-lands, but with no vegetation. Their houses were
            underground. He asked them if it was Heaven, and they told
            him they did not have a place such as heaven. He was
            fascinated by the picture machine and went back several
            times to view the pictures. Apparently, the star visitors
            told him they liked the green of Earth, and they thought the
            Red Willow that grew along the banks of the river was quite
            beautiful in April. They loved the water. On their world,
            water was underground: nothing on the surface. My
            grandfather frequently collected geodes for them. They were
            amazed when he broke them open to reveal the crystallized
            cities inside. They were apparently pleased to add them to
            their collection. Gramps also taught them the medicinal uses
            of the red willow and how to propagate it from a small
            sample..."<br>

            May 16th of this year highlighting inventor Dennis Danzik,
            who is in production in Scottsdale, Arizona with a self
            powering magnetic motor.&nbsp; The motor uses anisotropic
            magnets that are strategically placed on counter rotating
            flywheels to drive up to 4,000 pounds of inertia power and
            deliver in excess of 25 kilowatts.<b><br>

              I AM NOT BUYING THE REFINERY ATTACK STORY LINE<br>
            </b>Here is the main reason: Please explain how the fires
            resulting from the worst refinery attack in history on the
            largest refinery in the world were fully extinguished on the
            same day. That's BULLSHIT, it could have only happened if
            someone wanted to make a show, and did not set anything off
            that could not be brought under control easily.<br>
            Additionally, the pinpoint accuracy of the attacks reeks of
            a manually placed setup. It was just too PERFECT.<br>
            <br>
            I have bumped this topic to the top of the page for the day
            because I posted it late last night.<br>
            <br>
            <b>I AM CALLING IT: THERE WERE NO DRONES AND NO MISSILES
              USED AGAINST SAUDI REFINERY</b><b><br>
            </b>Obviously there's no way to be 100 percent certain with
            this, but a referee would certainly call it for the
            following reasons: There was no damage to the oil facility.
            At least no damage to speak of. They can patch it up and get
            it going STAT because it was extremely minimal damage that
            did not wipe out actual refining capabilities, all it did
            was light big fires (that are already completely out) and
            make a bunch of smoke. If this was for real, it would not be
            put out already.<br>
            <br>
            Another very suspicious aspect of this was how precise the
            "hits" were. It looks as if someone went up on the tanks
            with a man lift that could access the same spot on each tank
            easily, and put the absolute minimal explosive there
            manually that would be needed to blow the tank, without
            actually destroying the tank. There's not a chance in hell
            it was cruise missiles because if it was, there would be
            nothing left of the tanks. Instead, they are all neatly
            poked in exactly the same spot on each tank. The tanks
            obviously only need to be patched, they don't need to be
            replaced.<br>
            <br>
            Here's a HUGE reason to call the attacks totally FAKE, and I
            know this cinches it -<br>
            <br>
            First, an explanation to prove the scenario here - In
            industry, when repairs have to be made to any tank filled
            with anything that can explode when mixed with air - if it
            needs to be welded, welding can be done without worry
            provided the welding is done below the level of the liquid
            in the tank, down below where the air can reach it. This is
            even true on gasoline tanks. As long as you don't puncture
            the tank or weld where the air is, there's no chance at all
            of there being a problem from being welded, welding can be
            done below the level of whatever liquid is in the tank. <br>
            <br>
            <b>THIS IS EXACTLY HOW EVERY SINGLE "DRONE AND CRUISE
              MISSILE" HIT THESE TANKS.</b><b><br>
            </b>Take a look at this picture. All the tanks were hit the
            same way in exactly the same spot, with precison that is not
            attainable by those accused, as well as precise limited
            damage not attainable by those accused.<br>
            <br>
            Look in the lower right hand corner of the photo. There is a
            car or pickup truck there. That shows how large the tanks
            are. Iran's smallest cruise missile has approximately a 290
            pound warhead. If an Iranian cruise missile hit those tanks
            (as some have claimed) the hole would be approximately as
            far across as 5 of those cars if the tank was robustly
            built, and more if it was not. AND IF there was no
            additional explosive effects provided by the fuel in the
            tank. The entire story line for the refinery attack is an
            obvious hoax. There's no way a 290 pound warhead hit that
            tank.<br>
            <br>
            This attack was prepared for, because NONE of the tanks
            exploded, UPDATE: These were likely natural gas tanks that
            were fully purged of oxygen and would not explode, but that
            still can't explain the holes that look like they were poked
            by needles. What are the chances of that happening at
            random? I'd say zilch, and am probably right. <br>
            <br>
            <b>AND HOW THE HELL ARE THE FIRES OUT SO SOON AFTER THE
              "ATTACK" THAT A PHOTO LIKE THIS COULD BE TAKEN RIGHT AWAY?
            </b><b><br>
            </b>These fires were out in ONE DAY. That needs some
            explaining, - explaining that can't be done outside of this
            attack being hoaxed for max impression and minimal damage.<br>
            <br>
            <b>BOTTOM LINE: </b>If it is all out so quickly and the
            damage is that uniform and the damage is that minimal, first
            of all Iranian cruise missiles did not do this because the
            damage is not enough (all of them carry 130 KG (286 pound)
            warheads and up) which would obliterate a large section of
            those tanks and not just leave a little hole (Oh, I know
            what did this, the Iranian navy put limpet mines on those
            tanks, YEP, that would end up looking like the photo) and
            magically and mysteriously got all of them right where they
            would not ignite any vapors and blow the whole thing. Forget
            about how they sailed into that refinery to do it, IRAN DID
            IT, IRAN DID IT, IRAN DID IT!!!!<br>
            <br>
            The Yemenis did not do this either, they were simply not
            capable of that kind of precision. Even the U.S. would
            likely not have an attack pattern be so uniform and perfect,
            this looks like a hand placement job and someone was
            brainless about making it look credible...<br>
            <br>
            Here are the probable culprits as far as I see it, in order:<br>
            1. Israel.<br>
            2. The Pentagon, which wants an Iran war, in retaliation for
            removing Bolton.<br>
            3. Saudi Arabia<br>
            The above 3 are for justifying attacking Iran.<br>
            4. A private corporation that will gain from this, perhaps
            even one like Google that is not even in the oil business
            directly but has oil investments.<br>
            5. Yemen, as part of the ongoing conflict.<br>
            6. Russia, to boost oil prices.<b><br>

              <b>by Christopher Jon Bjerknes </b><br>
            </div>
            <b><br>
            </b>Though commonly associated with the name Albert
            Einstein, Samuel Tolver Preston published the formula E =
            mc2 in 1875, four years before Einstein was born. Unlike
            Einstein, Preston fully grasped the significance of the
            tremendous store of energy the equation represents. He
            engineered machines to take advantage of the energy source,
            including the atomic bomb. In 1875, Samuel Tolver Preston
            calculated the mass-energy equivalence with the equation E =
            mc2 in his book PHYSICS OF THE ETHER, which is republished
            in full. He proposed methods of obtaining atomic energy and
            generating superconductivity. Adopting the mechanical
            gravitational theory of George Louis LeSage, S. Tolver
            Preston presented a comprehensive physical theory of gravity
            and electromagnetism, analogous to the kinetic theory of
            gasses and based upon an aether composed of subdivided
            matter, whose particles travel at light speed and possess
            the energy of their mass times the speed of light squared.
            Preston's works forecast and inspired numerous discoveries
            and technologies that would shape the Twentieth Century. He
            wrote almost exclusively in highly polished prose and the
            non-mathematical reader will find it easy to understand his
            writings. Preston was an eloquent proponent of science and
            championed female collegiate education in the 1880's. In
            another anticipation of the theory of relativity, he fully
            relativized unipolar induction in the same terms Albert
            Einstein would repeat decades later as justification for a
            new theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies known as
            the special theory of relativity. His insightful and
            creative articles were eagerly sought by journals around the
            world and inspired other authors of science, as well as
            science fiction. In addition to Christopher Jon Bjerknes'
            history of Preston and his innovations, the book republishes
            an extensive collection of Preston's works, including
            Preston's books PHYSICS OF THE ETHER and ORIGINAL ESSAYS,
            and 116 thought provoking and historically important journal
            articles and letters to the editor. SAMUEL TOLVER PRESTON:
            FATHER OF E = mc2, THE ATOMIC BOMB AND ATOMIC ENERGY by
            Christopher Jon Bjerknes is the first and only account and
            collection of Samuel Tolver Preston’s works and
            achievements. It is an unprecedented and long overdue
            documentation of this largely forgotten genius and his many
            significant accomplishments, which cannot be found anywhere
            else.<b><br>

                deactivates all enemy weapons</b><br>
            </div>
            Pravda reports:<br>
            Russia continues surprising the West with new weapons.
            According to recent reports, Russian engineers develop a
            jammer missile called Alabuga. Rumor has it that this weapon
            will be able to completely neutralize enemy without even
            opening fire at its forces. This weapon produces a very
            strong radio electric impact, the power of which is
            comparable to the power of a nuclear explosion.<br>
            <br>
            The missile can literally disable all enemy weapons and
            military equipment, including missiles, missile defense
            systems, ships and tanks, as well as any type of air, sea
            and ground military hardware. The Alabuga missile causes all
            microcircuits to come out of order. In fact, the military
            hardware and equipment will simply freeze in place, whereas
            aircraft and missiles will fall down to the ground like
            rocks.<br>
            <br>
            It is believed that the Alabuga will become the most
            powerful prospective radio-electric bomb that will be able
            to deactivate and immobilize the entire combat power of the
            enemy completely.<br>
            <br>
            The idea of a bomb that, without destroying the environment,
            could deactivate all of the military equipment and weapons
            of the enemy is not new.&nbsp; In 2001, the “Ranets” complex
            was introduced in Russia. The word “ranets” translates into
            English as “backpack.” The weapon looked more like a radio
            station than a radio-electric weapon. It was a movable
            system that could strike enemy equipment at a distance of up
            to 40 km.<br>
            <br>
            The Alabuga is being developed by most advanced enterprises
            in the field of defence technology. There are no details
            about the project. It is believed, however, that the missile
            will be able to fly up for 300-400 meters to deactivate all
            military equipment and weapons within the range of four
            kilometers.<br>
            <br>
            The United States has been developing a similar technology
            since 2012. The goal is to create a weapon that could hit
            the enemy and give total advantage over enemy forces. Yet,
            the USA has never presented any real system yet.&nbsp; The
            Alabuga is not a lethal missile, nor does it lead to victims
            when it explodes. Specialists believe that such weapons may
            change the strategy of wars of the future entirely.<b><br>

            The dinosaurs that are in control of our nation are old and
            do not understand any other way of life other than vicious
            imperialism. They do not understand compassion, empathy,
            understanding, respect, or love. The world has been this way
            for thousands of years. We are attempting to transition from
            the old ways of conquering, war, domination, and enslavement
            into an entirely new dimension, but the Old forces are not
            allowing this transition to come easily. They are fighting
            with everything they have. They have full control over our
            nation’s mainstream media establishment, and furthermore
            they have full control over the world’s global financial
            system and how it operates. This gives them incredible power
            to get away with almost anything they want to get away
            with.The reality is that most Americans, and I agree with
            you it’s not right, don’t pay attention to what is actually
            going on in the world. They have their cars, their houses,
            and they don’t think too deeply about the world around them.
            For the have-nots, aka the poor, they are too
            disenfranchised and homeless or whatever to do anything
            about it. Nobody is united. There are only small groups, and
            small pockets of resistance here and there. Previous
            attempts to break this mold, which were led by John F
            Kennedy, and Martin Luther King, ended in assassination. Not
            enough people questioned the official narratives, at the
            time, surrounding these assassinations. Very few question
            the events of 9/11 and very few people take a look at what
            is happening outside of what the mainstream media is telling
            them. People’s needs are generally taken care of, and that’s
            all that matters to them.The only real hope now lies in the
            younger generations. Those who grew up with the internet.
            They are a little less brainwashed. They read alternative
            media. They have access to more information, and therefore,
            the truth. They are questioning things. They are angry about
            what is happening and what their country is doing.
            Furthermore, there is a growing sense amongst the general
            population that the “powers that be” and the mainstream
            media do not serve their interests. (Which is why Trump was
            elected). So I would not say that all hope is lost and the
            US is doomed to start WW3.Whatever you do, don’t give up.
            There is a growing awareness in the USA about what their
            country has become. People are tired, and pissed off with
            the status quo. It would take only a single charismatic
            leader, who can unite the people, an American Putin if you
            will, to completely change everything. The rise of such a
            leader, who could unite the tens of millions of those in the
            younger generations, who truly want change, and lead them
            against the forces of oppression and death, could change
            everything before you even know it. The empire will not be
            able to continue destroying nations when it faces a civil
            war in it’s main center of power (the US). This time is now
            fast approaching. I believe it must, and that it will
            happen. The alternative is that the Elite, who are desperate
            to hang onto power and avoid paying for their crimes against
            humanity, will start WW3 and we will all be forced to
            experience the horrors of a nuclear war. Then nobody
            wins.But that won’t happen. There is going to be a movement
            of true change in the United States that will be sparked
            when everyone least expects it, in what will seem to be the
            darkest hour for mankind. Just in time to save this “doomed”
            world. Believe it. It is coming.<b><br>

            </b>Like relativity and quantum theory chaos research is
            another prominent concept of 20th century physics that has
            triggered deep and far-reaching discussions in the
            philosophy of science. In this volume outstanding scientists
            discuss the fundamental problems of the concepts of law and
            of prediction. They present their views in their
            contributions to this volume, but they also are exposed to
            criticism in transcriptions of recordings made during
            discussions and in comments on their views also published in
            this book. Although all authors assume familiarity with some
            background in physics they also address the philosophers of
            science and even a general audience interested in modern
            science's contribution to a deeper understanding of reality.

                Doesn’t Exist, VT on Maxwell with Keshe and Jeff Smith</b><br>
              <b>By Gordon Duff</b><br>
            </div>
            <b><br>
            </b>...It appears that Maxwell’s first two formulas describe
            what gravity is, and his second two formulas describe what
            light or transverse radio waves are. This is according to
            Hertz’ own notes!!!<br>
            <br>
            This is also confirmed by J.J. Thompson and T.T. Brown’s
            work on electrostatics....<br>
            <br>
            Here is the simple science / math part.:<br>
            <br>
            1. Gravity is non-rotational. It has no spin or rotation;
            therefore it is not a wave of any type and never can be.
            Only transverse waves have rotation or curl as it is called.
            Light spins. Gravity is static and does not possess spin.
            This is because it is a vector force field only. Vector
            fields do not posses spin, rotation or curl.<br>
            <br>
            2. Gravity is a static vector field of force. I.E. a flow of
            current from the sky towards the center of the Earth. You
            can also say it is a difference in potential or a voltage
            drop. Therefore it is static and flows in one direction
            only. It is not scalar and has no spin, rotation or curl.
            This is why gravity is always attractive and never repulsive
            on Earth.<br>
            <br>
            3. It is not Scalar but it is a type of Scalar field. I.E.
            the field varies from zero in outer space to 100% at sea
            level but the field always has a constant vector amplitude
            and direction. I.E. its field intensity or force is always
            in the same direction and level, everywhere, when measured
            in a closed space. Like Einstein’s elevator.<br>
            <br>
            4. Its Gradient is negative. Anti-gravity has a positive
            Gradient or what is called an “Over Gradient”.<br>
            <br>
            5. According to J.J. Thomas and T.T. Brown, electrostatic
            levitation is a form of anti-gravity because it uses an
            electrical over-gradient to cancel the effect of gravity by
            pushing out the magnetic lines of force, creating a form of
            magnetic buoyancy.<br>
            <br>
            6. J.J. Thompson also states that the presence of air
            surrounding an object of mass interferes with the ability of
            an electrostatic charge to deflect it. The effect was
            heavily researched with vacuum tubes, x-rays, cathode ray
            tubes, etc. back in the late 1900’s by everybody but they
            missed the gravity part that was right in front of them
            until the Germans re-discovered the effect in WW2...<br>

            Ekomille is an eco friendly, modern, highly effective system
            for rodent control. The device enables the continuous
            captures of rats and mice ensuring hygiene and safety. The
            traditional means of deratization are very noxious for human
            health because of the poisons used in baits and because of
            the severe infections caused by carcasses when scattered in
            the environment. Ekomille solves completely the problem
            trough the only use of natural feed. Moreover the device
            withholds the carcasses. Proper to each kind of environment,
            Ekomille can be used in both internal or external areas. It
            ensures respect of the HACCP regulations and is ideal for
            the food industry.<b><br>

            <b>Abstract<br>
            </b>Our brain is not a “stand alone” information processing
            organ: it acts as a central part of our integral nervous
            system with recurrent information exchange with the entire
            organism and the cosmos. In this study, the brain is
            conceived to be embedded in a holographic structured field
            that interacts with resonant sensitive structures in the
            various cell types in our body. In order to explain earlier
            reported ultra-rapid brain responses and effective operation
            of the meta-stable neural system, a field-receptive mental
            workspace is proposed to be communicating with the brain.
            Our integral nervous system is seen as a dedicated neural
            transmission and multi-cavity network that, in a non-dual
            manner, interacts with the proposed supervening
            meta-cognitive domain. Among others, it is integrating
            discrete patterns of eigen-frequencies of photonic/solitonic
            waves, thereby continuously updating a time-symmetric global
            memory space of the individual. Its toroidal organization
            allows the coupling of gravitational, dark energy,
            zero-point energy field (ZPE) as well as earth magnetic
            fields energies and transmits wave information into brain
            tissue, that thereby is instrumental in high speed conscious
            and sub-conscious information processing. We propose that
            the supposed field-receptive workspace, in a mutual
            interaction with the whole nervous system, generates
            self-consciousness and is conceived as operating from a 4th
            spatial dimension (hyper-sphere). Its functional structure
            is adequately defined by the geometry of the torus, that is
            envisioned as a basic unit (operator) of space-time. The
            latter is instrumental in collecting the pattern of discrete
            soliton frequencies that provided an algorithm for coherent
            life processes, as earlier identified by us. It is
            postulated that consciousness in the entire universe arises
            through, scale invariant, nested toroidal coupling of
            various energy fields, that may include quantum error
            correction. In the brain of the human species, this takes
            the form of the proposed holographic workspace, that
            collects active information in a ”brain event horizon”,
            representing an internal and fully integral model of the
            self. This brain-supervening workspace is equipped to
            convert integrated coherent wave energies into attractor
            type/standing waves that guide the related cortical template
            to a higher coordination of reflection and action as well as
            network synchronicity, as required for conscious states. In
            relation to its scale-invariant global character, we find
            support for a universal information matrix, that was
            extensively described earlier, as a supposed implicate order
            as well as in a spectrum of space-time theories in current
            physics. The presence of a field-receptive resonant
            workspace, associated with, but not reducible to, our brain,
            may provide an interpretation framework for widely reported,
            but poorly understood transpersonal conscious states and
            algorithmic origin of life. It also points out the deep
            connection of mankind with the cosmos and our major
            responsibility for the future of our planet.<br>

            <b><br>
            </b>Using renewable electricity to convert CO/CO2 into
            liquid products is touted as a sustainable process to
            produce fuels and chemicals, yet requires further advances
            in electrocatalyst understanding, development and device
            integration. The roughness factor of an electrode has
            generally been used to increase total rates of production,
            although rarely as a means to improve selectivity. Here we
            demonstrate that increasing the roughness factor of Cu
            electrodes is an effective design principle to direct the
            selectivity of CO reduction towards multicarbon oxygenates
            at low overpotentials and concurrently suppressing
            hydrocarbon and hydrogen production. The nanostructured Cu
            electrodes are capable of achieving almost full selectivity
            towards multicarbon oxygenates at an electrode potential of
            only –0.23?V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. The
            successful implementation of this catalytic system has
            enabled an excellent CO reduction performance and elucidated
            viable pathways to improve the energy efficiency towards
            liquid fuels in high-power conversion electrolysers.<b><br>

            <b>Abstract</b><br>
            To date, copper is the only heterogeneous catalyst that has
            shown a propensity to produce valuable hydrocarbons and
            alcohols, such as ethylene and ethanol, from electrochemical
            CO2 reduction (CO2R). There are variety of factors that
            impact CO2R activity and selectivity, including the catalyst
            surface structure, morphology, composition, the choice of
            electrolyte ions and pH, and the electrochemical cell
            design. Many of these factors are often intertwined, which
            can complicate catalyst discovery and design efforts. Here
            we take a broad and historical view of these different
            aspects and their complex interplay in CO2R catalysis on Cu,
            with the purpose of providing new insights, critical
            evaluations, and guidance to the field with regard to
            research directions and best practices. First, we describe
            the various experimental probes and complementary
            theoretical methods that have been used to discern the
            mechanisms by which products are formed, and next we present
            our current understanding of the complex reaction networks
            for CO2R on Cu. We then analyze two key methods that have
            been used in attempts to alter the activity and selectivity
            of Cu: nanostructuring and the formation of bimetallic
            electrodes. Finally, we offer some perspectives on the
            future outlook for electrochemical CO2R.<br>

            </div>
            <b><br>
            </b>Arabella Advisors is a for-profit consulting firm based
            in Washington, D.C. Eric Kessler, the Clinton administration
            staffer who founded Arabella in 2005, previously worked at
            the League of Conservation Voters, which the Center for
            Public Integrity calls a “‘dark money’ heavyweight.”<br>
            Arabella operates four in-house nonprofits with interlocking
            boards:<br>
            <br>
            New Venture Fund<br>
            Sixteen Thirty Fund<br>
            Hopewell Fund<br>
            Windward Fund<br>
            <br>
            Those in-house nonprofits have created over 300 pop-up
            groups that have no legal existence but are just logos,
            websites, and political ads. They pop into existence to
            serve a political agenda and pop out of existence when no
            longer needed. They include<br>
            <br>
            Demand Justice<br>
            Fix the Court<br>
            Health Care for America Now<br>
            North Carolinians for a Fair Economy<br>
            Restore Public Trust<br>
            All Above All and All Above All Action Fund<br>
            <br>
            These fake groups appear to have popular support, when in
            fact their fuel is “dark money” from the Left’s mega-donors.
            Arabella tells potential customers its existing donors’
            assets exceed $100 billion.<br>
            Though Arabella receives hardly any press coverage, vast
            streams of&nbsp; “dark money” pour through its in-house
            nonprofits:$582 million in 2017 alone (the most recent year
            available).<br>
            Combined, that revenue for Arabella’s four nonprofits would
            have made it the 22nd biggest charity in 2016 — larger than
            the ACLU, Planned Parenthood Federation, or the Clinton
            Foundation.<br>
            Business is booming: Revenues for Arabella’s nonprofits
            soared 392% from 2013-2017, totaling $1.6 billion for those
            years.<br>
            The Democracy Alliance — co-founded by financier George
            Soros and now the Left’s most powerful donor cabal — is an
            Arabella customer. The Alliance has created multiple “funds”
            in the Arabella network that pool tens of millions of
            dollars for political fights.<br>
            Darker than dark: Because Arabella uses pop-up groups rather
            than separate legal organizations, those groups disclose far
            less information than other “dark money” entities.<br>

                age’ can be reversed</b><br>
              <b>by Alison Abbott</b><br>
            </div>
            <b><br>
            </b>In a small trial, drugs seemed to rejuvenate the body’s
            ‘epigenetic clock’, which tracks a person’s biological age.
            <br>
            <br>
            A small clinical study in California has suggested for the
            first time that it might be possible to reverse the body’s
            epigenetic clock, which measures a person’s biological age.<br>
            <br>
            For one year, nine healthy volunteers took a cocktail of
            three common drugs — growth hormone and two diabetes
            medications — and on average shed 2.5 years of their
            biological ages, measured by analysing marks on a person’s
            genomes. The participants’ immune systems also showed signs
            of rejuvenation.<br>
            <br>
            The results were a surprise even to the trial organizers —
            but researchers caution that the findings are preliminary
            because the trial was small and did not include a control
            arm.<br>
            <br>
            “I’d expected to see slowing down of the clock, but not a
            reversal,” says geneticist Steve Horvath at the University
            of California, Los Angeles, who conducted the epigenetic
            analysis. “That felt kind of futuristic.” The findings were
            published on 5 September in Aging Cell1.<br>
            <br>
            “It may be that there is an effect,” says cell biologist
            Wolfgang Wagner at the University of Aachen in Germany. “But
            the results are not rock solid because the study is very
            small and not well controlled.”<b><br>
            </b><b><br>
              Marks of life<br>
            </b>The epigenetic clock relies on the body’s epigenome,
            which comprises chemical modifications, such as methyl
            groups, that tag DNA. The pattern of these tags changes
            during the course of life, and tracks a person’s biological
            age, which can lag behind or exceed chronological age.<br>
            <br>
            Scientists construct epigenetic clocks by selecting sets of
            DNA-methylation sites across the genome. In the past few
            years, Horvath — a pioneer in epigenetic-clock research —
            has developed some of the most accurate ones.<br>
            <br>
            The latest trial was designed mainly to test whether growth
            hormone could be used safely in humans to restore tissue in
            the thymus gland. The gland, which is in the chest between
            the lungs and the breastbone, is crucial for efficient
            immune function. White blood cells are produced in bone
            marrow and then mature inside the thymus, where they become
            specialized T cells that help the body to fight infections
            and cancers. But the gland starts to shrink after puberty
            and increasingly becomes clogged with fat.<br>
            <br>
            Evidence from animal and some human studies shows that
            growth hormone stimulates regeneration of the thymus. But
            this hormone can also promote diabetes, so the trial
            included two widely used anti-diabetic drugs,
            dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and metformin, in the
            treatment cocktail.<br>
            <br>
            The Thymus Regeneration, Immunorestoration and Insulin
            Mitigation (TRIIM) trial tested 9 white men between 51 and
            65 years of age. It was led by immunologist Gregory Fahy,
            the chief scientific officer and co-founder of Intervene
            Immune in Los Angeles, and was approved by the US Food and
            Drug Administration in May 2015. It began a few months later
            at Stanford Medical Center in Palo Alto, California.<br>
            <br>
            Fahy’s fascination with the thymus goes back to 1986, when
            he read a study in which scientists transplanted
            growth-hormone-secreting cells into rats, apparently
            rejuvenating their immune systems. He was surprised that no
            one seemed to have followed up on the result with a clinical
            trial. A decade later, at age 46, he treated himself for a
            month with growth hormone and DHEA, and found some
            regeneration of his own thymus.<br>

            &nbsp;the TRIIM trial, the scientists took blood samples
            from participants during the treatment period. Tests showed
            that blood-cell count was rejuvenated in each of the
            participants. The researchers also used magnetic resonance
            imaging (MRI) to determine the composition of the thymus at
            the start and end of the study. They found that in seven
            participants, accumulated fat had been replaced with
            regenerated thymus tissue.<br>
            <b><br>
              Rewinding the clock<br>
            </b>Checking the effect of the drugs on the participants’
            epigenetic clocks was an afterthought. The clinical study
            had finished when Fahy approached Horvath to conduct an
            analysis.<br>
            <br>
            Horvath used four different epigenetic clocks to assess each
            patient’s biological age, and he found significant reversal
            for each trial participant in all of the tests. “This told
            me that the biological effect of the treatment was robust,”
            he says. What’s more, the effect persisted in the six
            participants who provided a final blood sample six months
            after stopping the trial, he says.<br>
            <br>
            “Because we could follow the changes within each individual,
            and because the effect was so very strong in each of them, I
            am optimistic,” says Horvath.<br>
            <br>
            Researchers are already testing metformin for its potential
            to protect against common age-related diseases, such as
            cancer and heart disease. Fahy says that the three drugs in
            the cocktail might contribute separately to the effect on
            biological ageing through unique mechanisms. Intervene
            Immune is planning a larger study that will include people
            of different age groups and ethnicities, and women.<br>
            <br>
            Regenerating the thymus could be useful in people who have
            underactive immune systems, including older people, he says.
            Pneumonia and other infectious diseases are a major cause of
            death in people older than 70.<br>
            <br>
            Cancer immunologist Sam Palmer at the Heriot-Watt University
            in Edinburgh says that it is exciting to see the expansion
            of immune cells in the blood. This “has huge implications
            not just for infectious disease but also for cancer and
            ageing in general”.<br>

                immunosenescent trends in humans</b><br>
              <b>Gregory M. Fahy, et al.</b><br>
            </div>
            <b>Abstract<br>
            </b>Epigenetic “clocks” can now surpass chronological age in
            accuracy for estimating biological age. Here, we use four
            such age estimators to show that epigenetic aging can be
            reversed in humans. Using a protocol intended to regenerate
            the thymus, we observed protective immunological changes,
            improved risk indices for many age-related diseases, and a
            mean epigenetic age approximately 1.5 years less than
            baseline after 1 year of treatment (-2.5-year change
            compared to no treatment at the end of the study). The rate
            of epigenetic aging reversal relative to chronological age
            accelerated from -1.6 year/year from 0–9 month to -6.5
            year/year from 9–12 month. The GrimAge predictor of human
            morbidity and mortality showed a 2-year decrease in
            epigenetic vs. chronological age that persisted six months
            after discontinuing treatment. This is to our knowledge the
            first report of an increase, based on an epigenetic age
            estimator, in predicted human lifespan by means of a
            currently accessible aging intervention...<br>
            <br>
            For these reasons, we conducted what may be the first human
            clinical trial designed to reverse aspects of human aging,
            the TRIIM (Thymus Regeneration, Immunorestoration, and
            Insulin Mitigation) trial, in 2015–2017. The purpose of the
            TRIIM trial was to investigate the possibility of using
            recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) to prevent or
            reverse signs of immunosenescence in a population of 51- to
            65-year-old putatively healthy men, which represents the age
            range that just precedes the collapse of the TCR repertoire.
            rhGH was used based on prior evidence that growth hormone
            (GH) has thymotrophic and immune reconstituting effects in
            animals (Kelley et al., 1986) and human HIV patients
            (Napolitano et al., 2008; Plana et al., 2011). Because
            GH-induced hyperinsulinemia (Marcus et al., 1990) is
            undesirable and might affect thymic regeneration and
            immunological reconstitution, we combined rhGH with both
            dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and metformin in an attempt to
            limit the “diabetogenic” effect of GH (Fahy, 2003, 2010;
            Weiss, Villareal, Fontana, Han, &amp; Holloszy, 2011). DHEA
            has many effects, in both men and women, that oppose
            deleterious effects of normal aging (Cappola et al., 2009;
            Forti et al., 2012; Shufelt et al., 2010; Weiss et al.,
            2011). Metformin is a powerful calorie restriction mimetic
            in aging mice (Dhahbi, Mote, Fahy, &amp; Spindler, 2005) and
            has been proposed as a candidate for slowing aging in humans
            (Barzilai, Crandall, Kritchevsky, &amp; Espeland, 2016).
            Neither DHEA (Riley, Fitzmaurice, &amp; Regelson, 1990) nor
            metformin are known to have any thymotrophic effects of
            their own... <b><br>
              <br>
              DISCUSSION<br>
            </b>The TRIIM trial was designed to investigate the
            possibility of thymus regeneration and reversion of
            immunosenescent trends in healthy aging men while minimizing
            side effects and any possible risks. Our results support the
            feasibility of this goal but unexpectedly also bring to
            light robust evidence that regression of multiple aspects
            and biomarkers of aging is possible in man. These two
            observations may be related.<br>
            <br>
            Thymus regeneration and reactivation by growth hormone
            administration have been established in aging rats and dogs
            by restoration of youthful thymic histology (Goff, Roth,
            Arp, &amp; al., e., 1987; Kelley et al., 1986) and by
            reversal of age-related immune deficits (Kelley et al.,
            1986). In humans, the existence of surviving thymic tissue
            after the age of about 54, which is required for successful
            thymus regeneration in older individuals, has been
            questioned (Simanovsky, Hiller, Loubashevsky, &amp;
            Rozovsky, 2012). Available reports indicating increased
            thymic CT density and immunological improvements induced by
            rhGH in HIV patients (Napolitano et al., 2008; Plana et al.,
            2011), whose thymi are physiologically unusual (McCune et
            al., 1998), are silent on whether regeneration was observed
            in individuals over the age of 50. The present study now
            establishes highly significant evidence of thymic
            regeneration in normal aging men accompanied by improvements
            in a variety of disease risk factors and age-related
            immunological parameters as well as significant correlations
            between TFFF and favorable changes in monocyte percentages
            and the LMR, independent of age up to the age of 65 at the
            onset of treatment. These observations are consistent with
            the known ability of growth hormone to stimulate
            hematopoiesis and thymic epithelial cell proliferation
            (Savino, 2007). Our finding of an increase in FGF-21 levels
            after 12 months of treatment suggests that thymic
            regeneration by the present treatment may be mediated in
            part by this cytokine (Youm, Horvath, Mangelsdorf, Kliewer,
            &amp; Dixit, 2016), which we believe is a novel finding...<b><br>

                rock nitrogen sources in Earth’s surface environment</b><br>
              <b>B. Z. Houlton, et al.</b><br>
            </div>
            <b> </b><b>Freed from a rocky embrace</b><br>
            Nitrogen availability is a central controller of terrestrial
            plant growth and, thereby, of the carbon cycle and global
            climate change. It has been widely assumed that the
            atmosphere is the main source of terrestrial nitrogen input.
            Surprisingly, Houlton et al. now show that bedrock is just
            as large a nitrogen source across major sectors of the
            global terrestrial environment. They used three diverse and
            largely independent assessments of the nitrogen mobility and
            reactivity of rocks in the surface environment. These
            approaches yielded convergent estimates pointing to the
            equal importance of the atmosphere and bedrock as nitrogen
            sources.<b><br>
              <br>
              Abstract<br>
            </b>Nitrogen availability is a pivotal control on
            terrestrial carbon sequestration and global climate change.
            Historical and contemporary views assume that nitrogen
            enters Earth’s land-surface ecosystems from the atmosphere.
            Here we demonstrate that bedrock is a nitrogen source that
            rivals atmospheric nitrogen inputs across major sectors of
            the global terrestrial environment. Evidence drawn from the
            planet’s nitrogen balance, geochemical proxies, and our
            spatial weathering model reveal that ~19 to 31 teragrams of
            nitrogen are mobilized from near-surface rocks annually.
            About 11 to 18 teragrams of this nitrogen are chemically
            weathered in situ, thereby increasing the unmanaged
            (preindustrial) terrestrial nitrogen balance from 8 to 26%.
            These findings provide a global perspective to reconcile
            Earth’s nitrogen budget, with implications for
            nutrient-driven controls over the terrestrial carbon sink.<br>
            <br>
            Nitrogen (N) availability controls many aspects of ecosystem
            structure and function on land and in the sea (1, 2). This
            includes strong, N-driven effects on Earth’s climate system

            During the American Revolution<br>
            <br>
            When Congress’ approval rating was in the double-digits,
            polls showed that it was less popular among the American
            public than cockroaches, lice, root canals, colonoscopies,
            traffic jams, used car salesmen, Genghis Khan, Communism,
            North Korea, BP during the Gulf Oil Spill, Nixon during
            Watergate or King George during the American Revolution.<br>
            <br>
            An October poll by Public Policy Polling showed that
            Congress is less popular among the American people than
            zombies, witches, dog poop, potholes, toenail fungus and
            hemorrhoids.&nbsp; That was when Congress’ approval rating
            was 8%.<br>
            <br>
            A new Economist/YouGov.com poll shows that Congress has hit
            an all-time low: only 6% of the American public approves of
            Congress.<br>
            <br>
            To put this in perspective, Wikipedia notes: "Historians
            have estimated that between 15 and 20 percent of the
            European-American population of the colonies were
            Loyalists."<br>
            <br>
            In other words, around 3 times as many colonists supported
            King George as the 6% which support our own Congress today.<br>
            <br>
            Moreover, a May 2013 poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University
            found that 29% of registered voters think that armed
            revolution may be “necessary” in the next couple of years.
            In other words, the number of Americans who think that armed
            revolution may be “needed” dwarf the number of Americans who
            approve of the job that Congress is doing.<br>
            <br>
            Even back in 2010, Rasmussen noted that only a small
            minority of the American people think that the government
            has the consent of the governed, and that the sentiment was
            “pre-revolutionary”.<br>

            <div align="center"><b>Atomically thin minerals show promise
                as proton conducting membranes for green technologies</b><br>
            </div>
            <b><br>
            </b>Researchers at The University of Manchester discovered
            that atomically- thin micas – the name given to a type of
            common mineral found in soil – are excellent proton
            conductors. This surprising result is important for the use
            of 2D materials in applications such as fuel cells and other
            hydrogen-related technologies.<br>
            <br>
            Previously, the Manchester researchers led by Professor
            Andre Geim and Dr Marcelo Lozada-Hidalgo found that one-atom
            thick materials like graphene are highly permeable to
            protons, nuclei of hydrogen atoms. However, they also found
            that other 2D materials such as molybdenum sulphide (MoS2),
            that were just three atoms thick, were completely
            impermeable to protons. These results suggested that only
            one-atom thick crystals could be permeable to protons.<br>
            <br>
            Writing in Nature Nanotechnology, the team have shown that
            protons can easily permeate through few-layered micas
            despite the fact that they are 10 times thicker than
            graphene. Micas, like graphite, consist of crystal layers
            stacked on top of each other and can be sliced down to a
            single layer. The team isolated one of these layers and
            found that it was 100 times more permeable to protons than
            graphene.<br>
            <br>
            At first glance, this result seems impossible because micas
            are too thick for protons to permeate – they are much
            thicker than monolayer MoS2 that is completely impermeable
            to protons. However, micas can be thought of as crystal
            slabs pierced by tubular channels. These channels aren’t
            empty but filled with hydroxyl groups that are like the
            proton-conducting one-dimensional chains in water. Protons
            jump along these chains, turning the material into an
            excellent proton conductor.<br>
            <br>
            “There is a lack of proton-conducting materials that can
            reliably operate between 100°C and 500°C. However, this is
            the sweet spot temperature range for optimum operation of
            fuel cells and other hydrogen technologies. Atomically-thin
            micas work rather well in this temperature range – they
            merit attention from this perspective." -- Dr Marcelo
            Lozada-Hidalgo<br>
            <br>
            Lucas Mogg, a PhD student on the project and the first
            author of the paper said: “We found that proton conductivity
            in atomically-thin micas is 10 to 100 times higher than in
            graphene. It is encouraging because graphene is already
            being considered as a promising proton conducting material.
            Our results show micas could be even more promising – not
            least because they are abundant and inexpensive.”<br>
            <br>
            Professor Andre Geim said: “The result also implies that
            many other 2D materials could be turned into proton
            conductors. Our strategy is not limited to protons or micas.
            Many more 2D crystals with atomic-scale channels similar to
            those in micas could be explored, hopefully bringing
            unexpected phenomena and new applications in the field of
            proton and ionic conductors.”<br>
            <br>
            The researchers also found that micas become particularly
            highly conductive in a temperature range that has been
            notoriously inaccessible for the related technologies.<br>
            <br>
            Dr Marcelo Lozada-Hidalgo said: “There is a lack of
            proton-conducting materials that can reliably operate
            between 100°C and 500°C. However, this is the sweet spot
            temperature range for optimum operation of fuel cells and
            other hydrogen technologies. Atomically-thin micas work
            rather well in this temperature range – they merit attention
            from this perspective.”<br>
            <br>
            Furthermore, the researchers say they are now working on
            building a mica prototype membrane that is big enough to be
            tested under industrial conditions. They are also optimistic
            about the possibilities this research open in terms of
            fundamental research. The work shows that the field of
            two-dimensional ionic conductors holds great promise due to
            the wealth of other crystals that could be turned into ionic
            and proton conductors.<b><br>

            </b>Twitter has suspended multiple large Cuban media
            accounts for reasons the social media platform has yet to
            explain as of this writing, a move which journalist Dan
            Cohen has described as “the equivalent of silencing CNN,
            Fox, WaPo and NPR’s accounts” for that nation. The Union of
            Cuban Journalists has denounced the move as censorship.<br>
            <br>
            Last month we saw Twitter suspend hundreds of accounts which
            it claims originated in mainland China for engaging in
            “covert, manipulative behaviors” against the Hong Kong
            protests, with Facebook and Google/YouTube following suit in
            the creepy, uniform coordination we’ve come to expect
            between these social media giants. In June of this year
            Twitter removed thousands of accounts it claims were
            associated with the governments of Iran, Russia and
            Venezuela, as well as 130 accounts reportedly tied to the
            Catalan independence movement in Spain. In May Twitter
            removed 2,800 of what it claimed were “inauthentic accounts
            originating in Iran.” Earlier this year, Twitter and
            Facebook coordinated with each other to remove hundreds of
            accounts they claim were tied to “coordinated influence
            operations” in Iran, Russia, and Venezuela.<br>

            entirely. They did not delete it as far as I know, but it's
            a fat chance you'll ever find it and they refused to serve
            it to an Android device. Maybe by the time I tried it on a

            Since 911, we have been lied to about how the World Trade
            center was built, and Donald Trump, one of the greatest
            architectual people of our time stated the exact opposite of
            what the MSM said.<br>
            <br>
            MSM: The steel beams on the outside of the building were
            merely ornamental and a plane could go right through them.<br>
            <br>
            Donald Trump: I was taken through the WTC personally by an
            engineer that built it. The steel beams on the outside of
            the building were incredibly strong, and were the strongest
            part of the building. It seems impossible a plane would ever
            go through them. Bombs must have been used in addition to
            the planes.<b><br>

                Deadly Lung Illness</b><br>
              <b>by Vladimir Pesnya</b><br>

            <b><br>
            </b>State and federal health officials have found the same
            chemical in samples of marijuana-based vaping products used
            by people sickened in different parts of the country and who
            used different vaping brands in recent weeks.<br>
            <br>
            Investigators at the US Food and Drug Administration found
            an oil derived from vitamin E in cannabis products in
            samples collected from patients who mysteriously fell ill to
            lung disease across the United States. FDA officials shared
            that information with state health officials during a
            telephone briefing this week, several officials who took
            part in the call told the Washington Post.<br>
            <br>
            That same chemical was also found in nearly all cannabis
            samples from patients who fell ill in New York in recent
            weeks, a state health department spokeswoman said.<br>
            <br>
            Health officials said it is too early to know whether this
            is causing the injuries, noting that the oil is the first
            common element found in samples from across the country.<br>
            <br>
            “We knew from earlier testing by New York that they had
            found vitamin E acetate, but to have FDA talk about it from
            their overall testing plan, that was the most remarkable
            thing that we heard,” one official who listened to the
            briefing but was not authorized to speak publicly, told the
            Post. <br>
            <br>
            An FDA spokesman said the agency is “looking into potential
            leads regarding any particular constituent or compound that
            may be at issue.” The FDA is analyzing samples for a broad
            range of chemicals, including nicotine, THC, other
            cannabinoids, “cutting agents” that may be used to dilute
            liquids, other additives, pesticides, opioids, poisons and
            toxins.<br>
            <br>
            “The number of samples received continues to increase and we
            now have over 100 samples for testing,” FDA spokesman
            Michael Felberbaum said Thursday. <br>
            <br>
            The FDA also told state officials Wednesday that its lab
            tests found nothing unusual in nicotine products that had
            been collected from sick patients, another person who took
            part in the call said.<br>
            <br>
            Vitamin E is found naturally in foods like canola oil, olive
            oil and almonds. The oil derived from the vitamin, known as
            vitamin E acetate, is commonly available as a nutritional
            supplement and is used in topical skin treatments as a
            vitamin supplement. Its oil-like properties, however, can be
            dangerous when inhaled, and could be associated with the
            kinds of respiratory symptoms that many patients have
            reported: cough, shortness of breath and chest pain,
            officials said.<br>
            <br>
            Laura Crotty Alexander, lung inflammation and e-cigarette
            researcher at the University of California in San Diego
            School of Medicine, said it’s not clear whether the chemical
            itself or its byproducts could be toxic.<br>
            <br>
            “We haven’t looked at the toxicity of vitamin E in the
            lungs,” she said. “The lungs are designed to exchange gas
            molecules; they’re not designed to be exposed to other
            chemicals.”<br>
            <br>
            When the lung cells die, that often provokes an inflammatory
            response, and “other cells need to come in and clean up the
            cell debris,” Alexander said, adding that extra cells – like
            vitamin E cells – could “get in the way of gas exchange,”
            making it more difficult for oxygen to get into a person’s
            bloodstream. The inflammation can cause the liquid to
            accumulate in the lungs, making it difficult for someone to
            breathe, she said.<b><br>

            produces cycles of insolation reflected in climate records.
            Conversely, these climate records can be used to infer
            changes in the dynamics of the Solar System, which is
            inherently chaotic and not always similarly periodic. A
            particular obstacle is the lack of well-defined planetary
            orbital constraints between 50 and 60 million years ago.
            Zeebe and Lourens found an astronomical solution for that
            interval showing that the Solar System experienced a
            specific resonance transition pattern. These data provide a
            measure of the duration of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal

            Welcome to the Science of the Stars, the Physics of the Gods
            or the Energy Construct of the Universe. Here you will find
            in easy to understand terms, how a new Atomic Structure is
            required to explain the anomalies of science and pictures to
            show some of the 1000’s of experiments utilizing
            Electro-Magnetic restructuring of Water. This is NOT
            electrolysis. This is Magnetic Field Creation for the
            observation of Field interactions upon all of what we call
            matter. Magnetic properties of Water can best be described
            as ‘memories’ and ‘frequencies’ and experimental results
            obtained, challenges the accepted foundations of physics,
            chemistry and science. This Magnetic Field Science of Water
            opens up a plethora of new ideas and inventions, These
            Magnetic Field Generators or “Cells” have many applications
            and no field of human endeavor is exempt. Health, healing,
            water purification and energy production but to name a few.<br>

            <br>
            What we have here is Pure Ocean Sea Water hand harvested at
            High Tide near Ballina NSW Australia.<br>
            <br>
            This is known to the Ancient Alchemists as Manna, where Sea
            Water can be made to be consumed by the gallon a day. there
            is no recommended daily dose. Its just water.<br>
            <br>
            As this is 'food' for your gut microbes, one ounce or a shot
            glass full a day added to an 8 ounce glass of Bottled at the
            Source Spring Water is sufficient to be of benefit.&nbsp;
            This bottle is 12 days supply. If using for seed germination
            enhancement, it can be diluted even further. It can of
            course, be diluted even more when feeding your gut microbes.
            This product is designed to aid your Gastro Intestinal
            Microbiome as well as soil Micro Biome. <br>
            <br>
            It is made with Field Science. The Science of creating
            Magnetic Fields to restructure liquids. (also known as
            joecellwaterscience Technology) It can be used solely to
            water house plants. (think about that for a minute... using
            a battery to make sea water better than most river waters
            for irrigation purposes) One car battery could make millions
            of gallons. Star Tech now available.<br>
            <br>
            This White has only had a DC Battery applied to the Sea
            Water for just a few seconds. The salts or "Frequencies"
            'drop out' much like ormus drops out only we don't use any
            Caustic Solution to raise the pH. We use the Science of
            Magnetics to raise the pH of the solution.<br>
            <br>
            This White is Med/Lab Grade. Meaning it has had a Secondary
            charge applied to the Liquid to Finalize it or permanently
            give the Ocean Water a New Memory. A Memory you can TASTE as
            it no longer tastes 'salty'.<br>
            <br>
            If you ever have had anything to do with ORMUS the Wet
            method, this product is FAR superior in all its application
            and is not known, in 10 years of trials on plants, microbes
            and animals, to have an adverse effect or other such
            symptoms that Long term Ormus eaters show with the Caustic
            Wet Method. Homeopathy Principles of the Wet Method Ormus,
            clearly state, that the Memory or Frequency of Caustic Lye
            MUST still be present in the Ormus 'dropout' that is claimed
            to be beneficial. No Real Alchemist would claim caustic Lye
            added to sea salt is Homeopathy. Its entirely a chemical
            concoction.<br>
            <br>
            Given that everything that passes through the Gut is eaten
            by Microbes, the dosage of Ormus of a teaspoon a day diluted
            in a gallon of water to blend out the caustic frequencies is
            all that one can 'eat' and not suffer from noticeable
            adverse reactions. With Ocean White, there is NO additives
            to impart Toxic Frequency Memories. This Ocean White product
            can be consumed at the rate of many full glasses a day. It
            has turned Sea Water into a plant and animal Food-Like
            Liquid. It must be Tasted to be Appreciated. It feeds
            Microbes.<br>
            <br>
            Something to consider about the Spiel of Ormus sellers.....
            Given that the white drop-out or ORMUS the wet method made
            with Caustic to raise the pH, the white drop-out is WATER
            INSOLUBLE. So when its taken orally, it 'theoretically'
            passes through the gut and exits as excrement. Being water
            insoluble it just cant be dissolved by water so if the
            stomach acids react with the ormus white, its no longer
            ormus? yes? So how does the Body absorb this chemical
            concoction? The same way it utilizes everything thats
            ingested... Gut Microbes eat it. This isn't explained by any
            Ormus seller. It would appear ormus sellers have little
            understandings of how the human body operates on 'energy'

            <br>
            When making Elixirs and trying to pass them off as Manna or
            some mythical Egyptian essence, it is wise to know how the
            Gut Biome figures in the health of a human being. This
            method of using Baghdad Museum Batteries and Magnetic
            Current to make Ocean Milk or Manna (We call it White) is
            how the Ancient Alchemists did it. It literally makes FOOD
            from Sea Water to feed Gut Microbes. Food from a Heavenly
            source. Food from the 'fingers' of God (lightning)<br>
            <br>
            Don't be fooled by by quack Homeopathy or poor
            understandings of what happens in the Gastrointestinal
            tract. The Gut Brain link and the role of Microbes in eating
            EVERYTHING that enters the GI is only JUST being understood
            by Biologists. Pseudo alchemists will try to sell you

            <b>WHITE OR ELECTRO-MAGNETICALLY CHARGED OCEAN WATER.</b><br>
            <br>
            Otherwise known as Ormus or Ocean Milk or Orbitally
            Rearranged Monoatomic Elements<br>
            <br>
            The traditional process for making ORMUS has been to raise
            the pH of ocean salt water so as a ‘drop out’ of white or
            creamy solution falls to the bottom of the container. One of
            the ways to do this is using a very caustic solution and
            then a thorough ‘washing’ process to remove the caustic
            solution.<br>
            <br>
            The resultant “Ormus” can then be experimented with on
            organic life, both plants and animals.<br>
            <br>
            We state that the Homeopathy of traditional Wet Method Ormus
            retains the Caustic memories in the product.<br>
            <br>
            The essential part to this process is careful monitoring of
            the pH. But what actually is pH?<br>
            <br>
            Potential Hydrogen or pH with the opposite and equal being
            Oxygen Reduction Potential {ORP} has been calibrated from
            mans experimentations, where a scale is used with the
            balance or neutral of these two ‘measurements’ of fluids, as
            a “7” on the scale, with a below 7 reading ‘acidic’ and
            above 7 being ‘alkaline’.<br>
            <br>
            In Particle science terms; pH stands for “potential of
            Hydrogen” and refers to the concentration of hydrogen ions
            (H+) in water or whatever liquid is being measured. Hydrogen
            can also be made by the Negative electrode in water
            electrolysis. This represents North Pole Magnetism.<br>
            <br>
            In Particle science terms, ORP which is a measure, in
            millivolts, of the tendency of a chemical substance to
            oxidize or reduce another chemical substance.&nbsp;
            Oxidation is the loss of electrons by an atom, molecule, or
            ion. Reduction is the net gain of electrons by an atom,
            molecule, or ion. <br>
            <br>
            In Field Science terms, where Magnetic Current or Magnetic
            Energy replaces the “theoretical electron” terminology, this
            Magnetic Current can have an effect on water to ‘mimic’
            Hydrogen and Oxygen potential.<br>
            <br>
            In Field Science terms if the electrode configuration or
            “array” of electrodes {Antenna} are such that the Magnetic
            Current places a Negative charge in the water as verses an
            electrode “array” that places a Positive charge in the
            water, it is possible to duplicate or control the potential
            Hydrogen effect in the water in the same way as a caustic
            solution added to water will change the pH of the water.<br>
            <br>
            With Field Science principles of creating Magnetic Fields in
            water through specially designed antenna arrays with many
            electrodes in a “format” verses just two electrodes in
            ‘electrolysis’, one can control the pH and ORP of the water
            after “charging” with Magnetic Current {plasma electricity}
            by making the “array” either Positive or Negative, which is
            predetermined by the placement of the electrodes upon the
            Antenna array.<br>
            <br>
            In this way, one can make “Ormus Like” or Ocean WHITE with
            just the addition of Direct Current, eliminating the caustic
            solution and washing procedure by using a Wet Cell Battery
            {12VDC car battery} on a formatted antenna, to create a
            Magnetic Field Charge upon the Magnetic Field Generating
            Array being immersed in the Ocean water. This creates the
            only pure WHITE available in the world today by using Field
            Science of Magnetics to mimic or alter the pH in fluids.<br>

            <br>
            "Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to
            desert," begins Allan Savory in this quietly powerful talk.
            And terrifyingly, it's happening to about two-thirds of the
            world's grasslands, accelerating climate change and causing
            traditional grazing societies to descend into social chaos.
            Savory has devoted his life to stopping it. He now believes
            -- and his work so far shows -- that a surprising factor can
            protect grasslands and even reclaim degraded land that was
            once desert.<br>

            <b>By Victoria Bell</b><b><br>
            </b><b> </b><br>
            A new type of modified wood that can trap heat and then
            release it when needed could help buildings cut down on
            their energy use. <br>
            <br>
            Scientists say that the revolutionary material, which is
            biodegradable, can bear heavy loads and could open the door
            for 'eco-friendly' homes and other buildings.<br>
            <br>
            The researchers, from KTH Royal Institute of Technology in
            Sweden, produced technically transparent wood, which allows
            light to pass through it.<br>
            <br>
            They did this by removing a light-absorbing component called
            lignin from the wood's cell walls and adding polyethylene
            glycol (PEG), which stores heat.<br>
            <br>
            After adding acrylic - which stops the light from bouncing
            around - into the porous wood, the resulting material is
            physically strong and and virtually clear.<br>
            <br>
            The material is not completely transparent but its hazy
            appearance&nbsp; provides enough privacy without shutting
            out external light. <br>
            <br>
            The material is able to absorb heat before it reaches the
            indoor space, making it cooler inside and at night it
            releases the heat indoors.<br>
            <br>
            Céline Montanari, a PhD student student at the University
            said: 'Back in 2016, we showed that transparent wood has
            excellent thermal-insulating properties compared with glass,
            combined with high optical transmittance.<br>
            <br>
            'In this work, we tried to reduce the building energy
            consumption even more by incorporating a material that can
            absorb, store and release heat.'<br>
            <br>
            As economic development progresses worldwide, energy
            consumption has soared.<br>
            <br>
            Much of the energy is used to light, heat and cool homes,
            offices and other buildings.<br>
            <br>
            Glass windows can transmit light, helping to brighten and
            heat homes, but they don't store energy for use when the sun
            goes down.<br>
            <br>
            Three years ago, lead investigator Professor Lars Berglund
            and colleagues at KTH reported an optically transparent wood
            in the journal Biomacromolecules.<br>
            <br>
            The researchers made the material by removing a
            light-absorbing component called lignin from the cell walls
            of balsa wood.<br>
            <br>
            To reduce light scattering, they incorporated acrylic into
            the porous wood scaffold, which also protects from
            humidity.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Ms Montanari said: 'During a sunny day, the material will
            absorb heat before it reaches the indoor space, and the
            indoors will be cooler than outside.<br>
            <br>
            'And at night, the reverse occurs - the PEG becomes solid
            and releases heat indoors so that you can maintain a
            constant temperature in the house.'<br>
            <br>
            She said the team encapsulated PEG within the de-lignified
            wood scaffold, which prevented leakage of the polymer during
            phase transitions. <br>
            <br>
            The researchers say that the transparent wood has the
            potential to be more environmentally friendly than other
            building materials such as plastic, concrete and glass.<br>
            <br>
            In addition to its thermal-storage capabilities, the
            researchers say that the transparent wood could be easier to
            dispose of apart from the acrylic.<br>
            <br>
            Professor Beglund said that the PEG and wood are both
            bio-based and biodegradable.<br>
            <br>
            'The only part that is not biodegradable is the acrylic, but
            this could be replaced by another bio-based polymer.' <br>
            <br>
            The researchers estimate that transparent wood could be
            available for niche applications in interior design in as
            little as five years.<br>
            <br>

            Wood may seem more at home in log cabins than modern
            architecture, but a specially treated type of timber could
            be tomorrow's trendy building material. Today, scientists
            report a new kind of transparent wood that not only
            transmits light, but also absorbs and releases heat,
            potentially saving on energy costs. The material can bear
            heavy loads and is biodegradable, opening the door for its
            eventual use in eco-friendly homes and other buildings.<br>
            <br>
            The researchers will present their results today at the
            American Chemical Society (ACS) Spring 2019 National Meeting
            &amp; Exposition. ACS, the world's largest scientific
            society, is holding the meeting here through Thursday. It
            features nearly 13,000 presentations on a wide range of
            science topics.<br>

            "Back in 2016, we showed that transparent wood has excellent
            thermal-insulating properties compared with glass, combined
            with high optical transmittance," says Céline Montanari, a
            Ph.D. student who is presenting the research at the meeting.
            "In this work, we tried to reduce the building energy
            consumption even more by incorporating a material that can
            absorb, store and release heat."<br>
            <br>
            As economic development progresses worldwide, energy
            consumption has soared. Much of this energy is used to
            light, heat and cool homes, offices and other buildings.
            Glass windows can transmit light, helping to brighten and
            heat homes, but they don't store energy for use when the sun
            goes down.<br>
            <br>
            Three years ago, lead investigator Lars Berglund, Ph.D., and
            colleagues at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in
            Stockholm, Sweden, reported an optically transparent wood in
            the ACS journal Biomacromolecules. The researchers made the
            material by removing a light-absorbing component called
            lignin from the cell walls of balsa wood. To reduce light
            scattering, they incorporated acrylic into the porous wood
            scaffold. The team could see through the material, yet it
            was hazy enough to provide privacy if used as a major
            building material. The transparent wood also had favorable
            mechanical properties, enabling it to bear heavy loads.<br>
            <br>
            Building on this work, Montanari and Berglund added a
            polymer called polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the de-lignified
            wood. "We chose PEG because of its ability to store heat,
            but also because of its high affinity for wood," Montanari
            says. "In Stockholm, there's a really old ship called Vasa,
            and the scientists used PEG to stabilize the wood. So we
            knew that PEG can go really deep into the wood cells."<br>
            <br>
            nown as a "phase-change material," PEG is a solid that melts
            at a temperature of 80 F, storing energy in the process. The
            melting temperature can be adjusted by using different types
            of PEGs. "During a sunny day, the material will absorb heat
            before it reaches the indoor space, and the indoors will be
            cooler than outside," Montanari explains. "And at night, the
            reverse occurs -- the PEG becomes solid and releases heat
            indoors so that you can maintain a constant temperature in
            the house."<br>
            <br>
            The team encapsulated PEG within the de-lignified wood
            scaffold, which prevented leakage of the polymer during
            phase transitions. They also incorporated acrylic into the
            material to protect it from humidity. Like their earlier
            version, the modified wood was transparent, though slightly
            hazy, and strong, but had the added bonus of storing heat.<br>
            <br>
            The researchers point out that the transparent wood has the
            potential to be more environmentally friendly than other
            building materials such as plastic, concrete and glass. In
            addition to its thermal-storage capabilities, the
            transparent wood could be easier to dispose of after it has
            served its purpose. "The PEG and wood are both bio-based and
            biodegradable," Berglund notes. "The only part that is not
            biodegradable is the acrylic, but this could be replaced by
            another bio-based polymer."<br>
            <br>
            Now, the focus turns to scaling up the production process to
            be industrially feasible. The researchers estimate that
            transparent wood could be available for niche applications
            in interior design in as little as five years. They are also
            trying to increase the storage capacity of the material to
            make it even more energy-efficient.<br>

                sound</b><br>
              <i> Mechanical engineers create synthetic, sound-silencing
                structure that blocks 94 percent of sounds</i><br>
            </div>

            Boston University researchers, Xin Zhang, a professor at the
            College of Engineering, and Reza Ghaffarivardavagh, a Ph.D.
            student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering,
            released a paper in Physical Review B demonstrating it's
            possible to silence noise using an open, ringlike structure,
            created to mathematically perfect specifications, for
            cutting out sounds while maintaining airflow.<br>
            <br>
            "Today's sound barriers are literally thick heavy walls,"
            says Ghaffarivardavagh. Although noise-mitigating
            barricades, called sound baffles, can help drown out the
            whoosh of rush hour traffic or contain the symphony of music
            within concert hall walls, they are a clunky approach not
            well suited to situations where airflow is also critical.
            Imagine barricading a jet engine's exhaust vent -- the plane
            would never leave the ground. Instead, workers on the tarmac
            wear earplugs to protect their hearing from the deafening
            roar.<br>
            <br>
            Ghaffarivardavagh and Zhang let mathematics -- a shared
            passion that has buoyed both of their engineering careers
            and made them well-suited research partners -- guide them
            toward a workable design for what the acoustic metamaterial
            would look like.<br>
            <br>
            They calculated the dimensions and specifications that the
            metamaterial would need to have in order to interfere with
            the transmitted sound waves, preventing sound -- but not air
            -- from being radiated through the open structure. The basic
            premise is that the metamaterial needs to be shaped in such
            a way that it sends incoming sounds back to where they came
            from, they say.<br>
            <br>
            As a test case, they decided to create a structure that
            could silence sound from a loudspeaker. Based on their
            calculations, they modeled the physical dimensions that
            would most effectively silence noises. Bringing those models
            to life, they used 3D printing to materialize an open,
            noise-canceling structure made of plastic.<br>
            <br>
            Trying it out in the lab, the researchers sealed the
            loudspeaker into one end of a PVC pipe. On the other end,
            the tailor-made acoustic metamaterial was fastened into the
            opening. With the hit of the play button, the experimental
            loudspeaker set-up came oh-so-quietly to life in the lab.
            Standing in the room, based on your sense of hearing alone,
            you'd never know that the loudspeaker was blasting an
            irritatingly high-pitched note. If, however, you peered into
            the PVC pipe, you would see the loudspeaker's subwoofers
            thrumming away.<br>
            <br>
            The metamaterial, ringing around the internal perimeter of
            the pipe's mouth, worked like a mute button incarnate until
            the moment when Ghaffarivardavagh reached down and pulled it
            free. The lab suddenly echoed with the screeching of the
            loudspeaker's tune.<br>
            <br>
            "The moment we first placed and removed the silencer...was
            literally night and day," says Jacob Nikolajczyk, who in
            addition to being a study co author and former undergraduate
            researcher in Zhang's lab is a passionate vocal performer.
            "We had been seeing these sorts of results in our computer
            modeling for months -- but it is one thing to see modeled
            sound pressure levels on a computer, and another to hear its
            impact yourself."<br>
            <br>
            By comparing sound levels with and without the metamaterial
            fastened in place, the team found that they could silence
            nearly all -- 94 percent to be exact -- of the noise, making
            the sounds emanating from the loudspeaker imperceptible to
            the human ear.<br>
            <br>
            Now that their prototype has proved so effective, the
            researchers have some big ideas about how their
            acoustic-silencing metamaterial could go to work making the
            real world quieter.<br>
            <br>
            "Drones are a very hot topic," Zhang says. Companies like
            Amazon are interested in using drones to deliver goods, she
            says, and "people are complaining about the potential
            noise."<br>
            <br>
            "The culprit is the upward-moving fan motion,"
            Ghaffarivardavagh says. "If we can put sound-silencing open
            structures beneath the drone fans, we can cancel out the
            sound radiating toward the ground."<br>
            <br>
            Closer to home -- or the office -- fans and HVAC systems
            could benefit from acoustic metamaterials that render them
            silent yet still enable hot or cold air to be circulated
            unencumbered throughout a building.<br>
            <br>
            Ghaffarivardavagh and Zhang also point to the unsightliness
            of the sound barriers used today to reduce noise pollution
            from traffic and see room for an aesthetic upgrade. "Our
            structure is super lightweight, open, and beautiful. Each
            piece could be used as a tile or brick to scale up and build
            a sound-canceling, permeable wall," they say.<br>
            <br>
            The shape of acoustic-silencing metamaterials, based on
            their method, is also completely customizable,
            Ghaffarivardavagh says. The outer part doesn't need to be a
            round ring shape in order to function.<br>
            <br>
            "We can design the outer shape as a cube or hexagon,
            anything really," he says. "When we want to create a wall,
            we will go to a hexagonal shape" that can fit together like
            an open-air honeycomb structure.<br>
            <br>
            Such walls could help contain many types of noises. Even
            those from the intense vibrations of an MRI machine, Zhang
            says.<br>
            <br>
            According to Stephan Anderson, a professor of radiology at
            BU School of Medicine and a coauthor of the study, the
            acoustic metamaterial could potentially be scaled "to fit
            inside the central bore of an MRI machine," shielding
            patients from the sound during the imaging process.<br>
            <br>
            Zhang says the possibilities are endless, since the noise
            mitigation method can be customized to suit nearly any
            environment: "The idea is that we can now mathematically
            design an object that can block the sounds of anything," she
            says.<br>

            <b> </b><b> Abstract</b><br>
            Recently, with advances in acoustic metamaterial science,
            the possibility of sound attenuation using subwavelength
            structures, while maintaining permeability to air, has been
            demonstrated. However, the ongoing challenge addressed
            herein is the fact that among such air-permeable structures
            to date, the open area represents only small fraction of the
            overall area of the material. In the presented paper in
            order to address this challenge, we first demonstrate that a
            transversely placed bilayer medium with large degrees of
            contrast in the layers' acoustic properties exhibits an
            asymmetric transmission, similar to the Fano-like
            interference phenomenon. Next, we utilize this design
            methodology and propose a deep-subwavelength acoustic
            metasurface unit cell comprising nearly 60% open area for
            air passage, while serving as a high-performance selective
            sound silencer. Finally, the proposed unit-cell performance
            is validated experimentally, demonstrating a reduction in
            the transmitted acoustic energy of up to 94%. This
            ultra-open metamaterial design, leveraging a Fano-like
            interference, enables high-performance sound silencing in a
            design featuring a large degree of open area, which may find
            utility in applications in which highly efficient,
            air-permeable sound silencers are required, such as smart
            sound barriers, fan or engine noise reduction, among others.<br>

            It is one of life's everyday frustrations, putting on a
            jumper only to get too hot and have to take it off again.<br>
            But scientists may now have an answer - a self-cooling
            jumper.<br>
            Researchers have created a material which heats up when
            someone gets too cold. <br>
            But it also detects when they are warm enough and releases
            heat to maintain the perfect temperature.<br>
            The clothing is made out of regular wool already used in
            sportswear but coated with a super-thin layer of conductive
            metal.<br>
            Its creators claim it is far better than breathable
            sportswear which is already available, altering the body's
            temperature by 35 per cent, while existing clothing only
            manages five per cent.<br>
            The material can be washed like a regular jumper and is
            expected to be only around £4 ($5) more expensive.<br>
            Professor Min Ouyang, who helped to create the material from
            the University of Maryland, said: 'This material was created
            with the idea of making sure that someone can remain
            comfortable.<br>
            'They do not have to take off clothing, then put on
            clothing, to try to reach a comfortable temperature.<br>
            'If someone is sitting in an office and they feel hot, they
            don't need to turn on the air conditioning or change their
            clothing. This textile can regulate their temperature for
            them.' <br>
            Researchers took wool which is already available and used in
            performance sportswear as their starting point. <br>
            This was coated in carbon 'nanotubes' which are a millionth
            as thin as a human hair.<br>
            The fabric underneath the metal detects if someone is
            getting slightly warm, as their skin becomes damp with
            sweat.<br>
            This causes the fabric fibres to shrink and pull closer
            together, creating an electric charge that expels heat from
            the body.<br>
            But if someone starts feeling a bit chilly again, the
            material will expand, with the metal pulling in warmth from
            the air outside.<br>
            Previous attempts at creating clothing which cools you down
            include 'air-conditioned' jackets from Japan with two fans
            built in at the back. <br>
            But the latest invention does not require batteries, working
            simply through natural physics.<br>
            Described in the journal Science, the fabric is said to work
            almost instantly, so that before someone realises they are
            getting hot, their garment immediately starts cooling them
            down.<br>
            Professor Youang said: 'The human body is a perfect
            radiator. It gives off heat quickly. <br>
            For all of history, the only way to regulate the radiator
            has been to take clothes off or put clothes on. But this
            fabric is a true bidirectional regulator.'<br>
            Ray Baughman, a professor of chemistry at the University of
            Texas who was not involved in the study, said: 'This
            pioneering work provides an exciting new switchable
            characteristic for comfort-adjusting clothing.' <br>
            The fabric, which scientists have already knitted into a
            piece of material almost five square feet in size, is set to
            be tested by a US clothing company and could be available in
            two years.<br>

            <b> </b><b>A cloth that adapts to the heat</b><b><br>
            </b>Textiles trap infrared radiation, which helps keep us
            warm in cold weather. Of course, in hot weather, this is
            less desirable. Zhang et al. constructed an
            infrared-adaptive textile composed of polymer fibers coated
            with carbon nanotubes. The yarn itself expanded and
            collapsed based on heat and humidity, which changed the
            spacing of the fibers. Wider fiber spacing allowed the
            textile to breathe but also altered the infrared emissivity
            of the textile. This allowed for better heat exchange under
            hot and wet conditions. The self-adjusting emissivity of the
            textile could help toward wearable thermal-management
            attire.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
            </b>The human body absorbs and loses heat largely through
            infrared radiation centering around a wavelength of 10
            micrometers. However, neither our skin nor the textiles that
            make up clothing are capable of dynamically controlling this
            optical channel for thermal management. By coating
            triacetate-cellulose bimorph fibers with a thin layer of
            carbon nanotubes, we effectively modulated the infrared
            radiation by more than 35% as the relative humidity of the
            underlying skin changed. Both experiments and modeling
            suggest that this dynamic infrared gating effect mainly
            arises from distance-dependent electromagnetic coupling
            between neighboring coated fibers in the textile yarns. This
            effect opens a pathway for developing wearable localized
            thermal management systems that are autonomous and
            self-powered, as well as expanding our ability to adapt to
            demanding environments.<br>

                spontaneously produce hydrogen peroxide</b><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            Water is everywhere on Earth, but maybe that just gives it
            more space to hide its secrets. Its latest surprise,
            Stanford researchers report Aug. 26 in Proceedings of the
            National Academy of Sciences, is that microscopic droplets
            of water spontaneously produce hydrogen peroxide. <br>
            <br>
            The discovery could pave the way for greener ways to produce
            the molecule, a common bleaching agent and disinfectant,
            said Richard Zare, the Marguerite Blake Wilbur Professor in
            Natural Science and a professor of chemistry in the Stanford
            School of Humanities and Sciences.<br>
            <br>
            "Water is one of the most commonly found materials, and it's
            been studied for years and years and you would think that
            there was nothing more to learn about this molecule. But
            here's yet another surprise," said Zare, who is also a
            member of Stanford Bio-X.<br>
            <br>
            The discovery was made serendipitously while Zare and his
            lab were studying a new, more efficient way to create gold
            nanostructures in tiny water droplets known as
            microdroplets. To make those structures, the team added an
            additional molecule called a reducing agent. As a control
            test, Zare suggested seeing if they could create gold
            nanostructures without the reducing agent. Theoretically
            that should have been impossible, but it worked
            anyway—hinting at an as yet undiscovered feature of
            microdroplet chemistry.<br>
            <br>
            The team eventually traced those results to the presence of
            a molecule called hydroxyl—a single hydrogen atom paired
            with an oxygen atom—that can also act as a reducing agent.
            That equally unexpected result led Katherine Walker, at the
            time a graduate student in Zare's lab, to wonder whether
            hydrogen peroxide—a molecule with two hydrogen and two
            oxygen atoms—was also present.<br>
            <br>
            To find out, Zare, Walker, staff scientist Jae Kyoo Lee and
            colleagues conducted a series of tests, the simplest of
            which involved spraying ostensibly pure water microdroplets
            onto a surface treated so that it would turn blue in the
            presence of hydrogen peroxide—and turn blue it did.
            Additional tests confirmed that water microdroplets
            spontaneously form hydrogen peroxide, that smaller
            microdroplets produced higher concentrations of the
            molecule, and that hydrogen peroxide was not lost when the
            microdroplets recombined into bulk water.<br>
            <br>
            The researchers ruled out a number of possible explanations
            before arriving at what they argue is the most likely
            explanation for hydrogen peroxide's presence. They suggest
            that a strong electric field near the surface of water
            microdroplets in air triggers hydroxyl molecules to bind
            into hydrogen peroxide.<br>
            <br>
            Although the results are something of a basic science
            curiosity, Zare said, they could have important practical
            consequences. Hydrogen peroxide is an important commercial
            and industrial chemical, most often manufactured through an
            ecologically unfriendly process. The new discovery could
            help make those methods greener, Zare said, and it could
            lead to simpler ways to disinfect surfaces—simply spraying
            water microdroplets on a table or floor might be enough to
            clean it.<br>
            <br>
            "I think it could be one of the most important things I've
            ever done," Zare said. <br>

            <div align="center"><b>TOR: an enzyme that could hold the
                secret to longevity and healthy ageing</b><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            Calorie-restricted diets have been shown to increase the
            lifespan and healthspan of everything from yeast to monkeys
            – as long as there is no malnutrition. And while no
            long-term studies have proven the benefits of calorie
            restriction on human lifespan, shorter-term studies suggest
            that it does improve health. Here’s how it might work.<br>
            <br>
            Our bodies monitor and sense the amount of nutrients
            available through specific molecules in our cells. Depending
            on the amount of food we eat, these molecules tweak our
            metabolism to regulate how we use the available nutrients.
            One of these molecules is an enzyme called TOR.<br>
            <br>
            When there is a lot of food, the TOR enzyme instructs cells
            in the body to grow. If there is less food, TOR instructs
            the body to be on alert - a state that scientists refer to
            as a “mild stress response”.<br>
            <br>
            Many experiments have shown that when animals eat a lot of
            food, especially for prolonged periods, TOR senses this and
            their lifespan becomes shorter. But do all foods have this
            effect on TOR?<br>
            <br>
            TOR enzyme is especially activated when cells sense large
            amounts of amino acids (the building blocks of protein) or
            protein. A protein-restricted diet, without malnutrition,
            can have the same effects on the metabolism and lifespan of
            lab animals as a calorie-restricted diet.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Age-related disease</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            Age-related diseases are known to be caused by genetic
            mutations, but could there be a connection between TOR,
            nutrition and diseases of old age? We know that nutrition is
            associated with cancer and heart disease, and overactive TOR
            is known to be involved in these diseases, but recent
            studies show that TOR is also directly related to
            neurodegenerative diseases. For example, the activity of the
            TOR enzyme in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s is much
            higher compared with healthy brains. Also, simulating these
            diseases in mice and other lab animals has shown that
            removing excess TOR stops brain cells dying.<br>
            <br>
            So there may be a link between what we eat, how it is sensed
            by our body and the risk of neurodegenerative disease.
            Scientists are exploring different possibilities to prevent
            neurodegeneration. If more protein means more active TOR, we
            could either modify our diet, safely, or develop a drug that
            tricks our body into thinking it is getting less protein.<br>
            <br>
            Work in many labs, including ours, have shown that caffeine
            and a drug called rapamycin do exactly that. While cells
            have abundant protein, their metabolism and lifespan are
            similar to protein-restricted cells. We are currently
            investigating this in human neurons and the first results
            point in the same direction.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Not that simple</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            Does that mean that we should change our diets and protein
            intake? What about other nutrients such as sugars?
            Unfortunately, as expected, things are not that simple. Many
            other molecules within our bodies are involved in sensing
            nutrients including carbohydrates, which affect longevity
            and age-related disease.<br>
            <br>
            This is why we need to be very cautious. First, everyone has
            different needs for nutrients depending on their
            developmental stage and age, gender or activity levels – to
            name only a few important factors. Also, while evidence from
            the lab using human cells and tissues is piling up, we need
            large population studies that can record specific diets,
            including protein, fat and carbohydrate intakes, with
            parallel analyses of the relevant health or molecular
            markers. Such studies need decades to generate solid data
            and valid conclusions.<br>
            <br>
            Still, with the development of new technologies and
            scientific approaches, we are taking steps towards
            understanding the underlying causes of ageing and
            age-related disease. Coupled with targeted clinical trials
            and population studies, perhaps one day soon we’ll be able
            to achieve healthy ageing and longer lifespans.<br>

            The biggest source of global energy consumption is the
            industrial manufacturing of products such as plastics, iron,
            and steel. Not only does manufacturing these materials
            require huge amounts of energy, but many of the reactions
            also directly emit carbon dioxide as a byproduct.<br>
            <br>
            In an effort to help reduce this energy use and the related
            emissions, MIT chemical engineers have devised an
            alternative approach to synthesizing epoxides, a type of
            chemical that is used to manufacture diverse products,
            including plastics, pharmaceuticals, and textiles. Their new
            approach, which uses electricity to run the reaction, can be
            done at room temperature and atmospheric pressure while
            eliminating carbon dioxide as a byproduct...<br>
            <br>
            To come up with a more sustainable approach, the MIT team
            took inspiration from a reaction known as water oxidation,
            which uses electricity to split water into oxygen, protons,
            and electrons. They decided to try performing the water
            oxidation and then attaching the oxygen atom to an organic
            compound called an olefin, which is a precursor to epoxides.<br>
            <br>
            This was a counterintuitive approach, Manthiram says,
            because olefins and water normally cannot react with each
            other. However, they can react with each other when an
            electric voltage is applied.<br>
            <br>
            To take advantage of this, the MIT team designed a reactor
            with an anode where water is broken down into oxygen,
            hydrogen ions (protons), and electrons. Manganese oxide
            nanoparticles act as a catalyst to help this reaction along,
            and to incorporate the oxygen into an olefin to make an
            epoxide. Protons and electrons flow to the cathode, where
            they are converted into hydrogen gas.<br>
            <br>
            Thermodynamically, this reaction only requires about 1 volt
            of electricity, less than the voltage of a standard AA
            battery. The reaction does not generate any carbon dioxide,
            and the researchers anticipate that they could further
            reduce the carbon footprint by using electricity from
            renewable sources such as solar or wind to power the epoxide
            conversion.<b>..</b><br>

            <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
            </b>Epoxides are useful intermediates for the manufacture of
            a diverse set of chemical products. Current routes of olefin
            epoxidation either involve hazardous reagents or generate
            stoichiometric side products, leading to challenges in
            separation and significant waste streams. Here, we
            demonstrate a sustainable and safe route to epoxidize olefin
            substrates using water as the oxygen atom source at room
            temperature and ambient pressure. Manganese oxide
            nanoparticles (NPs) are shown to catalyze cyclooctene
            epoxidation with Faradaic efficiencies above 30%. Isotopic
            studies and detailed product analysis reveal an overall
            reaction in which water and cyclooctene are converted to
            cyclooctene oxide and hydrogen. Electrokinetic studies
            provide insights into the mechanism of olefin epoxidation,
            including an approximate first-order dependence on the
            substrate and water and a rate-determining step which
            involves the first electron transfer. We demonstrate that
            this new route can also achieve a cyclooctene conversion of
            ~50% over 4 h.<br>

            <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
            </b>Chemical understanding is driven by the experimental
            discovery of new compounds and reactivity, and is supported
            by theory and computation that provide detailed physical
            insight. Although theoretical and computational studies have
            generally focused on specific processes or mechanistic
            hypotheses, recent methodological and computational advances
            harken the advent of their principal role in discovery. Here
            we report the development and application of the ab initio
            nanoreactor—a highly accelerated first-principles molecular
            dynamics simulation of chemical reactions that discovers new
            molecules and mechanisms without preordained reaction
            coordinates or elementary steps. Using the nanoreactor, we
            show new pathways for glycine synthesis from primitive
            compounds proposed to exist on the early Earth, which
            provide new insight into the classic Urey–Miller experiment.
            These results highlight the emergence of theoretical and
            computational chemistry as a tool for discovery, in addition
            to its traditional role of interpreting experimental
            findings.<br>

            </div>
            <br>
            Spacetime is doomed. It, and its particles, cannot be
            fundamental in physical theory, but must emerge from a more
            fundamental theory. I review the converging evidence for
            this claim from physics and evolution, and then propose a
            new way to think of spacetime: as a data-compressing and
            error-correcting channel for information about fitness. I
            propose that a theory of conscious agents is a good
            candidate for the more fundamental theory to replace
            spacetime. Spacetime then appears as one kind of interface
            for communication between conscious agents. Donald Hoffman
            is a cognitive scientist and author of more than 90
            scientific papers and three books, including Visual
            Intelligence: How We Create What We See (W.W. Norton, 2000).
            He received his BA from UCLA in Quantitative Psychology and
            his Ph.D. from MIT in Computational Psychology. He joined
            the faculty of UC Irvine in 1983, where he is now a full
            professor in the departments of cognitive science, computer
            science and philosophy. He received a Distinguished
            Scientific Award of the American Psychological Association
            for early career research into visual perception, the Rustum
            Roy Award of the Chopra Foundation, and the Troland Research
            Award of the US National Academy of Sciences. He was chosen
            by students at UC Irvine to receive a campus-wide teaching
            award, and to be included in Who’s Who Among America’s
            Teachers. Hoffman studies visual perception, visual
            attention and consciousness using mathematical models,
            computer simulations, and psychological experiments. His
            empirical research has led to new insights into how we
            perceive objects, colors and motion. His theoretical
            research has led to a “user interface” theory of
            perception—which proposes that natural selection shapes our
            perceptions not to report truth but simply to guide adaptive
            behavior. It has also led to a “conscious realism” theory of
            consciousness—which proposes a formal model of consciousness
            and the mind-body problem that takes consciousness as
            fundamental.<br>

                Applications to Antigravity, Grand Unification and
                Cosmology</b><br>
              <b>Ruggero Maria Santilli</b><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            Antimatter, already conjectured by A. Schuster in 1898, was
            actually predicted by P.A.M. Dirac in the late 19-twenties
            in the negative-energy solutions of the Dirac equation. Its
            existence was subsequently confirmed via the Wilson chamber
            and became an established part of theoretical physics.<br>
            <br>
            Dirac soon discovered that particles with negative energy do
            not behave in a physically conventional manner, and he
            therefore developed his "hole theory". This restricted the
            study of antimatter to the sole level of second
            quantization.<br>
            <br>
            As a result antimatter created a scientific imbalance,
            because matter was treated at all levels of study, while
            antimatter was treated only at the level of second
            quantization.<br>
            <br>
            In search of a new mathematics for the resolution of this
            imbalance the author conceived what we know today as
            Santilli’s isodual mathematics, which permitted the
            construction of isodual classical mechanics, isodual
            quantization and isodual quantum mechanics.<br>
            <br>
            The scope of this monograph is to show that our classical,
            quantum and cosmological knowledge of antimatter is at its
            beginning with much yet to be discovered, and that a
            commitment to antimatter by experimentalists will be
            invaluable to antimatter science.<br>

            A recently published IOP Science paper by Harvard scientists
            Wake Smith and Gernot Wagner titled “Stratospheric Aerosol
            Injection Tactics and Costs in the First Fifteen Years of
            Deployment” is a collation of all the public research on
            Geoengineering and prescribes a program using high altitude
            aircraft to disperse chemicals in the stratosphere to
            reflect sunlight and curb global warming. Going into all the
            details that would constitute a Geoengineering program. This
            paper gives a rare insight into how such a thing would
            operate, how much it would cost and how many planes would be

            <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
            </b>We review the capabilities and costs of various lofting
            methods intended to deliver sulfates into the lower
            stratosphere. We lay out a future solar geoengineering
            deployment scenario of halving the increase in anthropogenic
            radiative forcing beginning 15 years hence, by deploying
            material to altitudes as high as ~20 km. After surveying an
            exhaustive list of potential deployment techniques, we
            settle upon an aircraft-based delivery system. Unlike the
            one prior comprehensive study on the topic (McClellan et al
            2012 Environ. Res. Lett. 7 034019), we conclude that no
            existing aircraft design—even with extensive
            modifications—can reasonably fulfill this mission. However,
            we also conclude that developing a new, purpose-built
            high-altitude tanker with substantial payload capabilities
            would neither be technologically difficult nor prohibitively
            expensive. We calculate early-year costs of ~$1500 ton-1 of
            material deployed, resulting in average costs of ~$2.25
            billion yr-1 over the first 15 years of deployment. We
            further calculate the number of flights at ~4000 in year
            one, linearly increasing by ~4000 yr-1. We conclude by
            arguing that, while cheap, such an aircraft-based program
            would unlikely be a secret, given the need for thousands of
            flights annually by airliner-sized aircraft operating from
            an international array of bases.<br>

            The diseases most people die of have been attributed to
            unhealthy lifestyles. But evidence now suggests bacteria are
            to blame, heralding a revolution in medicine<br>
            <br>
            <b>[ Excerpts ]</b><b><br>
            </b>...The worst culprits, which seem to play a role in the
            widest range of ailments, are the bacteria that cause gum
            disease. This is the most widespread disease of ageing - in
            fact, "the most prevalent disease of mankind", says Maurizio
            Tonetti at the University of Hong Kong. In the US, 42 per
            cent of those aged 30 or above have gum disease, but that
            rises to 60 per cent in those 65 and older. It has been
            measured at 88 per cent in Germany...<br>
            <br>
            Your mouth hosts more than 1000 species of bacteria, in a
            stable community where potential bad actors are kept in
            check by peaceful bacteria around them. Elsewhere in the
            body, including on the skin or the lining of the gut,
            communities of bacteria live on a continuous sheet of cells,
            where the outermost layer is constantly shed, getting rid of
            invasive bacteria. But your teeth can't cast off a layer
            like that, says Tonetti. There, the bacteria live on a hard
            surface, which pierces through the protective outer sheet of
            cells...<br>
            <br>
            P. gingivalis may have a hand in it. It actually perpetuates
            inflammation by producing molecules that block some
            inflammatory processes, but not all of them, says Caroline
            Genco of Tufts University in Massachusetts. The resulting
            weakened inflammation never quite destroys the bacteria, but
            keeps trying, killing your own cells in the process. The
            debris is a feast for P. gingivalis, which, unlike most
            bacteria, needs to eat protein.<br>
            <br>
            The destruction also liberates the iron that bacteria need
            and which the body therefore normally keeps locked up.
            "These bacteria manipulate their interaction with the host
            immune response to enhance their own survival," says George
            Hajishengallis at the University of Pennsylvania.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Gum control</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            Eventually, the infected tooth falls out - but long before
            that P. gingivalis escapes into the bloodstream. There your
            immune system makes antibodies against it, which usually
            defend us from germs. But P. gingivalis antibodies seem to
            be more a mark of its passing than protection. People with
            these antibodies are actually more likely to die in the next
            decade than those with none, and more likely to get
            rheumatoid arthritis or have a heart attack orstroke.<br>
            <br>
            This could be because, once in the blood, P. gingivalis
            changes its surface proteins so it can hide inside white
            blood cells of the immune system, says Genco. It also enters
            cells lining arteries. It remains dormant in these
            locations, occasionally waking to invade a new cell, but
            otherwise remaining hidden from antibiotics and immune
            defences. However, even hunkered down within our cells, P.
            gingivalis continues to activate or block different immune
            signals, even changing a blood cell's gene expression to
            make it migrate to other sites of inflammation, where the
            bacteria can hop out and feast again.<br>
            <br>
            One explanation for why gum disease makes you more likely to
            get conditions like diabetes and Alzheimer's disease is that
            it adds to your general "inflammatory load". But P.
            gingivalis may act more directly too: the bacteria have been
            detected in inflamed tissue in the brain, aorta, heart,
            liver, spleen, kidneys, joints and pancreas in mice and, in
            many cases, humans.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Master of concealment</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            If the bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis is partly to blame
            for a wide range of inflammatory diseases such as
            Alzheimer's and heart disease, why not just kill it?
            Unfortunately, it is brilliant at dodging our defences:
            lurking inside cells where antibodies can't reach it, and
            often lying dormant, making it invisible to antibiotics,
            which mostly attack bacteria as they divide.<br>
            <br>
            We could vaccinate against P. gingivalis, but vaccines work
            by inducing antibodies. People with gum disease already make
            antibodies against the bacteria, but these seem to do little
            to stop it.<br>
            <br>
            It may be better to have the antibodies early and stop P.
            gingivalis invading our mouths when we are young. Eric
            Reynolds at the University of Melbourne is running a
            clinical trial of a vaccine that targets gingipains, the
            protein-digesting enzymes that P. gingivalis makes. Caroline
            Genco of Tufts University in Massachusetts is also working
            on an anti-gingipain vaccine. "The key is to prevent it ever
            colonising," she says.<br>
            <br>
            The trouble is, many of us already host the bacteria.
            Routine gum abrasion, through eating or brushing your teeth,
            can release the microbes into your bloodstream, even if you
            don't have gum disease. There it can spread throughout the
            body and promote inflammation.<br>
            <br>
            In studies by the company Cortexyme, antibiotics killed P.
            gingivalis in mice, but it rapidly became resistant. To
            limit resistance, instead of trying to kill the bacteria, it
            may be better to block its ability to cause disease.
            Cortexyme has a drug that does this by blocking gingipains.
            In mice, it reversed Alzheimer's-like brain damage without
            driving resistance in P. gingivalis, and in a small trial in
            humans it improved inflammation and some measures of
            cognition. A large trial is now under way.<br>
            <br>
            But as all these diseases involve inflammation, why not just
            block that? If we did, it could leave you open to the germs
            that this immune response does fight off or block other
            vital things that immune signals do. That's why some
            companies are working on drugs to block only specific
            inflammatory signals. But tampering with our complex immune
            systems without doing damage - as P. gingivalis shows - will
            be a significant challenge...<br>
            <br>
            Then, in January, teams at eight universities and the San
            Francisco company Cortexyme found a protein-digesting enzyme
            called gingipain, produced only by P. gingivalis, in 99 per
            cent of brain samples from people who died with Alzheimer's,
            at levels corresponding to the severity of the condition.
            They also found the bacteria in spinal fluid. Giving mice
            the bacteria caused symptoms of Alzheimer's, and blocking
            gingipains reversed the damage. <br>
            <br>
            Moreover, half of the brain samples from people without
            Alzheimer's also had gingipain and amyloid, but at lower
            levels. That is as you would expect if P. gingivalis causes
            Alzheimer's, because damage can accumulate for 20 years
            before symptoms start. People who develop symptoms may be
            those who accumulate enough gingipain damage during their
            lifetimes, says Casey Lynch at Cortexyme...<br>

                The "Holy Grail" Of Electric Motors</b><br>
              <b>by Tyler Durden</b><br>
            </div>
            &nbsp; <br>
            A Texas-based company recently raised $4.5 million in seed
            funding to develop and commercialize a revolutionary motor
            that produces more torque, double the power, and increases
            range in an electric vehicle versus one using a typical
            electric motor.<br>
            <br>
            Linear Labs has big claims for its Hunstable Electric
            Turbine (HET), is expected to perform much better than
            conventional electric motors found on a Tesla or any other
            electric vehicle.<br>
            <br>
            Vehicles with HET motors will eliminate transmission
            systems, will increase range by more than 10% from a current
            battery size while allowing the vehicle to have more power
            and torque.<br>
            <br>
            Linear Labs says the new motors can produce 2 to 5 times
            more torque output of similarly-scaled conventional electric
            motors, and twice the power output.<br>
            <br>
            Here's the breakthrough technology explained by CNET:<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "HET uses four rotors rather than the
            single unit found in many electric motors that acts on the
            motor's coils to create rotation. The number of coils that
            the rotors interact with is variable thanks to endplates
            that can be rotated independently so that they weaken the
            magnetic fields acting on them, allowing the HET to be
            infinitely variable for power and torque."<br>
            <br>
            Here, Linear Labs describes HET's technology as the first
            significant advancement in electric motors in more than a
            century.<br>
            <br>
            Several quotes from independent researchers stand out in the
            video:<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You built the holy grail in electric
            motors-high torque and no gearbox," said Henrik Christensen,
            author of US Robotics National Roadmap Advisor to the
            President.<br>
            <br>
            HET generates a lot of torque at lower RPMs than a
            conventional permanent magnet motor, which means it can be
            constructed out of less expensive and widely available iron
            ferrite magnates, rather than expensive neodymium. Neodymium
            is used in motors where maximum torque is produced at high
            speeds, but it works similarly to iron ferrite at lower
            RPMs.<br>
            <br>
            This breakthrough would allow US EV manufacturers to ditch
            sourcing of neodymium from China, and use cheaper and widely
            available ferrite magnates from other countries.<br>
            <br>
            Linear Labs is currently building prototypes of its new
            motors for use in various industries. The first
            transportation application will be in micro-mobility
            (scooters, electric longboards, e-bikes, and motorcycles)
            next year, followed by electric cars in 2021.<br>

            Fundamentally, electric motors haven’t changed all that much
            since they were developed well over a century ago: they’re
            still electromechanically spinning rotors inside of stators.
            There a Texas startup, though, that claims to have developed
            the first real, substantive improvements in the basic design
            of an electric motor, and they claim that its motor, the
            Linear Labs Hunstable Electric Turbine (HET) will perform so
            much better than conventional motors that electric cars with
            these motors can eliminate any sort of gearboxes, expect 10
            percent more range from a given battery size, while
            providing more powe<br>
            <br>
            Linear Labs claims two to five times the torque output of
            similarly-scaled conventional electric motors, and twice the
            power output. Electric motors are already known for how much
            torque they can generate, so these are especially impressive

            The way Linear Labs claims they can achieve this is with the
            novel design of the motor. It doesn’t require any dramatic
            technological advancements to build motors like this, but
            the way its designed is certainly clever.<br>
            <br>
            There’s four rotors in there, more than in most conventional
            electric motors, and the stator is located inside a
            “magnetic torque tunnel,” with all sides of the same
            polarity, which Linear Labs says helps to keep the magnetic
            fields all in the direction of the rotational motion. <br>
            <br>
            The motor can also deliberately mis-align its magnetic
            fields to achieve field weakening, which sounds undesirable
            but is actually helpful for more efficient high-speed
            operation of the motor, where torque is traded for RPMs—sort
            of like an overdrive in a conventional transmission...<br>

            Fundamentally, electric motors haven’t changed all that much
            since they were developed well over a century ago: they’re
            still electromechanically spinning rotors inside of stators.
            There a Texas startup, though, that claims to have developed
            the first real, substantive improvements in the basic design
            of an electric motor, and they claim that its motor, the
            Linear Labs Hunstable Electric Turbine (HET) will perform so
            much better than conventional motors that electric cars with
            these motors can eliminate any sort of gearboxes, expect 10
            percent more range from a given battery size, while
            providing more power and torque for a given size of motor.<br>

            Illustration for article titled A Texas Startup Claims To
            Have Made The Biggest Advancements In Electric Motor Designs
            In Over A Century<br>
            Linear Labs claims two to five times the torque output of
            similarly-scaled conventional electric motors, and twice the
            power output. Electric motors are already known for how much
            torque they can generate, so these are especially impressive
            numbers...<br>

            A special type of polymer capable of disappearing without a
            trace is being tested by the US government.<br>
            <br>
            Scientists say the material, made by researchers at the
            American Chemical Society at the behest of the Department of
            Defense, could be used to deploy electronic sensors and
            deliver military equipment covertly by dropping off packages
            and leaving no sign that the device was ever there.<br>
            <br>
            'This is not the kind of thing that slowly degrades over a
            year, like the biodegradable plastics that consumers might
            be familiar with,' said Paul Kohl a doctor whose team
            developed the material. <br>
            <br>
            'This polymer disappears in an instant when you push a
            button to trigger an internal mechanism or the sun hits it.'<br>
            <br>
            To achieve the the rapid transition from a solid state to
            decomposition, researchers say they used a type of polymer
            with a 'low ceiling temperature,' meaning that its bonds
            quickly break apart when above a certain threshold.<br>
            <br>
            In this case, scientists used a light-sensitive catalyst to
            kickstart the polymers decomposition, meaning that as soon
            as the material is exposed to sunlight, it begins to vanish.<br>
            <br>
            This would theoretically allow an operative to send out the
            polymer at night, leaving no trace of it when the sun rises.
            <br>
            <br>
            Using this method, the researchers say they were also able
            to adjust the timing of decomposition to create materials
            with a longer shelf-life. <br>
            <br>
            'We have a way to delay the depolymerization for a specific
            amount of time—one hour, two hours, three hours,' said Kohl
            in a statement. <br>
            <br>
            'You would keep it in the dark until you were going to use
            it, but then you would deploy it during the day, and you
            would have three hours before it decomposes.'<br>
            Scientist have pursued the creation of a polymer that can
            disappear rapidly but have failed due to their instability
            at room temperature<br>
            <br>
            Scientist have pursued the creation of a polymer that can
            disappear rapidly but have failed due to their instability
            at room temperature<br>
            <br>
            Yet another version is made to be sensitive to fluorescent
            light, making the material practical for indoor missions.<br>
            <br>
            Scientists have tried for many years to create such a
            material but have failed due to the polymers' instability
            when at room temperature. <br>
            <br>
            By removing impurities from the substance before synthesis,
            however, they say the polymer was for more durable than its
            predecessors.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Though the polymer is already being incorporated into
            military technology, researchers say that it may have other
            more civilian or commercial applications as well.<br>
            <br>
            Among them, they cite its potential for use as a temporary
            epoxy used in construction or for use as delivery vehicles
            to areas where recovery is difficult.<br>

            And the Russians are hard sells to spoof.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            I find it fascinating.&nbsp; What has actually happened is
            that there are in fact two factions of bankers represented
            by the Federal Reserve and the IMF, respectively. <br>
            <br>
            The Federal Reserve is run by old-line Sephardic Spanish,
            French, Italian and more recently, Israeli banks. <br>
            <br>
            The IMF is run by upstart Ashkenazi and
            military-industrialist commercial bankers. <br>
            <br>
            Both of these groups have been acting as crime syndicates
            and predators, and not because they are Jewish — it’s
            because they are bankers, and as bankers, they work for
            governments and militaries which, to some extent they
            control, because the bankers are charged with finding ways
            to finance both the politicians and the militaries of all
            these countries.<br>
            <br>
            This became very difficult to do early last century for two
            reasons: (1) gold is an inelastic commodity, and (2) a very
            large portion of the gold backing the world’s monetary
            system disappeared between 1898 and 1907.&nbsp; It simply
            disappeared.<br>
            <br>
            We now know that it went to the Philippines and that it was
            cashiered there by a now long-defunct Scottish commercial
            corporation doing business “as” The United States of America
            — Incorporated.&nbsp; The gold was transported to the
            Philippines by the British-controlled U.S. Navy.&nbsp; It
            was our gold and the gold of other countries that trusted
            our banks, and therefore, deposited gold here.<br>
            <br>
            The Philippines were supposed to become– for the Bank of
            England and Bank of Scotland and Bank of France crooks
            responsible for all this–&nbsp; a sort of alternative to
            Switzerland as a banking stronghold. It was to be a new
            epicenter for international banking —-and, for continued
            fraud and theft and “leveraging” of currency commodities. <br>
            <br>
            They experienced some difficulties when the Japanese took
            the Philippines during World War II, but for the most part,
            it was too hard for the Japanese to transport the gold under
            war time conditions and while they managed to set up a
            couple secondary centers in Indonesia and Hong Kong and
            various stashes around the Pacific Rim, including the
            Japanese homeland,&nbsp; most of the gold remained in the
            Philippines.<br>
            <br>
            Douglas MacArthur could be sure that he would return.&nbsp;
            He knew that with that much gold sitting there up for grabs,
            no expense of men or materials would be too great.<br>
            <br>
            Did MacArthur know that he was sitting on stolen American
            gold and gold stolen from private citizens and other
            countries from around the world who deposited their gold in
            our banks?&nbsp; Probably.&nbsp; But he was also no doubt
            given some plausible Cock and Bull story to explain away the
            circumstance, too.<br>
            <br>
            This has been the long history of The Mess: honorable men
            are lied to by those in positions of authority, and acting
            upon these lies, they make wrong assumptions and take
            heinously incorrect actions. <br>
            <br>
            As the Zoroastrians observed Millenia ago, without right
            thoughts, it is impossible to take right actions.<br>
            <br>
            So, what was the ultimate “Hundred Year Plan” of these
            hucksters?<br>
            <br>
            They would collect by all means possible, all the gold in
            the world that they could mine or otherwise lay their hands
            on, hoard it, and when the time was ripe and they had
            siphoned off all real and/or perceived value of the fiat
            currencies, they would purposefully limit the supply of gold
            and force the grandsons of the men they stole the gold from
            in the first place to pay exorbitant amounts of resources
            and labor to buy it back. <br>
            <br>
            Gold, just before the Crash, sold for @ $30 in silver per
            ounce. What does it sell for today?&nbsp; At least $1000 in
            oil per ounce.&nbsp; That difference between $30 and $1000
            for the same amount of gold, is what the crooks were (and
            are) aiming to cash in on.&nbsp; THAT is what it is all
            about: (1) limiting access to gold; (2) driving the price of
            gold up as much as possible.<br>
            <br>
            They did the same thing with oil and they are trying to do
            the same thing with water.&nbsp; It is always the
            same.&nbsp; Find a commodity that everyone either needs or
            that they believe is supremely valuable, corner the market,
            choke off the supply, and charge up the wazoo for it.<br>
            <br>
            It’s boring.&nbsp; It’s infantile.&nbsp; It’s crooked.&nbsp;
            And in the end, it’s insane, because it creates bogus
            shortages of things that are in fact abundant.&nbsp; It
            leaves everyone on Earth dealing from a stacked deck and
            living in a purposefully skewed reality dominated by
            artificially created shortages.<br>
            <br>
            No matter how they create these bogus shortages or what
            commodity is targeted, the modus operandi is always the
            same.&nbsp; And the people of the Earth always suffer for
            it.<br>
            <br>
            So now we have Russian Generals hopping around up and down
            on one leg and calling Donald Trump an “economic hit man”
            and pointing fingers at “the Jews”. <br>
            <br>
            The Jews have been bankers since the seventh century BCE for
            the simple reason that although their religion forbids them
            to charge interest on loans to other Jews, it allows them to
            charge interest on loans (practice usury) made to Gentiles.
            <br>
            <br>
            Since the advent of Islam, Muslims have been pressed into
            service as bankers for similar reasons, except that Muslims
            who are dishonest face moral and physical punishment within
            their own communities— hence, on average, Muslims make more
            honest bankers. <br>
            <br>
            That’s why so many high-flying Jews keep their money in
            Muslim banks. Muslim banks are safer and Muslim bankers are
            more honest.&nbsp; Go figure.<br>
            <br>
            And that is part of the reason that Iran is being
            targeted.&nbsp; Word has it that vast amounts of gold and
            other precious metal and jewel assets have been stashed by
            Muslim bankers in Iran. <br>

            And that is why Iran is being misrepresented by the Western
            Press Corps as a dangerous Aggressor — when it hasn’t fought
            a war outside its borders in over 200 years.<br>
            <br>
            It’s time to grow up.<br>
            <br>
            It’s time to look at what is in front of our faces. <br>
            <br>
            The bankers are a problem because we let them be a problem.<br>
            <br>
            We let the politicians and military be a problem, too. <br>
            <br>
            They work for us.&nbsp; They get their pay from us, albeit
            via the Queen or the Pope acting as middlemen.&nbsp; Their
            armies and navies are built on the backs of our sons and
            daughters. <br>
            <br>
            What happens if we all — Russians, Chinese, Japanese,
            Germans, Americans, and yes, Brits — all wake up and face
            the facts? <br>
            <br>
            It’s all a crooked, violent, destructive, criminal racket
            built on lies and secretive enslavement of living people,
            theft of their assets, and created shortages of commodities
            that are in fact abundant. <br>
            <br>
            This situation exists because we have all been sitting on
            our rumps, gullibly trusting our governments and
            bought-and-paid-for news commentators.<br>
            <br>
            Mr. Trump isn’t an economic hit man. He’s a beleaguered
            corporate CEO trying to administer an unimaginably huge
            bankruptcy, which is predicated in turn on an unimaginably
            huge probate fraud —-and if he fails, not only this country
            but the entire rest of the world will be thrown into WWIII —
            a cataclysm that nobody will survive.<br>
            <br>
            The American States and People are owed the return of
            approximately $387 billion in gold, plus interest, from the
            World Bank.&nbsp; We are owed the return of the control of
            the Philippines and Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariannas
            Islands –which were all purchased “for” us, with our
            money.&nbsp; We are owed — at a minimum — $23 trillion
            dollars as the American National Credit.<br>
            <br>
            And we are owed nothing but thanks from the rest of the
            world which has benefited itself at our expense for 150
            years. <br>
            <br>
            Those are the facts.<br>
            <br>
            So, now what do we do with them? <br>
            <br>
            We declare and record our proper political status, we boot
            up our States of the Union, we elect our Justices of the
            Peace, we serve as Jurors, actual County Sheriffs, Land
            Marshals — aka, Continental Marshals — and we reboot our
            civilian courts. <br>
            <br>
            We demand the closure of the Municipal and “Administrative”
            COURTS and the end of all presumptions against our private
            and public property assets, the collapse of all so-called
            “infant decedant estates” and the return of all assets to
            the lawful owners. <br>
            <br>
            We object loudly to U.S. Navy and NATO attempts to create a
            worldwide drought in order to make water a “strategic
            commodity”. <br>
            <br>
            We pay attention to what these cretins are really doing
            behind our backs.<br>
            <br>
            We get to the bottom of who owns and operates the
            corporation doing business as the GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED
            STATES.<br>
            <br>
            We grab these miscreants by the shorthairs and hang them
            upside down until they call “Uncle”. <br>
            <br>
            It’s all simple enough, not rocket science at all.&nbsp; And
            all it takes is for the people of this world to wake up,
            declare their proper political status, and take action,
            action, action — and those actions to not include begging
            these vermin for more “treats” like trained dogs. <br>
            <br>
            No, we don’t “petition” them for anything.&nbsp; We tell
            them what they are going to do as our deputies.&nbsp; And if
            they don’t do their duty, they lose their contracts.<br>
            <br>
            And that, darlings, is the only way to deal with out of
            control commercial corporations — pull their contracts and
            charters, un-staff their offices, sell their stock, expose
            their dirt, arrest their officers if they are guilty of
            crimes, boycott their products, sue them for non-performance
            in your own courts of law, and stop being chumps and marks.<br>
            <br>
            The real economic “hit men” are operating Municipal and
            Administrative COURTS in this country and around the
            world.&nbsp; That’s why these COURTS have to be shut down
            and replaced by actual civilian courts from here to
            Dusseldorf.<br>
            <br>
            These COURTS are being used as private debt collection
            agencies and they are being used to sue the actual Creditors
            of these Perpetrators.&nbsp; Just as we told you all — these
            vermin borrow from and then murder their Creditors, so that
            they don’t have to pay them back.&nbsp; We recently
            published absolute proof of this fact by their own
            admission.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            This is what happened to the Jews in Germany, because they
            were holding the largest amount of the Nazi Government’s
            debt, and this is what the Perpetrators of this “System”
            have planned to happen in America, too. <br>
            <br>
            Take a look around, people.&nbsp; There are more than 800
            FEMA camps in this country, and billions of rounds of
            ammunition in the hands of Municipal “Agencies” —- is it
            worth your time and effort to pay attention and get involved
            in running your own government? <br>
            <br>
            Or are you just going to sit there and wait for whatever
            comes? <br>
            <br>
            It’s time for a vast outreach of people-to-people around the
            globe, all working together to end this madness, and nobody
            has more fat in the fire than the Jewish and Muslim bankers
            who have been used to set up and operate this
            “System”.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Now, I know that when you wake up and look at the actual
            situation, you will feel afraid of the Beast.&nbsp; That is
            natural.&nbsp; Just be aware that it is a Beast of your own
            creation, and that will help cut it down to size.&nbsp; Like
            the shadows in your closet and the dust bunnies under you
            chair, it exists because you were asleep and let it
            accumulate. <br>
            <br>
            And now, it’s time to wake up and clean house.<br>

            <br>
            Slavery had some good aspects for those chaps who had it
            rather good. A colonial setup is the next best thing to
            slavery, and it also holds its attraction for people who
            knew how to place themselves just below the sahibs and above
            the run-of-the-mill natives. The Hong Kong revolt is the
            mutiny of wannabe house niggers who feel that the gap
            between them and the natives is rapidly vanishing. Once, a
            HK resident was head and shoulders above the miserable
            mainland coolies; he spoke English, he had smart devices, he
            had his place in the tentacle sucking wealth out of the
            mainland, and some of that wealth stuck to his sweaty hands.
            But now he has no advantage compared to the people of
            Shanghai or Beijing. There is huge swelling of wealth in the
            big cities of Red China. The Chinese dress well, travel
            abroad, and they do not need HK mediation for dealing with
            the West. Beijing had offered HK a fair deal of [relative]
            equality; nothing would be taken from them, but the
            shrinking gap is not only unavoidable, but desirable, too.<br>
            <br>
            However, HK had been the imperial bridgehead in China for
            too long. Its people were complicit, nay, willing partners
            in every Western crime against China, beginning with dumping
            opium and sucking out Chinese wealth. Millions of opium
            addicts, of ruined families and households nearly destroyed
            the Middle Kingdom, and each of them added to HK prosperity.
            The blood, sweat and labour of all China abundantly supplied
            the island. HK was the first of the Treaty Ports, and the
            last to return home. Its populace was not thoroughly
            detoxed; they weren’t ideologically prepared for a new life
            as equals.<br>
            <br>
            Chairman Mao harboured hard suspicions against comprador
            cities, the cities and the people who prospered due to their
            collaboration with the imperialist enemy. He cleansed them
            with communist and patriotic re-education; recalcitrant
            compradors were sent to help peasants in far-away villages
            in order to reconnect with the people. Mao’s successors had
            a strong if misplaced belief in Chinese nationalism as a
            universal remedy; they thought the Chinese of HK, Macau and
            Taiwan would join them the moment the colonial yoke failed.
            This was an over-optimistic assessment. The imperialist
            forces didn’t give up on their former house slaves, and the
            moment they needed to activate them against independent
            China they knew where to look.<br>
            <br>
            Their time came as the trade conflict between the US and
            China warmed up. The secret government of the West aka Deep
            State came to the conclusion that China is getting way too
            big for its boots. It is not satisfied with making cheap
            gadgets for Walmart customers. It is producing state-of-art
            devices that compete with American goods and, what’s worse,
            their devices are not accessible for NSA surveillance. The
            Chinese company Huawei came under attack; sanctions and
            custom duties followed in train. When the Yuan eased under
            the strain, the Chinese were accused of manipulating their
            currency. It is a strong charge: when Japan was attacked by
            the West in the 1990s and the Yen had eased as expected,
            this claim forced Tokyo to keep the Yen high and take Japan
            into a twenty-year-long slump. But China did not retreat.<br>
            <br>
            Then the supreme power unleashed its well-practiced weapon:
            they turned to foment unrest in China and gave it a lot of
            space in the media. At first, they played up the fate of the
            Uygur Islamists, but it had little success. The Uygur are
            not numerous, they are not even a majority in their
            traditional area; their influence in China is limited.
            Despite headlines in the liberal Western media proclaiming
            that millions of Uygur are locked up in concentration camps,
            the impact was nil. No important Muslim state took up this
            cause.<br>
            <br>
            The anniversary of Tiananmen came (in beginning of June) and
            went without a hitch. For good reason: the alleged
            ‘massacre’ is a myth, as the Chinese always knew and we know
            now for certain thanks to publication of a relevant US
            Embassy cable by Wikileaks. There were no thousands of
            students flattened by tanks. A very few died fighting the
            army, but China had evaded the bitter fate of the USSR. In
            China proper the event had been almost forgotten. A few
            participants retell of their experiences to Western
            audiences, but the desired turmoil did not materialise.<br>
            <br>
            And then came the time for HK. It is an autonomous part of
            China; it had not been re-educated; there are enough people
            who remember the good days of colonial slavery. The actual
            spark for the mutiny, the planned extradition treaty, was
            exceedingly weak. For the last decade, HK became the chosen
            place of refuge for mainland criminals, for HK had
            extradition treaties with the US and Britain, but not with
            the mainland. This had to be remedied.<br>
            <br>
            [The extradition treaty had played an important role in the
            Snowden case. An ex-CIA spy Edward Snowden decided to reveal
            to the world the extent of the NSA surveillance we all are
            subjects of. He chose the Guardian newspaper for his
            revelations, probably because of the Wikileaks precedent.
            When he gave an extended interview to the Guardian in HK,
            his identity had been revealed. The arrival of the US
            extradition request was imminent. The Chinese authorities
            told Snowden that they would have to send him to a US jail,
            to torture and death; that the extradition treaty left them
            no option in his case. Only the fast footwork of Julian
            Assange’s brave assistant Sarah Harrison prevented this grim
            finale and delivered Snowden to safe Moscow.]<br>
            <br>
            While HK authorities were obliged to extradite Snowden, they
            weren’t and couldn’t extradite numerous criminals from the
            mainland. This was an obvious wrong that had to be urgently
            corrected, in the face of rising tension. And then the
            sleeping agents of the West woke up and activated their
            networks. They had practically unlimited funds, not only
            from the West, but also from the criminals who weren’t
            particularly impecunious and were afraid of extradition.
            After the demonstrations started, the Western media gave
            them maximum coverage, magnifying and encouraging the
            mutineers.<br>
            <br>
            Hundreds of articles, leading stories and editorials in
            important newspapers cheered and encouraged the HK rebels.
            The People’s War Is Coming in Hong Kong, editorialised the
            New York Times today. An amazing fact (that is if you are a
            fresh arrival from Mars): the same newspaper and its
            numerous sisters paid no attention to the real People’s War
            raging in France, where the Gilets Jaunes have continued to
            fight for forty weeks against the austerity-imposing Macron
            regime. 11 people were killed and 2,500 injured in France,
            but the Western media just mumbled about the GJ
            antisemitism. Nothing new, indeed. The same media did not
            notice the one-million-strong demonstration against the US
            war on Iraq, paid little attention to Occupy Wall Street,
            disregarded protests against US wars and interventions. One
            hundred thousand people marching in New York would get no
            coverage if their purpose did not agree with the desires of
            the Real Government; and alternatively, three thousand
            protesters in Moscow with its 12 million population would be
            presented as the voice of the people challenging Vlad the
            Tyrant.<br>
            <br>
            In its peculiar way, the media fulfills its purpose of
            keeping us informed. If mainstream media reports on
            something, it usually lies; but if media keeps mum, you can
            bet it is important and you are not encouraged to learn of
            it. It is especially true in case of popular protests. How
            do you know they are lying? – Their lips are moving.<br>
            <br>
            The biggest lie is calling the HK rebels marching under the
            Union Jack, “pro-democracy”. These guys wish to restore
            colonial rule, to be governed by their strict but fair
            round-eyed overlords. It could be a bad or a good idea, but
            democracy it ain’t. The second biggest lie is the slogan
            Make Hong Kong Great Britain Again.<br>
            <br>
            Hong Kong was never a part of Great Britain. This was never
            on offer, so it can’t become that again. Even the most
            adventure- and diversity-prone British politician won’t make
            seven million Chinese in a far-away territory British
            citizens with full rights, members of an imperfect but real
            British democracy. HK was a colony; this is what the
            marchers aspire to, to make HK colony again.<br>
            <br>
            With all these differences taken into account, this is as
            true for Moscow demos as well. Moscow protesters dream of a
            Russia occupied by NATO forces, not of democracy. They
            believe that they, pro-Western, educated, entrepreneurial,
            would form the comprador class and prosper at the expense of
            hoi polloi. Mercifully, they aren’t plentiful: the Russians
            already tried to live under benign Western occupation
            between 1991 and 2000, when the IMF directed their finances
            and American advisers from Harvard ran the state machinery.
            Smart and ruthless Jews like Bill Browder, Boris Berezovsky,
            Roman Abramovich made their fortunes, but Russia was ruined
            and its people were reduced to poverty.<br>
            <br>
            Not many Russians would like to return to the Roaring
            Nineties, but some would. It is a matter for the majority to
            prevent this aspiring minority to achieve its aspirations.
            Those who can’t take it will flee to Israel, as young Mr
            Yablonsky who discovered his Jewish roots after two nights
            of police detention. He landed in jail for violently
            fighting erection of a church in his town.<br>
            <br>
            The Chinese will likewise sort out their HK affliction. It
            can be done if the government does not promise to restrict
            its counteractions to painless and bloodless measures. Only
            the real and imminent threat of painful and bloody
            suppression can make such measures unnecessary. Likewise,
            only the imminent threat of no-deal Brexit could bring some
            sense into the stubborn heads of the EU leaders. A state
            that is not ready to use force will necessarily fail, as did
            the Ukrainian state under Mr Yanukowych in 2014. Blood will
            be shed and the state will be ruined, if its rulers are too
            squeamish to stop the rebellion.<br>
            <br>
            We can distinguish a real people’s rising and
            foreign-inspired interventions on behalf of the compradors.
            The first one will be silenced while the second will be
            glorified by the New York Times. It is that simple.<br>

            I would not worry overmuch for China. The Chinese leaders
            knew how to deal with Tiananmen, they knew how to deal with
            minority unrest, without unnecessary cruelty and without
            hesitation and prevarication. They weren’t dilly-dallying
            when the US tried to send to HK its warships, but flatly
            denied them the pleasure. They will overcome.<br>

            Dr. Tullio Simoncini is a medical doctor in Italy who has
            done more than anyone to explore the uses of the baking soda
            cancer treatment as an alternative cancer treatment. It is
            known that cancer creates and favors an acid environment and
            because of this, Dr. Simoncini and others have used sodium
            bicarbodate as an alkaline therapeutic agent.<br>
            <br>
            The way that acidity seems to protect cancer is not fully
            understood.&nbsp; It seems that cytotoxic T-cells, which may
            attack cancer cells under normal conditions, are inactivated
            in an acid extracellular fluid.[1]&nbsp; Also, the type of
            acidity that cancer produces, i.e., lactic acid, stimulates
            vascular endothelial growth factor and
            angiogenesis.[2]&nbsp; This is like a highway project, which
            enables a tumor to build the blood vessels that it needs to
            bring the nutrients for it to survive.&nbsp; So the tumor
            creates an environment in which it can then exist
            comfortably.<br>

            At a pH of about 10, sodium bicarbonate is an antidote to
            this acidity.&nbsp; It can be used clinically in sterile,
            intravenous form.&nbsp; This is a liquid, sterile
            bicarbonate of soda.&nbsp; The baking soda cancer treatment
            is well-tolerated, even with frequent repeated dosing....<br>

                antennae</b><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            A research team at The University of Tokyo has introduced a
            powerful method for actively breaking chemical bonds using
            excitations in tiny antennae created by infrared lasers.
            This process may have applications throughout chemistry as a
            way to direct chemical reactions in desired directions. In
            particular, the reactions used in the energy,
            pharmaceutical, and manufacturing sectors may become much
            more efficient by increasing yields while reducing waste....<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;"Being able to control chemical reactions on a
            molecular level -- that is, the ability to selectively break
            or form chemical bonds, is a major goal for physical
            chemists," says first author Ikki Morichika.<br>
            <br>
            One way to control which bonds are broken during a chemical
            reaction is to get molecules vibrating by exciting them with
            infrared laser light. Since each type of chemical bond
            absorbs a particular wavelength of light, they can be
            activated individually. Unfortunately, it is difficult to
            deliver enough energy throughout the sample to generate the
            vibration intensity required. The team at The University of
            Tokyo was able to overcome this problem by fabricating tiny
            gold antennae, each just 300 nanometers wide, and by
            illuminating them with infrared lasers. When infrared light
            of the right frequency was present, the electrons in the
            antennae oscillated back and forth in resonance with the
            light waves, which created a very intense electric field.
            This phenomenon is called a "plasmonic resonance," and
            requires that the antennae be just the right shape and size.
            The plasmonic resonance focused the laser's energy on nearby
            molecules, which started vibrating. The vibration was
            further boosted by shaping the waveform of the infrared
            laser so that the frequency changed rapidly in time,
            reminiscent of the chirping of birds. "This successfully
            demonstrated that the combination of ultrafast optics and
            nano-plasmonics is useful for efficient, selective
            vibrational excitation," says senior author Satoshi
            Ashihara.<br>
            <br>
            In the future, this technique may be applied to the
            production of cleaner fuels or cheaper pharmaceuticals as
            the chemical processes become optimized.<br>

            <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
            </b>Selective bond cleavage via vibrational excitation is
            the key to active control over molecular reactions. Despite
            its great potential, the practical implementation in
            condensed phases have been hampered to date by poor
            excitation efficiency due to fast vibrational relaxation.
            Here we demonstrate vibrationally mediated, condensed-phase
            molecular dissociation by employing intense plasmonic
            near-fields of temporally-shaped mid-infrared (mid-IR)
            pulses. Both down-chirping and substantial field enhancement
            contribute to efficient ladder climbing of the carbonyl
            stretch vibration of W(CO)6 in n-hexane solution and to the
            resulting CO dissociation. We observe an absorption band
            emerging with laser irradiation at the excitation beam area,
            which indicates that the dissociation is followed by
            adsorption onto metal surfaces. This successful
            demonstration proves that the combination of ultrafast
            optics and nano-plasmonics in the mid-IR range is useful for
            mode-selective vibrational ladder climbing, paving the way
            toward controlled ground-state chemistry.<br>
