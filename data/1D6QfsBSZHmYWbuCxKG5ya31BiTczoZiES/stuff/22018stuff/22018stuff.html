                Islam has spawned many sects that are master
                practitioners of the art of double standards. As far as
                Muslims are concerned, what is good for Muslims is not
                good for the non-Muslims; and what is bad for Muslims is
                good for non-Muslims.<br>
                <br>
                What complicates matters is that there is no way of
                knowing which of the dozens of at-each-other’s-throat
                sects is the legitimate Islam. As soon as Muhammad died,
                his religion of peace became a house of internal war:
                jockeying for power and leadership started, sects formed
                and splintered into sub-sects, and bloodletting began in
                earnest.<br>
                <br>
                The internal infighting in Islam is presently playing in
                full color – in red – most dramatically, in the Iraq and
                Afghanistan and other Islamic theaters. Shiite raid
                Sunni civilians, slaughter them like sheep, and toss
                their bodies like trash in the streets or the rivers.
                The Sunnis return the favor with just as much
                viciousness and savagery.<br>
                <br>
                Question: If this is the way these Muslims treat each
                other, how would they deal with the infidels if they had
                the chance?<br>
                <br>
                Answer: These devoted followers of Muhammad would deal
                with the infidels exactly the way Muhammad did: behead
                the non-believers, take them as slaves to hold or sell,
                or make them pay back-breaking jizya – poll taxes.<br>
                <br>
                Some may object that writings like this are little more
                than hate-mongering and fanning the fire that rages
                between Islam and the non-Islamic world. They may
                further play the Islamic apologists’ few, well-worn
                propaganda cards as evidence for their contention that
                Islam is not what its detractors claim.<br>
                <br>
                Here are the few favorite cards:<br>
                <br>
                “There is no compulsion in religion,” says the Quran.
                (But the full context is never shown.)\<br>
                Islam means “peace,” so Islam is a religion of peace.<br>
                “For you, your religion, and for me, my religion,”
                Muhammad reportedly said.<br>
                <br>
                The Muslims and their apologists quickly run out of
                their few cards, and the rest of the Islamic deck is all
                about intolerance, hatred and violence toward the
                infidels, toward all others who are not true Muslims,
                and even toward those who consider themselves Muslims.
                Shiites, for instance, judge the Sunnis as traitors to
                Islam, and Sunnis condemn the Shiites as heretics. Each
                side deems the other worthy of death and hellfire.<br>
                <br>
                This internecine Islamic war of the religion of peace is
                not confined to the Shiite-Sunni divide. There are so
                many internal divisions within each side that listing
                and describing them comprehensively would be an
                encyclopedic work.<br>
                <br>
                So, who is right? What are the facts about Islam and how
                does Islam impact the ever-shrinking village Earth and
                its inhabitants? Admittedly, this is a huge question and
                cannot be answered satisfactorily in one article.
                However, some facts can be presented to help the reader
                decide.<br>
                <br>
                There is no need to belabor the point that Islam is not,
                and has never been, a religion of peace. The word Islam
                is derived from taslim, which purely means “submission,”
                while the term for “peace” is solh. Another derivation
                of the word taslim is “salema”, which means “good
                health” and so on.<br>
                <br>
                Irrespective of what the term Islam may mean, the facts
                on the ground conclusively demonstrate Islam’s violent
                nature from its very inception. No need to go back to
                the time of Muhammad and examine the historical records.
                Just a few contemporary events should make the point.<br>
                <br>
                Here is a partial list: the savage Shiite-Sunni
                bloodletting in Iraq; the barbarism of the resurgent
                Taliban in Afghanistan; the genocide in Sudan’s Darfur
                region; the Somali killings; the Iranian mullahs’ murder
                of their own people and support of mischief abroad; the
                incessant terrorist acts of Hamas, Hezbollah and Islamic
                Jihad on Israel, and numerous fatwas on infidels and the
                apostates; the bombing of Shiite mosques in Pakistan and
                Iraq and the Shiite retaliation against soft, innocent
                and civilian targets.<br>
                <br>
                Clearly, there is no place on the planet where Muslims
                reside that is in peace from the religion of peace.
                America, Spain, France, Netherlands, England, Thailand,
                France, India and Indonesia have already been attacked,
                while others, such as Denmark, have been threatened and
                sanctioned.<br>
                <br>
                Stretching the benefit of the doubt beyond limits, one
                may believe that all these acts of horrors are committed
                by a small minority of thugs and radicals who happened
                to be Muslims. Fine, let us ignore all those “fringes”
                for now – those who are giving Islam a bad reputation.
                And never mind Saudi Arabia, the cradle of barbarism,
                fixed in formaldehyde since Islam’s inception. Also, let
                us overlook the dastardly Shiite fanatics presently
                ruling (ruining) the great nation of Iran. Iranian
                Shiite Hitlerists are hell-bent on wiping Israel off the
                face of the planet, while viciously devastating Iran’s
                own largest minority – the Baha’is, people
                universally-recognized as law-abiding and peaceful.<br>
                <br>
                Islamic rules are called Sharia law or the Islamic law.
                Sharia law is a misnomer, for laws must be squarely
                based on justice and fairness to all, while Sharia law
                is nothing more than a primitive set of dogmata
                stipulated by men for the benefit of Muslim men.<br>
                <br>
                Sharia law disenfranchises women from their legitimate
                equal rights with men; prescribes barbaric punishments
                such as stoning, amputation of limbs and death. Sharia
                law, contrary to what its advocates claim, does not
                limit application of its draconian provisions to Muslims
                only: it considers any and all disputes involving
                Muslims with non-Muslims also in its purview to
                adjudicate. Sharia law is inherently arbitrary,
                obsolete, and discriminatory to the extreme. Wherever
                Sharia law rules, injustice prevails. Non-Muslims,
                women, and even children are victimized by its biased
                and cruel provisions.<br>
                <br>
                Sharia law represents a twist to the concept of Blind
                Justice: It is indeed blind to justice. Even a cursory
                examination of Sharia’s family law, for instance, proves
                unequivocally its blindness to justice: it makes the
                shameful past laws, such as Jim Crow laws, seem as
                paragons of fairness by comparison.<br>
                <br>
                These are the conditions on the ground wherever Sharia
                rules. Violence of all forms is endemic to Islamic law
                and is not confined to any fringes. Sharia law itself is
                the fringe–a fringe that is oppressive, hateful of
                others and violent to the core. Presently, fanatical
                Islam is lashing out with mad fury before its own final
                demise. The “infidel” world has been complicit in the
                surge of Islamism through its mistakes, complacency, and
                greed.<br>
                <br>
                Warning: Islam is not a religion but a political
                ideology which incites hate, violence, intolerance and
                terror. Islamists are terminators. You cannot bargain
                with them. You cannot reason with them. They do not feel
                pity or remorse, or fear. And they absolutely will not
                stop, ever, until all the infidels are dead or have
                submitted to Islam. “The only language the Islamists
                understand is the language of brute force.<br>
                <br>
                In non-Muslim lands, Islamism, flush with Petrodollars,
                has been accelerating in its drive for the world
                Caliphate and is moving at the speed of light by
                building more mosques, printing more indoctrinating
                Islamic books, imposing more its presence in the western
                culture, in our schools and university campuses,
                bullying, intimidating and challenging more Christians
                and other peaceful people of faith and by using our
                democratic laws against us.<br>
                <br>
                In the Islamdom, they can dish out insults to
                non-Muslims; arrest Christians, Bahia’s or the Jews just
                for praying. They can confiscate their Holy books and
                toss them in the trash. They call the Jews pigs and
                monkeys, and spit on anyone that isn’t Muslim. But they
                go into frenzies of righteous outrage at the slightest
                criticism of their barbaric and highly dangerous
                beliefs.<br>
                <br>
                They never need to challenge the existing political
                order in our country, but can achieve all their goals
                without bothering or violating the Constitution of the
                U.S. because that Constitution guarantees complete
                government non-interference toward religion. Finally,
                and the most important element perhaps is the extreme
                coziness and appeasement by the current U.S.
                administration towards Islam, Muslims and radical
                Muslims which will recklessly and unknowingly drag the
                whole country and her citizens into an everlasting
                Islamic inferno, an inferno similar to the Islamic
                Republic of Iran and other Islamic terrorist countries.<br>
                <br>
                A constitutional amendment must be passed quickly
                defining Islam as a hostile political force with a
                global totalitarian agenda, and as such is totally
                inimical to our constitution and our national security,
                and that further to this definition, all practicing
                Muslims must either renounce this cult or be deported to
                their countries of origin, and all mosques must be
                demolished, since their goal is to propagate political
                propaganda, which has nothing whatsoever to do with
                ‘religion’ – let alone one of ‘peace’. That’s going to
                be the final ‘solution’ for Islam in America.<br>
                <br>
                “Fight and kill the disbelievers wherever you find them,
                take them captive, harass them, lie in wait and ambush
                them using every stratagem of war.” Qur’an:9:5<br>
                <br>
                “Fight those who do not believe until they all
                surrender, paying the protective tax in submission.”
                Qur’an:9:29<br>
                <br>
                We must also end the deadly practice of “Political
                Correctness.” Truth, only naked truth, can set us free.
                And freedom is our greatest gift of life. Life without
                freedom is death disguised as life. Remember Patrick
                Henry’s cry: Give me liberty or give me death. Humanity
                cannot afford, and must not ignore, the emergence of the
                latest threat to its very existence on this planet. We
                must fight for life, for liberty, for freedom and end
                the nightmare of Islamic hellfire.<br>

            In an incident that took place less than two weeks after the
            Greek Defense Ministry announced that Turkey had violated
            Greek airspace 138 times in a single day, a Turkish coast
            guard patrol boat on February 13 rammed a Greek coast guard
            vessel off the shore of Imia, one of many Greek islands over
            which Turkey claims sovereignty.<br>
            <br>
            Most of the areas within modern Greece’s current borders
            were under the occupation of the Ottoman Empire from the
            mid-15th century until the Greek War of Independence in 1821
            and the establishment of the modern Greek state in 1832. The
            islands, however, like the rest of Greece, are legally and
            historically Greek, as their names indicate.<br>
            <br>
            Turkey’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP),
            however, and even much of the opposition seem intent on, if
            not obsessed with, invading and conquering these Greek
            islands, on the grounds that they are actually Turkish
            territory.<br>
            <br>
            In December, for instance, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, the leader of
            the main Turkish opposition CHP party, stated that when he
            wins the election in 2019, he will “invade and take over 18
            Greek islands in the Aegean Sea, just as former Turkish PM
            Bulent Ecevit invaded Cyprus in 1974.” He said that there is
            “no document” proving that those islands belong to Greece.<br>
            <br>
            Meral Akşener, the head of the newly established opposition
            “Good Party,” has also called for an invasion and conquest
            of the islands. “What is required must be done,” she tweeted
            on January 13.<br>
            <br>
            The most garish muscle-flexing has come from Turkish
            President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, of course, who seems
            emboldened by his military invasion of the Afrin region in
            northern Syria having gone virtually unchallenged.<br>
            <br>
            “We warn those who have crossed the line in the Aegean and
            Cyprus,” Erdoğan declared, continuing:<br>
            <br>
            “Their courage persists only until they see our army, our
            ships and our planes… Whatever Afrin is to us, our rights in
            the Aegean and Cyprus are the same. Do not ever think that
            the natural gas exploration in the waters of Cyprus and the
            opportunistic attempts in the Aegean Sea drop off our radar.<br>
            <br>
            “Just as we disrupt the plots [in the region] through
            Operation Euphrates Shield and Operation Olive Branch [on
            Syria], and soon in Manbij and other regions, we can and we
            will disrupt the plots of those who engage in
            miscalculations on our southern border… Our warships and air
            forces are keeping an eye on the area closely to intervene
            in every way when required.”<br>
            <br>
            Referring to the days of the Ottoman Empire, Erdoğan went
            on:<br>
            <br>
            “Those who think that we have erased from our hearts the
            lands from which we withdrew in tears a hundred years ago
            are wrong.<br>
            <br>
            “We say at every opportunity we have that Syria, Iraq and
            other places in the geography [map] in our hearts are no
            different from our own homeland. We are struggling so that a
            foreign flag will not be waved anywhere where adhan [Islamic
            call to prayer in mosques] is recited.<br>
            <br>
            “The things we have done so far [pale in comparison to the]
            even greater attempts and attacks [we are planning for] the
            coming days, inshallah [Allah willing].”<br>
            <br>
            The Ottoman dynasty and empire was established by a nomadic
            Turkmen chief sometime around the year 1300. During the more
            than 600 years of the Ottoman period, the Ottoman Turks, who
            also represented the Islamic Caliphate, regularly launched
            wars of jihad, invading and occupying lands across five
            continents.<br>
            <br>
            Neo-Ottomanists in Turkey still proudly embrace the concept
            of jihad (Islamic holy war) against the kafirs (infidels).
            The head of the state-funded Directorate of Religious
            Affairs, the Diyanet, has openly described Turkey’s recent
            military invasion of Afrin as “jihad.”<br>
            <br>
            This designation makes sense when one considers that Muslim
            Turks owe their demographic majority in Asia Minor to
            centuries of Turkish Muslim persecution and discrimination
            against the Christian, Yazidi and Jewish inhabitants of the
            area. In the 11th century, Turkic jihadists from Central
            Asia invaded and conquered the Greek-speaking, Christian
            Byzantine Empire, paving the way for the gradual
            Turkification and Islamization of the region through methods
            such as murder, kidnapping, rape and forced conversions.<br>
            <br>
            The greatest 20th century Turkish assault against Christians
            took place in the 1914-1923 genocide of Greeks, Armenians
            and Assyrians (Syriacs/Chaldeans) in Ottoman Turkey. This
            did not prevent Turkey, which continues to deny the
            genocide, from becoming a member of NATO in 1952. The
            assault also did not stop Turkey, three years after joining
            NATO, from committing a savage anti-Greek pogrom in Istanbul
            or from forcibly expelling the remaining Greeks from Turkey
            in 1964.<br>
            <br>
            It is precisely because the Turks have never been held
            accountable for their criminal actions and aggression that
            they continue to threaten the security and sovereignty of
            their neighbors. It is high time for the West wake up and
            take Ankara to task. <br>

                up with a way we could harvest energy from Earth by
                turning excess infrared radiation and waste heat into
                electricity we can use.<br>
                <br>
                The concept involves the strange physics of quantum
                tunnelling, and key to the idea is a specially designed
                antenna that can detect waste or infrared heat as
                high-frequency electromagnetic waves, transforming these
                quadrillionth-of-a-second wave signals into a direct
                charge.<br>
                <br>
                There's actually a lot of energy going to waste here on
                Earth – most sunlight that hits the planet gets sucked
                up by surfaces, the oceans, and our atmosphere.<br>
                <br>
                This warming leads to a constant leak of infrared
                radiation that some estimate to be as much as millions
                of gigawatts every second.<br>
                <br>
                Because the infrared wavelengths are so short, to
                harness them we need super-tiny antennas. According to
                the international team of researchers behind the new
                study, it's quantum tunnelling that could provide the
                breakthrough required.<br>
                <br>
                "There is no commercial diode in the world that can
                operate at such high frequency," says lead researcher
                Atif Shamim from the King Abdullah University of Science
                and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia. "That's why we
                turned to quantum tunnelling."<br>
                <br>
                Quantum tunnelling is a well-established phenomenon in
                quantum physics where a particle can get through a
                barrier without having enough energy to do so.<br>
                <br>
                One of the examples used most often is of a ball rolling
                up a hill: in classical physics, the ball needs a
                certain amount of energy behind it to get up the hill
                and over to the other side.<br>
                <br>
                But in quantum physics, the ball can tunnel through the
                hill with less energy, thanks to the positional
                uncertainty that's at the heart of everything quantum.<br>
                <br>
                How does this help in the construction of nanoscale
                antennas? It enables electrons to be moved through a
                small barrier, via a tunnelling device like a
                metal-insulator-metal (MIM) diode, turning infrared
                waves into current along the way.<br>
                <br>
                The scientists were able to create a new bowtie-shaped
                nanoantenna, sandwiching the thin insulator film between
                two slightly overlapped metallic arms made from gold and
                titanium, giving them a device capable of generating the
                intense electrical fields required for tunnelling to
                work.<br>
                <br>
                "The most challenging part was the nanoscale overlap of
                the two antenna arms, which required very precise
                alignment," says one of the researchers, Gaurav Jayaswal
                from KAUST.<br>
                <br>
                "Nonetheless, by combining clever tricks with the
                advanced tools at KAUST's nanofabrication facility we
                accomplished this step."<br>
                <br>
                The newly created MIM diode was able to successfully
                capture infrared radiation with zero applied voltage, so
                it only turns on when needed.<br>
                <br>
                While conventional solar panels can only harvest a small
                chunk of the visible light spectrum, being able to tap
                into all that excess infrared radiation as well would
                represent a revolutionary shift in energy production, a
                "game changer" in the words of the researchers.<br>
                <br>
                What's more, unlike solar power plants, these energy
                harvesters could operate around the clock, whatever the
                weather. Other scientists are working on cracking the
                same problem from different angles.<br>
                <br>
                Despite the huge promise, for the time being this is
                just another step along the road to figuring this out,
                and many technical challenges still lie ahead –
                currently, the antenna isn't very energy efficient, for
                example.<br>
                <br>
                "This is just the beginning – a proof of concept," says
                Shamim.<br>
                <br>
                Eventually, though, the tech could make a huge
                difference. "We could have millions of such devices
                connected to boost overall electricity generation," he
                adds.<br>

                Most sunlight striking the Earth is absorbed by its
                surfaces, oceans and atmosphere. As a result of this
                warming, infrared radiation is emitted constantly all
                around us—estimated to be millions of Gigawatts per
                second. A KAUST team has now developed a device that can
                tap into this energy, as well as waste heat from
                industrial processes, by transforming
                quadrillionth-of-a-second wave signals into useful
                electricity.<br>
                <br>
                Unlike solar panels that are limited by daylight hours
                and weather conditions, infrared heat can be harvested
                24 hours a day. One way to achieve this is to treat
                waste or infrared heat as high-frequency electromagnetic
                waves. Using appropriately designed antennas, collected
                waves are sent to a rectifier, typically a semiconductor
                diode, that converts alternating signals to direct
                current charge for batteries or power devices.<br>
                <br>
                Putting these ‘rectenna’ designs into practice has been
                difficult. Because infrared emissions have very small
                wavelengths, they need micro- or nanoscale antennas that
                are not easy to fabricate or test. Additionally,
                infrared waves oscillate thousands of times faster than
                a typical semiconductor can move electrons through its
                junction. “There is no commercial diode in the world
                that can operate at such high frequency,” says Atif
                Shamim, project leader from KAUST. “That’s why we turned
                to quantum tunneling.”<br>
                <br>
                Tunneling devices, such as metal-insulator-metal (MIM)
                diodes, rectify infrared waves into current by moving
                electrons through a small barrier. Since this barrier is
                only a nanometer thin, MIM diodes can handle
                high-frequency signals on the order of femtoseconds. To
                generate the intense fields needed for tunneling, the
                team turned to a unique ‘bowtie-shaped' nano-antenna
                that sandwiches the thin insulator film between two
                slightly overlapped metallic arms.<br>
                <br>
                "The most challenging part was the nanoscale overlap of
                the two antenna arms, which required very precise
                alignment,” says postdoctoral researcher, Gaurav
                Jayaswal. “Nonetheless, by combining clever tricks with
                the advanced tools at KAUST’s nanofabrication facility
                we accomplished this step".<br>
                <br>
                By choosing metals with different work functions, the
                new MIM diode could catch the infrared waves with zero
                applied voltage, a passive feature that switches the
                device on only when needed. Experiments with infrared
                exposure revealed the bowtie successfully harvested
                energy solely from the radiation, and not from thermal
                effects, as evidenced by a polarization-dependent output
                voltage.<br>
                <br>
                “This is just the beginning—a proof of concept,” says
                Shamim. “We could have millions of such devices
                connected to boost overall electricity generation.”</font><b><font

                Harevesting energy from waste heat which fluctuates
                between, approximately, 250 K and 1500 K, i.e., peaking
                at 2–11 µm, could be a game changer in terms of tapping
                on to renewable energy sources. However, research in
                this area has remained elusive due to numerous
                challenges. We consider waste heat to be an
                electromagnetic (EM) wave in the mid infrared (IR)
                frequency range, which can be captured through a
                resonant antenna and rectified into useful DC through a
                diode, an arrangement typically known as a rectenna. A
                bowtie antenna has been optimized for IR field capture
                and enhancement through EM simulations. At the overlap
                of the bowtie arms, a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) diode
                has been realized that can operate at such a high
                frequency (28.3 THz or 10.6 µm). The choice of a low
                permittivity insulator (Al2O3) helps metigate the RC
                time constant and the diode's cutoff frequency, whereas
                the two different work function metals, Au and Ti,
                facilitate diode operation through tunneling at no
                applied bias. A custom optical characterization setup
                employing a 10.6 µm CO2 laser has been used to assess
                the IR capture and rectification ability of the rectenna
                device. A polarization dependent voltage output which is
                well above the noise level and well matched with our
                calculations, confirms the successful rectenna
                operation. According to authors' best knowledge, this is
                the first demonstration of rectification at 28.3 THz
                through a MIM diode based rectenna at zero applied
                bias...<br>

                COLLEGE PARK -- Engineers at the University of Maryland,
                College Park (UMD) have found a way to make wood more
                than 10 times stronger and tougher than before, creating
                a natural substance that is stronger than many titanium
                alloys.<br>
                <br>
                "This new way to treat wood makes it 12 times stronger
                than natural wood and 10 times tougher," said Liangbing
                Hu of UMD's A. James Clark School of Engineering and the
                leader of the team that did the research, to be
                published on February 8, 2018 in the journal Nature.
                "This could be a competitor to steel or even titanium
                alloys, it is so strong and durable. It's also
                comparable to carbon fiber, but much less expensive." Hu
                is an associate professor of materials science and
                engineering and a member of the Maryland Energy
                Innovation Institute.<br>
                <br>
                "It is both strong and tough, which is a combination not
                usually found in nature," said Teng Li, the co-leader of
                the team and Samuel P. Langley Associate Professor of
                mechanical engineering at UMD's Clark School. His team
                measured the dense wood's mechanical properties. "It is
                as strong as steel, but six times lighter. It takes 10
                times more energy to fracture than natural wood. It can
                even be bent and molded at the beginning of the
                process."<br>
                <br>
                The team also tested the new wood material and natural
                wood by shooting bullet-like projectiles at it. The
                projectile blew straight through the natural wood. The
                fully treated wood stopped the projectile partway
                through.<br>
                <br>
                "Soft woods like pine or balsa, which grow fast and are
                more environmentally friendly, could replace
                slower-growing but denser woods like teak in furniture
                or buildings," Hu said.<br>
                <br>
                "The paper provides a highly promising route to the
                design of lightweight, high performance structural
                materials, with tremendous potential for a broad range
                of applications where high strength, large toughness and
                superior ballistic resistance are desired, " said
                Huajian Gao, a professor at Brown University who was not
                involved in the study. "It is particularly exciting to
                note that the method is versatile for various species of
                wood and fairly easy to implement."<br>
                <br>
                "This kind of wood could be used in cars, airplanes,
                buildings - any application where steel is used," Hu
                said.<br>
                <br>
                "The two-step process reported in this paper achieves
                exceptionally high strength, much beyond what [is]
                reported in the literature," said Zhigang Suo, a
                professor of mechanics and materials at Harvard
                University, also not involved with the study. "Given the
                abundance of wood, as well as other cellulose-rich
                plants, this paper inspires imagination."<br>
                <br>
                "The most outstanding observation, in my view, is the
                existence of a limiting concentration of lignin, the
                glue between wood cells, to maximize the mechanical
                performance of the densified wood. Too little or too
                much removal lower the strength compared to a maximum
                value achieved at intermediate or partial lignin
                removal. This reveals the subtle balance between
                hydrogen bonding and the adhesion imparted by such
                polyphenolic compound. Moreover, of outstanding
                interest, is the fact that that wood densification leads
                to both, increased strength and toughness, two
                properties that usually offset each other," said Orlando
                J. Rojas, a professor at Aalto University in Finland.<br>
                <br>
                Hu's research has explored the capacities of wood's
                natural nanotechnology. They previously made a range of
                emerging technologies out of nanocellulose related
                materials: (1) super clear paper for replacing plastic;
                (2) photonic paper for improving solar cell efficiency
                by 30%; (3) a battery and a supercapacitor out of wood;
                (4) a battery from a leaf; (5) transparent wood for
                energy efficient buildings; (6) solar water desalination
                for drinking and specifically filtering out toxic dyes.
                These wood-based emerging technologies are being
                commercialized through a UMD spinoff company, Inventwood
                LLC.<br>

                  Magnetic fields do not result from the movement of
                  electrons, but from their intrinsic magnetic field.
                  Moreover, the intrinsic magnetic field of the
                  electrons does not have a dipole structure, but a

                </font></b><font color="#000000">Philosophers once spoke
                of the Music of the Spheres, the idea that the movements
                of celestial bodies express an underlying logic, and
                that astronomical measurements and mathematical
                relationships correspond to so many “tones.” Today,
                another sort of harmony, just as inaudible but perhaps
                just as beautiful, may characterize proteins. Proteins,
                it turns out, vibrate in different patterns. And these
                vibrational patterns may help proteins alter their
                structures, affecting everything proteins do, from the
                take up and delivery of oxygen to the “tuning” of
                membrane ion channels to the replication of DNA. Life
                itself, at the molecular level, may be a kind of
                symphony.<br>
                <br>
                Such music, consisting of molecular motions, may enable
                proteins to change their shape quickly so they can
                readily bind to each other. This idea has inspired
                investigations since the 1960s. They proved frustrating,
                however. To look at large-scale correlated motions in
                proteins, scientists had to impose extremely dry and
                cold conditions. Even worse, such studies required
                expensive facilities, noted Andrea Markelz, Ph.D., a
                physics professor at the University of Buffalo (UB).
                Some scientists, added Dr. Markelz, even adopted the
                view that a protein is more like a wet sponge than a
                bell: “If you tap on a wet sponge, you don’t get any
                sustained sound.”<br>
                <br>
                Fortunately, Dr. Markelz was not discouraged. Along with
                colleagues from UB and Hauptman-Woodward Medical
                Research Institute (HWI), Dr. Markelz used a new imaging
                technique to observe in detail the vibrations of a
                lysozyme, an antibacterial protein. The technique, which
                is based on orientation-sensitive terahertz near-field
                microscopy, exploits an interesting characteristic of
                proteins—they vibrate at the same frequency as the light
                they absorb.<br>
                <br>
                “Our technique is easier and much faster” than the
                techniques that had encumbered earlier investigations,
                said Dr. Markelz. “You don’t need to cool the proteins
                to below freezing or use a synchrotron light source or a
                nuclear reactor—all things people have used previously
                to try to examine these vibrations.”..</font><b><font

                </font></b><font color="#000000">Dr. George Land and
                Beth Jarman were commissioned by NASA to help the space
                agency identify and develop creative talent. The two
                were tasked to research school children in an attempt to
                identify creative individuals from which the agency
                could pick to help with their many products. In a recent
                TED talk, Land described his team’s surprising findings
                on the education system which are nothing short of
                shocking.<br>
                <br>
                It seems American schoolchildren lose their ability to
                think creatively over time. As students enter their
                educational journey, they retain most of their abilities
                to think creatively. In other words, children are born
                with creative genius. Employing a longitudinal study
                model, Land and Jarman studied 1,600 children at ages 5,
                10, and 15.<br>
                <br>
                Surprisingly, Land said they discovered if given a
                problem with which they had to come up with an
                imaginative, and innovative solution, 98 percent of
                5-year-olds tested at the “genius” level. Simply put,
                their answers to how the problem should be solved were
                brilliant.<br>
                <br>
                Upon entry into the school system, those numbers started
                to drop dramatically. When the team returned to test
                those same subjects at age 10, the percentage of
                genius-level imaginative and innovative thinkers fell to
                an unthinkable 30 percent. The indicators led the
                researchers to believe the current educational system is
                to blame. Not only did 68 percent of those students lose
                their ability to think with imagination and innovation,
                the thought that only 30 percent could still do is
                unfathomable.<br>
                <br>
                The downward spiral continued to be demonstrated at age
                15. When the researchers returned, the percentage of
                genius-level students had dropped to an abysmal 12
                percent. Gasps could be heard all around the room as the
                audience attempted to process how such a brilliant group
                of students could sink so low in their imaginations and
                ability to solve problems with innovation...<br>

                </b><b>Researchers from Clemson's Nanomaterials
                  Institute (CNI) are one step closer to wirelessly
                  powering the world using triboelectricity -- a green
                  energy source.</b><br>
                <br>
                In March 2017, a group of physicists at CNI invented the
                ultra-simple triboelectric nanogenerator, or U-TENG -- a
                small device made simply of plastic and tape that
                generates electricity from motion and vibrations. When
                the two materials are brought together -- through
                clapping your hands or tapping your feet, for example --
                a voltage is generated that is detected by a wired,
                external circuit. Electrical energy, by way of the
                circuit, is then stored in a capacitor or a battery
                until it's needed.<br>
                <br>
                Nine months later, in a paper published in the journal
                Advanced Energy Materials, the researchers have
                uncovered a wireless version of TENG, called the W-TENG,
                which greatly expands the applications of the
                technology.<br>
                <br>
                The W-TENG was engineered under the same premise as the
                U-TENG, using materials that are so opposite in affinity
                for electrons that they generate a voltage when brought
                in contact with each other.<br>
                <br>
                In the W-TENG, plastic was swapped for a multipart fiber
                made of graphene -- a single layer of graphite, or
                pencil lead -- and a biodegradable polymer known as
                poly-lactic acid (PLA). PLA, on its own, is great for
                separating positive and negative charges, but not so
                great at conducting electricity -- which is why the
                researchers paired it with graphene. Kapton tape, the
                electron-grabbing material of the U-TENG -- was replaced
                with Teflon, a compound known for coating nonstick
                cooking pans.<br>
                <br>
                "We use Teflon because it has a lot of fluorine groups
                that are highly electronegative, whereas the
                graphene-PLA is highly electropositive. That's a good
                way to juxtapose and create high voltages," said
                Ramakrishna Podila, corresponding author of the study
                and an assistant professor of physics at Clemson.<br>
                <br>
                To obtain graphene, the researchers exposed its parent
                compound, graphite, to a high frequency sound wave. The
                sound wave then act as a sort of knife, slicing the
                "deck of cards" that is graphite into layer after layer
                of graphene. This process, called sonication, is how CNI
                is able to scale up production of graphene to meet the
                research and development demands of the W-TENG and other
                nanomaterial inventions in development.<br>
                <br>
                After assembling the graphene-PLA fiber, the researchers
                exploited additive manufacturing -- otherwise known as
                3D printing -- to pull the fiber into a 3D printer, and
                the W-TENG was born.<br>
                <br>
                The end result is a device that generates a max voltage
                of 3000 volts -- enough to power 25 standard electrical
                outlets, or on a grander scale, smart-tinted windows or
                a liquid crystal display (LCD) monitor. Because the
                voltage is so high, the W-TENG generates an electric
                field around itself that can be sensed wirelessly. Its
                electrical energy, too, can be stored wirelessly in
                capacitors and batteries...<br>

                A new “wireless” paradigm for harvesting mechanical
                energy via a 3D-printed wireless triboelectric
                nanogenerator (W-TENG) comprised of an ecofriendly
                graphene polylactic acid (gPLA) nanocomposite and Teflon
                is demonstrated. The W-TENG generates very high output
                voltages &gt;2 kV with a strong electric field that
                enables the wireless transmission of harvested energy
                over a distance of 3 m. The W-TENG exhibited an
                instantaneous peak power up to 70 mW that could be
                wirelessly transmitted for storage into a capacitor
                obviating the need for hard-wiring or additional
                circuitry. Furthermore, the use of W-TENG for wireless
                and secure actuation of smart-home applications such as
                smart tint windows, temperature sensors, liquid crystal
                displays, and security alarms either with a single or a
                specific user-defined passcode of mechanical pulses
                (e.g., Fibonacci sequence) is demonstrated. The scalable
                additive manufacturing approach for gPLA-based W-TENGs,
                along with their high electrical output and
                unprecedented wireless applications, is poised for
                revolutionizing the present mechanical energy harvesting
                technologies.<br>

                In 2012 Rebecca Sommer founded the refugee aid
                association Arbeitsgruppe Flucht + Menschen-Rechte (AG
                F+M) [Working Group Asylum + Human Rights]. At the end
                of 2015, this artist, photographer and journalist and
                documentary maker applauded Angela Merkel’s decision to
                open German’s borders to the “refugees” who had been
                blocked in Hungary, despite the vacuum effect this would
                create. “At that time I wanted to help everyone and
                truly believed that all these people were fleeing hell
                and were in a state of complete distress,” the German
                activist explained in an article published by the
                conservative Polish weekly&nbsp; Do Rzeczy&nbsp; on 15
                January, discussing how she woke up to reality.<br>
                <br>
                In 2015, her NGO had almost 300 volunteers who were
                giving German courses to the new arrivals.<br>
                <br>
                …”I thought their medieval view was going to change with
                time…but after having seen these situations occur
                repeatedly and observing what was happening around me,
                as a volunteer, I have had to recognise that the Muslim
                refugees have grown up with values that are totally
                different, they have undergone brainwashing from
                childhood on and are indoctrinated by Islam and
                absolutely do not intend to adopt our values. Worse,
                they regard we infidels with disdain and arrogance.”<br>
                <br>
                “It was a jarring perception when I noticed that these
                people I had helped, who were eating, drinking, dancing
                and laughing with me, who didn’t pray, who didn’t go to
                the mosque, who didn’t respect Ramadan, who made fun of
                religion and deeply religious people, called me ‘the
                stupid German whore’ when they were eating my food and
                were in my garden.”...<br>

            Stephan A. Schwartz is a Distinguished Consulting Faculty of
            Saybrook University. He is the columnist for the journal
            Explore, and editor of the daily web publication
            Schwartzreport.net in both of which he covers trends that
            are affecting the future. His other academic and research
            appointments include: Senior Fellow for Brain, Mind and
            Healing of the Samueli Institute; founder and Research
            Director of the Mobius laboratory. Government appointments
            include Special Assistant for Research and Analysis to the
            Chief of Naval Operations. Schwartz was the principal
            researcher studying the use of Remote Viewing in
            archaeology. Using Remote Viewing he discovered Cleopatra's
            Palace, Marc Antony's Timonium, ruins of the Lighthouse of
            Pharos, and sunken ships along the California coast, and in
            the Bahamas. He is the author of more than 130 technical
            reports and papers. He has written The Secret Vaults of
            Time, The Alexandria Project, Mind Rover, Opening to the
            Infinite, and The 8 Laws of Change.<br>
            <br>
            Here he discusses a project in which he was engaged from
            1978 through 1996, asking individuals who attended his
            workshops and conferences to envision life in the year 2050.
            He describes the care that he took to avoid suggesting
            answers himself. The results consistently described
            situations that turned out to be true, but were hard for him
            to accept at the time -- including the disappearance of the
            Soviet Union. He suggests that, in our future, virtual
            reality will become an accepted substitute for air travel.<br>

            findings regarding the placebo effect in mainstream

            Schwartz cites parapsychological research, particularly the

            The Dome: The Pacific paradise of Enewtak Atoll harbours a
            devastating secret - the toxic legacy of nuclear testing.
            Following a careless cleanup operation the Dome on Runit
            island continues to poison the life surrounding it.<br>
            <br>
            Between 1946-1958, the US military tested 43 nuclear bombs
            in the Pacific. Known as "The Tomb" by the local Enewetak
            community, a 46cm thick concrete dome seals 80,000 cubic
            metres of waste within a crater on the deserted Runit
            Island. The porous coral islands cannot contain this
            poisonous waste. “If it kills our reef, it kills our fish,
            kills our food...so there’s really nothing for us." Alson
            Kelen, an Enewtak leader. Jim Androll is one of 4,000
            cleanup veterans suffering with health issues resulting from
            exposure to plutonium and other carcinogens. “I didn’t know
            it was radioactive. They didn’t tell us ‘til we landed... I
            was told I was going to visit a tropical paradise."
            Unrecognised as "atomic veterans", these soldiers fail to
            qualify for health insurance as the US government refuses to
            shoulder accountability. Kathy Jetnil-Kijner is a
            Marshallese activist, fighting for justice and recognition
            from the global community. “We’re disposable, our lives

              <b>By Matt Agorist</b><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            A state-sponsored forced sterilization on a massive scale
            has allegedly taken place in Africa according to opposition
            leaders and the public who are railing against the
            government. An industrial pharmaceutical laboratory has
            since had its license suspended by the Kenya Accreditation
            Service as a result of the controversy.<br>
            <br>
            Kenya’s opposition leader Raila Odinga—who swore himself in
            as president on Tuesday—claimed that at least 500,000 young
            girls and women may be infertile, following a tetanus
            vaccine administered by the government in 2014 and 2015.<br>
            <br>
            The controversy began coming to a head in 2016 when
            Agriq-Quest Ltd, a Nairobi-based pharmaceutical company got
            in a dispute with Kenya’s Ministry of Health over their
            tetanus and polio vaccinations. A group of Catholic doctors
            originally made the accusations claiming that the vaccines
            may contain a hormone that is dangerous to young women and
            can cause potential sterilization.<br>
            <br>
            As the Agence de Presse Africaine reported:<br>
            <br>
            "Odinga said girls and women aged between 14 and 49 from the
            fastest growing populations in the country will not have
            children, because of a state-sponsored sterilization
            exercise that was sold to the country as a tetanus
            vaccination.<br>
            <br>
            "The Catholic Church was ignored when it mounted a strong
            but lonely campaign against the mass tetanus vaccination,
            after it raised concerns about the safety of the vaccine
            that was being used, he said.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;"At the time, the Catholic Church in Kenya claimed
            that the tetanus vaccine used by the government of Kenya and
            UN agencies was contaminated with a hormone (hCG) that can
            cause miscarriages and render some women sterile...."<br>

            </div>
            <b>Summary</b><br>
            <br>
            Patients lying in a vegetative state present severe
            impairments of consciousness [1] caused by lesions in the
            cortex, the brainstem, the thalamus and the white matter [2]
            . There is agreement that this condition may involve
            disconnections in long-range cortico–cortical and
            thalamo-cortical pathways [3] . Hence, in the vegetative
            state cortical activity is ‘deafferented’ from subcortical
            modulation and/or principally disrupted between
            fronto-parietal regions. Some patients in a vegetative state
            recover while others persistently remain in such a state.
            The neural signature of spontaneous recovery is linked to
            increased thalamo-cortical activity and improved
            fronto-parietal functional connectivity [3] . The likelihood
            of consciousness recovery depends on the extent of brain
            damage and patients’ etiology, but after one year of
            unresponsive behavior, chances become low [1] . There is
            thus a need to explore novel ways of repairing lost
            consciousness. Here we report beneficial effects of vagus
            nerve stimulation on consciousness level of a single patient
            in a vegetative state, including improved behavioral
            responsiveness and enhanced brain connectivity patterns.<br>

            of rising anti-Semitism" and that therefore books like The
            Six Million: Fact or Fiction? needed to be removed from the
            public arena.<br>
            <br>
            As everyone now knows, the "threats against the Jewish
            Community Centers" all came from a Jew, Micheal Ron David
            Kadar, in Israel, who was only arrested after the US sent
            the FBI to that country, because the Israeli police had not
            acted against him.<br>
            <br>
            When he was arrested, it turned out he had over $250K in
            bitcoin, payment for the thousands of threats to Jewish
            centers all over the world, all very handily providing the
            excuse of "rising anti-Semitism" to ban books...<br>
            <br>
            Needless to say, when the US asked Israel to extradite
            Kadar, the request was refused.<br>
            <br>
            So it turned out that it was all a set-up, albeit one with
            which Amazon played along willingly.<br>
            <br>
            In reaction to this draconian and unwarranted censorship, I
            have waited until International Holocaust Remembrance Day,
            January 27, 2018, to prepare and release free on the
            Internet the very latest updated edition of The Six Million:

            <div align="center"><b>Music really is a universal language</b><br>
            </div>
            <i><br>
              People in 60 countries listened to songs from 86 mostly
              small-scale societies&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i><i><br>
            </i><i> They successfully inferred song functions on the
              basis of song form alone</i><i><br>
            </i><i> Listener ratings were guided by both contextual and
              musical features of the songs</i><i><br>
            </i><i> Human song therefore exhibits widespread
              form-function associations</i><i><br>
            </i><i> </i><i><br>
            </i>Every culture enjoys music and song, and those songs
            serve many different purposes: accompanying a dance,
            soothing an infant, or expressing love. Now, after analyzing
            recordings from all around the world, researchers reporting
            in Current Biology on January 25 show that vocal songs
            sharing one of those many functions tend to sound similar to
            one another, no matter which culture they come from. As a
            result, people listening to those songs in any one of 60
            countries could make accurate inferences about them, even
            after hearing only a quick 14-second sampling.<br>
            <br>
            The findings are consistent with the existence of universal
            links between form and function in vocal music, the
            researchers say.<br>
            <br>
            "Despite the staggering diversity of music influenced by
            countless cultures and readily available to the modern
            listener, our shared human nature may underlie basic musical
            structures that transcend cultural differences," says Samuel
            Mehr at Harvard University.<br>
            <br>
            "We show that our shared psychology produces fundamental
            patterns in song that transcend our profound cultural
            differences," adds co-first author of the study Manvir
            Singh, also at Harvard. "This suggests that our emotional
            and behavioral responses to aesthetic stimuli are remarkably
            similar across widely diverging populations."<br>
            <br>
            Across the animal kingdom, there are links between form and
            function in vocalization. For instance, when a lion roars or
            an eagle screeches, it sounds hostile to naive human
            listeners. But it wasn't clear whether the same concept held
            in human song.<br>
            <br>
            Many people believe that music is mostly shaped by culture,
            leading them to question the relation between form and
            function in music, Singh says. "We wanted to find out if
            that was the case or not."<br>

            Earlier detection is key to reducing cancer deaths. Here we
            describe a blood test that can detect eight common cancer
            types through assessment of the levels of circulating
            proteins and mutations in cell-free DNA. We applied this
            test, called CancerSEEK, to 1,005 patients with
            non-metastatic, clinically detected cancers of the ovary,
            liver, stomach, pancreas, esophagus, colorectum, lung, or
            breast. CancerSEEK tests were positive in a median of 70% of
            the eight cancer types. The sensitivities ranged from 69% to
            98% for the detection of five cancer types (ovary, liver,
            stomach, pancreas, and esophagus) for which there are no
            screening tests available for average-risk individuals. The
            specificity of CancerSEEK was &gt; 99%: only 7 of 812
            healthy controls scored positive. In addition, CancerSEEK
            localized the cancer to a small number of anatomic sites in
            a median of 83% of the patients.<br>

            </div>
            <b>Our Process</b><br>
            <br>
            We are the only company known to strictly follow the
            original Baati / Paris method of Carbon 60 olive oil
            preparation.<br>
            We start with 99.9+ % purified, research grade, solvent-free
            Carbon 60.<br>
            We use 5 grams of our Carbon 60 per liter of olive oil. This
            is more than 6 times the amount of Carbon 60 that can
            possibly saturate the solution. This is very important, as
            not all of the Carbon 60 being mixed with olive oil will
            dissolve in a two week mixing time.<br>
            Many of our competitors cut corners by using an industrial
            grade Carbon 60 (containing dangerous solvents), and/or
            simply putting in 0.8 or 0.9 grams of Carbon 60 per liter of
            olive oil, which always results in an inferior product. Our
            own in-house experiments have shown that you cannot achieve
            a fully saturated 0.8 grams per liter (0.8 mg per ml)
            solution if you do not start with the entire 5 grams per
            liter mix ratio described in the Baati process. Some
            companies are even boiling their olive oil to try to
            dissolve the carbon faster. This destroys the polyphenols in
            the olive oil, and results in a damaged, black oil.<br>
            After extensively researching olive oil quality we found
            that small batch extra virgin olive oil is notoriously
            inconsistent in quality. It is our determination that the
            best, most consistent quality olive oil available is
            Kirkland brand Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil, which is what
            we have been using for several years.<br>
            We mix our 5 grams of Carbon 60 per liter of olive oil for 2
            weeks using specialized equipment that ensures full
            suspension of Carbon 60 particles during the entire mixing
            operation. The mixing occurs in complete darkness, in
            temperature controlled conditions, to avoid Carbon 60
            degradation from light or heat.<br>
            Our fully saturated Carbon 60 solution is then centrifuged
            at 5,000 g for one hour to remove the undissolved Carbon 60
            .<br>
            This clarified, fully saturated Carbon 60 solution is then
            sterile filtered through a 0.22 micron filter.<br>
            We then bottle our solution in amber glass bottles, and
            package for delivery to you. Our packaging is designed to be
            extremely robust to prevent breakage, and conforms to
            international standards for shipping liquids in glass
            containers. We have not experienced a single broken bottle
            delivery since adopting our current shipping system in 2013.<br>
            We are the only company proven to consistently provide a
            fully saturated, 0.8 mg per ml Carbon 60 olive oil solution.
            Don’t settle for the slightly less expensive, vastly
            inferior products available from our competitors. Insist on
            fully saturated Carbon 60 olive oil solution from the only
            company that has been doing it right from the beginning!<br>

            <b> </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
            Countless studies showed that [60]fullerene (C(60)) and
            derivatives could have many potential biomedical
            applications. However, while several independent research
            groups showed that C(60) has no acute or sub-acute toxicity
            in various experimental models, more than 25 years after its
            discovery the in vivo fate and the chronic effects of this
            fullerene remain unknown. If the potential of C(60) and
            derivatives in the biomedical field have to be fulfilled
            these issues must be addressed. Here we show that oral
            administration of C(60) dissolved in olive oil (0.8 mg/ml)
            at reiterated doses (1.7 mg/kg of body weight) to rats not
            only does not entail chronic toxicity but it almost doubles
            their lifespan. The effects of C(60)-olive oil solutions in
            an experimental model of CCl(4) intoxication in rat strongly
            suggest that the effect on lifespan is mainly due to the
            attenuation of age-associated increases in oxidative stress.
            Pharmacokinetic studies show that dissolved C(60) is
            absorbed by the gastro-intestinal tract and eliminated in a
            few tens of hours. These results of importance in the fields
            of medicine and toxicology should open the way for the many
            possible -and waited for- biomedical applications of C(60)
            including cancer therapy, neurodegenerative disorders, and
            ageing.<br>

            <b>How To Shut Down Conversational Bullies </b>--- Have you
            seen the Jordan Peterson and Cathy Newman debate? See for
            yourself how he deals with it and give us your opinion in
            the comments! We've all found ourselves in conversation and
            felt attacked like we started off talking about one thing
            and then the other person twisted our words and before we
            knew it, we lost our cool, lost respect in their eyes, and
            maybe even acted like a jerk. Now, I don't normally do the
            same person twice in a row but this interview between Cathy
            Newman and Jordan Peterson was just too interesting of an
            opportunity to discuss how you can handle someone who uses
            subtle conversational tricks to bully you into looking dumb.
            So in this video, you're gonna see firsthand some of the
            most common tricks that people might be using on you and
            you're also gonna learn how to reverse those so that you can
            walk out of a kind of aggressive situation having earned
            more respect than you had going in. So first off, to stop a
            conversational bully, you have to realize what's going on
            before it's too late. Now, typically, a person will reveal
            their aggressive attitude early on with their tone of voice
            and their word choice. Check out the rest that we will show
            in this video and how Jordan Peterson tackles them. 1:49

            agreeing with you <br>
