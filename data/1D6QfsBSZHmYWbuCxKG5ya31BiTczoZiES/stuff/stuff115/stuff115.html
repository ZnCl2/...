            Europe in 2015: French Expert</b></big><b><br>
        </b></div>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><i>A French journalist and Middle East expert
          has told Sputnik that Europe should prepare for systematic
          attacks by Islamic State militants in the coming year.</i><br>
      </div>
      <i> </i><br>
      MOSCOW, December 30 (Sputnik) — In an interview with Sputnik,
      well-known French journalist and Middle East intelligence services
      expert Jean-Michel Vernochet said that he foresees an impending
      Islamic State group attack on Europe in the very near future.<br>
      <br>
      According to Vernochet, there are some who, in addition to seeking
      "to transform Europe into the land of Islam," also "want to turn
      it into the land of war."<br>
      <br>
      "You’ve probably heard about the recent events in France – in
      Nantes and in Dijon, in the suburbs of large cities," Vernochet
      recalls. "Police officers attacked by people wielding knives; cars
      ramming into crowds –in Nantes and in Dijon! Some people were
      seriously hurt. And more of these incidents keep happening."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Terrorist Activity in 2014: Facts and Details</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The expert notes that while "authorities are attempting to
      downplay [these incidents] as unrelated outbreaks," in reality
      "there is a connection. The perpetrators are being portrayed as
      unstable individuals. Let us assume that they acted on personal
      motives, as it makes things appear much better. Obviously they are
      unstable [individuals], which is why they did all these things,
      but there are many others who carefully consider their actions,
      and whose [terror] actions may be much more effective as a
      result."<br>
      <br>
      "Therefore," Vernochet explains, "Europe cannot consider itself
      safe, especially considering the fact that France, together with
      the United Kingdom and Australia (you’ve probably heard of what
      happened there recently), are members of the US-led coalition of
      61 states assembled to fight [IS]."<br>
      <br>
      Worst of all, in the journalist's view, is the fact that the
      Islamic State is "a movement created and supported by the United
      States," which "may at first seem paradoxical." Vernochet likened
      what he viewed as simultaneous US support for and campaign against
      IS as being akin to "a brake next to a gas pedal in a race car. On
      the one hand, the movement is being supported, and on the other,
      it is being opposed and contained." Vernochet marked this apparent
      paradox down to geopolitical interests.<br>
      <br>
      <b>A Global Anti-Fundamentalist Militant War to Involve China,
        India</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Vernochet believes that in today's interconnected world there is
      no point in using "concepts of global or local wars…[as] both of
      these concepts are intertwined." The journalist cited the presence
      of Islamic militants from across the world participating in the
      conflict in Mesopotamia and the Levant. "Those who believe that
      only local activists participate in regional conflicts should be
      reminded of Chechen fighters in Syria and Iraq. Another example is
      the stream of Uygur militants coming from China," the expert
      explained.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Sputnik/ Andrey Stenin : Islamic State Emissaries Sighted Near
        Russian Borders: Foreign Minister</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In this connection, Vernochet notes that even those countries,
      like China, that seek to distance themselves from the conflicts in
      the Middle East, cannot do so. He believes that "with the help of
      the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, [China] seeks to reinforce
      the Russia-China defense bloc that may eventually be joined by
      India." As far as India is concerned, Vernochet explains that
      there are 400 million Muslims in India, and that "back in the 19th
      century certain Indian sects [had] already swore fealty to Wahhabi
      movements that became widespread in Punjab and in Peshawar." The
      "real situation is quite different from what we [in the West]
      think it is, as things are moving to a global level," the
      journalist says.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Saudi and Qatari Petrodollars Spreading Radical Wahhabi Islamic
        Sects to the West</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In his recent book "Les Egares: Le Wahhabisme est-il un contre
      Islam?" ("The Perplexed: Is Wahhabism One Against Islam?")
      Vernochet provides what he says is "a comprehensive description of
      the world of Muslim sects that are intertwined with US
      intelligence, which [have] turned Saudi Arabia into an instrument
      of war." Vernochet notes that "Sunni Islam [was] always inspired
      by the example of the Ottoman Empire as the embodiment of ummah –
      "the Islamic world". During the First World War the West created a
      monster [in the Middle East] that somewhat resembles the European
      Protestant sects of the 17th century. The Protestant sects gave
      birth to America, and the Sufi sects gave birth to the terrorist
      state that is now so dear to Washington."<br>
      <br>
      Most controversially of all, Vernochet notes that "now, having
      cleared some space, the US, together with Saudi Arabia, is
      building an entire army poised to attack Europe. This is an
      experienced army that has no qualms about chopping off heads… Its
      warriors have been fighting since their teens and they have
      already lost everything…. Alas, poor West!"<br>

      A Chronon -- the smallest unit of Time measurable by Planck Unit
      T* -- has a net polarity of zero ( T0 ). To date , it has been
      considered to be " immutable ". <br>
      <br>
      Recently, however, the existence of several other forms of Time
      allegedly exist, and that existence was revealed by Pleiadian ETs
      to one Robert Nelson, proprietor of something called " Rex
      Research " in Las Vegas, NV.<br>
      <br>
      "I have no idea whatsoever what this means", he said to our
      intrepid reporter. " I am merely the messenger. " Semjase gave me
      a dvd that I've posted on the YouTube Pleiades Channel and several
      other sites. It explains everything in exhausting detail.<br>
      <br>
      In the new scheme of things, the allotropic forms of elementary
      Time ( T* ) are : <br>
      <br>
      ( T*- , negative [ " bad " ] Time) ,<br>
      &nbsp;( T*+ , positive [ "good" ] Time ) ,<br>
      ( T* n ,&nbsp; [&nbsp; " Now "&nbsp; ] ), <br>
      <br>
      and their isotopes : <br>
      <br>
      T*p ( Time Past ), <br>
      T*f ( Time Future, T*f),<br>
      T*n ( Time Now , Tn ).<br>
      <br>
      Time quantae can be generated by specific configurations of Form,
      Magnetism, and Electricity, and Frequency, yielding :<br>
      <br>
      T*p, T*f, and Tn exist in Positive, Neutral, and Negative forms,
      thus :<br>
      <br>
      T*p+ , T*p- , T*p=<br>
      T*f+ , T*f- , T*f=<br>
      T*n+ , T*n- , T*n=<br>
      <br>
      &amp;c...<br>
      <br>
      The new scheme also requires the existence of an ineffable
      supra-species labeled " Out-of-Time " ( T*=0 ), from which derive
      the plenum of relationships. These can be unified and managed with
      basic matrix algebra. Higher order configurations can be managed
      in a more adept manner by means of the permutations in Maxwell's
      Quaternion formulae ( original edition ).<br>

      <b>Significance</b><br>
      <br>
      The quest to find life in extreme and extraterrestrial
      environments is exciting and touches many research fields. One of
      the common signatures of life is movement: Even small
      microorganisms vibrate in response to their metabolic activity.
      Thus, we have devised a nanomotion detector to study these
      fluctuations and to associate them to the metabolic activity of
      the specimens. This technique does not measure the chemical
      response of life, which would require prior knowledge of the
      metabolic pathways involved. Instead, it monitors the physical
      manifestation of any kind of metabolic activity the microorganisms
      might have. Here, we show how this nanomotion detector can study
      any living system, paving the way to a complementary approach to
      the study of life in extreme environments.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      The existence of life in extreme conditions, in particular in
      extraterrestrial environments, is certainly one of the most
      intriguing scientific questions of our time. In this report, we
      demonstrate the use of an innovative nanoscale motion sensor in
      life-searching experiments in Earth-bound and interplanetary
      missions. This technique exploits the sensitivity of
      nanomechanical oscillators to transduce the small fluctuations
      that characterize living systems. The intensity of such movements
      is an indication of the viability of living specimens and conveys
      information related to their metabolic activity. Here, we show
      that the nanomotion detector can assess the viability of a vast
      range of biological specimens and that it could be the perfect
      complement to conventional chemical life-detection assays. Indeed,
      by combining chemical and dynamical measurements, we could achieve
      an unprecedented depth in the characterization of life in extreme
      and extraterrestrial environments.<big><b><br>

      modulus data obtained through contact measurement with the sample
      as a function of depth is used in the detection of features,

      preferably until it reaches a desired depth, and force-deflection
      data is measured as a function of depth. The FD data is broken
      into subsets or segments, each of which is independently analyzed
      to determine a stiffness or elastic modulus. The stiffness or
      elastic modulus data is used in determining whether there is great
      enough difference or contrast in any portion of the data to detect
      presence of a feature with a stiffness different than its

            our bones</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      New research by Queensland University of Technology is helping
      scientists better understand how bone cells work and may one day
      lead to the development of technology that can speed up the time
      it takes to heal fractured and broken bones.<br>
      <br>
      QUT recent graduate Dr Gwynne Hannay has built a gadget capable of
      promoting bone cell formation in the laboratory.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Hannay said his device replicated the mechanical and electrical
      stimulants which occurred naturally in the body to repair
      fractured and broken bones.<br>
      <br>
      "This device is about trying to grow bone tissue in the same
      environment our body grows bones. I have taken bone cells and put
      them in the physical environment they would experience in the
      body, and then varied the stimulants to extract a beneficial
      environment for tissue growth," he said.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Hannay's research has advanced the understanding of how bone
      cells can be stimulated to heal factures and has for the first
      time combined the artificial reproduction of both mechanical and
      electrical stimulants.<br>
      <br>
      "Previous research has looked at both of these stimulants
      individually, but not together, neglecting the fact that both are
      occurring in normal healthy bone during fracture healing"<br>
      <br>
      He said by combining the two stimulants, a synergistic effect was
      produced.<br>
      <br>
      "That means when you apply both the mechanical and electrical
      stimulants together a result greater than the sum of the two
      stimulants applied individually is achieved. It creates a greater
      output," he said.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Hannay said that unfortunately when bones fractured or broke,
      especially in older people, the healing process could stall.<br>
      <br>
      "We find bones can get half way through the healing process but
      won't heal properly and with an aging population this is a growing
      problem for orthopaedic surgeons to accommodate and one that is
      not easily solved with current methodologies," he said.<br>
      <br>
      "In the future we might be able to make a device utilising these
      combined stimulants that could be attached to the body and help
      heal the bone."<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, normal fractures that would otherwise heal
      successfully could be accelerated with the use of these
      stimulants.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Hannay said normal fractures in young, healthy people took
      approximately six to eight weeks to heal.<br>
      <br>
      "It might be possible to significantly reduce the healing time.
      That would be the goal."<br>
      <br>
      Dr Hannay graduated from QUT with a PhD from the Faculty of Built
      Environment and Engineering.<br>

      The aim of this project was to evaluate the effects of mechanical
      strain and indirect electrical stimulation upon the development of
      bone forming osteoblast cells and any possible synergistic effects
      of the two stimulants. This aim was achieved by using a novel
      device, designed and developed with the capability of creating a
      cell substrate surface strain along with an exogenous electrical
      stimulant individually or at the same time. Proliferation and
      differentiation was determined as a measure of cellular
      development. The indirect electrical stimulation was achieved
      through the use of pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) stimulation
      while the mechanical strain was produced from the dynamic
      stretching of a deformable cell substrate. The PEMF signal
      mimicked a clinically available bone growth stimulator signal.
      Results showed reduced proliferation and increased differentiation
      (alkaline phosphatase activity) with SaOS-2 osteoblast-like cell
      cultures, which were exposed to indirect electrical stimulation.
      MG-63 osteoblast-like cell cultures also showed reduced
      proliferation, however they did not show an increase in their
      differentiation with PEMF exposure. Mechanical stimulation alone
      did not have a significant effect over either proliferation or
      differentiation, while a dual mechanical and electrical
      stimulation resulted in cellular differentiation significantly
      increasing. It is possible a synergistic interaction between the
      two stimulants is occurring on a biological level. <br>

      The figure shows how much light (PLE, photoluminescence
      excitation) the individual pyramid-shaped antenna emits at various
      wavelengths (colours) of light in comparison to the antennas in
      the array. The individual antenna peaks at a wavelength <br>

      <br>
      Researchers from FOM Institute AMOLF and Philips Research have
      designed and fabricated a new type of nanoscale antenna. The new
      antennas look like pyramids, rather than the more commonly used
      straight pillars. The pyramid shape enhances the interference
      between the magnetic and electric fields of light. This makes the
      pyramid-shaped antenna capable of enhancing light emission and
      beaming different colours of light towards opposite directions.
      This finding could lead to more efficient light emitting devices
      (LEDs). The researchers published their results online on 12
      December 2014 in Physical Review Letters.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Individual antennas</b><br>
      <br>
      A straight nanoscale antenna will mainly respond to the electric
      field of light. This means that the effects of the magnetic field
      of light, which holds half of the energy of light, are
      disregarded. For a long time this was not considered as an issue
      that could be solved, because most of the metals used to fabricate
      antennas do not respond to the magnetic field of light anyway.<br>
      <br>
      This changed recently, due to the rapid developments in
      metamaterial research. What seemed to be impossible in the past –
      making antennas that respond strongly to the magnetic field of
      light—can now be done by structuring metals on the nanoscale.<br>
      <br>
      With these ideas in mind, the AMOLF and Philips researchers built
      the pyramid shaped antenna. By carefully designing the height and
      inclination of the antenna's side walls, the researchers found
      that the response to the magnetic field of light is almost as
      strong as the response to the electric field of light.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Antennas in an array</b><br>
      <br>
      After witnessing the described effects in individual nanoscale
      antennas, the researchers took it one step further and placed
      multiple pyramid-shaped antennas in an array. The effect that the
      antennas have on each other turns out to be quite striking. At
      certain wavelengths (colours) of light, the antennas can couple to
      each other via the light that is scattered on the surface of the
      array. This makes the group of antennas more effective in beaming
      light than the sum of the individual antennas. In addition, the
      antenna array may operate collectively at one wavelength, while at
      the same time the antennas operate individually at a different
      wavelength. Thus, the same array of pyramid-shaped antennas may
      beam light of a certain colour upward, and of a different colour
      downward.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Applications</b><br>
      <br>
      The array of nanoscale pyramid-shaped antennas has great potential
      for the improvement of LEDs. Currently, many LEDs are designed to
      emit light in one direction, for instance only 'upward'. Such LEDs
      are used for example in automotive lighting or spotlight
      illumination. Unfortunately, the light emitting material inside a
      LED emits light with equal intensities both upward and downward.
      Since only the 'upward' emission is useful, the downward moving
      light needs to be recycled by adding several optical elements,
      such as mirrors, to the LED. These elements make the LED bulky and
      less efficient, since some light is inevitably lost during the
      recycling process.<br>
      <br>
      Integrating the pyramid shaped antennas in the LED has great
      potential for overcoming these disadvantages. The pyramid-shaped
      antennas are able to selectively beam one colour of light upward.
      If an undesired colour is present, this can be beamed downward.
      This development could greatly enhance the efficiency of single
      LEDs and improve the integration of LEDs in combined light
      systems.<br>

          </big></b></div>
      <br>
      In the video above, Dr. Mark Geier explains the fraud behind the
      flu vaccine. Dr. Geier is NOT anti-vaccine. He is an MD and has a
      PhD in genetics. He spent 10 years working at the National
      Institute of Health, and was a professor at John Hopkins
      University as a geneticist. He is also the author of over 150
      peer-reviewed publications.<br>
      <br>
      He worked on vaccine safety and efficacy for more than 30 years.
      He was one of four scientists who worked to replace the DTP
      vaccine, a vaccine that caused every child to become sick with a
      high fever at the time of vaccination, with the DTaP vaccine,
      which is an attenuated vaccine and causes illness due to fever in
      only 3% of those vaccinated.<br>
      <br>
      In the video above, he explains that the flu shot causes
      Guillain-Barré Syndrome, and that the flu shot is not very
      effective in preventing the flu. He also explains that the CDC
      does not follow the law for vaccines in requiring long-term safety
      testing for the influenza vaccine like they do with other
      vaccines, as it is impossible to test a vaccine that changes every
      year. So the flu vaccine is basically an experimental vaccine that
      they want to give out to 300 million people every year. There are
      also no studies showing the safety of giving the flu vaccine to
      the same person every single year. However, Dr. Geier points out
      that the CDC is in the business of distributing flu vaccines,
      because they represent 300 million doses per year, whereas all the
      childhood vaccines together only number 20 million.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Geier goes on to explain that flu is “the wrong thing to
      vaccinate against” because you have to keep re-vaccinating against
      it every year, unlike childhood infectious diseases, such as
      smallpox, that are only vaccinated for once. Dr. Geier points out
      how ridiculous it is spend billions of dollars on a vaccine that
      might, at its best, save about 50 lives a year, when there are far
      more serious problems causing death that are more worthy of that
      kind of expenditure.<br>
      <br>
      Be informed, don’t become a statistic of those damaged or killed
      by the flu vaccine! There are many other less dangerous ways to
      protect oneself from influenza.<br>

      It's long been known that human fat cells are composed of carbon,
      hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. What's just been discovered by
      Australian scientists is that when we "burn" fat, almost all the
      broken-down fat molecules are exhaled through the lungs as carbon
      dioxide.<br>
      <br>
      The research team, led by Ruben Meerman and Andrew Brown of the
      University of New South Wales, discovered that when 1kg (2.2lb) of
      fat is fully oxidized ("burnt"), 0.84kg (1.9lb) departs via the
      lungs as carbon dioxide. The remaining 0.16kg (0.3lb) becomes
      water which may be excreted in the urine, feces, sweat, breath, or
      tears.<br>
      <br>
      The analysis shows that the inhaled oxygen required for this
      metabolic process weighs nearly three times more than the fat
      being lost.<br>
      <br>
      "None of this biochemistry is new, but for unknown reasons it
      seems nobody has thought of performing these calculations before,"
      says Brown. "The quantities make perfect sense but we were
      surprised by the numbers that popped out."<br>
      <br>
      Meerman explained that at rest, an average 70kg (154lb) person
      exhales around 200ml (0.4 pint) of CO2 in 12 breaths per minute.
      "Each of those breaths therefore excretes 33mg of CO2, of which
      9mg is carbon. By simply exhaling 17,280 times, an average person
      therefore loses at least 200g (7oz) of carbon every day and
      roughly a third of that weight loss is achieved during eight hours
      of sleep."<br>
      <br>
      "Keeping the weight off simply requires that you put less back-in
      by eating than you've exhaled by breathing," added Brown.
      "Replacing one hour of rest with exercise that raises the
      metabolic rate to seven times that of resting by, for example,
      jogging, removes an additional 40g (1.4oz) of carbon from the
      body, raising the total by about 20 percent to 240g (8.4oz).<br>
      <br>
      But the researchers point out that, for comparison, a single 100g
      muffin represents about 20 percent of an average person's total
      daily energy requirement. "Physical activity as a weight loss
      strategy is, therefore, easily foiled by relatively small
      quantities of excess food," they note. "Losing weight requires
      unlocking the carbon stored in fat cells, thus reinforcing that
      often heard refrain of 'eat less, move more.'" <br>

      (NaturalNews) Mainstream media's attention in America to the Ebola
      crisis in West Africa has long since wandered off, but that
      doesn't make the crisis any less real for the people living there.
      As of December 7, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is
      tracking a total of 17,908 cases of Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and
      Sierra Leone. 6,373 people have died from contracting the virus,
      according to the report. Other countries affected by the spread of
      Ebola include Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain and the United States,
      though the outbreaks in these nations are minimal in comparison.<br>
      <br>
      Sierra Leone currently has 7,897 cases, and 1,768 people have died
      there. The CDC's Ebola treatment web page states that currently
      "no FDA-approved vaccine or medicine (e.g., antiviral drug) is
      available for Ebola." That is to say, no cure has been found in
      conventional, corporate medicine. The CDC's best answer is to hope
      that the virus is detected early, then provide intravenous fluids
      and electrolyte salts, maintain oxygen levels and blood pressure,
      and treat other infections when they occur. In layman's terms,
      keep them watered, fed and comfortable and hope for the best.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Ebola continues to spread in West Africa as conventional
        medicine fails to stem the tide</b><br>
      <br>
      The situation in West Africa, and especially Sierra Leone, is
      getting worse. According to a recent report, the eastern district
      of Kano has been put on a two-week lockdown due to a surge of
      infections discovered by healthcare workers there. The report,
      published by Al Jazeera and citing the World Health Organization
      (WHO), also states that Sierra Leone has now surpassed Liberia as
      the country most affected by the deadly virus. "[T]he WHO said on
      Wednesday that it had found bodies piled up at the only hospital
      in Kono, a district of about 350,000 people bordering Guinea,"
      according to the report.<br>
      <br>
      With a scenario this bleak, it would seem that any possible
      solution to the 2014 Ebola outbreak would be under consideration
      by health authorities in these countries, the WHO, the CDC and
      other relevant medical authorities. But that is not the case.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Rowen-Robins Ebola protocol provides apparent cure for Ebola</b><br>
      <br>
      Dr. Robert Rowen, MD, recently received word from Sierra Leone on
      November 27 that an Ebola virus treatment he was involved in
      developing was being used to treat Dr. Komba Songu M'Briwa, a
      Sierra Leone military doctor, confirmed by testing to have the
      Ebola virus, who has been helping Ebola victims in his country.
      Dr. Rowen received the report from Dr. M.I. Jalloh who stated in
      an e-mail that "He is presently stable with no diarrhea or
      vomiting."<br>
      <br>
      Three days later, on November 30, Dr. Jalloh sent an update to Dr.
      Rowen. As reported by HealthyDoctors.com:<br>
      <br>
      Dr. M'Briwa promptly resolved his fever and had no further
      development of the usual Ebola symptoms of horror. In fact, he's
      already been moved out of the Ebola sick unit into the "recovery"
      unit. Furthermore, a second test (for viral load) after treatment
      commenced was negative for Ebola....<br>
      <br>
      That's right, Dr. M'Briwa no longer has the Ebola virus, according
      to Dr. Jalloh. Dr. Rowen was so happy, he "felt more than
      jubilant. Like jumping out of my skin!" The treatment was
      supervised by Dr. Jalloh and administered by Dr. Kanneh. According
      to Dr. Jalloh, Dr. M'briwa received ozone (55 ml) twice a day, as
      well as "Advance Cellular Silver, Vitamin C and Glutathione. "<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Jalloh and Dr. Kanneh are two of the many healthcare
      professionals in Sierra Leone that Dr. Rowen and his partner in
      the development of this treatment, Dr. Howard Robins, trained in
      the procedure. The treatment, named the Rowen-Robins Ebola
      protocol by the two physicians, involves the use of ozone therapy.
      Both doctors have decades of experience using ozone therapy to
      treat a number of different ailments.<br>
      <br>
      The treatment method for African Ebola patients which Dr. Rowen
      and Dr. Robins taught uses direct intravenous oxygen gas, which is
      99 percent oxygen (O2) and one percent ozone (O3). "You start slow
      with 20cc. [Dr. Robin] works up to a maximum of 120cc of gas. He
      gradually increases the concentration. Initially, in the early
      stages of this treatment, you can get a cough and some chest
      tightness, which eventually with further treatments modulates and
      goes away. It doesn't seem to be a big problem... [but] can be a
      little uncomfortable, because it takes about five to 10 minutes
      for it to go away," explained Dr. Rowen to Mercola.com. He also
      stated that it was "extraordinarily effective" and "dirt cheap to
      do."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Training healthcare workers to perform the treatment</b><br>
      <br>
      The doctors paid their own way to Africa and received donations
      from family, friends and other good Samaritans so that HAZMAT
      suits, IV needles, syringes, gloves and other supplies could be
      brought along on the trip. Most importantly, they received a
      donation of 10 machines from Longevity Resources, a Canadian
      manufacturer of Ozone Generators, used for a variety of medical
      and research applications.<br>
      <br>
      They arrived in Africa on October 18 with a lot to do and a
      limited amount of time to do it. Dr. Rowen and Dr. Robins each
      delivered a lecture to West African physicians that explained the
      process each uses, the process they developed specific to Ebola,
      and the medical research regarding ozone therapy. The next day,
      the equipment arrived and hands-on training was conducted. Dr.
      Rowen set the example, being the first "patient." The doctors
      witnessed him receiving 65 cc of the ozone therapy. They then
      watched and learned as each of them received a 20 cc therapy.<br>
      <br>
      After training 30 doctors and other healthcare workers the first
      day, another 20 were trained the second day. But the day got much
      more interesting. Dr. Rowen explained, "At 12:30 pm, our training
      was interrupted in order to visit with the President of the
      country. It seems some ministers were wanting our Ebola treatment
      project to proceed 300 miles from the capital, Freetown." The
      doctors, with a lot of help from their host, Dr. Kojo Carew,
      explained to the President that this was not a good use of the
      resources they had brought with them. The President agreed and
      went to meet with the ministers to correct the situation. Before
      departing, the President invited them to meet with him at his
      personal residence that evening.<br>
      <br>
      "We... met with him for 90 minutes. He appeared to be a very
      intelligent, concerned man, looking out for his people. His first
      concern was protection for those bravest of souls in the front
      lines," said Dr. Rowen. "Believe it or not, this open-minded
      leader became the first chief executive of any country (that we
      know of) to ask for and receive an ozone treatment," he added. A
      few days later, they returned home.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Will ozone therapy be given a chance in West Africa?</b><br>
      <br>
      Ozone therapy can be legally performed in 14 states, including
      California, New York and Texas, and thousands of people have found
      relief from a variety of ailments using ozone therapy, yet the
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the CDC, the WHO and
      other conventional medical practitioners are unwilling to try
      ozone therapy in a region of the world where the situation grows
      more desperate every day.<br>
      <br>
      Could it be because it would bring into question the validity of
      the conventional medical process? Maybe. Or perhaps it's because
      of the enormous influence that Big Pharma wields over the medical
      community? The question the conventional medical community must
      ask: How many lives should be lost before an alternative medicine
      therapy is given a chance to save lives and prove itself to the
      medical community at large?<br>

            Ebola?</b><br>
        </big><br>
        <b>by </b><br>
        <b>Dr. Mercola</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Ebola is heavily featured in the news these days, bringing lots of
      fear and concerns. Can anything be done to successfully treat or
      prevent this horrific and highly lethal disease?<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Robert Rowen who is a leading expert on oxidative therapy,
      offers an intriguing answer in this interview. By invitation of
      the President of Sierra Leone, he’s going there to teach health
      care workers how to treat Ebola using ozone.<br>
      <br>
      “I do ozone, ultraviolet blood irradiation therapy, and high-dose
      vitamin C,” he explains. “All of these collectively belong to a
      family of therapies called oxidative therapies.<br>
      <br>
      In my opinion – and I’ve been doing them longer than any other
      living person in North America; since 1986 – especially ozone and
      ultraviolet [therapies] are among the most powerful therapies for
      healing across the board of anything I’ve ever seen in my
      career... It does so by stimulating your own body to heal.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ozone Effectively Inactivates Viruses</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ozone is quite versatile, as you can administer it in many
      different ways. It’s extraordinary in terms of its anti-infective
      and antiviral action, and it has virtually no toxicity, making it
      a prime candidate for both prevention and treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Rowen’s YouTube channel1 contains a number of videos
      demonstrating and discussing what these therapies can do. With
      bacteria, ozone works by puncturing the membrane of the bacteria,
      causing it to spill its contents and die. It also inactivates
      viruses, and does so 10 times faster than chlorine.<br>
      <br>
      “I’ve told my patients and readers, please know where your closest
      oxidative physician is, because your life might depend on it, and
      if you have the wherewithal, to get an [ozone] machine to purify
      water.<br>
      <br>
      It can be easily adapted in the privacy of your home, so that you
      can administer it rectally for whatever condition you have,” Dr.
      Rowen says. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Ozone—The Most Powerful Natural Oxidant in the World</b><br>
      <br>
      Chlorine is being used overseas right now for Ebola to disinfect
      clothes and isolation suites, etc. But ozone actually disinfects
      10 times faster than chlorine. It’s the most powerful natural
      oxidant in the world.<br>
      <br>
      Ozone also has the advantage of stimulating the immune system, and
      modulating it—either up or down depending on what your system
      requires.<br>
      <br>
      “Right now, we’re faced with probably one of the most horrific
      epidemics human kind has ever known. That’s a virus called Ebola
      that is transmitted by personal contact [through] bodily fluids
      and, actually, it may be also be airborne,” Dr. Rowen says.<br>
      <br>
      “What I don’t know – and I’m trying to investigate – is how easily
      it is transmitted from person to person. I’m not sure that it’s
      easy to get, because if it was, everybody should be dead by now in
      many of the villages, and not everybody is dead.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, we know that there are aid workers who have
      gotten the disease and died even though they were wearing full
      suits...<br>
      <br>
      Anybody who works with Ebola are putting their lives on the line
      because there are no conventional therapies for this; none, except
      getting supportive care...”&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <b>How Ozone Works to Combat Infectious Disease</b><br>
      <br>
      As noted by Dr. Rowen, Ebola hijacks your immune system and
      suppresses it. Once your immune system realizes the virus is
      there, it launches a cytokine storm, and it is this cytokine storm
      that leads to massive tissue destruction and capillary leakage.<br>
      <br>
      This is what causes the hemorrhaging associated with Ebola. Ozone
      modulates the cytokine storm.<br>
      <br>
      It’s anti-infective. It improves circulation and blood flow,
      oxygen delivery, and likely upregulates mitochondrial respiration,
      thereby generating more energy in your cells. Oxygen is one of the
      most important things your body needs for tissue healing when
      you’re riddled with infection.<br>
      <br>
      There’s an experimental, still unapproved treatment for Ebola
      called ZMapp. It offers passive immunity to the virus. This is not
      a vaccine but three monoclonal antibodies that have been humanized
      by genetic engineering and grown in tobacco plants. It’s very
      costly and time consuming to produce and it’s not yet commercially
      available.<br>
      <br>
      ZMapp works with your body’s immune system, slowing down the viral
      load to give your body enough time to respond and not get killed
      by the cytokine storm. It’s not really a drug in the conventional
      sense, as it acts simply by slowing down the virus from reaching
      the cells.<br>
      <br>
      This is similar to ozone’s action, but ozone could potentially be
      more effective, as it works both indirectly and directly. It’s
      directly toxic to the virus while being harmless to your body’s
      own cells, and also indirectly enhances your immune system
      function. Regarding potential safety concerns of ozone, Dr. Rowen
      says:<br>
      <br>
      “Ozone is only hard on the lungs, but it can be given in other
      ways. It can be given intravenously. It can be given in the
      bladder, in the vagina, in the rectum, via injection – anywhere.
      It’s just [that] it can be tough on the lungs. You don’t want to
      be breathing it...<br>
      <br>
      Also, the way ozone can be done is dirt cheap. And in a place like
      Africa, where there are thousands of people with this and there’s
      just no money, can you imagine what it will mean to the planet if
      we can treat this disease with a therapy that will cost probably
      less than 10 dollars per patient?”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Historical Use of Oxidation Therapy Has Proven Its Benefits</b><br>
      <br>
      While in Sierra Leone, Dr. Rowen will use ozone on himself and his
      team every single day to prevent contracting the disease, and will
      continue the treatment for some time afterward.<br>
      <br>
      “I have less fear about Ebola with [ozone therapy],” Dr. Rowen
      says.”I mean this and I’m speaking honestly. Yes, Ebola is a
      fearsome disease. But I know the power of ozone and oxidative
      therapies. I wouldn’t be doing this if I didn’t have absolute
      confidence that we’re going to dramatically cut the death rate.”<br>
      <br>
      Oxidation therapy was actually discovered during the great
      influenza outbreak of 1918—a time when people were dying like
      flies across the world. A physician in India named Dr. Oliver was
      treating viral influenza—which has no treatment even today—and
      when he administered intravenous hydrogen peroxide, which costs a
      couple cents to do for materials, he cut the death rate by 50
      percent.<br>
      <br>
      “His comment at the end of his article published in The Lancet, a
      major medical journal, was, ‘This is more remarkable because we
      only treated the worst cases.’” Dr. Rowen says.<br>
      <br>
      According to Dr. Rowen, ozone therapy is also very beneficial for
      heart disease, immune diseases, injuries, and chronic degenerative
      diseases such as osteoarthritis. As an example, Dr. Rowen has
      found that ozone is about 85 percent effective in knees and only
      slightly less effective in hips, when given as an injection.<br>
      <br>
      “I’m actually injecting oxygen. One percent of it is ozone O3, 99
      percent of it is oxgen O2. They’re getting a blast of oxygen and
      they’re getting ozone. There are two effects,” Dr. Rowen explains.
      “(1) They’re getting oxygen, the most important thing those cells
      need to heal and (2) they’re getting ozone. Ozone instantly
      modulates the inflammation. It knocks out the excessive nitric
      oxide that’s in the joint. It increases other chemical mediators
      that reduce inflammation.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Other Oxidation Therapies</b><br>
      <br>
      Aside from ozone, other oxidation therapies include hydrogen
      peroxide, intravenous vitamin C, and ultraviolet light. Dr. Rowen
      has done intravenous hydrogen peroxide since 1989, and it’s very
      inexpensive. One drawback is that it’s hard on your veins, and can
      actually make your veins disappear. Ozone doesn’t do that.
      Ultraviolet blood irradiation therapy is another excellent
      modality, although it’s not quite as versatile as ozone. You can
      find an article discussing ultraviolet blood irradiation therapy
      on Dr. Rowen’s website.2, 3<br>
      <br>
      “[The article] is called ‘Ultraviolet Blood Irradiation Therapy:
      The Cure That Time Forgot’... [Ultraviolet blood irradiation
      therapy] was done widespread in this country until the ‘60s. And
      then when you could take a pill, it was wiped out. There are
      political reasons why it was wiped out, too. I know that for sure.
      But it’s still being done,” he says.<br>
      <br>
      Then there is high-dose intravenous vitamin C. While vitamin C is
      an antioxidant, it also promotes the production of superoxide
      dismutase. Dr. Rowen explains how:<br>
      <br>
      “[W]hen you give high-dose vitamin C intravenously, the ascorbic
      acid leaves the bloodstream and goes into the interstitial fluids
      where a series of reactions occur that incite a greater production
      of superoxide dismutase, which gets converted by the body into
      hydrogen peroxide. When you give intravenous vitamin C, you are
      actually giving hydrogen peroxide.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ozone Therapy for Cancer</b><br>
      <br>
      Still, ozone therapy is a superior approach to all these other
      alternatives. Dr. Rowen has even used it for cancer, and while not
      a magic bullet, it has successfully reversed some cases of cancer,
      including metastatic cancer. It’s important to realize the outcome
      varies from individual to individual, and most are also
      implementing dietary and supplement protocols. He notes:<br>
      <br>
      “There are articles out there where ozone therapy is recommended
      now by many people as a potential treatment for cancer. Why?
      Because tumors are hypoxic. Hypoxic means low oxygen. The research
      is showing that the more enrichment of oxygen you can get into the
      tumor, the better it’s going to behave. And ozone increases
      oxygenation of the body.<br>
      <br>
      If you get more oxygen into the tumor, you’re going to get a
      better-behaved tumor aside from modulating your immune system.
      Hyperbaric oxygen is probably really valuable. But it’s expensive.
      It’s time-consuming. And in my experience – I’ve done both—I would
      take ozone any day over hyperbaric oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      With cancer, we do a combination approach: Intravenous—either
      ultraviolet and/or ozone therapy. There was a monograph published
      40 or 50 years ago by a man named Olney... He had listed several
      patients with cancer who were cured using ultraviolet blood
      irradiation therapy and cleaning themselves up – detoxifying with
      certain supplements.<br>
      <br>
      We also do what’s called minor autohemotherapy. In that, you take
      a small amount of blood, about 5 or 6cc. You shake it up with
      ozone rather vigorously, and then reinject it [intramuscularly]
      almost like an autovaccine. I believe personally that that
      stimulates the immune system.<br>
      <br>
      The third pillar of what I call ‘triple oxidation’ is giving a
      small amount of gas intravenously... intravenous oxygen. This
      therapy has been around in Europe for 60, 70, or 80 years... [I]t
      seems to stimulate other aspects of the immune system,
      particularly an enzyme called 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1). That
      enzyme... has very strong anti-cancer properties.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Treatment Plan for African Ebola Patients</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The treatment method Dr. Rowen will implement in Africa is using
      direct intravenous oxygen gas (99 percent oxygen, O2, and one
      percent ozone, O3)—a therapy pioneered by Dr. Howard Robin who
      will accompany Dr. Rowen on this trip. Again, this is NOT air.
      It’s a metabolically active gas that is absorbed by your body.<br>
      <br>
      Ozone (O3) reacts immediately in your blood to stimulate a cascade
      of reactions creating something called ozonized biochemical
      molecules, which are highly metabolically active in the immune
      system and in blood circulation. As noted by Dr. Rowen, it’s
      “extraordinarily effective” and “dirt cheap to do.” Aside from the
      initial purchase of an oxygen tank and an ozone machine, the cost
      of treatment is limited to the price of one syringe per patient.
      Dr. Rowen explains the process as follows:<br>
      <br>
      “You start slow with 20cc. [Dr. Robin] works up to a maximum of
      120cc of gas. He gradually increases the concentration. Now, there
      are two issues: Initially, in the early stages of this treatment,
      you can get a cough and some chest tightness, which eventually
      with further treatments modulates and goes away. It doesn’t seem
      to be a big problem... [but] can be a little uncomfortable,
      because it takes about five to 10 minutes for it to go away.<br>
      <br>
      The other problem that concerns me a little bit more is if you do
      this repeatedly over and over again, it can do to the vein what
      intravenous hydrogen peroxide does – it can make it go away. I
      have not seen that with major autohemotherapy, [in which you’re]
      taking the blood out, treating it with ozone, and putting it back
      in... But if you give ozone gas intravenously, yes, it’s going to
      act like hydrogen peroxide... Now, when you’re dealing with
      something like Ebola, I would be happy to sacrifice a couple of
      veins for a cheap, quick fix.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Will Big Pharma Sacrifice Lives to Maintain Monopoly on
        Expensive Ebola Treatments?</b><br>
      <br>
      If direct intravenous oxygen turns out to be successful, we can
      expect the government of Sierra Leone to announce to the world
      that it has a treatment for Ebola, as Dr. Rowen and his team are
      going there at the invitation of its President. That will make
      international news very quickly. On the other hand, there are
      commercial interests that stand to make billions, maybe trillions
      of dollars, on Ebola treatment drugs and/or vaccines, whether such
      drugs are effective or not. So it would be naïve to think that
      they will not make a sincere effort to suppress inexpensive
      oxidation therapies for the treatment of Ebola and other potential
      pandemic diseases...&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      “Will it be suppressed? Probably yes,” Dr. Rowen says. “I’m not
      afraid to tell you that my biggest concern in this is that we will
      be in greater danger from those interests than we will be from the
      Ebola itself... But you know, it’s something that I have to do.
      All of us who are going, we’re being guided by something much
      higher. It’s something that I have to do no matter the risk,
      because the risk is far greater if we don’t do it.”<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, perhaps the greatest risk of all is that the therapy will
      be unsuccessful for treating Ebola, and that the disease will keep
      spreading unchecked around the world. As noted by Dr. Rowen, the
      Ebola pathogen is unlike most other pathogens, and may not respond
      like other viruses.<br>
      <br>
      “I can usually get rid of herpes zoster (shingles) in a couple of
      days with ozone therapy, and we can cure a lot of these other
      acute conditions. But Ebola is a pathogen unlike anything that
      we’ve ever seen before. I don’t know what’s going to happen when
      we do this. Maybe the patients are just so toxic that they’re
      going to be overcome by anything we do. I don’t know... If it
      doesn’t work, I don’t want to see ozone discredited for all the
      other miracles it does,” he says.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Why Ozone Therapy Stands a Good Chance of Working Against Ebola</b><br>
      <br>
      Still, despite such cautious doubts, there are very positive
      indications suggesting oxygen therapy might be the answer the
      world needs right now to successfully respond to this situation.
      As mentioned earlier, ZMapp works by slowing down the virus,
      allowing your immune system more time to kill off the virus
      itself. Tests suggest ZMapp can be effective if given early
      enough, and ozone is orders of magnitude more effective at
      boosting immune function.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, ozone also inactivates viruses, which ZMapp does not do,
      which actually allows you to build immunity against the pathogen.
      “Since we’re neutralizing the virus, now you have viral particles
      that are still antigenic – not infectious but antigenic – that can
      stimulate your immune system, which in itself will make the
      antibodies,” Dr. Rowen explains.<br>
      <br>
      Basically, that is an authentic “vaccine.” This is how you develop
      a natural immunity to the virus. I for one eagerly await Dr.
      Rowen’s results, and will hopefully have the opportunity to
      interview him again to learn about his first-hand experiences
      treating Ebola in Africa.<br>
      <br>
      “I wouldn’t go and put myself at risk if I didn’t think that what
      I’m taking there to use to help these people wouldn’t also take
      care of myself,” Dr. Rowen says. “I’m really excited about it. I’m
      really hopeful that this is going to change the world... I pray
      about this every day. It’s my prayer that the result we get in
      Sierra Leone is going to change the disease-maintenance paradigm
      of the world. I call it ‘the sickness system.’ We need a paradigm
      shift.”<br>

        Preclinical development of a vaccine 'against smoking'.</b><b><br>

        Henzelin-Nkubana C, Patiny L, Tuchscherer G, Cerny T.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>BACKGROUND:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Nicotine is the main culprit for dependence on tobacco-containing
      products, which in turn are a major etiologic factor for
      cardiovascular diseases and cancer. This publication describes a
      vaccine, which elicits antibodies against nicotine. The antibodies
      in the blood stream intercept the nicotine molecule on its way to
      its receptors and greatly diminish the nicotine influx to the
      brain shortly after smoking.<br>
      <br>
      <b>METHODS:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The nicotine molecule is chemically linked to cholera toxin B as a
      carrier protein in order to induce antibodies. The potential to
      elicit antibodies after subcutaneous as well as intranasal
      immunization is evaluated. In order to simulate realistic
      conditions, nicotine pumps delivering the nicotine equivalent of 5
      packages of cigarettes for 4 weeks are implanted into the mice 1
      week prior to vaccination. The protective effect of the vaccine is
      measured 5 weeks after vaccination by comparing the influx of
      radiolabeled nicotine in the brains of vaccinated and
      non-vaccinated animals 5 min after challenge with the nicotine
      equivalent of 2 cigarettes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>RESULTS:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The polyclonal antibodies induced by the vaccine show a mean
      avidity of 1.8 x 10(7) l/Mol. Subcutaneous immunization elicits
      high antibody levels of the IgG class, and significant IgA
      antibody levels in the saliva of vaccinated mice can be found
      after intranasal vaccination. The protective effect also in the
      animals with implanted nicotine pumps is significant: less than
      10% of radiolabeled nicotine found in the brains of non-vaccinated
      animals can be found in the brains of vaccinated animals.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      These data provide credible evidence that a vaccine can break the
      vicious circle between smoking and instant gratification by
      intercepting the nicotine molecule. Astonishingly, there is no
      sign of exhaustion of specific antibodies even under extreme
      conditions, which makes it highly unlikely that a smoker can
      overcome the protective effect of the vaccine by smoking more.
      Finally, the high titers of specific antibodies after 1 year let
      us hope that booster vaccinations are probably only necessary in
      intervals of years.<br>

            At Fukushima Appears To Work</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The US company that supplied a mobile strontium 90 filtration
      system is saying it met target goals of performance at Fukushima
      Daiichi. The company also mentions that TEPCO has now ordered a
      second unit.<br>
      <br>
      The mobile system is installed in a shipping crate and is able to
      be moved from place to place. The system then filters the contents
      of a storage tank to remove strontium 90. The high levels of
      strontium 90 had been an ongoing problem. Even after water had
      been treated through the Sarry filtration system, only the cesiums
      had been removed. An early series of tank leaks at the facility
      had released large amounts of strontium 90 into the groundwater
      causing concerns about the potential for more large leaks.<br>
      <br>
      TEPCO has been unusually silent on something that they would
      usually tout as a success. Kurion, the company that made the unit
      claimed it filtered 11,000 metric tons of water since October with

            Radioactivity Removed from Water in First Nine Months at
            Fukushima</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Kurion was part of an international team of leading radioactive
      waste management companies to quickly deliver the first-ever
      external cooling system for a nuclear reactor.<br>
      <br>
      The Kurion team designed, fabricated and delivered its critical
      cesium-removal system in only five weeks.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;<b>Situation Overview</b><br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Following the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that devastated
      Japan, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) resorted to using
      seawater to cool the reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear
      Power Plant. Without a functioning cooling system, TEPCO needed to
      add millions of gallons to cool the reactors. TEPCO was in a race
      against time – by the middle of April, the plant’s basements and
      buildings were filling with contaminated water and the rainy
      season was weeks away, threatening to flood the plant and spread
      radiation. The company needed a solution to cool the reactors and
      clean the contaminated water.<br>
      <br>
      Kurion was tasked with building the first-ever external
      water-cooling system for a nuclear reactor before the plant
      flooded and heightened the catastrophe. During the crisis
      situation,&nbsp; specifications were changed daily as new
      information emerged from the site.<br>
      <br>
      Regulatory Process<br>
      Kurion skid is loaded onto an Antonov airplane for direct delivery
      to Japan.<br>
      <br>
      Due to the nature of the crisis, Kurion’s technology was evaluated
      simultaneously by TEPCO and Japan’s national laboratories and
      other nuclear companies. The evaluation team was reassured by the
      fact that the ISM technology dates back to the cleanup of Three
      Mile Island and was shown to be effective and vitrifiable.<br>
      <br>
      Remediation Approach<br>
      The primary objective was to remove cesium from the millions of
      gallons of wastewater, as cesium was the principal source of
      radioactivity at the site and the greatest safety risk to the site
      and environment from a dose standpoint. Cesium was in high
      abundance due to the failed fuel. Furthermore, it is a strong
      gamma emitter and the sole ionizing radiation found in nuclear
      waste that can penetrate piping.<br>
      <br>
      Kurion system ready to begin operations at the Fukushima Daiichi
      Nuclear Power Plant.<br>
      <br>
      ISM is an inorganic media that uses ion exchange to surgically
      isolate specific isotopes, in this case, cesium. Additionally, ISM
      works as a molecular sieve and adsorbent, which preserves its
      performance as an isotope sorbent in aqueous solutions with salt
      water and other common interferents present.<br>
      <br>
      Kurion was in a unique position to help – unlike conventional
      media, Kurion’s ISM has low sensitivity to pH, salt water, and the
      presence of surfactants (e.g., soap) in wash waters. The inorganic
      ISM is also resistant to radiation, mitigating the stability
      concerns associated with organic ion exchange resin under high
      radiation applications. Finally, it can be produced in large
      quantities and could meet TEPCO’s significant need.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to providing its ISM, Kurion designed and constructed
      the entire cesium-removal portion of the overall process system.
      This processing system has several stages, including debris and
      oil removal, radioactivity removal (Kurion’s role), and
      desalinization. The goal was to process radioactive contaminated
      water that was presently in the turbine buildings, along with new
      cooling water added daily, and return the purified water to the
      plant to recycle as reactor cooling water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results<br>
        <br>
      </b>Kurion delivered the first-ever external cooling system for a
      nuclear reactor in five weeks:<br>
      <br>
      On-time delivery in a five-week design/fabricate/delivery cycle
      with frequent and significant specification changes right up to
      shipment<br>
      The system was assembled at Fukushima in nine days followed by
      only one day of cold commissioning and three days of warm
      commissioning before hot startup with actual wastewater<br>
      In its first three months, the cesium-removal system achieved its
      cesium removal goal of 99.9%<br>
      In its first year of operation, Kurion’s cesium removal system was
      responsible for 70% of the radioactivity removed from the
      wastewater<br>
      Effectiveness of system helped TEPCO achieve its goal to declare
      the end of Phase I of its “Roadmap towards Restoration from the
      Accident” when the plant reached Cold Shutdown status on December
      16, 2011<br>
      One year after the tsunami, the water cooling system had processed
      more than 258,780 MT (68 million gallons), reduced salinity by
      almost 90% and was estimated to have removed about 12 million
      curies (4.4 x 1017 Becquerel) of the estimated original 13.6
      million cesium curie inventory (5 x 1017 Becquerel)”<br>

      <b>Separation Technologies : Ion Specific Media (ISM)</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Kurion has developed several classes of Ion Specific Media (ISM)
      to selectively remove hazardous ions from aqueous waste streams.
      Many of the byproducts of the fission process are ions dissolved
      in water that emit alpha, beta and gamma particles. Of highest
      concern are environmentally relevant ions and ions which have
      relatively long half-lives, such as: 137Cs+ (~30 year half-life),
      90Sr2+ (~30 year half-life), 63Ni2+, 58/60Co2+, 129Sb (as
      [Sb(OH)6]-), 129I-, 99Tc (as TcO4-), among others. These ions can
      be captured by ISM using a process called ion-exchange. Since June
      2011, Kurion’s ISM’s have been used to treat 134/137Cs+ from the
      wastewater at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant site. Once
      used, these exclusively inorganic media can be vitrified with
      Kurion’s stabilization technologies, MVS® and GeoMelt®. <br>

      Kurion has two types of material engineered from Zeolite:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surfactant Modified Zeolite (KUR-SMZ)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strontium Specific Media (KUR-SSM)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Glass Microspheres:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Developed from a collaboration with MoSci., Inc, several forms of
      microspheres are being designed.<br>
      <br>
      The glass microspheres can be produced in a fines (25-100 µ),
      seeding agent form, bead, or frit version (20-50 mesh) for
      sluiceable column applications. These glass microspheres have huge
      surface areas, both external and internal, ~ 195 m2per gram, with
      crystalline structures of approximately 10 to 50 nm in diameter
      and a total porosity of about 35% to 40%. This extremely high
      internal surface area and nano-porosity allow for the internal
      placement of reactive moieties by chemical reactions and the
      subsequent entrapment of radio-isotopes within the matrix.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>

      <br>
      How to restore hair loss is a task not undertaken exclusively by
      beauty practitioners. The discovery, now published by a group from
      the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), reveals a
      novel angle to spur hair follicle growth. This also adds new
      knowledge to a broader problem: how to regenerate tissues in an
      adult organism, especially the skin.<br>
      <br>
      The group has discovered an unexpected connection--a link between
      the body's defense system and skin regeneration. According to the
      authors of the study published today in PLOS Biology, cells from
      the immune system called macrophages-- those in charge of
      devouring invading pathogens, for example--are also responsible
      for activating skin stem cells and induce hair growth.<br>
      <br>
      The regenerative ability of stem cells allows skin replenishment
      during a lifetime. But different factors can reduce their
      regenerative properties or promote their uncontrolled growth. When
      things go wrong, this can lead to aging and disease, including
      skin carcinomas. The discovery that macrophages activate skin stem
      cells may also have further implications beyond the possibility to
      develop therapeutic approaches for hair loss, but may also be
      relevant for cancer research.<br>
      <br>
      The authors of the study are Mirna Perez-Moreno and Donatello
      Castellana, from the Epithelial Cell Biology Group of the BBVA
      Foundation-CNIO Cancer Cell Biology Programme, along with Ralf
      Paus, a hair immunobiology expert from the University of
      Manchester and Münster.<br>
      <br>
      "We have discovered that macrophages, cells whose main function is
      traditionally attributed to fight infections and wound repair, are
      also involved in the activation of hair follicle stem cells in non
      inflamed skin," says Perez-Moreno.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers did not investigate the relationship between
      macrophages and hair for fun. This work emerged more than four
      years ago from an observation made by Perez-Moreno while working
      on another research project. The mice she had been working with at
      that time received anti-inflammatory drugs, a treatment that also
      reactivated hair growth. Convinced that the explanation could
      reside in the existence of close communication between stem cells
      and immune cells --the Perez-Moreno's lab began to experiment with
      the different types of cells involved in the body´s defense
      system.<br>
      <br>
      After years of investigation, they discovered that when stem cells
      are dormant, a fraction of macrophages die, due to a process known
      as apoptosis. This stimulated the secretion of factors from dying
      and living macrophages, which in turn activated stem cells, and
      that is when hairs began to grow again.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Reproducing natural process</b><br>
      <br>
      Macrophages secrete a number of factors including a class of
      proteins called Wnt.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers demonstrated the participation of macrophage-derived
      Wnts by artificially reproducing the natural process by treating
      macrophages with a Wnt inhibitor drug encapsulated in liposomes.
      As expected, when they used this drug, the activation of hair
      growth was delayed.<br>
      <br>
      Although this study has been completed in mice, the researchers
      believe their discovery "may facilitate the development of novel
      treatment strategies" for hair growth in humans.<br>
      <br>
      The possibility of attacking one type of cell to affect another
      might have broader applications that go beyond "just" growing
      hair. Furthermore, the use of liposomes as a way of drug delivery
      to specific cells, is a very promising line of experimentation,
      which may have implications for the study of several pathologies,
      says Donatello Castellana.<br>
      <br>
      From a more fundamental perspective, this research is an effort to
      understand how modifying the environment that surrounds adult skin
      stem cells can regulate their regenerative capabilities. "One of
      the current challenges in the stem cell field is to regulate the
      activation of endogenous stem cell pools in adult tissues to
      promote regeneration without the need of transplantation," says
      Perez-Moreno.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Biochemical dialogue</b><br>
      <br>
      It is now known that macrophages are key cells involved in the
      biochemical dialogue that exists in the environment surrounding
      stem cells.<br>
      <br>
      "Our study underlines the importance of macrophages as modulators
      in skin regenerative processes, going beyond their primary
      function as phagocytes [immune system cells]," say the authors in
      PLoS Biology.<br>
      <br>
      The researcher´s next goal is to characterise the class of
      macrophage(s) that are involved in the activation of skin stem
      cells and their implications in the regulation of stem cells under
      pathological conditions, including skin carcinomas.<br>
      <br>
      As Perez-Moreno explains, "macrophages are a very diverse cell
      population. It was only less that ten years ago that scientists
      discovered that besides from the bone marrow, macrophages
      originate from the yolk sac during pregnancy, and there are even
      other macrophages that proliferate within tissues. The diversity
      of the sources from which skin resident macrophages originate is
      not fully understood."<br>

      In a finding that could help treat an inherited form of baldness,
      a research team in Manchester claims to have discovered a protein
      "code" that instructs cells to sprout hair. <br>
      <br>
      By sending the code to more cells than usual, the scientists at
      the University of Manchester say they were able to breed mice with
      more fur -- a feat that could potentially be replicated in humans.
      <br>
      <br>
      "During human development, skin cells have the ability to turn
      into other types of cells to form hair follicles, sweat glands,
      teeth and nails," explained Denis Headon, who led the research. <br>
      <br>
      "Which cells are transformed into hair follicles is determined by
      three proteins that are produced by our genes," he said.<br>

      Scientists looking at mice may have discovered why certain people
      are hairier than others in what could provide clues as to the
      reason some men go bald prematurely.<br>
      <br>
      The University of Manchester team has laid bare the molecular
      processes that determine which embryonic skin cells will form into
      hair follicles and determine the body's hair pattern.<br>
      <br>
      The findings will be of interest to scientists looking at
      male-pattern baldness but have more direct implications for people
      who suffer from ectodermal dysplasia - a range of conditions where
      skin cells fail to develop into other tissue, including hair
      follicles.<br>
      <br>
      "During human development, skin cells have the ability to turn
      into other types of cells to form hair follicles, sweat glands,
      teeth and nails," said Dr Denis Headon, who led the research.
      "Which cells are transformed into hair follicles is determined by
      three proteins that are produced by our genes.<br>
      <br>
      "Our research has identified how one of these proteins working
      outside of the cell interacts at a molecular level to determine an
      individual's hair pattern as the embryonic skin spatially
      organises itself."<br>
      <br>
      The team found that cells given the genetic command to become hair
      follicles will send out signals to neighbouring cells to prevent
      them from doing likewise, so producing a specific hair pattern.<br>
      <br>
      They also demonstrated that by hyperactivating the 'hair protein'
      in embryonic mice, young with considerably more fur than normal
      were produced.<br>
      <br>
      "We were able to change the number of hair follicles in the
      embryonic mice while they were developing in the womb," said Dr
      Headon, who is based in the University's Faculty of Life Sciences.<br>
      <br>
      "The findings could have implications for sufferers of ectodermal
      dysplasia that are missing this particular protein and who are
      unable to develop hair follicles during embryonic development.<br>
      <br>
      "The research - while not directly linked to male-pattern baldness
      - should be of interest to pharmaceutical companies working in
      this field as understanding the molecular processes at work during
      follicle development could provide clues as to why follicles
      shrink and hair growth diminishes in certain men as they get
      older."<br>
      <br>
      Ectodermal dysplasia (ED) is a group of closely related, heritable
      conditions in which there are abnormalities of two or more
      ectodermal structures, such as the hair, teeth, nails, sweat
      glands as well as other parts of the body.<br>
      <br>
      The 1990 edition of the Birth Defects Encyclopaedia estimates that
      up to seven in every 10,000 babies are born with one of the 150 or
      so ED syndromes.<br>
      <br>
      ED can affect both sexes but is more prevalent in boys. It also
      affects people of different races and ethnic groups. Probably the
      most well-known person to suffer from ED is actor Michael
      Berryman.<br>

              Jacket Trap</b><br>

      The Alaska Outdoor Journal publishes instructions on making a
      yellow jacket trap out of soapy water, a few sticks and a piece of
      raw fish. This method is NON-TOXIC and for the most part pet and
      wildlife friendly due to the harmless components that are used to
      build the “system.” There are quite a few commercial products on
      the market to eliminate yellow jackets but this one doesn’t cost
      anything and I can guarantee its an extremely effective way to rid
      your yard or campsite of the yellow hoards in just a day or two.
      How It Works: The yellow jackets love fish and will begin to cut
      off small pieces to take back to the nest. In their "excitement"
      of buzzing around the bait a few will occasionally hit the water.
      The soap in the water breaks the surface tension of the waterproof
      coating on the yellow jacket and it instantly sinks in the water
      and drowns in a few seconds. Some yellow jackets will successfully
      haul a piece of meat back to the nest and tell all the other
      gatherers in the nest where this great food source is. Soon all
      the wasps from the nest will be working on this fish and over a
      period of time, all will eventually make mistakes and either fall
      off the fish and into the water or bump other wasps flying around
      and knock themselves in the drink, then its curtains for them too.
      It only takes a day or two to wipe out nearly every yellow jacket
      in your area. Put the trap on a table or other high area outside
      so that kids and pets will not be able to get close to it. A piece
      of fish with vertical sides works best for having the insects fall
      off easier. (via boingboing.com)<br>

          <i>Beginning 2015 Due to Extreme Cold 30 Yr Period</i><i><br>
          </i><i> </i></big></div>
      <i> </i><br>
      If you think the last few days of record setting snow and cold in
      parts of upstate New York is just a freak event, then you're not
      going to like what I am about to tell you. According to NASA
      Scientist/Climatologist John Casey that is just the beginning of
      what is to come during this next 30 yr cycle of extreme cold,
      which will be caused by an historic decline in the Sun's energy
      output that will impact the entire world.<br>
      <br>
      If Casey is right, then not only will a mass number of the world's
      people die by freezing and starvation due to the extreme cold
      killing 50 percent of the world's food supply, but you can also
      expect super earthquakes, and more powerful volcanic eruptions
      across the globe.<br>
      <br>
      Former NASA consultant, climatologist John L. Casey states 'a
      radical shift in global climate is underway, 30-year cold spell
      will strike Earth'.<br>
      <br>
      With nasty cold fronts thrusting an icy and early winter across
      the continental U.S. - along with last winter described by USA
      Today as "one of the snowiest, coldest, most miserable on record"
      - climatologist John L. Casey thinks the weather pattern is here
      to stay for decades to come.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, Casey, a former space shuttle engineer and NASA
      consultant, is out with the provocative book Dark Winter: How the
      Sun Is Causing a 30-Year Cold Spell, which warns that a radical
      shift in global climate is underway, and that Al Gore and other
      environmentalists have it completely wrong. The earth, he says, is
      cooling, and cooling fast. <br>
      <br>
      And unless the scientific community and political leaders act
      soon, cold, dark days are ahead. Casey says the evidence is clear
      that the earth is rapidly growing colder because of diminished
      solar activity. He says trends indicate we could be headed for
      colder temperatures similar to those seen in the late 1700s and
      early 1800s when the sun went into a "solar minimum" - a
      phenomenon with significantly reduced solar activity, including
      solar flares and sunspots.<br>
      <br>
      If he's right, that would be very bad news. Dark Winter posits
      that a 30-year period of cold has already begun. Frigid
      temperatures and the food shortages that inevitably result could
      lead to riots and chaos. <br>
      <br>
      Casey tells Newsmax, "All you have to do is trust natural cycles
      and follow the facts, and that leads you to the inevitable
      conclusion that the Sun controls the climate (HOLLY NOTE: This is
      something Stan has lectured on for two decades), and that a new
      cold era has begun." Casey is president of the Space and Science
      Research Corp., an Orlando, Fla., climate research firm. His new
      book debunks global warming orthodoxy. For more than a decade, he
      reports, the planet's oceans have been cooling. And since 2007,
      the atmospheric temperature has been cooling as well.<br>
      <br>
      "The data is pretty solid," Casey says. "If you look at the
      100-year global temperature chart, you look at the steep drop-off
      we've had since 2007. It's the steepest drop in global
      temperatures in the last hundred years."<br>

      <br>
      Will 2015 be a year of financial crashes, economic chaos and the
      start of the next great worldwide depression?&nbsp; Over the past
      couple of years, we have all watched as global financial bubbles
      have gotten larger and larger.&nbsp; Despite predictions that they
      could burst at any time, they have just continued to expand.&nbsp;
      But just like we witnessed in 2001 and 2008, all financial bubbles
      come to an end at some point, and when they do implode the pain
      can be extreme.&nbsp; Personally, I am entirely convinced that the
      financial markets are more primed for a financial collapse now
      than they have been at any other time since the last crisis
      happened nearly seven years ago.&nbsp; And I am certainly not
      alone.&nbsp; At this point, the warning cries have become a
      deafening roar as a whole host of prominent voices have stepped
      forward to sound the alarm.&nbsp; The following are 11 predictions
      of economic disaster in 2015 from top experts all over the globe…<br>
      <br>
      #1 Bill Fleckenstein: “They are trying to make the stock market go
      up and drag the economy along with it. It’s not going to work.
      There’s going to be a big accident. When people realize that it’s
      all a charade, the dollar will tank, the stock market will tank,
      and hopefully bond markets will tank. Gold will rally in that
      period of time because it’s done what it’s done because people
      have assumed complete infallibility on the part of the central
      bankers.”<br>
      <br>
      #2 John Ficenec: “In the US, Professor Robert Shiller’s cyclically
      adjusted price earnings ratio – or Shiller CAPE – for the S&amp;P
      500 is currently at 27.2, some 64pc above the historic average of
      16.6. On only three occasions since 1882 has it been higher – in
      1929, 2000 and 2007.”<br>
      <br>
      #3 Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, one of the most respected economic
      journalists on the entire planet: “The eurozone will be in
      deflation by February, forlornly trying to ignite its damp wood by
      rubbing stones. Real interest rates will ratchet higher. The debt
      load will continue to rise at a faster pace than nominal GDP
      across Club Med. The region will sink deeper into a compound
      interest trap.”<br>
      <br>
      #4 The Jerome Levy Forecasting Center, which correctly predicted
      the bursting of the subprime mortgage bubble in 2007: “Clearly the
      direction of most of the recent global economic news suggests
      movement toward a 2015 downturn.”<br>
      <br>
      #5 Paul Craig Roberts: “At any time the Western house of cards
      could collapse. It (the financial system) is a house of cards.
      There are no economic fundamentals that support stock prices — the
      Dow Jones. There are no economic fundamentals that support the
      strong dollar…”<br>
      <br>
      #6 David Tice: “I have the same kind of feel in ’98 and ’99; also
      ’05 and ’06.&nbsp; This is going to end badly. I have every
      confidence in the world.”<br>
      <br>
      #7 Liz Capo McCormick and Susanne Walker: “Get ready for a
      disastrous year for U.S. government bonds. That’s the message
      forecasters on Wall Street are sending.”<br>
      <br>
      #8 Phoenix Capital Research: “Just about everything will be hit as
      well. Most of the ‘recovery’ of the last five years has been
      fueled by cheap borrowed Dollars. Now that the US Dollar has
      broken out of a multi-year range, you’re going to see more and
      more ‘risk assets’ (read: projects or investments fueled by
      borrowed Dollars) blow up. Oil is just the beginning, not a
      standalone story.<br>
      <br>
      If things really pick up steam, there’s over $9 TRILLION worth of
      potential explosions waiting in the wings. Imagine if the entire
      economies of both Germany and Japan exploded and you’ve got a
      decent idea of the size of the potential impact on the financial
      system.”<br>
      <br>
      #9 Rob Kirby: “What this breakdown in the crude oil price is going
      to spawn another financial crisis.&nbsp; It will be tied to the
      junk debt that has been issued to finance the shale oil plays in
      North America.&nbsp; It is reported to be in the area of half a
      trillion dollars worth of junk debt that is held largely on the
      books of large financial institutions in the western world.&nbsp;
      When these bonds start to fail, they will jeopardize the future of
      these financial institutions.&nbsp; I do believe that will be the
      signal for the Fed to come riding to the rescue with QE4.&nbsp; I
      also think QE4 is likely going to be accompanied by bank bail-ins
      because we all know all western world countries have adopted
      bail-in legislation in their most recent budgets.&nbsp; The
      financial elites are engineering the excuse for their next round
      of money printing . . .&nbsp; and they will be confiscating money
      out of savings accounts and pension accounts.&nbsp; That’s what I
      think is coming in the very near future.”<br>
      <br>
      #10 John Ing: “The 2008 collapse was just a dress rehearsal
      compared to what the world is going to face this time around. This
      time we have governments which are even more highly leveraged than
      the private sector was.<br>
      <br>
      So this time the collapse will be on a scale that is many
      magnitudes greater than what the world witnessed in 2008.”<br>
      <br>
      #11 Gerald Celente: “What does the word confidence mean? Break it
      down. In this case confidence = con men and con game. That’s all
      it is. So people will lose confidence in the con men because they
      have already shown their cards. It’s a Ponzi scheme. So the con
      game is running out and they don’t have any more cards to play.<br>
      <br>
      What are they going to do? They can’t raise interest rates. We saw
      what happened in the beginning of December when the equity markets
      started to unravel. So it will be a loss of confidence in the con
      game and the con game is soon coming to an end. That is when you
      are going to see panic on Wall Street and around the world.”<br>
      <br>
      If you have been following my website, you know that I have been
      pointing to 2015 for quite some time now.<br>
      <br>
      For example, in my article entitled “The Seven Year Cycle Of
      Economic Crashes That Everyone Is Talking About“, I discussed the
      pattern of financial crashes that we have witnessed every seven
      years that goes all the way back to the Great Depression.&nbsp;
      The last two major stock market crashes began in 2001 and 2008,
      and now here we are seven years later.<br>
      <br>
      Will the same pattern hold up once again?<br>
      <br>
      In addition, there are many other economic cycles that seem to
      indicate that we are due for a major economic downturn.&nbsp; I
      discussed quite a few of these theories in my article entitled “If
      Economic Cycle Theorists Are Correct, 2015 To 2020 Will Be Pure
      Hell For The United States“.<br>
      <br>
      But just like in 2000 and 2007, there are a whole host of doubters
      that are fully convinced that the party can continue
      indefinitely.&nbsp; Even though our economic fundamentals continue
      to get worse, our debt levels continue to grow and every objective
      measurement shows that Wall Street is more reckless and more
      vulnerable to collapse than ever before, they mock the idea that a
      financial collapse is imminent.<br>
      <br>
      So let’s see what happens in 2015.<br>
      <br>
      I have a feeling that it is going to be an extremely “interesting”
      year.<br>

      Does the economy move in predictable waves, cycles or
      patterns?&nbsp; There are many economists that believe that it
      does, and if their projections are correct, the rest of this
      decade is going to be pure hell for the United States.&nbsp; Many
      mainstream economists want nothing to do with economic cycle
      theorists, but it should be noted that economic cycle theories
      have enabled some analysts to correctly predict the timing of
      recessions, stock market peaks and stock market crashes over the
      past couple of decades.&nbsp; Of course none of the theories
      discussed below is perfect, but it is very interesting to note
      that all of them seem to indicate that the U.S. economy is about
      to enter a major downturn.&nbsp; So will the period of 2015 to
      2020 turn out to be pure hell for the United States?&nbsp; We will
      just have to wait and see.<br>
      <br>
      One of the most prominent economic cycle theories is known as “the
      Kondratieff wave”.&nbsp; It was developed by a Russian economist
      named Nikolai Kondratiev, and as Wikipedia has noted, his economic
      theories got him into so much trouble with the Russian government
      that he was eventually executed because of them…<br>
      <br>
      The Soviet economist Nikolai Kondratiev (also written Kondratieff)
      was the first to bring these observations to international
      attention in his book The Major Economic Cycles (1925) alongside
      other works written in the same decade. Two Dutch economists,
      Jacob van Gelderen and Samuel de Wolff, had previously argued for
      the existence of 50 to 60 year cycles in 1913. However, the work
      of de Wolff and van Gelderen has only recently been translated
      from Dutch to reach a wider audience.<br>
      <br>
      Kondratiev’s ideas were not supported by the Soviet government.
      Subsequently he was sent to the gulag and was executed in 1938.<br>
      <br>
      In 1939, Joseph Schumpeter suggested naming the cycles
      “Kondratieff waves” in his honor.<br>
      <br>
      In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the
      Kondratieff wave.&nbsp; The following is an excerpt from an
      article by Christopher Quigley that discussed how this theory
      works…<br>
      <br>
      Kondratiev’s analysis described how international capitalism had
      gone through many such “great depressions” and as such were a
      normal part of the international mercantile credit system. The
      long term business cycles that he identified through meticulous
      research are now called “Kondratieff” cycles or “K” waves.<br>
      <br>
      The K wave is a 60 year cycle (+/- a year or so) with internal
      phases that are sometimes characterized as seasons: spring,
      summer, autumn and winter:<br>
      <br>
      Spring phase: a new factor of production, good economic times,
      rising inflation<br>
      Summer: hubristic ‘peak’ war followed by societal doubts and
      double digit inflation<br>
      Autumn: the financial fix of inflation leads to a credit boom
      which creates a false plateau of prosperity that ends in a
      speculative bubble<br>
      Winter: excess capacity worked off by massive debt repudiation,
      commodity deflation &amp; economic depression. A ‘trough’ war
      breaks psychology of doom.<br>
      <br>
      Increasingly economic academia has come to realize the brilliant
      insight of Nikolai Kondratiev and accordingly there have been many
      reports, articles, theses and books written on the subject of this
      “cyclical” phenomenon. An influential essay, written by Professor
      W. Thompson of Indiana University, has indicated that K waves have
      influenced world technological development since the 900’s. His
      thesis states that “modern” economic development commenced in
      930AD in the Sung province of China and he propounds that since
      this date there have been 18 K waves lasting on average 60 years.<br>
      <br>
      So what does the Kondratieff wave theory suggest is coming next
      for us?<br>
      <br>
      Well, according to work done by Professor W. Thompson of Indiana
      University, we are heading into an economic depression that should
      last until about the year 2020…<br>
      <br>
      Based on Professor Thompson’s analysis long K cycles have nearly a
      thousand years of supporting evidence. If we accept the fact that
      most winters in K cycles last 20 years (as outlined in the chart
      above) this would indicate that we are about halfway through the
      Kondratieff winter that commenced in the year 2000. Thus in all
      probability we will be moving from a “recession” to a “depression”
      phase in the cycle about the year 2013 and it should last until
      approximately 2017-2020.<br>
      <br>
      But of course the Kondratieff wave is far from the only economic
      cycle theory that indicates that we are heading for an economic
      depression.<br>
      <br>
      The economic cycle theories of author Harry Dent also predict that
      we are on the verge of massive economic problems.&nbsp; He mainly
      focuses on demographics, and the fact that our population is
      rapidly getting older is a major issue for him.&nbsp; The
      following is an excerpt from a Business Insider article that
      summarizes the major points that Dent makes in his new book…<br>
      <br>
      <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Young people cause inflation
        because they “cost everything and produce nothing.” But young
        people eventually “begin to pay off when they enter the
        workforce and become productive new workers (supply) and
        higher-spending consumers (demand).”<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, the U.S. reached its
        demographic “peak spending” from 2003-2007 and is headed for the
        “demographic cliff.” Germany, England, Switzerland are all
        headed there too. Then China will be the first emerging market
        to fall off the cliff, albeit in a few decades. The world is
        getting older.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The U.S. stock market will crash. “Our best
        long-term and intermediate cycles suggest another slowdown and
        stock crash accelerating between very early 2014 and early 2015,
        and possibly lasting well into 2015 or even 2016. The worst
        economic trends due to demographics will hit between 2014 and
        2019. The U.S. economy is likely to suffer a minor or major
        crash by early 2015 and another between late 2017 and late 2019
        or early 2020 at the latest.”<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The everyday consumer never came out of the
        last recession.” The rich are the ones feeling great and
        spending money, as asset prices (not wages) are aided by
        monetary stimulus.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The U.S. and Europe are headed in the same
        direction as Japan, a country still in a “coma economy precisely
        because it never let its debt bubble deleverage,” Dent argues.
        “The only way we will not follow in Japan’s footsteps is if the
        Federal Reserve stops printing new money.”<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The reality is stark, when dyers start to
        outweigh buyers, the market changes.” It all comes down to an
        aging population, Dent writes. “Fewer spenders, borrowers, and
        investors will be around to participate in the next boom.”<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The U.S. has a crazy amount of debt and
        “economists and politicians have acted like we can just wave a
        magic wand of endless monetary injections and bailouts and get
        over what they see as a short-term crisis.” But the problem,
        Dent says, is long-term and structural — demographics.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Businesses can “dominate the years to come”
        by focusing on cash and cash flow, being “lean and mean,”
        deferring major capital expenditures, selling nonstrategic real
        estate, and firing weak employees now.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The big four challenges in the years ahead
        will be 1) private and public debt 2) health care and retirement
        entitlements 3) authoritarian governance around the globe and 4)
        environmental pollution that threatens the global economy.<br>
      </blockquote>
      According to Dent, “You need to prepare for that crisis, which
      will occur between 2014 and 2023, with the worst likely starting
      in 2014 and continuing off and on into late 2019.”<br>
      <br>
      So just like the Kondratieff wave, Dent’s work indicates that we
      are going to experience a major economic crisis by the end of this
      decade.<br>
      <br>
      Another economic cycle theory that people are paying more
      attention to these days is the relationship between sun spot
      cycles and the stock market.&nbsp; It turns out that market peaks
      often line up very closely with peaks in sun spot activity.&nbsp;
      This is a theory that was first popularized by an English
      economist named William Stanley Jevons.<br>
      <br>
      Sun spot activity appears to have peaked in early 2014 and is
      projected to decline for the rest of the decade.&nbsp; If
      historical trends hold up, that is a very troubling sign for the
      stock market.<br>
      <br>
      And of course there are many, many other economic cycle theories
      that seem to indicate that trouble is ahead for the United States
      as well.&nbsp; The following is a summary of some of them from an
      article by GE Christenson and Taki Tsaklanos…<br>
      <br>
      Charles Nenner Research (source)<br>
      Stocks should peak in mid-2013 and fall until about 2020.
      Similarly, bonds should peak in the summer of 2013 and fall
      thereafter for 20 years. He bases his conclusions entirely on
      cycle research. He expects the Dow to fall to around 5,000 by 2018
      – 2020.<br>
      <br>
      Kress Cycles (Clif Droke) (source)<br>
      The major 120 year cycle plus all minor cycles trend down into
      late 2014. The stock market should decline hard into late 2014.<br>
      <br>
      Elliott Wave (Robert Prechter) (source)<br>
      He believes that the stock market has peaked and has entered a
      generational bear-market. He anticipates a crash low in the market
      around 2016 – 2017.<br>
      <br>
      Market Energy Waves (source)<br>
      He sees a 36 year cycle in stock markets that is peaking in
      mid-2013 and will cycle down for 2013 – 2016. “… the controlling
      energy wave is scheduled to flip back to negative on July 19 of
      this year.” Equity markets should drop 25 – 50%.<br>
      <br>
      Armstrong Economics (source)<br>
      His economic confidence model projects a peak in confidence in
      August 2013, a bottom in September 2014, and another peak in
      October 2015. The decline into January 2020 should be severe. He
      expects a world-wide crash and contraction in economies from 2015
      – 2020.<br>
      <br>
      Cycles per Charles Hugh Smith (source)<br>
      He discusses four long-term cycles that bottom in the 2010 – 2020
      period. They are: Credit expansion/contraction cycle, Price
      inflation/wage cycle, Generational cycle, and Peak oil extraction
      cycle.<br>
      <br>
      So does history repeat itself?<br>
      <br>
      Well, it should be disconcerting to a lot of people that 2014 is
      turning out to be eerily similar to 2007.&nbsp; But we never
      learned the lessons that we should have learned from the last
      major economic crisis, and most Americans are way too apathetic to
      notice that we are making many of the very same mistakes all over
      again.<br>
      <br>
      And in recent months there have been a whole host of indications
      that the next major economic downturn is just around the
      corner.&nbsp; For example, just this week we learned that
      manufacturing job openings have declined for four months in a
      row.&nbsp; For many more indicators like this, please see my
      previous article entitled “17 Facts To Show To Anyone That
      Believes That The U.S. Economy Is Just Fine“.<br>
      <br>
      Let’s hope that all of the economic cycle theories discussed above
      are wrong this time, but we would be quite foolish to ignore their
      warnings.<br>
      <br>
      Everything indicates that a great economic storm is rapidly
      approaching, and we should use this time of relative calm to get
      prepared while we still can.<br>

      " People often ask me , ' Are you crazy ? ' . My stock answer is,
      ' No, not really.&nbsp; My seeming insanity is simply an
      enormously enjoyous personal hobby, a persona ( amongst several
      others in my vast repertoire of egos and psychic constructs ) that
      also wins friends, enemies, and bets, even as it exerts a
      subliminal influence on peoples and non-human persons such as
      dolphins, whales, and corporations'. This is a scientific,
      algorhythmic response, calculated to maximize allegorical sympathy
      with several bands of analogous mental resonances, and it has
      proven to be surprisingly effective ...<br>
      <br>
      " It is true, as rumored in legend : I have no rectum, nor urethra
      ... I do not poopoo, nor peepee. Nor do I perspire. Rather, I
      exercise biological transmutation to convert all of the energy in
      my food into raw orgone, the which sustains me. Thus I produce no
      waste, and my rectum, urethra, and sweat glands have sealed over
      with this blushing, hymen-like skin. It protects my purity from
      most astral influences and from dread dangers such as Candiru fish
      ( Vandelia cirrhosa ). This wonderment is but one of the many
      blessings bestowed by the alchemists' miraculous Philosophers'
      Stone in its Elixir form... I attained this most Gracious Gift of
      God as a gift from the French adept Nicholas Flamel in the year
      1758...<br>
      <br>
      " I used to be a " Cloud-Eater " -- another of my several hobbies
      -- but the geo-engineering program of spraying so-called
      "chemtrails " has so contaminated Earth's atmosphere, that I
      stopped the regimen...<br>
      <br>
      " My successful persistent praxis of the exotic ancient esoteric
      Taoist exercise called&nbsp; " Dragon's Vaginal Secretions Burn
      Tiger's Penis " has resulted in the opening of a certain minute,
      atrophied ( and hence nearly invisible and previously unidentified
      by modern anatomists, although it is very apparent to clairvoyants
      ) lymphatic channel that connects the coccygeal body ( on the
      prostate gland ) to an opening in the coccyx bone. <br>
      <br>
      " This regeneration, combined with a perfect control of the
      prostate gland ( by way of its reflex point on the penis, at the
      conjunction of the vein and foreskin ), makes it possible to pulse
      the prostate on command as rapidly as one time every few seconds,
      for long periods, even for hours. This results in lymphatic and
      seminal fluids ( from the prostate and gonads respectively ) being
      conducted into one of the holes in the spinal coccyx bone ( rather
      than being ejaculated ), and culminates in the legendary spiritual
      experience known as " kundalini ". <br>
      <br>
      " It's simple, easy, and fun ! Try it !<br>
      <br>
      "In 1929 I began to consider what the little individual could do
      on behalf of his fellow man that government and corporations could
      not do. It became evident that the individual was the only one
      that could deliberately find the time to think in a cosmically
      adequate manner. Each human has his lifetime to invest. If he
      commits to operations in cosmic integrities he will find himself
      participating in nature's own formulations and will realize the
      potentials of her various freedoms and choices, to be employed to
      the advantage of all human beings to come, in order that humans
      may fulfill their cosmic functioning on board of our planet... I'm
      quoting R. Buckminster Fuller here, but I agree with every word...
