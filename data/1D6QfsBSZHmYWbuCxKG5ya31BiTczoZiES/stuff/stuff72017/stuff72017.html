        </div>
        <b><br>
          A new model of the way the THz waves interact with DNA
          explains how the damage is done and why evidence has been so
          hard to gather<br>
        </b><br>
        Boian S. Alexandrov et.al. ( Center for Nonlinear Studies at Los
        Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico ) : Terahertz waves
        “…unzip double-stranded DNA, creating bubbles that could
        significantly interfere with processes such as gene expression
        and DNA replication.”<br>
        <br>
        The evidence that terahertz radiation damages biological systems
        is mixed. “Some studies reported significant genetic damage
        while others, although similar, showed none,” say Boian
        Alexandrov at the Center for Nonlinear Studies at Los Alamos
        National Laboratory in New Mexico and a few buddies. Now these
        guys think they know why.<br>
        <br>
        Alexandrov and co have created a model to investigate how THz
        fields interact with double-stranded DNA and what they’ve found
        is remarkable. They say that although the forces generated are
        tiny, resonant effects allow THz waves to unzip double-stranded
        DNA, creating bubbles in the double strand that could
        significantly interfere with processes such as gene expression
        and DNA replication. That’s a jaw dropping conclusion.<br>
        <br>
        And it also explains why the evidence has been so hard to
        garner. Ordinary resonant effects are not powerful enough to do
        do this kind of damage but nonlinear resonances can. These
        nonlinear instabilities are much less likely to form which
        explains why the character of THz genotoxic effects are
        probabilistic rather than deterministic, say the team.<b><br>

        </b>We consider the influence of a terahertz field on the
        breathing dynamics of double-stranded DNA. We model the
        spontaneous formation of spatially <br>
        localized openings of a damped and driven DNA chain, and find
        that linear instabilities lead to dynamic dimerization, while
        true local strand separations <br>
        require a threshold amplitude mechanism. Based on our results we
        argue that a specific terahertz radiation exposure may
        significantly affect the natural <br>
        dynamics of DNA, and thereby influence intricate molecular
        processes involved in gene expression and DNA replication. <br>

        The evidence of the TSA's fakery is now obvious thanks to the

        <br>

        • To this day, there has been no credible scientific testing of

        <br>
        • The testing that did take place was done on a custom
        combination of spare parts rigged by the manufacturer of the

        installed in airports. In other words, the testing was rigged.<br>
        <br>
        • The names of the researchers who conducted the radiation tests

          April 2011 Letter to John Holdren<br>
          <br>
          RESPONSE TO THE LETTER FROM DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN
          SERVICES OF OCTOBER 12, 2010 There is Still No Rigorous Hard
          Data For The Safety of X-Ray Airport <br>
        </b><br>
        Passenger Scanners The problem remains that the safety of the
        X-ray airport scanners has not been independently verified.
        Recently the NIST report on the <br>
        'Rapiscan Secure 1000', the most widely deployed person X-ray
        scanner, and the Johns Hopkins report have been made available.
        However the Johns Hopkins <br>
        report, which is the more detailed and significant because it
        refers to the widely deployed Single Pose system, does not hold
        to critical principles of <br>
        scientific reporting. The document is heavily redacted with red
        stamps over the words and figures. In every case the electric
        current used which correlates <br>
        one to one with X-ray dose has been specifically redacted. Thus
        there is no way to repeat any of these measurements. While the
        report purports to present the <br>
        results of objective testing, in fact the JHU APL personnel, who
        are unnamed anywhere in the document either as experimenters or
        as authors, were not <br>
        provided with a machine by Rapiscan. Instead they were invited
        to the manufacturing site to observe a mock-up of components
        (spare parts) that were said to <br>
        be similar to those that are parts of the Rapiscan system. The
        tests were performed by the manufacturer using the
        manufacturer's questionable test <br>
        procedures. Although the doses from Compton Backscatter
        screening are potentially low, the dose rates are very high,
        comparable to dose rates in CT machines. <br>
        <br>
        These dose rates far exceed the limits specified for the ion
        chambers that were used in both the JHU measurements and the
        field measurements using the Fluke <br>
        451 reported by the TSA. There are also issues related to the
        incomplete coverage of the ion chamber by the flying spot of the
        backscatter machine. The data <br>
        given in the Johns Hopkins report indicate that there must be
        something wrong. The very large exposures measured for scatter
        radiation in the JHL report, 36% <br>
        of primary exposure above the cabinets outside the direct beam
        path and 19% of primary exposure in the entrance and exit
        regions, strongly suggest that the <br>
        measurement of primary exposure is too low. Scatter exposure is
        usually at most a few % of the primary exposure, which is
        consistent with the fact that only <br>
        a few % incident X-rays are Compton backscattered calling into
        question the validity of the exposure measurement as well as the
        validity of this test <br>
        equipment for a (intense) spot scanner. The report was
        apparently summarized by the JHU APL; however, without
        signatories, there is no accountability for the <br>
        document. Thus, important information has not been provided to
        the public regarding the beam intensity under operational
        conditions at airports [X-ray <br>
        photons per unit area per unit time (because it is scanning)]
        and/or the related quantity - fluence (being the total energy
        delivered per unit area, which is <br>
        equal to the intensity multiplied by the time the spot remains
        on a given area), values that would be especially useful in
        calculating the dose. Also the X-<br>

              About Orwell's 1984</b><br>
          </font><br>
          <b>by Anna Matthews</b><br>
        </div>
        <b><br>
        </b>George Orwell’s novel 1984 was incredibly popular at the
        time it was published, and it remains incredibly popular to this
        day. With multiple stars citing the <br>
        book as one of their favorites – including Stephen King, David
        Bowie, Mel Gibson, and Kit Harrington – 1984 has been growing in
        popularity in recent years. <br>
        <br>
        The book reappeared on best-seller lists in early 2017, as some
        argued Orwell’s dystopian vision had finally arrived.<br>
        <br>
        Below are 10 facts you might not know about Orwell’s dark novel.<br>
        <br>
        1. Before he wrote 1984, Orwell worked for the British
        government during World War II as a propagandist at the BBC.
        (Perhaps seeing the propaganda industry <br>
        up close led to his critical portrait in 1984.)<br>
        <br>
        2. Orwell initially named the novel 1980, and then 1982 before
        settling on 1984. Since it was written in 1948, some think that
        Orwell devised the title by <br>
        inverting the year the book was written. Additionally, he
        thought about naming the novel The Last Man in Europe.<br>
        <br>
        3. While writing the novel, Orwell fought tuberculosis. The
        disease ultimately consumed him and he died seven months after
        1984 was published, with <br>
        tuberculosis as the sole cause of death. <br>
        <br>
        4. In addition to fighting tuberculosis, Orwell almost died
        while writing the novel. On a recreational boating trip with his
        children, he went overboard. <br>
        Fortunately, neither this episode nor the tuberculosis prevented
        him from finishing his novel.<br>
        <br>
        5. On an ironic note, Orwell himself was under government
        surveillance while writing his novel warning about government
        surveillance. The British government <br>
        was watching Orwell because they believed he held socialist
        opinions. This surveillance started after he published The Road
        to Wigan Pier, a true story about <br>
        poverty and the lower class in England. <br>
        <br>
        6. The slogan “2 + 2 = 5” originated from Russia, where the
        Communist regime used it as a motto of sorts in an effort to
        help them accomplish the goals of <br>
        their five-year plan in only four years. Though the slogan is
        still used to point out the ills of totalitarian brainwashing
        today, it was not coined by <br>
        Orwell.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        7. In addition to borrowing a piece of Russian propaganda,
        Orwell also borrowed some Japanese propaganda for his novel. The
        “Thought Police” are based on the <br>
        Japanese wartime secret police who literally arrested Japanese
        citizens for having “unpatriotic thoughts.” Their official name
        was the Kempeitai, and they <br>
        officially named their pursuit the “Thought War.”<br>
        <br>
        8. When Orwell worked as a propagandist for the BBC, there was a
        conference room there numbered 101. This room was the room of
        which he based the location <br>
        for some of his more horrifying scenes, making the scenes
        themselves all the more horrifying.<br>
        <br>
        9. According to Orwell’s friends and families, his second wife
        Sonia Brownell was the model off of which he based the love
        interest (Julia) of the book’s <br>
        main character, Winston Smith.<br>
        <br>
        10. Though his book may be popular, Orwell’s novel also makes
        the list of the world’s top ten most frequently banned books.
        Some ban it for what they claim <br>
        are pro-communist points of view, and others have banned it
        because it is anti-communist. Regardless, it is ironic that a
        book warning against <br>
        totalitarianism is often an item for censorship.<br>

              50% More Energy Than Silicon Cells</b><br>

        <br>
        Researchers have created a concentrating photovoltaic (CPV)
        system with embedded microtracking that is capable of producing
        50 percent more energy per day <br>
        than the standard silicon solar cells...<br>
        <br>
        To do this, the researchers embed tiny multi-junction solar
        cells, roughly half a millimeter square, into a sheet of glass
        that slides between a pair of <br>
        plastic lenslet arrays. The whole arrangement is about two
        centimeters thick and tracking is done by sliding the sheet of
        solar cells laterally between the <br>
        lenslet array while the panel remains fixed on the roof.<br>
        <br>
        An entire day’s worth of tracking requires about one centimeter
        of movement, which is practically imperceptible...<br>
        <br>
        The CPV system reached 30 percent efficiency, in contrast to the
        17 percent efficiency of the silicon cell. All together over the
        entire day, the CPV system <br>
        produced 54 percent more energy than the silicon and could have
        reached 73 percent if microcell heating from the intense
        sunlight were avoided...<b><br>

          Abstract<br>
          <br>
        </b>Prospects for concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) power are
        growing as the market increasingly values high power conversion
        efficiency to leverage now-dominant&nbsp; balance of system and
        soft costs. This trend is particularly acute for rooftop
        photovoltaic power, where delivering the high efficiency of
        traditional CPV in the form factor of a standard rooftop
        photovoltaic panel could be transformative. Here, we demonstrate
        a fully automated planar microtracking CPV system &lt;2? cm
        thick that operates at fixed tilt with a microscale
        triple-junction solar cell at &gt;660× concentration ratio over
        a 140° full field of view. In outdoor&nbsp; testing over the
        course of two sunny days, the system operates automatically from
        sunrise to sunset, outperforming a 17%-efficient commercial
        silicon solar cell by generating &gt;50% more energy per unit
        area per day in a direct head-to-head competition. These results
        support the technical feasibility of planar&nbsp; microtracking
        CPV to deliver a step change in the efficiency of rooftop solar
        panels at a commercially relevant concentration ratio.<br>

              Now Hidden Under A New Name</b></font><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        ...HCFS is now being disguised under the names “fructose syrup”
        or, simply, “fructose”. It is a processed chemical sweetener
        that you will find in products such as bread, cakes, cookies,
        condiments and soft drinks. It is cheaper to use than sugar and
        extends the shelf life of products, so naturally the food
        companies are inclined to use it, but at the detriment of their
        customers' health.<br>
        <br>
        The food companies don't want to change their money-making ways,
        so they found an ingenious way to get around the food labeling
        laws. HFCS is sub-categorized based on its fructose content.
        Normal HFCS – HFCS 42 or HFCS 55 – contains either 42 or 55
        percent fructose. The term “fructose” is now being used when
        foods contain the ingredient previously called HFCS-90, which
        has 90 percent fructose. Identifying HFCS-90 as “fructose” makes
        it possible for them to label the product as 'not containing
        HCFS' when it actually does.<br>
        <br>
        CRA’s have said: “A third product, HFCS-90, is sometimes used in
        natural and ‘light’ foods, where very little is needed to
        provide sweetness. Syrups with 90% fructose will not state high
        fructose corn syrup on the label [anymore], they will state
        ‘fructose’ or ‘fructose syrup’.”...<br>
        <b><br>
        </b>What is the real danger of eating HFCS? Here are some
        scientific sources to help you understand the danger of this
        ingredient:<br>
        <br>
        “Some people have claimed that high-fructose corn syrup is no
        different than other sweeteners when it comes to weight gain and
        obesity, but our results make it clear that this just isn’t
        true, at least under the conditions of our tests.” “When rats
        are drinking high-fructose corn syrup at levels well below those
        in soda pop, they’re becoming obese — every single one, across
        the board. Even when rats are fed a high-fat diet, you don’t see
        this; they don’t all gain extra weight.” – Bart Hoebel,
        psychology professor at Princeton University (source:
        Princeton.edu)<br>
        <br>
        “The study adds to a growing body of scientific literature that
        indicates HFCS consumption may result in negative health
        consequences distinct from and more deleterious than natural
        sugar.” – Dr. Michael I. Goran (source: Huffington Post)<br>
        <br>
        “Consumption of HFCS may lead to mineral imbalances, including
        Zn [Zinc], Ca [Calcium] and P [Phosphorus] loss and Cu [Copper]
        gain and is a potential source of inorganic mercury exposure.”–
        Dufault et al. Clinical Epigenetics, 2012<br>
        <br>
        “Data show that consumption of added sugars, particularly
        HFCS-55, negatively impacts hippocampal function, metabolic
        outcomes, and neuroinflammation when consumed in excess during
        the adolescent period of development.” – Hsu et al Hippocampus,
        2014.<br>
        <br>
        “In the United States, food ingredient information is written
        for regulators and scientists, not for the average consumer.” –

        forms...<br>
        <br>
        Researchers used four types of stevia: three in liquid form
        derived from standard alcohol extraction and one powdered. The
        powdered stevia diluted in liquid did not show promise in
        killing off Lyme, but the alcohol extracted stevia samples did.<br>
        <br>
        Stevia leaf extract outperformed individual drugs often used to
        treat Lyme disease (doxycycline, cefoperazone, daptomycin, and
        their combinations).<br>
        <br>
        Interestingly, a week after treatment, viable B. burgdorferi
        started to surface again in the antibiotic groups. This did not
        happen in the stevia group, which appeared to be a complete kill
        off after seven days.<br>
        <br>
        The biofilm associated with Lyme actually increased in size with
        individual antibiotic treatment. Not good!...<br>

        <b><br>
        </b>...We’re now living under that condition of “intellectual
        martial law.” The consequent degradation of thinking means that
        the polity can’t construct a coherent consensus about what is
        happening to it (or devise a plan for what to do about it). This
        is exactly the point where the Overton Window turns into an
        Overton Bubble, as described by Devers. The bubble comprises
        ideas that are assumed to be self-evident (though they actually
        aren’t) and notions that are potentially destructive of society,
        even suicidally so. Here is a partial list of the current dogmas
        and shibboleths inside today’s Overton Bubble:<br>
        <br>
        Russia hacked the election of 2016 (no evidence required).<br>
        Russia (Vladimir Putin in particular) is bent on destroying the
        USA.<br>
        All immigrants, legal or illegal, have equal status before the
        law.<br>
        National borders are inconvenient, cruel, and obsolete.<br>
        Western Civilization is a malign force in human history.<br>
        Islam is “the religion of peace,” no matter how many massacres
        of “infidels” are carried out in its name.<br>
        Men are a negative force in society.<br>
        White men are especially negative.<br>
        Brownie points given for behaviors under the rubric LBGTQ.<br>
        All discussion about race problems and conflicts is necessarily
        racist.<br>
        The hijab (head covering worn in public by some Muslim women) is
        a device of liberation for women.<br>
        There should be a law against using the wrong personal pronoun
        for people who consider themselves neither men nor women
        (recently passed by the Canadian parliament).<br>
        A unifying common culture is unnecessary in national life
        (anything goes).<br>
        Colonizing Mars is a great solution to problems on Earth.<br>
        <br>
        That list defines the general preoccupations of the thinking
        classes today — to the exclusion of other issues. Here is an
        alternative list of matters they are not generally concerned
        about or interested in:<br>
        <br>
        The energy quandary at the heart of our economic malaise... The
        enormous debt racked up to run society in the absence of
        affordable energy inputs... The dangerous interventions and
        manipulation in markets by unelected officials of the Federal
        Reserve... The extraordinary dysfunction of manipulated
        financial markets... The fragility of a banking system based on
        accounting fraud... The dysfunction and fragility of the
        American suburban living arrangement... The consequences of a
        catastrophic breakdown in the economy due to the above...&nbsp;
        The destruction of planetary ecology, threatening the
        continuation of the human race, and potentially all life.<br>
        <br>
        Now, the question of motive. Why does the thinking class in
        America embrace ideas that are not necessarily, and surely not
        self-evidently, truthful, and even self-destructive? Because
        this class is dangerously insecure and perversely needs to
        insist on being right about its guiding dogmas and shibboleths
        at all costs. That is why so much of the behavior emanating from
        the thinking class amounts to virtue signaling — we are the good
        people on the side of what’s right, really we are! Of course,
        virtue signaling is just the new term for self-righteousness.
        There is also the issue of careerism. So many individuals are
        making a living at trafficking in, supporting, or executing
        policy based on these dogmas and shibboleths that they don’t
        dare depart from the Overton Bubble of permissible, received
        thought lest they sacrifice their status and incomes.<br>
        <br>
        The thinking classes are also the leaders and foot-soldiers in
        American institutions. When they are unable or unwilling to
        think clearly, then you get a breakdown of authority, which
        leads to a breakdown of legitimacy. That’s exactly where we’re
        at today in our national politics — our ability to manage the
        polity.<br>

              Bladder Cancer Cells As Effectively As Chemotherapy</b></font><br>
        </div>
        <b><br>
        </b>Can distilled water kill bladder cancer cells? That’s the
        question doctors at the Department of Urology, University of
        Bonn, Germany are attempting to answer. The surprising results
        suggest simple distilled water might just be a bladder cancer
        cell’s worst nightmare.<br>
        <br>
        Reporting in the October 2006 International Journal of Clinical
        Practice, the team said that the surgical procedure called
        transurethral resection is used to remove bladder cancer and
        followed by instillation of chemotherapeutic agents such as
        mitomycin; it is considered as standard therapy in recurrent
        superficial bladder cancer.<br>
        <br>
        “However, incidence of bladder cancer is increasing and
        contrariwise, the resources to finance health care systems are
        decreasing. Therefore, effective alternatives to expensive
        chemotherapeutics are necessary,” said the authors.<br>
        <br>
        Recurrence of bladder cancer after transurethral resection is
        caused by reimplantation of dissolved tumor cells. To kill them
        off, mitomycin is used. The researchers took human bladder
        cancer cells and incubated them in mitomycin or distilled water.<br>
        <br>
        “Distilled water led to significant cytolysis in all tumor
        cells,” they write. “This effect was comparable to exposition to
        mitomycin. Distilled water and mitomycin have comparable in
        vitro effects in bladder cancer cells,” the scientists wrote.<br>
        <br>
        This was not the first study to determine distilled water kills
        bladder cancer cells. In a 1986 issue of European Urology, the
        effect of distilled water on tumor cells was compared to the
        effect of chemotherapeutic agents dissolved in saline and in
        distilled water.<br>
        <br>
        “Distilled water proved as effective as chemotherapeutic agents
        in distilled water and more destructive than chemotherapeutic
        agents in saline within the 2-hour time limit of the
        experiment,” the researchers reported.<b><br>

              again — Just one minute of intense exercise produces
              health benefits.</b></font><br>
        </div>
        <b><br>
        </b>Researchers at McMaster University have found that a single
        minute of very intense exercise produces health benefits similar
        to longer, traditional endurance training.<br>
        <br>
        The findings put to rest the common excuse for not getting in
        shape: there is not enough time.<br>
        <br>
        "This is a very time-efficient workout strategy," says Martin
        Gibala, a professor of kinesiology at McMaster and lead author
        on the study. "Brief bursts of intense exercise are remarkably
        effective."<br>
        <br>
        Scientists set out to determine how sprint interval training
        (SIT) compared to moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT),
        as recommended in public health guidelines. They examined key
        health indicators including cardiorespiratory fitness and
        insulin sensitivity, a measure of how the body regulates blood
        sugar.<br>
        <br>
        A total of 27 sedentary men were recruited and assigned to
        perform three weekly sessions of either intense or moderate
        training for 12 weeks, or to a control group that did not
        exercise).<br>
        <br>
        The McMaster team has previously shown that the SIT protocol,
        which involved three 20-second 'all-out' cycle sprints, was
        effective for boosting fitness. The workout totaled just 10
        minutes, including a 2-minute warm-up and 3-minute cool down,
        and two minutes of easy cycling for recovery between the hard
        sprints.<br>
        <br>
        The new study compared the SIT protocol with a group who
        performed 45 minutes of continuous cycling at a moderate pace,
        plus the same warm-up and cool down. After 12 weeks of training,
        the results were remarkably similar, even though the MICT
        protocol involved five times as much exercise and a five-fold
        greater time commitment.<br>
        <br>
        "Most people cite 'lack of time' as the main reason for not
        being active", according to Gibala. "Our study shows that an
        interval-based approach can be more efficient—you can get health
        and fitness benefits comparable to the traditional approach, in
        less time."<br>
        <br>
        Gibala, who has studied has been studying interval training for
        more than a decade. O, was the first researcher to show that a
        few minutes per week of intense exercise produced benefits
        similar to longer, continouous workouts. Over time, his team has
        experimented with different protocols in an effort to identify
        the most time-efficient exercise strategies.<br>
        <br>
        "The basic principles apply to many forms of exercise," he says.
        "Climbing a few flights of stairs on your lunch hour can provide
        a quick and effective workout. The health benefits are
        significant."<b><br>

          Abstract<br>
          <br>
        </b>We investigated whether sprint interval training (SIT) was a
        time-efficient exercise strategy to improve insulin sensitivity
        and other indices of cardiometabolic health to the same extent
        as traditional moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT).
        SIT involved 1 minute of intense exercise within a 10-minute
        time commitment, whereas MICT involved 50 minutes of continuous
        exercise per session.<br>
        Methods<br>
        <br>
        Sedentary men (27±8y; BMI = 26±6kg/m2) performed three weekly
        sessions of SIT (n = 9) or MICT (n = 10) for 12 weeks or served
        as non-training controls (n = 6). SIT involved 3x20-second
        ‘all-out’ cycle sprints (~500W) interspersed with 2 minutes of
        cycling at 50W, whereas MICT involved 45 minutes of continuous
        cycling at ~70% maximal heart rate (~110W). Both protocols
        involved a 2-minute warm-up and 3-minute cool-down at 50W.<br>
        Results<br>
        <br>
        Peak oxygen uptake increased after training by 19% in both
        groups (SIT: 32±7 to 38±8; MICT: 34±6 to 40±8ml/kg/min;
        p&lt;0.001 for both). Insulin sensitivity index (CSI),
        determined by intravenous glucose tolerance tests performed
        before and 72 hours after training, increased similarly after
        SIT (4.9±2.5 to 7.5±4.7, p = 0.002) and MICT (5.0±3.3 to 6.7±5.0
        x 10-4 min-1 [µU/mL]-1, p = 0.013) (p&lt;0.05). Skeletal muscle
        mitochondrial content also increased similarly after SIT and
        MICT, as primarily reflected by the maximal activity of citrate
        synthase (CS; P&lt;0.001). The corresponding changes in the
        control group were small for VO2peak (p = 0.99), CSI (p = 0.63)
        and CS (p = 0.97).<b><br>
          <br>
          Conclusions<br>
          <br>
        </b>Twelve weeks of brief intense interval exercise improved
        indices of cardiometabolic health to the same extent as

        </div>
        <br>
        PROSTATE health can be a pretty awkward subject, so prepare to
        blush at this new research from Harvard University.<br>
        <br>
        Scientists say frequent ejaculations could be the key to keeping
        the semen-producing gland healthy and avoiding cancer.<br>
        <br>
        In fact, in a study of almost 32,000 men published in the
        journal of European Urology, researchers found high levels of
        sexual activity can reduce the risk of contracting prostate
        cancer by 33 per cent.<br>
        <br>
        The optimum number is 21 ejaculations per month.<br>
        <br>
        We’ve done a few quick calculations and that’s equal to 252
        times annually — or almost 70 per cent of days in a year.<br>
        <br>
        Experts aren’t exactly sure why ejaculation lowers the risk of
        prostate cancer, but they speculate it might help flush out
        cancer-causing toxins.<br>
        <br>
        According to statistics from the University of Sydney, prostate
        cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in Australia, and the
        third most common cause of cancer death.<br>
        <br>
        It’s more common in older men, with 85 per cent of cases
        diagnosed in those over 65 years of age, so the results of this
        study are definitely worth taking on board.<br>
        <br>
        Enjoyable as it may be, frequent ejaculation isn’t a magical
        one-stop shop.<br>
        <br>
        The Harvard researchers pointed out an active sex life may be an
        indicator of good general health, which in itself is likely to
        lower the risk of cancer.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, it’s also important to maintain a good diet and
        exercise routine, and get regular check-ups from your doctor.<br>

          New experiments to uncover the factors that influence plasma
          flow could bring scientists closer to achieving an
          electrodeless plasma thruster.<br>
          <br>
          In space, it’s known that magnetic field lines become
          stretched by plasma flows, causing them to increase – but in
          the lab, scientists have found that the opposite occurs,
          causing the magnetic field to decrease.<br>
          <br>
          Based on these interactions, researchers are working to create
          thrusters that use an expanding magnetic field, in which
          plasma is accelerated to propel a spacecraft.<br>
          <br>
          Scientists have now identified the transition point that could
          allow plasma flow to guide the magnetic field toward space
          while still maintaining thrust, in what could help overcome
          one of the technology’s biggest challenges.<br>

          </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
          <br>
          A potentially useful approach for drug discovery is to connect
          gene expression profiles of disease-affected tissues (“disease
          signatures”) to drug signatures, but it remains to be shown
          whether it can be used to identify clinically relevant
          treatment options. We analyzed coexpression networks and
          genetic data to identify a disease signature for type 2
          diabetes in liver tissue. By interrogating a library of 3800
          drug signatures, we identified sulforaphane as a compound that
          may reverse the disease signature. Sulforaphane suppressed
          glucose production from hepatic cells by nuclear translocation
          of nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (NRF2) and
          decreased expression of key enzymes in gluconeogenesis.
          Moreover, sulforaphane reversed the disease signature in the
          livers from diabetic animals and attenuated exaggerated
          glucose production and glucose intolerance by a magnitude
          similar to that of metformin. Finally, sulforaphane, provided
          as concentrated broccoli sprout extract, reduced fasting blood
          glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in obese patients with
          dysregulated type 2 diabetes.<br>

          ...After each Islamic terrorist attack or migrant crime spree,
          the left predictably virtue signals, informing us that we must
          combat our own slaughter with love, tolerance, and open
          borders. Of course, this only leads to the Islamization of
          nations as the dead cry out from their graves that at least
          they were morally superior to their murderers. Still, it takes
          liberals falling on their own sword to realize that their
          theories don’t work when put into action, and even then, many
          refuse to acknowledge that the flaw is in their agenda and not
          its execution.<br>
          <br>
          Syrian hairstylist Mohammad Hussain Rashwani was hailed by
          local media as a “model for integration of asylum seekers”
          after migrating from Damascus to Germany during the refugee
          crisis. Falling for this leftist propaganda, 64-year-old <br>
          <br>
          Ilona F. took Mohammad under her wing by offering him a
          position at her salon in Herzberg in September 2016. Sadly, it
          took Ilona just 5 months to discover the truth about just how
          dangerous even vetted asylum seekers can be.<br>
          <br>
          German online newspaper Lausitzzer Rundschau reports that the
          left’s poster child for Muslim migration, 39-year-old
          Mohammad, brutally attacked his elderly female boss on June
          28, stabbing her in the neck as Muslim jihadists often do. <br>
          <br>
          The Syrian refugee, who was lauded by liberals as proof of
          Islamic “integration,” carried out the Quran’s command to
          “smite at their necks,” nearly killing his employer.<br>
          <br>
          Ilona managed to escape certain death when another 22-year-old
          Syrian intervened and stopped Mohammad, which authorities say
          likely saved the woman. She was forced to undergo emergency
          surgery but is now in stable condition...<br>
          <br>
          Aside from the Quran’s dozens of other violent commands
          towards unbelievers, verses 47:4 and 8:12 specifically order
          the stabbing of non-Muslims at their necks. This can mean
          either beheading, stabbing, or simple throat-slitting —
          whatever accomplishes “inflicting slaughter upon them” and
          “casting terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve.” <br>
          <br>
          Surprisingly, the only interpretation of this that’s false is
          any inclination that Muslims should be peaceable to
          non-Muslims.<br>

          92 percent of all severe rapes (violent rapes) are committed
          by migrants and refugees. 100 percent of all attack rapes
          (where victim and attacker had no previous contact) are
          committed by that same group. In other words, thousands of
          Swedish women would not have been raped and thereby

          Kosovo.<br>

          The polemicist Eric Zemmour was sentenced Thursday
          [06/22/2017] to a 5,000 euro fine for incitement to hatred for
          anti-Muslim remarks held in the program “C to you” on
          September 6, 2016.<br>
          <br>
          During the broadcast on France 5, he had in particular
          considered that it was necessary to give the Muslims “the
          choice between Islam and France”.<br>
          <br>
          He had also argued that “all Muslims, whether they say it or
          not,” regarded the jihadists as “good Muslims.”<br>
          <br>
          The Correctional Court of Paris ruled that the remarks made
          are “undoubtedly serious”, Eric Zemmour “stigmatizing on
          several occasions and in particularly violent and peremptory
          terms, a community taken in its entirety”.<br>

          For many years, whenever one Googled “jihad,” Jihad Watch was
          the first result. This was back in the days when Google’s
          results were based on the relevance of the subject matter to
          the search and the popularity of the site. But then Google
          began engaging in social engineering, attempting to manipulate
          opinion by changing the results of searches to lead people to
          sites that offered the perspectives it favored. Then when one
          searched for “jihad,” Jihad Watch became the <br>
          second result, and then the fourth, even though our readership
          was steadily rising; replacing it at the top were Islamic
          apologetics sites with a fraction of the readership, offering
          soothing falsehoods about the meaning of jihad...<br>

          </b><br>
          Our smartphones enable—and encourage—constant connection to
          information, entertainment, and each other. They put the world
          at our fingertips, and rarely leave our sides. Although these
          devices have immense potential to improve welfare, their
          persistent presence may come at a cognitive cost. In this
          research, we test the “brain drain” hypothesis that the mere
          presence of one’s own smartphone may occupy limited-capacity
          cognitive resources, thereby leaving fewer resources available
          for other tasks and undercutting cognitive performance.
          Results from two experiments indicate that even when people
          are successful at maintaining sustained attention—as when
          avoiding the temptation to check their phones—the mere
          presence of these devices reduces available cognitive
          capacity. Moreover, these cognitive costs are highest for
          those highest in smartphone dependence. We conclude by
          discussing the practical implications of this
          smartphone-induced brain drain for consumer decision-making
          and consumer welfare...<br>
          <br>
          ...Smartphone owners interact with their phones an average of
          85 times a day, including immediately upon waking up, just
          before going to sleep, and even in the middle of the night
          (Perlow 2012; Andrews et al. 2015; dscout 2016). Ninety-one
          percent report that they never leave home without their phones
          (Deutsche Telekom 2012), and 46% say that they couldn’t live
          without them (Pew Research Center 2015)... <br>

          Chinese scientists claim to have made a major breakthrough in
          magnetic detection technology that could bring unprecedented
          accuracy to the process of finding hidden metallic objects –
          from minerals to submarines.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The Chinese Academy of Sciences, the country’s largest
          research institute, said in an article on its website on
          Wednesday that a “superconductive magnetic anomaly detection
          array” has been developed in Shanghai and passed inspection by
          an expert panel.<br>
          <br>
          The experts were quoted as saying that the device, which works
          from the air, could be used to pinpoint the location of
          minerals buried deep beneath the earth in Inner Mongolia, for
          example, with a level of precision as high as anything
          currently available around the world.<br>
          <br>
          The device could also be used on civilian and military
          aircraft as a “high performance equipment and technical
          solution to resources mapping, civil engineering, archaeology
          and national defence”, the article said.<br>
          <br>
          China’s military may soon adopt the technology, if it hasn’t
          already, said Professor Zhang Zhi, an expert in remote sensing
          with the Institute of Geophysics and Geomatics, China
          University of Geosciences in Wuhan, Hubei.<br>
          <br>
          “The technology could be used to detect minerals on land, and
          in the ocean to nail down submarines,” said Zhang, who was not
          involved in the project.<br>
          <br>
          Anti-submarine aircraft have been equipped with magnetic
          anomaly detectors, or MAD, since World War II. The devices
          monitor the small disturbances metallic objects cause to the
          Earth’s magnetic field, analyse the data and use complex
          algorithms to calculate the object’s position.<br>
          <br>
          Precise locations are often difficult to obtain, however,
          because the strength of a magnetic signal drops rapidly as the
          distance from the source increases.<br>
          <br>
          Aircraft have to fly low, and the submarine has to be
          operating sufficiently close to surface for the device to
          register it. The power of the signal can be reduced by other
          factors, too, such as if the submarine is made from less
          ferromagnetic materials.<br>
          <br>
          The experts were quoted as saying that the device, which works
          from the air, could be used to pinpoint the location of
          minerals buried deep beneath the earth in Inner Mongolia, for
          example, with a level of precision as high as anything
          currently available around the world.<br>
          <br>
          The device could also be used on civilian and military
          aircraft as a “high performance equipment and technical
          solution to resources mapping, civil engineering, archaeology
          and national defence”, the article said.<br>
          <br>
          China’s military may soon adopt the technology, if it hasn’t
          already, said Professor Zhang Zhi, an expert in remote sensing
          with the Institute of Geophysics and Geomatics, China
          University of Geosciences in Wuhan, Hubei.<br>
          <br>
          “The technology could be used to detect minerals on land, and
          in the ocean to nail down submarines,” said Zhang, who was not
          involved in the project.<br>

          distance from the source increases.<br>

          factors, too, such as if the submarine is made from less
          ferromagnetic materials.<br>
          <br>
          Dr Lei Chong, an assistant researcher studying MAD technology
          at the Department of Micro/Nano Electronics, Shanghai Jiaotong
          University, said the Chinese device was different from
          conventional designs in at least two ways.<br>
          <br>
          The first is the large number of probes the device uses. With
          this “array”, it can collect much more data than traditional
          detectors, which tend to use just one antenna, said Lei, who
          was not involved in the project.<br>
          <br>
          The new MAD also uses a superconductive computer chip cooled
          by liquid nitrogen. This super-cool environment significantly
          increases the device’s sensitivity to signals that would be
          too faint for traditional devices to spot.<br>
          <br>
          “I am surprised they made such an announcement,” Lei said.
          “Usually this kind of information is not revealed to the
          public because of its military value.”<br>
          <br>
          The superconductive MAD array was developed over four years by
          a research team led by Professor Xie Xiaoming from the
          Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology,
          according to the CAS article.<br>
          <br>
          Xie could not immediately be reached for comment.<br>
          <br>
          Chinese research teams have also recently completed the
          development of eight other types of magnetic detectors, some
          of which are small and sensitive enough to be used on
          satellites, the article said.<br>
          <br>
          The academy said that due to the difficulties involved in
          developing such equipment, most countries, including the
          United States, don’t yet have it. Germany is the rare
          exception, it said.<br>
          <br>
          Despite the article’s claims, Lei said it was too early to say
          whether China was leading the world in MAD technology.<br>
          <br>
          “The US military might have developed similar equipment but
          kept their lips sealed about it,” he said.<br>
          <br>
          “It’s impossible, therefore, to compare one country to another
          on this kind of sensitive technology based only on openly
          available information.<br>
          <br>
          “Converting a mineral detector to a MAD for submarines
          requires a lot of extra work. Military users have very
          different requirements to those in the civilian sector,” he
          said.<br>

          <br>
          A new study demonstrates a way to adapt the so-called Trombe
          wall -- a passive solar building design from the 19th century
          -- to not only heat but also cool buildings, while drastically
          reduce associated carbon emissions. The new design is now
          being tested by locals in Saint Catherine, Egypt. <br>
          <br>
          Researcher Marwa Dabaieh from Lund University in Sweden has
          come up with a way to adapt the so-called Trombe wall -- a
          passive solar building design from the 19th century -- to not
          only heat but also cool buildings, while drastically reduce
          associated carbon emissions. The new design is now being
          tested by locals in Saint Catherine, Egypt.<br>
          <br>
          "In Egypt, fossil fuels account for 94% of all energy. There
          is therefore a great need for innovative energy solutions to
          reduce carbon emissions that can also be used in rural
          communities which do not always have electricity," says
          architectural researcher Marwa Dabaieh who divides her time
          between Lund University and the British University in Egypt.<br>
          <br>
          The vented Trombe wall is an old, yet still popular passive
          construction technique that hardly requires any energy. Marwa
          Dabaieh has continued to develop this technique so that it can
          be used for not only building heating, but also cooling --
          providing a comfortable indoor temperature all year around.<br>
          <br>
          "The new design uses renewable wind and solar energy to
          generate cooling and heating in buildings. The adjustments
          have also eliminated the original Trombe wall problem with
          overheating, which in turn has drastically reduced the total
          energy consumption and carbon emissions," says Marwa Dabaieh.<br>
          <br>
          The new design has taken the aesthetic aspects of the Trombe
          wall into account, so that it can be integrated into modern
          buildings and become an attractive architectural element. The
          materials used to build the wall are local stone, wood and
          wool, as well as locally produced glass.<br>
          <br>
          "Locals have been involved in every step of the process, so
          that they can easily build the Trombe wall themselves or show
          others how to construct one. Local construction could also
          help create new opportunities for young and unemployed
          people," says Marwa Dabaieh.<br>
          <br>
          The villagers in Saint Catherine who have installed the Trombe
          wall have experienced a nicer indoor temperature, and several
          people have expressed a desire to have the new ventilation
          system installed; something Marwa Dabaieh sees as positive
          sign.<br>
          <br>
          This passive ventilation system could be key for a sustainable
          future.<br>
          <br>
          "In order to overcome future environmental challenges, we must
          invest in passive, low-cost systems that require almost no
          energy from fossil fuels. The vented Trombe wall has a great
          potential for meeting the steadily increasing energy demands
          without increasing carbon emissions," says Marwa Dabaieh.<br>

          In Egypt, fossil fuels account for 94% of all energy. There is
          a need for innovative energy solutions to reduce carbon
          emissions that can also be used in rural communities which do
          not always have electricity. Researcher Marwa Dabaieh from
          Lund University in Sweden has come up with a way to adapt the
          so-called Trombe wall – a passive solar building design from
          the 19th century – to not only heat but also cool buildings,
          while drastically reduce associated carbon emissions. The new
          design is now being tested by locals in Saint Catherine,
          Egypt. Learn how the Trombe wall design works:<br>

              Plastic From Sugar and Carbon Dioxide</b></font></div>
        <font size="+1"><br>
          Some biodegradable plastics could in the future be made using
          sugar and carbon dioxide, replacing unsustainable plastics
          made from crude oil, following research by scientists from the
          Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies (CSCT) at the
          University of Bath.<br>
          <br>
          Polycarbonate is used to make drinks bottles, lenses for
          glasses and in scratch-resistant coatings for phones, CDs and
          DVDs... Current manufacture processes for polycarbonate use
          BPA (banned from use in baby bottles) and highly toxic
          phosgene, used as a chemical weapon in World War One... Bath
          scientists have made alternative polycarbonates from sugars
          and carbon dioxide in a new process that also uses low
          pressures and room temperature, making it cheaper and safer to
          produce... This new type of polycarbonate can be biodegraded
          back into carbon dioxide and sugar using enzymes from soil
          bacteria... This new plastic is bio-compatible so could in the
          future be used for medical implants or as scaffolds for
          growing replacement organs for transplant<br>
          <br>
          Polycarbonates from sugars offer a more sustainable
          alternative to traditional polycarbonate from BPA, however the
          process uses a highly toxic chemical called phosgene. Now
          scientists at Bath have developed a much safer, even more
          sustainable alternative which adds carbon dioxide to the sugar
          at low pressures and at room temperature.<br>
          <br>
          The resulting plastic has similar physical properties to those
          derived from petrochemicals, being strong, transparent and
          scratch-resistant. The crucial difference is that they can be
          degraded back into carbon dioxide and sugar using the enzymes
          found in soil bacteria.<br>
          <br>
          The new BPA-free plastic could potentially replace current
          polycarbonates in items such as baby bottles and food
          containers, and since the plastic is bio-compatible, it could
          also be used for medical implants or as scaffolds for growing
          tissues or organs for transplant.<br>
          <br>
          Dr Antoine Buchard, Whorrod Research Fellow in the
          University's Department of Chemistry, said: "With an
          ever-growing population, there is an increasing demand for
          plastics. This new plastic is a renewable alternative to
          fossil-fuel based polymers, potentially inexpensive, and,
          because it is biodegradable, will not contribute to growing
          ocean and landfill waste.<br>
          <br>
          "Our process uses carbon dioxide instead of the highly toxic
          chemical phosgene, and produces a plastic that is free from
          BPA, so not only is the plastic safer, but the manufacture
          process is cleaner too."<br>
          <br>
          Dr Buchard and his team at the Centre for Sustainable Chemical
          Technologies, published their work in a series of articles in
          the journals Polymer Chemistry and Macromolecules.<br>
          <br>
          In particular, they used nature as inspiration for the
          process, using the sugar found in DNA called thymidine as a
          building block to make a novel polycarbonate plastic with a
          lot of potential.<br>
          <br>
          PhD student and first author of the articles, Georgina
          Gregory, explained: "Thymidine is one of the units that makes
          up DNA. Because it is already present in the body, it means
          this plastic will be bio-compatible and can be used safely for
          tissue engineering applications.<br>
          <br>
          "The properties of this new plastic can be fine-tuned by
          tweaking the chemical structure -- for example we can make the
          plastic positively charged so that cells can stick to it,
          making it useful as a scaffold for tissue engineering." Such
          tissue engineering work has already started in collaboration
          with Dr Ram Sharma from Chemical Engineering, also part of the
          CSCT.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers have also looked at using other sugars such as
          ribose and mannose. Dr Buchard added: "Chemists have 100
          years' experience with using petrochemicals as a raw material
          so we need to start again using renewable feedstocks like
          sugars as a base for synthetic but sustainable materials. It's
          early days, but the future looks promising."<br>

          <br>
          Bio-based aliphatic polycarbonates (APCs) are attractive
          synthetic materials for biomedical applications because of
          their biodegradabilty and biocompatability properties. A high
          yielding 3-step process that utilises CO2 as a C1 synthon is
          presented for converting raw sugar, 2-deoxy-D-ribose into a
          novel 6-membered cyclic carbonate for ring-opening
          polymerisation (ROP) into carbohydrate-based APCs. The a- and
          ß-anomers of the monomer could be isolated and revealed very
          different polymerisability, as rationalised by DFT
          calculations. Whereas the ß-anomer could not be polymerised
          under the conditions tested, organocatalytic
          homopolymerisation of the a-anomer, in solution at room
          temperature (rt) or under melt conditions, yielded highly
          insoluble polycarbonates, composed of both cyclic and linear
          topologies, and exhibiting a glass transition temperature (Tg)
          of ~58 °C. Random copolymers with controllable incorporation
          of this new sugar monomer were prepared with trimethylene
          carbonate (TMC) at rt in the bulk or in solution with Mn up to
          64 000 g mol-1. With increasing sugar content, the Tg values
          of the copolymers increased and their thermal degradability
          was enhanced, giving access to a new class of APCs with
          tailored properties.<br>

          As you’ll probably have seen from this morning’s headlines, UK
          researchers running a clinical trial have presented some
          exciting preliminary results at a the tenth European Breast
          Cancer Conference.<br>
          <br>
          The trial looked at the effects of combining two drugs –
          trastuzumab (Herceptin) and lapatinib –before surgery, in
          women with HER2 positive breast cancer.<br>
          <br>
          Called EPHOS B, the trial was led by UK researchers in London
          and Manchester, and funded by CRUK.<br>
          <br>
          So what did these early results show, and why the excitement?<br>
          <br>
          <b>The pre-trial setting</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          When a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer, it is generally
          classified as one of a number of subtypes. One of these is
          called ‘HER2 positive’ breast cancer, because the cancer cells
          have large amounts of a molecule called HER2 on their surface.<br>
          <br>
          This means they’re more likely to respond to drugs designed to
          target this molecule – including both trastuzumab and
          lapatinib.<br>
          <br>
          The treatment these women are offered depends on a number of
          things, such as the stage of their breast cancer, whether they
          are pre- or post-menopausal and their all-round general
          health.<br>
          <br>
          Some HER2 positive patients have chemotherapy with or without
          trastuzumab (Herceptin) right away, to try and shrink their
          tumour before surgery. Then after surgery, these women may
          have more chemotherapy and maybe Herceptin to help stop the
          cancer coming back.<br>
          <br>
          Other women are scheduled to have surgery first, and are then
          given an extensive course of chemotherapy combined with
          Herceptin. Again, this is to help stop the cancer returning.<br>
          <br>
          It’s this second group that the EPHOS B trial looked at.<br>
          <br>
          <b>The trial</b><br>
          <br>
          EPHOS B included 257 women who had been diagnosed with HER2
          positive breast cancer and were waiting to have surgery.<br>
          <br>
          It was run in two parts. In the first, 130 women were assigned
          to one of three groups – some received Herceptin
          (trastuzumab), others received lapatinib. Both these groups
          were treated for 11 days after diagnosis and before surgery. A
          third group received no drug treatment before surgery (the
          control group).<br>
          <br>
          But, as often happens in science, other evidence became
          available during the trial which showed that giving both drugs
          together was better than either alone.<br>
          <br>
          So the researchers changed tack. The next 127 women recruited
          to the trial were assigned to either a control group, a
          Herceptin only group, or group given a combination of
          Herceptin and lapatinib.<br>
          <br>
          Following their initial treatment, all women involved in the
          trial went on to have standard care, including surgery.<br>
          <b><br>

          After surgery, the researchers analysed the resulting tissue
          to see if there was a difference between the various groups.
          They measured a variety of things in each sample, including
          hallmarks of cell death and cell growth, and the size of any
          remaining tumour tissue.<br>
          <br>
          Excitingly, in tissue from seven of the 66 women who had the
          combination treatment they saw what, in medical terms, is
          known as a ‘pathological complete response’.<br>
          <br>
          In non-medical terms, their tumours had gone.<br>
          <br>
          And for another 11 women the drug combination shrank their
          tumour considerably – these women are described as having
          minimal residual disease – in other words, there were only
          microscopic traces of the disease left over after treatment.<br>
          <br>
          It’s important to remember that while this generally suggests
          a treatment has worked well, it also means there are still
          cancer cells remaining from which the disease could grow back.<br>
          <br>
          This is especially important because HER2 positive breast
          cancer is more likely to come back after treatment than some
          other types of breast cancer.<br>
          <br>
          But nevertheless, these are exciting results, particularly
          when you consider that women with Stage 2 cancer – where the
          cancer had spread to the lymph nodes – were among those who
          responded to the combination therapy.<br>
          <br>
          They’re also exciting when compared to the other groups in the
          trial. No women given trastuzumab only, or no drug treatment,
          had a complete response, while only one woman in the
          trastuzumab-only group had minimal residual disease.<br>
          <br>
          It’s also important to remember that the researchers didn’t
          see any response in the other 48 women who received the drug
          combination. Clearly, there’s something different about some
          HER2 positive tumours that makes them exquisitely sensitive to
          the drug combination.<br>
          <br>
          <b>The next steps</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          These results indicate that there’s a group of HER2 positive
          breast cancer patients who are likely to derive big benefits
          from receiving trastuzumab and lapatinib, and the researchers
          running the trial think these same women may not need
          chemotherapy after surgery.<br>
          <br>
          But it’s too early to say this for sure – this needs to be
          confirmed with longer follow-up and larger clinical trials.
          And this needs to answer two key questions.<br>
          <br>
          First, researchers and doctors have to come up with a way of
          identifying those women who are more sensitive to pre-surgery
          treatment.<br>
          <br>
          Following this, they will need to run clinical trials to see
          if these women really can avoid chemotherapy treatment and if
          the current standard of care for some HER2 positive breast
          cancer patients can and should be changed.<br>
          <br>
          It’s certainly one to keep an eye on.<br>

              'dramatically' in 11 days</b></font><br>

        <font size="+1"><br>
          A pair of drugs can dramatically shrink and eliminate some
          breast cancers in just 11 days, UK doctors have shown.<br>
          <br>
          They said the "surprise" findings, reported at the European
          Breast Cancer Conference, could mean some women no longer need
          chemotherapy.<br>
          <br>
          The drugs, tested on 257 women, target a specific weakness
          found in one-in-ten breast cancers.<br>
          <br>
          Experts said the findings were a "stepping stone" to tailored
          cancer care.<br>
          <br>
          The doctors leading the trial had not expected or even
          intended to achieve such striking results.<br>
          <br>
          They were investigating how drugs changed cancers in the short
          window between a tumour being diagnosed and the operation to
          remove it.<br>
          <br>
          But by the time surgeons came to operate, there was no sign of
          cancer in some patients.<br>
          <br>
          Prof Judith Bliss, from the Institute of Cancer Research in
          London, said the impact was "dramatic".<br>
          <br>
          She told the BBC News website: "We were particularly surprised
          by these findings as this was a short-term trial.<br>
          <br>
          "It became apparent some had a complete response. It's
          absolutely intriguing, it is so fast."<br>
          <br>
          The drugs were lapatinib and trastuzumab, which is more widely
          known as Herceptin.<br>
          <br>
          They both target HER2 - a protein that fuels the growth of
          some women's breast cancers.<br>
          <br>
          Herceptin works on the surface of cancerous cells while
          lapatinib is able to penetrate inside the cell to disable
          HER2.<br>
          <br>
          The study, which also took place at NHS hospitals in
          Manchester, gave the treatment to women with tumours measuring
          between 1 and 3cm.<br>
          <br>
          In less than two weeks of treatment, the cancer disappeared
          entirely in 11% of cases, and in a further 17% they were
          smaller than 5mm.<br>
          <br>
          Current therapy for HER2 positive breast cancers is surgery,
          followed by chemotherapy and Herceptin.<br>
          <br>
          But Prof Bliss believes the findings could eventually mean
          some women do not need chemotherapy.<br>
          <br>
          However, that will require larger studies especially as HER2
          positive cancers have a higher risk of coming back.<br>
          <br>
          "We would have to be very clear we're not taking a backwards
          step and increasing the risk of relapse," Prof Bliss added.<br>
          <br>
          Baroness Delyth Morgan, the chief executive at Breast Cancer
          Now, said: "We hope this particularly impressive combination
          trial will serve as a stepping stone to an era of more
          personalised treatment for HER2 positive breast cancer.<br>
          <br>
          "Such a rapid response to treatment could soon give doctors
          the unprecedented ability to identify women responding so well
          that they would not need gruelling chemotherapy."<br>
          <br>
          Breast cancer is now thought of as at least ten separate
          diseases, each with a different cause, life expectancy and
          needing a different treatment.<br>
          <br>
          Matching the specific errors in a tumour to targeted drugs is
          considered the future of cancer medicine.<br>
          <br>
          Breast cancers, and particularly HER2 positive tumours, are at
          the forefront of this revolution in treatment.<br>
          <br>
          Prof Arnie Purushotham, from Cancer Research UK which funded
          the study, said: "These results are very promising if they
          stand up in the long run, and could be the starting step of
          finding a new way to treat HER2 positive breast cancers."<br>

          School of Medicine’s biochemistry department team, in
          partnership with Q2 Pharma, to develop antivirulence agents
          that disarm bacteria of deadly toxins<br>
          <br>
          Case Western Reserve University and Q2 Pharma Ltd., an Israeli
          biopharmaceutical company, have signed a two-year option to
          license small molecule, antivirulence technology with the
          potential to treat bacterial infections such as
          methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Use of
          these novel agents in patients could revolutionize the
          treatment of bacterial infections.<br>
          <br>
          “Superbugs” are bacteria that have developed resistance to
          antibiotics for which current antibiotics are no longer
          effective. Ever-increasing antibiotic resistance endangers
          patients as doctors run out of treatment options.<br>
          <br>
          The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report
          that more than two million people develop antibiotic-resistant
          infections in the U.S. every year, leading to 23,000 deaths.
          Some experts say that without new inroads, the death toll
          could top that from cancer or heart disease by 2050. The
          financial costs are already enormous: as much as $20 billion
          in extra health care spending annually.<br>
          <br>
          “Superbugs threaten to undo many of the enormous health
          advances brought about by the development of antibiotics since
          penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928,” said
          Menachem Shoham, associate professor of biochemistry at CWRU
          School of Medicine, the scientist at the heart of the new
          effort. “Our work represents a game changer to address this
          mounting problem.” <br>
          <br>
          Shoham and his research team have discovered and patented
          non-antibiotic antivirulence compounds that prevent
          disease-causing toxins from forming in gram-positive bacteria
          such as MRSA. Since the antivirulent compounds don’t
          jeopardize the survival of the bacteria, resistance isn’t
          likely to occur, and has not been observed to date.<br>
          <br>
          One of the Shoham team’s small-molecule compounds, named F19,
          was effective in healing a MRSA skin infection in mice, and in
          combination with an otherwise ineffective antibiotic, also
          reduced bacterial presence in the wounds. F19 has also
          demonstrated effectiveness against other gram positive
          “Superbugs,” including the deadly Clostridium difficile (C.
          diff.), Bacillus anthracis (the causative agent of anthrax),
          Staphylococcus epidermidis typically infecting catheters and
          implants, Streptococcus pyogenes (the causative agent of strep
          throat) and Streptococcus pneumoniae, one of the causes of
          acquired pneumonia and meningitis.<br>
          <br>
          F19 works by binding to a protein involved in expressing
          disease-causing toxins, thus preventing the bacteria from
          producing the toxins. Without the toxins, the bacteria are
          benign. F19 also blocks the formation of biofilms—the slimy
          shells that bacteria encase themselves with for protection and
          which antibacterial drugs can’t penetrate.<br>
          <br>
          “By killing bacterial pathogens, antibiotics eventually induce
          the organism to develop resistance,” said Shoham. “This is the
          case with once-highly-effective antibiotics such as
          penicillin. In contrast, our antivirulence agents strip the
          bacteria pathogen of its ability to produce harmful toxins
          without killing the pathogen. This results in little, if any,
          need to develop resistance. Without the toxins, the bacteria
          remain harmless, so people can go about their lives without
          any sign of disease.”<br>
          <br>
          While bacterial infections could be cured by anti-virulence
          agents such as F19 without the need for antibiotics, in severe
          cases or for immunocompromised patients, combination therapy
          with a low-dose antibiotic may be appropriate. “The potential
          drugs we developed have the additional benefit of enabling the
          use of ‘old’ antibiotics in combination therapy,” said
          Shoham...<br>
