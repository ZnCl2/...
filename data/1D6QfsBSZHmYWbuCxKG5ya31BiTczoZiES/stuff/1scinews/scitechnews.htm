      <br>
      My first steps on the Orgonite trail took place in Spring 2008,
      when I
      decided to distribute the mysterious ‘pucks’ of resin, metal and
      crystal among friends with allotments and gardens. The resultant,
      and
      unexpected, vegetable growth (FT249:24) only served to send me
      further
      down the path. Orgonite is a recent invention building on the
      concept
      of Dr Wilhelm Reich’s Orgone Accumulator, a device he believed
      stored
      and concentrated positive energy (see FT107:26–30). The Orgonite
      pucks
      are solid-state versions of the same concept which are intended to
      take
      in negative energies and emit positive ones.<br>
      <br>
      In 2009, I decided to find out more about how this simple
      composite
      mat­erial – made from aluminium shavings, resin and a crystal –
      functioned when used by a wider group of people. Was there some
      person-specific phenom­enon which massively accelerated plant
      growth, resulting in giant vege­tables? Or was the motive force
      provided by the Orgonite itself, somehow acting on the
      environment?<br>
      <br>
      A very informal trial was set up locally in Brighton, in
      conjunction
      with EcoLogicCool, a small shop specialising in power-saving and
      energy
      management hardware as well as recycled gifts. Shop owner Jake
      Greene
      was “up for it” as an experiment, and – although he had no
      investment
      in the project – was happy to humour me by placing a puck with
      each of
      the two palm plants in the store. The shop would simply be acting
      as a
      central distribution point for the Orgonite, as well as for the
      disposable 24-shot cameras offered as a documentation tool for
      those
      who didn’t have digital cameras or suitably equipped mobile
      phones.<br>
      <br>
      A questionnaire was prepared beforehand, which the participants
      had to
      fill out, covering a range of topics from gardening skills to
      paranormal belief. They were then handed either one or two ‘tower
      buster’ (TB) Orgonite pucks, depending on the size of their
      gardens,
      with an estimated effect radius of 3–4.5m for plants when buried
      in the
      ground. People without allotments or gardens were still welcomed
      and
      told to use potted plants to see the effects.<br>
      <br>
      Word of mouth acted as an initial call for participants, and this
      was
      followed by a nationally distributed press release announcing the
      trial. Participants ranged from keen gardeners to weekend
      dabblers,
      from members of the clergy to local police officers, each taking
      away
      one or two of the TBs. Strangely, the Green Party, who had a stall
      set
      up nearby to attract new members, seemed to resist offers to join
      in
      the free trial, which would have required no more than simply
      walking
      the short block to “EcoLogicCool”.<br>
      <br>
      With the trial being covered twice on BBC Sussex – the prime 7.30
      morning slot and a specialist Sunday gardening show – the range
      was
      extended to include keen gardeners outside Brighton, with even the
      BBC’s local morning team joining in the experiment. One specific
      invitation was to people with ‘brown thumbs’ – those who seem to
      kill
      any plant they’re given. This would hopefully demonstrate whether
      some
      psi elements were at work, as similar interference on
      psycho­tronic
      hardware had been reported in past tests.<br>
      <br>
      The number of TB pucks given out locally was close to 100, with
      half
      being funded by me as part of a longer and more detailed research
      project with Black Ice magazine, and the other half kindly donated
      by
      the supplier at www.whale.to. One of the earliest results came
      back
      from G Davies, a gard­ener with a polytunnel greenhouse, who had
      already started growing her green beans. She commented that she
      “was
      eating runner beans 31st of May” from her allotment, very much
      earlier
      than expected.<br>
      <br>
      The use of Orgonite in gardening had also sparked the interest of
      organisers at the Liverpool Biennial after a couple of TBs were
      given
      out during a lecture at the city’s Made Up Weekend, both of which
      produced extreme growth increases on indoor potted plants. These
      personal results led to setting up a further two-part lecture and
      trial
      in Seaforth, using the same methodology as in the local Brighton
      trials. TBs were purchased and a box donated by the maker. About
      20
      locals arrived, and with the exception of one paranoid individual
      attempting to derail the lecture (before the bulk of the audience
      turned on him), the take-up was exceptional, clearing out all the
      TBs
      and the 25 or so disposable cameras.<br>
      <br>
      Another piece of early evidence could literally be seen in my
      backyard
      on my return from Liverpool. Given that I have no access to the
      basement flat’s backyard, I had simply thrown a couple of pucks
      out of
      the bathroom window during the summer of 2008. Over that summer,
      the
      hedges on both sides of the property grew like mad and were
      noticeably
      much larger than in previous years. Finally, both sides got so
      tall
      that the landlord had to have them cut down by a professional; the
      resulting cutback was so severe that the landlord thought the
      hedges
      had been killed. Gazing out the window now, it struck me that not
      only
      were the hedges not dead, they had in fact grown back to the point
      that
      the one on the left side was close to covering half the yard.<br>
      <br>
      This dramatic growth spurt is compar­able to that of the hazel
      tree
      reported by M Rogers of Shoreham (FT249:24), who continues to get
      reliable growth from a grapevine “that used to produce these
      bitter
      little peas and for the second year running is producing a
      vineyard in
      my greenhouse”.<br>
      <br>
      The initial press release sent out at the end of March 2009 spread
      far
      and wide, appearing on a range of news websites, with five pages
      of
      results on Google and a Digg entry. One surprising appearance,
      becoming
      the basis for a 340+ page thread, was on the David Icke forum
      where
      people who have experience with Orgonite are sharing reports and
      photos
      of their own Orgonite creations. Multiple attempts have been made
      by a
      few posters to derail the thread, which has now been made ‘sticky’
      (i.e. can’t be deleted). Such posters are always countered with
      lucid
      arguments and observations by those on the forum with hands-on
      experience. These include a curious result with freezing water
      combined
      with Orgonite, producing stalagtites and highly visible vortex
      formations.<br>
      <br>
      P Gardner, who makes his own Orgon­ite, explained: “The ice thing
      seems to work 99 per cent of the time – only a couple of occasions
      out
      of many without noticeable results. Varying permutations of TBs –
      above/below/both – and contents of Orgonite – types of quartz,
      wire
      wraps etc – seem to have a noticeable difference on the
      form­ations
      produced.”<br>
      <br>
      Wanting some sort of explanation of how the Orgonite was affecting
      the
      water, he took a piece into a secondary school science department
      to
      get their take on it. “All were pretty flummoxed, agreeing that
      something was going on but they didn’t really know what,” he
      reports.<br>
      <br>
      Gardner has not pursued all the variations in the Orgonite
      material
      design, reasoning thus: “I now know it just does ‘work’. I don’t
      really
      feel the need to prove it to myself.” It’s a common reaction, and
      for
      many Orgonite users, following a season or two of except­ional
      plant growth, further ‘teasing out’ of the ‘why’ isn’t needed.<br>
      <br>
      Other observations of Orgonite effects are being reported. One
      active
      poster, Natalie in the US, commented that she has “noticed
      Orgonite
      makes a positive effect on my mood as well as my energy level.
      Placing
      Orgonite on my incoming power supply has also decreased my
      electrical
      usage and expenses! Also sleeping near small pieces of Orgonite is
      improving my quality of sleep. I sent some Orgonite to two family
      members who also confirm that it is improving their sleep. One has
      had
      chronic insomnia in the past and now takes the Orgonite everywhere
      he
      travels to insure a good night’s sleep!”<br>
      <br>
      These subjective physiological reports continue to be scattered
      among
      the collected anecdotes concerning Orgonite effects. B Harrison in
      Lancashire was mailed two pieces in order to reproduce the basic
      seed
      germination tests. Instead, he pursued his own test on himself,
      having
      suffered from chronic leg pain and numbness for some time,
      possibly due
      to a cartilage issue. He simply put a TB in his trouser pocket and
      within two weeks the long-running pain was gone. He then repeated
      this
      experiment on a Manchester-based friend with a similar leg
      complaint;
      likewise, the condition cleared up.<br>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3">BALTIMORE, Apr 13,
          2010
          (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Alkane, Inc. (ALKN.PK) announced today it
          has filed
          for a patent for a newly developed synthetic fuel for use as
          an
          additive, blend or fuel in gasoline powered engines. The fuel
          is not
          petroleum based, so it requires no crude oil to produce. It
          delivers
          more power to the engine than gasoline and is expected to
          produce
          significantly less heat.<br>
          <br>
          The technology behind the fuel produces unconventional
          combustion in an
          internal combustion engine. This results in as much as 18
          times the
          momentum imparted to an engine as compared to the combustion
          wave that
          occurs when fueled by gasoline. Effectively, this fuel
          enhances
          mechanical energy output from an engine.<br>
          <br>
          "The ability to enhance mechanical energy output from an
          internal
          combustion engine is groundbreaking," said Mathew Zuckerman,
          Ph.D., CEO
          &amp; President of Alkane. "The internal combustion engine of
          today
          still works on the basic pioneering work of Nicolaus Otto's
          original
          invention in 1854. The fuel is burned and up to 75% goes into
          waste
          heat, while only approximately 25% is converted to mechanical
          energy.
          Our new fuel creates no such waste heat during combustion, but
          rather
          all of its energy is useful as mechanical energy in the
          engine. This
          will truly be a revolutionary innovation."<br>
          <br>
          "America needs to develop products like our flagship product,
          Monster
          Diesel, and our new synthetic fuel, that promise to multiply
          the
          usefulness of our domestic reserves of energy," said Lou
          Petrucci, Vice
          President of Sales &amp; Marketing for the company. "America
          faces
          increased competition from other countries for sources of
          energy to
          fuel our economy and increase our standard of living. We have
          the
          answer."<br>

          How does it work? The Professor says that "it’s a high-force
          steam
          cavitation explosion." Most bombardier species generate it by
          mixing
          hydroquinone, hydrogen peroxide, and some catalysts. When the
          juice
          hits air, "it volatizes instantly… generating a puff of
          ’smoke’ and an
          audible popping sound."<br>

        </span>-- A method and apparatus is disclosed for ejecting
        material.
        The ejected material is ejected as liquid and/or liquid vapour
        via an
        explosive process which can provide a very fast ejection as well
        as an
        ejection which has a large throw. The material can be water or
        other
        fire suppressant material to provide a successful fire

        </font><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      </div>
      <br>
      <font face="verdana" size="2">Scientists with Ceramatec, the
        research
        and development arm of CoorsTek, say that they have developed a
        new
        kind of deep-storage battery that, when coupled with on-site
        power
        generation mechanisms like wind and solar electricity, could
        power an
        entire home for only pennies per kilowatt hour.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font face="verdana" size="2">Most wind and solar-powered homes
        remain
        connected to the national electric grid, largely because it is
        difficult and expensive to install batteries large enough to
        keep the
        house powered through low wind or sun periods. Ceramatec's new
        battery,
        however, uses solid materials to store between 20 and 40
        kilowatt hours
        of electricity at temperatures of only 90 degrees Celsius. In
        contrast,
        most high-density batteries use liquids heated to dangerous
        temperatures of roughly 600 degrees.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font face="verdana" size="2">The batteries are currently being
        tested
        to see how many charge-discharge cycles they can support
        throughout
        their lifetimes. Currently the batteries have made it through
        200 and
        are still going strong, and the scientists estimate a lifespan
        of 3,650
        cycles -- or one cycle every day for 10 years. Since each
        battery costs
        approximately $2,000, this would translate into a cost of only
        three
        cents per kilowatt hour -- in contrast to the eight cents per
        kilowatt
        hour charged by the typical electric company.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font face="verdana" size="2">The battery can release electricity
        at a
        continuous rate of five kilowatts for a period of four hours.
        This
        would be enough to power a vacuum cleaner, stereo, sewing
        machine,
        trash compactor, food processor, thirty-three 60-watt light
        bulbs and
        one electric stovetop burner.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font face="verdana" size="2">Batteries such as these, matching
        high
        capacity with low cost, have the potential to revolutionize the
        field
        of home-generated electricity, perhaps even rendering centrally
        generated power obsolete.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font face="verdana" size="2">"This changes the whole scope of
        things
        and would have a major impact on what we're trying to do," said
        Clyde
        Shepherd of Alpine, Utah, whose home is powered by two
        windmills.
        "Something that would provide 20 kilowatts would put us near 100
        percent of what we would need to be completely independent. It
        would
        save literally thousands of dollars a year."</font><br>

research

      </div>
      <br>
      Japanese farming lore has long observed that plentiful mushroom
      harvests tend to follow thunderstorms. Now researchers at Iwate
      University in northern Japan have confirmed the legend, finding
      that
      some mushrooms more than double their yields when jolted by
      electricity.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The results could lead to new harvesting methods that would
      significantly increase food production. That's good news for a
      Japanese
      food industry where mushrooms are a popular staple, and where
      around
      50,000 tons of mushrooms must be imported a year, mainly from
      China and
      South Korea, just to meet the high demand.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The study reached its conclusions after four years of bombarding
      mushrooms with artificially induced lightning, reports National
      Geographic. Ten varieties of mushroom were tested, and eight of
      those
      species responded by growing at an increased rate when
      electrified. The
      fungi reacted best when exposed to between 50,000 and 100,000
      volts for
      one ten-millionth of a second.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Researchers were able to get the shiitake crop to yield double the
      amount usually harvested, but the best performing species were
      nameko
      mushrooms, which produced a whopping 80 percent more mushrooms.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      As for why the mushrooms multiply when powered by lightning,
      researchers can only hypothesize at this point. But it's possible
      the
      mushrooms are giving themselves a reproductive boost in response
      to
      danger, said Yuichi Sakamoto, one of the study's chief
      researchers.
      Initially, the mushrooms are damaged by the electrical bursts, but
      they
      compensate quickly by increasing protein and enzyme secretion.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The next step for researchers is to develop machines for farmers
      that
      can deliver carefully controlled lightning-like bursts to their
      mushroom harvests. "We want to collaborate with commercial
      mushroom
      farmers and eventually commercialize this technology," said Koichi
      Takaki, an associate professor in engineering at Iwate University.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The prospects are so good that the Iwate team is testing to see if
      other crops also respond to lightning in this way. So far, radish,
      rapeseed, beans and some varieties of lily are showing increased
      growth
      rates when the proper electric current is applied.<br>

          inventors
          test energy saving engine&nbsp;
          - Lipika-Kanishk team await Tata motors nod

      <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">by <br>

      <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Santosh Singh
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Patna, Dec. 24: A young couple from Patna have invented an
        energy-saving
        engine, at a cost of Rs 35,000, which can run without petrol or
        diesel
        and can last for a 4.5-lakh kilometre run.
      </p>
      <p>Kanishk and Lipika Sinha are a wife-husband team of inventors
        of the
        fuel-free engine that they invented some three years ago.
        Kanishk Sinha
        recently got the engine patented (1077/Del/2005) with BigPatents
        India,
        a body supported by the Ford Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>The duo today carried out a demonstration by running a bicycle
        with
        the engine. Though the mechanic who ran it seemed tad afraid of
        its
        speed
        at first, later he managed an effective demonstration.
      </p>
      <p>The young inventors have completed their MSc in physics from
        Northeastern
        Hill University, Shillong. They carried out a research for three
        to
        four
        years before concluding that a “chemical reaction with pure
        oxygen”
        causes
        Q energy to run a dynamo.
      </p>
      <p>“The vehicle made to run without conventional form of fuel is
        based
        on the law of interconvertible energy which states that total
        energy in
        an isolated system is conserved and can neither be created nor
        destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>“The motor created by us has a power range of 40-50MW, good
        enough
        to
        meet the needs of a four-wheeler,” explained Lipika.
      </p>
      <p>The inventors added that an engine would cost Rs 35,000 and can
        be
        refilled
        for Rs 10,000. Any four-wheeler could be fitted with the
        eco-friendly
        fuel-free
        engine. Though both claimed that there are thin chances of an
        engine
        breakdown,
        the husband-wife team have taken it upon themselves to train
        engineers
        and mechanics and place the engines in towns across Bihar and
        Bengal.
      </p>
      <p>“We received a proposal from Tata Motors stating that they
        would
        like
        to give our invention a brand name and its service centres,”
        said
        Kanishk.
      </p>
      <p>He added that he would soon ink an agreement with Tata Motors
        for
        the
        manufacture of the patented engines for common use. “We just
        heard from
        a Tata Motors official called Ravikant regarding the decision,”
        said
        Kanishk.
      </p>
      <p>The engine has no exhaust pipes and thus it is pollution free.
        “Another
        strong feature is its suitability. It can bear the rough, tough
        and
        bumpy
        Bihar roads,” said the young man enthusiastically.
      </p>
      <p>“Hopefully our luck would turn if we collaborate with Tata
        Motors,”
        said Kanishk.
      </p>
      <p>Till that happens and their engines start their magic, the
        young
        inventors
        are happy supporting themselves by running a restaurant at
        Ashiana
        Nagar
        here.<br>

          solutions for two problems that, for the last twenty years,

        Thanks to two technologies developed by Professor Benoît Marsan
        and his team at the Université du Québec à
        Montréal (UQAM) Chemistry Department, the scientific and
        commercial future of solar cells could be totally transformed.
        Professor Marsan has come up with solutions for two problems
        that, for
        the last twenty years, have been hampering the development of
        efficient
        and affordable solar cells.<br>
        <br>
        His findings have been published in two scientific journals, the
        Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS) and Nature
        Chemistry.<br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">The untapped potential of solar
          energy</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        The Earth receives more solar energy in one hour than the entire
        planet
        currently consumes in a year. Unfortunately, despite this
        enormous
        potential, solar energy is barely exploited. The electricity
        produced
        by conventional solar cells, composed of semiconductor materials
        like
        silicon, is 5 or 6 times more expensive than from traditional
        energy
        sources, such as fossil fuels or hydropower. Over the years,
        numerous
        research teams have attempted to develop a solar cell that would
        be
        both efficient in terms of energy and inexpensive to produce.<br>

          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        One of the most promising solar cells was designed in the early
        '90s by
        Professor Michael Graetzel of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale
        de
        Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland. Based on the principle of
        photosynthesis -- the biochemical process by which plants
        convert light
        energy into carbohydrate (sugar, their food) -- the Graetzel
        solar cell
        is composed of a porous layer of nanoparticles of a white
        pigment,
        titanium dioxide, covered with a molecular dye that absorbs
        sunlight,
        like the chlorophyll in green leaves. The pigment-coated
        titanium
        dioxide is immersed in an electrolyte solution, and a
        platinum-based
        catalyst completes the package.<br>
        <br>
        As in a conventional electrochemical cell (such as an alkaline
        battery), two electrodes (the titanium dioxide anode and the
        platinum
        cathode in the Graetzel cell) are placed on either side of a
        liquid
        conductor (the electrolyte). Sunlight passes through the cathode
        and
        the electrolyte, and then withdraws electrons from the titanium
        dioxide
        anode, a semiconductor at the bottom of the cell. These
        electrons
        travel through a wire from the anode to the cathode, creating an
        electrical current. In this way, energy from the sun is
        converted into
        electricity.<br>
        <br>
        Most of the materials used to make this cell are low-cost, easy
        to
        manufacture and flexible, allowing them to be integrated into a
        wide
        variety of objects and materials. In theory, the Graetzel solar
        cell
        has tremendous possibilities. Unfortunately, despite the
        excellence of
        the concept, this type of cell has two major problems that have
        prevented its large-scale commercialisation:<br>
        <br>
        The electrolyte is: a) extremely corrosive, resulting in a lack
        of
        durability; b) densely coloured, preventing the efficient
        passage of
        light; and c) limits the device photovoltage to 0.7 volts.<br>
        <br>
        The cathode is covered with platinum, a material that is
        expensive,
        non-transparent and rare. Despite numerous attempts, until
        Professor
        Marsan's recent contribution, no one had been able to find a
        satisfactory solution to these problems.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Professor Marsan's solutions</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        Professor Marsan and his team have been working for several
        years on
        the design of an electrochemical solar cell. His work has
        involved
        novel technologies, for which he has received numerous patents.
        In
        considering the problems of the cell developed by his Swiss
        colleague,
        Professor Marsan realized that two of the technologies developed
        for
        the electrochemical cell could also be applied to the Graetzel
        solar
        cell, specifically:<br>
        <br>
        For the electrolyte, entirely new molecules have been created in
        the
        laboratory whose concentration has been increased through the
        contribution of Professor Livain Breau, also of the Chemistry
        Department. The resulting liquid or gel is transparent and
        non-corrosive and can increase the photovoltage, thus improving
        the
        cell's output and stability.<br>
        <br>
        For the cathode, the platinum can be replaced by cobalt
        sulphide, which
        is far less expensive. It is also more efficient, more stable
        and
        easier to produce in the laboratory.<br>
