goes to my colleague Tony Boys for </FONT>providing important

surround the FNPP#1 and block radiation from leaking into the ocean.
Note that the site is built on low altitude, soft “fill” soil
directly next to the ocean, and directly over an underground

author of the CNIC report on contaminated water, Nobuko Tanimura,
makes these points:</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<P ><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>*
Tepco's “underground water bypass system” is preventing only
between 1 - 10 percent of the underground water from entering and
becoming contaminated at the reactor site. In other words, the effort
is highly ineffective (picture Laurel and Hardy wearing rubber boots
and tripping over each other while swishing mops in the air).</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<P ><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>*
The contaminated water that is being captured will soon amount to one
million tons being stored in above ground tanks at the Fukushima
site.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<P ><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>*
Because of the near non-viability of this approach, the “Frozen
Earth Barrier” was conceived and implemented. This is a complicated
engineering task that is still under construction and has encountered
many technical problems.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

extolling the superiority of the frozen earth barrier, METI sources
state, ‘These efforts to surround the buildings on the inland side
over a long period with an impervious barrier using the frozen earth
method are a challenge with no precedent anywhere in the world, and
involve many technological problems. This should therefore not be
left to the company alone, but the government should take the
initiative, consider aiding R&amp;D, including that of other means of
control, and support its actualization.’ This indicates active
support from the government.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

government is justifying financial aid to TEPCO using the pretext of
a need to support R&amp;D because frozen earth barriers constitute an

ice wall was chosen for shady scientific reasons and quite likely
because Tepco could get further bail out money from the taxpayer. The
contradictory logic of Tepco, on the one hand to say the ice wall is
the best solution, while on the other that it is a
less-than-proven-experiment is illogical and dishonest.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<P ><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Tepco
was warned by other experts about the potential failure of the
project when it was initiated in June, 2014 (10). Why not implement
the simplest, cheapest, most effective idea to begin with, and in the
meantime carry out experiments with the ice wall to see if it could
work or be made to work? Tepco prefers an ad hoc, willy nilly
approach rather than a rigorous scientific one that would look at the
problem from every angle.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

mis-managing the contaminated water crisis. </FONT>Of course,
engineers and technocrats can have difficulty effectively
communicating to the general public, not an easy task due to the
complexity of the topic in relation to a scientifically dumbed down
populace. They prefer to hide behind technical jargon rather than
forthrightly explain the issues.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

contaminated water continues to pour into the ocean Tepco offers
gimmick solutions which seem futile (11). Incredibly, Tepco’s
convoluted approach reveals they carried out work projects on a

knew wouldn’t work” but did it anyhow! Who knows why, maybe they
needed to look busy or make sure taxpayer subsidies kept flowing,
until they actually figured out what to do. </FONT>By pouring
“hydro-cement” into the contaminated trench Tepco admits it will
“result in considerable worker exposures” to radiation. As one
commentator notes, the concrete “<FONT COLOR="#1a1a1a">could have
new consequences if it forces this flow of highly contaminated water
to take a different route rather than stopping it from flowing”

is another example of the way in which alternative energy is being
suppressed by the Nuclear Cartel and the Abe administration (13).
While this Japanese press article, “A losing bet on green energy”
tends to support the notion that the Japanese electricity grid can't
handle alternative energy because it is “too expensive,” if you
think about it such a thesis is just plain nonsensical, Orwellian
Nuclear DoubleSpeak. Big Oil &amp; Big Nuclear always whine and
whimper that alternative energy is “too expensive,” because they
never internalize the costs of the highly destructive wars,
ecological disasters and pollution they cause in their product
pricing. The real problem is that abundant solar energy that is
already available and is simply not being accommodated for by the
utility companies (like Tepco) because they don't want to abandon
their vice-grip control over energy profits.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

Post script: The Iraq war was not a “war for oil” as many on the
Left have claimed, but was a war organized and implemented by the
Zionist Neo-Cons on behalf of Israel. Surely oil and many other
factors played a role in the war's implementation but oil company
executives were not the primary cheerleaders for the 2003 invasion,
whereas the Israel Lobby was (see: James Petras: Zion-power and War:
From Iraq to Iran, The Deadly Embrace).</FONT></FONT></FONT>
