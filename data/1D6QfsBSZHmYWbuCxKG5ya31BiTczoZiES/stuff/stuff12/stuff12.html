      <div align="center"><b>Oxytocin helps to better overcome fear</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Frightening experiences do not quickly fade from memory. A
      team of researchers under the guidance of the University of Bonn
      Hospital has now been able to demonstrate in a study that the
      bonding hormone oxytocin inhibits the fear center in the brain and
      allows fear stimuli to subside more easily. This basic research
      could also usher in a new era in the treatment of anxiety
      disorders. The study has already appeared in advance online in the
      journal Biological Psychiatry. The print edition will be available
      in a few weeks.<br>
      <br>
      Significant fear becomes deeply entrenched in memory. Following a
      car accident, for example, it is difficult to manage street
      traffic once again -- even screeching tires can evoke significant
      anxiety. Scientists refer to this as "conditioning." Certain
      images or noises are very closely intertwined in the brain with
      the experience of pain or fear. Only gradually does one learn that
      not every screeching tire means danger. This active overwriting in
      the memory is known as "extinction." "In this process, however,
      the original contents of the memory are not erased but instead
      merely overlaid with positive experiences," explains Prof. Dr. Dr.
      René Hurlemann from the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy
      of the University of Bonn Hospital. If there are dangerous
      situations once again, the fear, which was believed to have been
      already overcome, frequently flares up once more.<br>
      <br>
      Extinction is often used in therapy for anxiety disorders. For
      example, a person suffering from a spider phobia will gradually
      and increasingly come face to face with spiders. First the patient
      has to view photos of spiders and then look at living examples
      until finally he holds a tarantula in his hand. When people with
      an anxiety disorder experience as frequently as possible the fact
      that they do not need to fear the trigger, their fear is reduced.
      "However, this can take a very long time, because this
      confrontation with the fearful situation frequently has to be
      experienced. In addition, there may be relapses because the
      original trace of fear is still anchored in the memory," reports
      Prof. Hurlemann. This is why therapists seek a possibility for
      "overwriting" the fearful memory in a faster and longer-lasting
      way.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Oxytocin facilitates overwriting of fearful experiences<br>
        <br>
      </b>It has been known for a long time that the hormone oxytocin
      does not just have a bonding effect in the mother-child
      relationship and in the case of sex partners but that it is also
      considered to be anxiolytic. The scientists at the Department of
      Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the University of Bonn, together
      with their colleagues from the German Cancer Research Center in
      Heidelberg and the University of Chengdu (China) have now been
      able to prove its helpful effect in overwriting fearful
      experiences. "Oxytocin actually reinforces extinction: Under its
      influence, the expectation of recurrent fear subsequently abates
      to a greater extent than without this messenger," says study
      director Prof. Hurlemann, summarizing the result.<br>
      <br>
      The team of scientists induced fear conditioning in a total of 62
      healthy male subjects. In the brain scanner, using video glasses,
      the test subjects viewed photos, for example of human faces. For
      70 percent of the images, they received a very brief, unpleasant
      electrical shock to the hand via electrodes. "In this way, certain
      images were associated with an experience of anxiety in the test
      subjects' memory," explains Prof. Hurlemann. The scientists used
      two methods to prove that this pairing of a particular photo and
      pain was actually anchored in the test subjects' brains: The
      expectation of an electrical shock was demonstrated by increased
      cold sweat which was measured via skin conductivity. In addition,
      the brain scans prove that the fear regions in the brain were
      always particularly active.<br>
      <br>
      Half of the test subjects received oxytocin via a nasal spray. The
      rest received a placebo. Then the extinction phase began in which
      the test persons were shown the same pictures several times as
      before but they no longer received electrical shocks. In the men
      under the influence of oxytocin, the amygdala, as the fear center
      in the brain, was overall far less active than in the control
      group, whereas fear-inhibiting regions were more stimulated. Over
      time, the messenger caused the fear to initially be somewhat
      greater but then it abated to a far greater extent than without
      oxytocin. The scientists explain this through the special effect
      of the messenger: "Oxytocin initially reinforces the test
      subjects' conscious impressions and thus the reaction to the
      electrical shock, yet after a few minutes, the anxiolytic effect
      prevails," explains Prof. Hurlemann.<br>
      <br>
      The scientists hope that anxiety patients can be helped more
      quickly with the aid of oxytocin and that a relapse can be better
      prevented. In addition, the researchers presume that the hormone
      likely facilitates bonding between the therapist and the patient
      and thus the success of the treatment. "However, this must first
      be demonstrated by clinical studies," says the scientist from the
      University of Bonn Hospital.<br>

      [peak expansion] to be seen in events of December 2017 through
      September of 2018. Climate shift into [ice age] continues in LT
      data through 2020 with a 'rising' emotional sum in [impact] and
      [duration] and [emotional intensity] within our array of
      temporally significant emotional values. However, LT data
      forecasts continuing [disturbances] to [global populace] through
      2041 before the [ice age] [climate/weather patterns] begin to
      [descend (in) purbutations (toward) regularity]. (11.24.2014)<br>

      <br>
      Yet another sinkhole. This one is triggering the language about
      [nuke plants] that [go dry] and become [dangerous] as the [rivers

      [fears (of TPTB/officialdom)] will be [visible] in temporal
      relation to [space aliens/UFO's]. (11/5/2014)<br>
      <br>
      Data sets within the SGFs entity are gaining new sub sets around
      the idea of a [breakthrough] in [understanding (of) time] that
      will have direct [impact] on multitudes of [business types]. The
      [breakthrough] is described as causing
      [strokes/headaches/bloat/bellyaches/fear shits] in the [military]
      and [academia]. In the sub sets for [academia] there are some

      and the [breakthrough] starts having impact in modelspace in
      Spring, 2015 (northern hemisphere) (11/5/2014)<br>
      <br>
      ST data shows that this [December] in [northern hemisphere] the
      [UFO/(daleks/machine-intelligences?)] will be [displaying] in an
      almost [preening fashion *(grooming?)] over [large swaths (of
      continents)]. The imagery in the detail layer suggest that this
      [display] will be [nearly unique] in UFO history in that it will
      be [involving (large bands)] across [whole continents].
      (10-14-2014)<br>
      <br>
      LT data types are suggesting that [November, 2015] will have
      [aware (??) humanity] being [actively/dynamically] involved with
      [multiple species] of [space aliens]. Further data sets point to a
      [fundamental (knowledge) revolution] that occurs [across popular
      understanding] in the first [half] of 2015 as [events (dalek?)]
      become [too blatant] to [collectively ignore]. A curious side
      effect of this set has huge levels of cross links back over to the
      [british criminal rulers (aka self claiming 'royals')] where
      [history] will be [revealed] that will [set the populace] against
      the [blood lines] at a [visceral/cellular] level. This [(near)
      xenophobic reaction] is described as [destroying] several
      [offshoots (of 'royals' bloodlines)] and also causing [near total
      breakdown] of the [BBC]. (10/16/2014)<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>In a recent study by Harvard University and the University of
      NSW, a new way to completely reverse aging in cells was revealed.
      This December 2013 study not only showed how the aging process can
      be slowed down but how you actually can make your cells younger.<br>
      <br>
      For a long time, we thought that aging was due to free radicals
      damaging our DNA. But David Sinclair, a Harvard Professor of
      Genetics and the principal researcher theorized that aging
      happened because the communication between the mitochondria and
      the nucleus inside the cells broke down. With the results of his
      research, the scientific evidence is there that his theory is
      correct. And, more importantly, the specific substance that
      improves communication between the nucleous and mitochondria was
      identified. This substance is called NAD.<br>
      <br>
      By giving 2 year old mice injections of NAD, in just weeks, the
      cells of the 2 year old mice reverted to that of 6 month old mice.
      The anti-aging effect on the mice is equivalent to the cells of a
      60 year old human reverting to that of a 20 year old.<br>
      <br>
      This breakthrough in science has made the amazing anti-aging
      benefits available to the general public. NIAGEN IS THE ONLY
      NATURAL OCCURRING COMPOUND KNOWN TO INCREASE THE LEVELS OF NAD
      (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide). No injections needed. By
      taking one simple pill, you too can see many benefits related to
      anti-aging.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Product Description<br>

      <br>
      They're often rutted and dangerous, but a Santa Fe business owner
      has a new technology that could forever change how road crews
      repair and maintain dirt roads.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, there's a certain beauty found in taking a road less
      traveled in New Mexico, but there's also a certain headache -- a
      teeth-ratting reminder why most dirt roads should be avoided.<br>
      <br>
      On the back roads of the Navajo Nation, that's almost always true.<br>
      <br>
      "There are a lot of struggles," Benjamin Bennett, the deputy
      director of the Navajo Nation Division of Transportation said in
      an interview with 4 Investigates.<br>
      <br>
      The Navajo Nation is almost entirely rural and sparsely
      populated.&nbsp; Because of that, there are hundreds of miles of
      dirt roads.&nbsp; Crews try to maintain them, but it's often
      difficult.<br>
      <br>
      After the snow melts every winter, it's especially tough.<br>
      <br>
      "[We] try to make sure that we can keep everybody out of the mud,"
      Bennett said.<br>
      <br>
      He said some of the roads develop ruts that are up to one foot
      deep.&nbsp; He said some people never leave their homes for fear
      of becoming stranded.<br>
      <br>
      They're often too far out of reach of emergency responders as
      well, he said.<br>
      <br>
      However, Bennett hopes those are problems of the past.&nbsp; The
      Navajo Nation recently bought into a new technology called bionic
      soil, which puts Mother Nature's biological clock into overdrive.<br>
      <br>
      "The product technology is called lithification, and lithification
      is the definition of transforming soil into rock," Bob Sherwin,
      founder of Bionic Soil Solutions said.<br>
      <br>
      He had the help of an inventor in Brisbane, Australia in
      developing a "secret sauce" -- a non-toxic, proprietary liquid
      that exponentially accelerates the breakdown of oxygen, silicon,
      and aluminum found naturally in soil to turn it into stone.<br>
      <br>
      "It's what Mother Nature does over hundreds of thousands of
      years," Sherwin said.<br>
      <br>
      In order for the product to work properly, he said crews first
      till a dirt road with a machine called a reclaimer.&nbsp; Then,
      they spray the fluffed dirt with water to make it pack well.&nbsp;
      After that, they apply the "sauce," smooth the dirt with road
      rollers, then wait for it to harden overnight.<br>
      <br>
      The next morning, 4 Investigates found it to be as hard as
      concrete and as smooth as a freshly-paved interstate.<br>
      <br>
      Sherwin said the bionic soil is scientifically proven to be harder
      than concrete, water repellent, and nearly indestructible.<br>
      <br>
      He demonstrated how the bionic soil remains intact, like a rock,
      when submerged in water.&nbsp; He said he's had some samples
      soaking for months which haven't changed a bit.<br>
      <br>
      The Navajo Nation is confident the product is environmentally
      friendly to their sacred land.&nbsp; Bennett said the Navajo DOT
      has more stringent environmental standards than the rest of the
      country.<br>
      <br>
      He also believes the bionic soil is a permanent solution along a
      particularly problematic, six-mile stretch of road through a
      mountain pass.<br>
      <br>
      "This [project] was on the books since 1998," Bennett said.<br>
      <br>
      He said the $1.3 million project is costing them the same, or
      less, than what they would have spent on a traditional road made
      of gravel and sand.<br>
      <br>
      Sherwin said traditional gravel and sand roads last about three or
      four years, whereas the bionic soil could last for 20 or 30 years.<br>
      <br>
      "Its going to open a lot of doors," Bennett said.&nbsp; "It's
      going to sell itself.&nbsp; And I think that if we can do that
      across the Navajo Nation, we could put a lot of people out of the
      mud."<br>
      <br>
      Bionic Soil Solutions has completed roughly a dozen other projects
      elsewhere across New Mexico, including a road near Edgewood and on
      pads that surround pump jacks in the oil fields.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the company expects to apply the product to the
      construction of homes.&nbsp; Ultimately, it plans to donate the
      product to the making of dirt bricks in underdeveloped countries.<br>
      <br>
      Sherwin, along with more than a dozen investors scattered across
      the western U.S., recently secured licensing rights for their
      product nationwide.&nbsp; They have plans to expand worldwide. <br>

      <blockquote>Bob Sherwin Former real estate agent Bob Sherwin has
        been working for years on a long-lasting, eco-friendly solution
        to the problems of maintaining hundreds of miles of rutted dirt
        roads in rural New Mexico and elsewhere. He thought he had the
        answer several years ago with a product called RoadPacker, which
        he used to treat Spur Ranch Road in a private subdivision off
        U.S. 285 south of Eldorado.<br>
        <br>
        Today the road is “1,000 percent” better, but it isn’t water
        resistant, and there have been some problems after heavy rains.
        The product, which has a high acid content, had worked well in
        China, Australia, Mexico and Canada. But it turned out that it
        didn’t work as well in the Southwest, where the pH content of
        soils is much higher, he said. He went back to the inventor,
        Alan Sonnenburg of Brisbane, Australia, who, it turned out, was
        developing a new formula designed to work in all soil
        conditions. And now Sherwin thinks he’s really found the
        solution to the problem. The new product turns dirt to stone
        overnight through a process called lithification in nature, he
        said.<br>
        <br>
        Sherwin pointed out that a French materials scientists — Joseph
        Davidovits— believes this type of technology, not cut stone, was
        used to build the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt. Sherwin’s
        company, Bionic Soil Solutions LLC, has recently completed work
        on 11 miles of rural roads on the Navajo Nation, where the ruts
        after a snowmelt are as deep as 18 inches in places. “So far we
        are very pleased,” said Benjamin Bennett, deputy director of the
        Navajo Nation Division of Transportation. Soils, Sherwin said,
        have three common elements: oxygen, silicon and aluminum. They
        combine to form aluminosilicate. Bionic Soil turns the
        aluminosilicates into a gel that hardens and becomes impermeable
        to water. Sonnenburg added accelerators to make this process
        happen in 24 hours rather than over many thousands of years, the
        time it would take to occur naturally.<br>
        <br>
        Bionic Soil Solutions partners with Univar USA, an international
        company that blends the product and sends it to the job site in
        tankers. The application process involves scarifying or tilling
        the soil with a grader or, for bigger projects, a reclaimer. The
        formula is mixed with water and the top 6 inches of soil. Then
        the surface is shaped and rolled. “You can drive on it
        immediately,” Sherwin said. The process is cheaper than laying
        down base course, the sand and gravel mixture used on many
        county roads. Sherwin said a mile of base course 6 inches deep
        and 24 feet wide takes 95 to 99 truckloads of gravel. Bionic
        Soil applications require 1 1/2 tankers of solution (at 3,500
        gallons per tanker).<br>
        <br>
        The overall cost depends on how far the materials have to be
        hauled. Because the Navajo Nation roads were so remote, the job
        is costing the tribe about $230,000 per mile, Bennett said.
        Paving the road could cost up to $2 million a mile, he added.
        Sherwin estimates the cost could be as low as $75,000 a mile for
        less remote stretches of road. In the case of Bionic Soil, the
        treated road will last longer and with a lot less maintenance,
        Sherwin said. If the product catches on, it could reduce the
        amount of gravel mining here and elsewhere. According to
        Sherwin, 300 million tons of virgin aggregate are mined annually
        in the U.S., taking down hills and leaving behind big, empty
        pits.<br>
        <br>
        Sherwin is Bionic Soil’s founder and managing partner and owns
        50 percent of the company. The other half is owned by about 35
        investors, some of whom invested in RoadPacker, an entity that
        has been dissolved. Bionic Soil Solutions bought licensing and
        distribution rights for the U.S. and its protectorates and pays
        inventor Sonneburg money for every gallon sold. The company is
        currently looking for potential customers in the private sector
        — gas, oil, wind and solar energy firms, ranchers, farmers and
        Native communities — who can act more quickly than the public
        sector, although Sherwin said he met with the New Mexico
        Department of Transportation last week.<br>
        <br>
        The new road technology has other applications as well. The
        company built a parking lot and 11 battery pads for an oil
        company in Carlsbad to reduce the chance of chemical spills
        reaching groundwater. “We’re hoping to spread the word to other
        oil companies,” Sherwin said. The product also can be adapted
        for making adobe earth blocks for homebuilding. Bennett said he
        thinks Bionic Soil speaks for itself. White Clay Road and Blue
        Canyon Road near Sawmill, Ariz., on the Navajo Reservation were
        virtually impassable, especially after hard rains and snow. They
        are also school bus routes, and the buses that are able to get
        through “tend to have high maintenance costs,” he said. Because
        of the conditions of the roads, Bionic Soil Solutions had to
        strip the roads down to the bottom of the ruts, at least a foot,
        and then build them back up. After the product was applied and
        the road was shaped and smoothed, the crew did a test drive.
        Sherwin said they were able to reach a speed of 87 mph on roads
        where the previous limit was about 5 mph.<br>
        <br>
        To avoid compromising the surface, however, crews removing snow
        and debris will use a rubber-edged blade positioned a half-inch
        above the surface. But Bennett said “there’s no maintenance
        required,” and from the cost savings, “we could move on and do
        other roads.” What we’re shooting for,” Sherwin said, “is a
        green road technology that reduces the carbon footprint. One and
        one-half truckloads [of product] versus 98 [trucks of
        gravel].Businessman seeking green roadbuilding solution sees

      <blockquote>The operator of the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant
        plans to fill in trenches on the coastline in yet another
        attempt to prevent highly contaminated water from pouring into
        the sea.<br>
        <br>
        Under the plan, approved by the Nuclear Regulation Authority on
        Nov. 21, Tokyo Electric Power Co. will inject a special cement
        mixture into the seaside trenches of the No. 2 and No. 3
        reactors while pumping up radioactive water accumulating in
        them.<br>
        <br>
        The special mixture does not absorb water so it can spread more
        easily along the bottom of the trenches, displacing the tainted
        water.<br>
        <br>
        The new method will allow radioactive materials to remain in the
        surrounding soil, but TEPCO decided to employ the technique
        because it puts high priority on preventing massive amounts of
        highly contaminated water from leaking into the ocean.<br>
        <br>
        This spring, TEPCO tried to stop the water influx at the trench
        for the No. 2 reactor by freezing the junction of the turbine
        building and the trench, but the operation was tough-going.<br>
        <br>
        The company then attempted to stop the water inflow with a
        cement mixture, but was unable to do so completely.<br>

        ( 11-26-2014 )<br>
        <br>
      </b>You may have already spoken to a recruiter or thought about
      signing up. This is NOT intended to discourage you from signing
      up, but merely to inform you of facts your recruiter will probably
      won't discuss.<br>
      <br>
      Do you fully understand the impact of the military on your life
      after signing up, and the impact on your civilian life in the
      future?<br>
      <br>
      Here are facts to think about BEFORE you sign the contract:<br>
      <br>
      * Officer commissions are not the result of promotions. They must
      attend West Point or another US military college first. Promotions
      of military personnel without officer training school (personnel
      who re-enlist) usually stop at the level of sergeant.<br>
      <br>
      * Today Army, Navy, Marines and special forces exist for this
      reason - kill people to defend America and start wars we don't
      need.<br>
      <br>
      * Other than patriotism, emotions are not part of recruiting or
      the military. Recruiters are trained as salesman. They will tell
      you anything and promise you the Moon to get you to sign up.
      Verbal promises mean nothing. You have no recourse whatsoever if
      government promises for the job you want later prove fictitious or
      are not kept. If a recruiter does not reach a certain number of
      sign-ups each month, they can be transferred from their cushy,
      soft recruiting job into a field combat unit. Commanding officers
      of recruiters only care about numbers, not how they get them.
      Scrutinize every word a recruiter tells you.<br>
      <br>
      * If you are married or have children, forget about supporting
      your family on your income unless they can live in a cardboard
      box. Your pay is calculated to support ONLY YOU. Remember your
      family is not in the military - you will be. Only by living on a
      military base can you survive on that meager income. Men and women
      overseas have suffered unbearable pain after hearing their family
      back home lost their home due to insufficient income. Military
      does not care about it. You will not be able to go home to console
      your family. Your family is left to fend for themselves. Military
      has zero sympathy for personal problems. It is unwise to sign up
      for the military if you have a spouse at home with a long term
      illness.<br>
      <br>
      * Military (government) may promise you a job in the profession
      you want. READ every word of your contract. You will read in the
      military contract the US government is NOT required to give you
      the job you want. If they do not give you the job you want there
      is NO recourse. You may not be given the job you wanted based on
      your test scores. You will get a job which matches your skills and
      psych profile. If you don't measure up in post-boot camp school,
      you can end up in the infantry.<br>
      <br>
      * Can training they give you for a specific job be useful later in
      civilian life? Not always. Several weeks of training after boot
      camp will be provided for the job you will do. A few examples are
      fixing classified electronics and radio equipment, servicing
      aircraft, working on a aircraft carrier flight deck, handling and
      loading bombs, missiles, ordinance and tank shells or whatever job
      they decide you will do. These types of jobs are useless for any
      job in civilian life. Even if you are trained to service/repair
      military aircraft, in civilian life you must still go through the
      new training to work on civilian aircraft. Then take the same
      civilian tests to become certified as a licensed mechanic. Without
      that license you cannot service or make repairs on any civilian
      aircraft.<br>
      Example of a promised job in the navy: A young man signed up in
      the navy to work on the flight deck of a aircraft carrier. That
      was his dream. He made it through boot camp and later graduated
      near the top of his class in flight deck school. Then he was sent
      to steamy hot Newport News, Virginia in August to his post on the
      USS Enterprise aircraft carrier. He was given a respiratory mask,
      a environmental suit to wear over that (not air conditioned) and a
      pneumatic needle gun. He was told that would be this job for the
      rest of his time in the military - stripping paint off floors and
      bulkheads. He did it and found his perspiration pooled up in his
      mask and had to empty it often. Why? Navy knew it was far cheaper
      to have their personnel do this work than to find a contractor to
      do it.<br>
      <br>
      * Job you ultimately get will depend on the psych profile they get
      from your grade school records (which they have legal access to)
      and other written tests they administer. If you have a certain
      mental profile and are physically fit, you could end up being
      trained in special ops or the seals to kill people. Otherwise
      known as "wet-work" for obvious reasons. Many service people who
      worked in special ops have a nightmare adjusting to civilian life
      later on. No matter what you hear or believe, the military is not
      concerned about your post-military civilian life. Some become
      murderers or serial killers as a result of insufficient or
      ineffective deprogramming.<br>
      <br>
      * You will be fighting wars which you will be told are defending
      America, and fight in other wars for national security. But a
      closer look at today's world shows wars over the past years have
      actually been about oil and power, with nothing to do with
      America's security. With Iraq the American people were PROMISED
      oil like it was the spoils of war. Instead, after thousands of
      Americans were killed all that oil was given away to British
      Petroleum (BP.) This adds credibility to the fact that America is
      still part of England despite the Declaration of Independence.
      Just because America's founding fathers declared independence from
      England does mean it actually happened. Do you want to sacrifice
      your life for oil?<br>
      <br>
      * You may be ordered to kill Americans even if though they are
      innocent. Not because these Americans represent a threat to
      America, but because of their political opinions. Are you ready to
      do that?<br>
      <br>
      * You may be ordered to use psychotronic weapons on innocent
      Americans with political opinions. Maybe even on your own family.
      These weapons can cause permanent incapacitation, mental illness
      or insanity all in the name of "national security." Can you live
      with yourself after doing that?<br>
      <br>
      * In the late 90's the US Supreme court ruled that ANYONE in the
      military is US government property. One soldier who was poisoned
      by a covert&nbsp; medical experiment was permanently
      incapacitated. He sued the military back in the nineties for doing
      this to him. Finally after reaching the US Supreme court a double
      ruling came out:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Military does NOT need to inform you or anyone
      when they experiment on military personnel. US Supreme court ruled
      YOU are government property while in the military. They own you
      and can do whatever they want to you.<br>
      &nbsp; 2. Court ruled that only a local official must be told 30
      days before they experiment on the public.<br>
      <br>
      * If you don't like being micro-managed then military life is not
      for you. They will dictate EVERY detail of your military life and
      indirectly, your personal life.<br>
      <br>
      * If you end up serving in a theater of war and are injured or
      have killed people, expect nightmares or PTSD later on in life.
      For some service people nightmares start years or decades after
      they leave the service. A friend was in the Korean war. PTSD hit
      him in the 1990's after he retired from a lifetime of professional
      civilian work. He still tries to deal with it today using
      prescription drugs.<br>
      <br>
      * You can unknowingly bring diseases home to your family such as
      engineered viruses and micoplasma-derived diseases. VA doctors who
      have never left the USA, have contracted these highly contagious
      diseases just from being in the same examination room with
      veterans. Civilian doctors are not trained to recognize or treat
      military diseases soon enough to prevent permanent damage to
      veterans health. Military diseases can put you in a wheel chair or
      worse. Pentagon admitted military engineered diseases have hurt
      more than 200,000 personnel in the 1991 gulf war. They became
      incapacitated with diseases we manufactured.<br>
      <br>
      * Everything you are asked to do must be considered an order. Obey
      it or face disciplinary action or a court martial and possible
      prison time. You can get kicked out of the military or be court
      martialed if you display rebellion or break the rules. When a
      officer speaks to you, consider it as coming from the lips of God.
      If you are mouthy and rebellious to your parents or family now,
      boot camp and military life will be even harder for you.<br>
      <br>
      * National Guard and Coast Guard are two services which do not
      routinely kill people as a mission. These two services function
      more like police agencies. National Guard is different - personnel
      can be called to full time duty overseas to function like army
      personnel to kill people at any time.<br>
      <br>
      * You can hold down a full time job at home and still serve in the
      National Guard on weekends. However - if you are ordered to serve
      full time overseas income from your full time job may stop cold.
      Even if your civilian employer keeps your job open for you, your
      family is suddenly living on your meager military income. Many
      houses of National Guard soldiers have already been lost to banks
      because of this.<br>
      <br>
      * There are gangs in the military similar to those on the streets.
      Gangs are relatively new to the military and never existed until
      about 20 years ago. Military will hire nearly anyone out of high
      school. To the military's credit they are trying to break up gangs
      and prevent formation of new gangs. Many of these gangs are black
      or Hispanic. They bring their street gang culture with them into
      military life where it has no place. Racism against whites by
      these groups is not uncommon.<br>
      <br>
      * Be sure your body's immune system is in good working order
      before signing up. During boot camp you will walk down between
      multiple medical techs and receive painful, multiple air-gun
      injections into both arms. These cocktails of vaccines help
      protect you from diseases common in other countries. Vaccination
      is inescapable.<br>
      <br>
      * Few know what they inject you with. They will never tell you
      what all the injections are. You are government property and don't
      need to know. Many of these vaccines are experimental with unknown
      short term and long term side-effects. If you become ill from any
      injection very few doctors are trained to deal with it. Nearly all
      civilian doctors today are trained to believe all vaccines are
      wonderful. Doctors think vaccines will never make you sick.
      Military doctors will never admit any vaccine made you sick.<br>
      <br>
      * Regardless of what service you sign up for, in boot camp you
      will be subjected to tear gas and bio-weapons protection training.
      You will be sent into a building filled with tear gas without
      wearing protection to experience what it will be like. Military
      tear gas is far stronger than watered-down tear gas used by
      civilian police for crowd control.<br>
      <br>
      If these facts do not both you, then maybe the military is just
      right for you.<br>

        “Couple Tries to Bobbitise Man”<br>
      </b><br>
      Just this week, Ranka Dalai, who has a history of “manhandling and
      misbehaving,” reportedly tried to grope a man’s wife in the
      village of Baiganbadipalli. So the couple allegedly hid in some
      bushes near the village pond and sprung on Dalai in the middle of
      the night. The husband held the man by the neck while the wife
      slashed his genitals. But Dalai insists he’s not to blame. “I am
      being victimized by them,” he told reporters from his hospital
      bed. <br>
      “Rape Victim Bobbitises Tantrik”<br>
      <br>
      A tantric healer from Madhepura allegedly attacked his ill niece
      in June after telling the girl’s mother she was “under the
      influence of evil forces.” Subsequently, according to the Bihar
      Times, the man “outraged her modesty notwithstanding her repeated
      protests.” The next night, the girl showed up at her uncle’s house
      and castrated him. <br>

          That Are Banned In Other Countries</b><br>

      <b><br>
      </b>There are countless chemicals in use all over the world today,
      many of which have been linked to cancer and other serious
      illnesses. Once the chemical is linked to these illnesses the
      excuse is often that they just didn’t know that the long-term
      effects of these chemicals would cause such disorders. Kind of
      like smoking, they just didn’t know that smoking would lead to
      cancer back then, but now they do because they are seeing it first
      hand. Even after it was proven that smoking caused cancer,
      however, it took a long time to fully let the public know. When
      there is money to be lost the truth often becomes very shady.<br>
      <br>
      Below are the top 13 worst chemicals used in food products in the
      US today, that are banned in other countries. The difference
      between the US and the rest of the world is that once something is
      proven to be harmful, the Food and Drug Administration disagrees
      mostly, and the chemicals are still allowed to be widely used in
      food production, while many other countries ban these additives
      and find safer alternatives. Why does this happen? Mostly because
      many American citizens are just uninformed and uneducated on this
      matter, they choose to not speak out against it, and instead they
      keep buying the products that contain these harmful chemicals.
      Here are the top 13:<b><br>
        <br>
        Azodicarbonamide<br>
        <br>
      </b>This is a chemical that is used primarily in foam plastics,
      such as sneaker soles and yoga mats, but it is also used to bleach
      flour. Up until early this year it was an ingredient in the famous
      “Subway” sandwich rolls, but thanks to “Food Babe” and her
      #FoodArmy, it has been removed. It can still be found in other
      breads, frozen dinners and packaged baked goods.<br>
      <br>
      Banned in Australia and Europe.<br>
      <br>
      Safety? This chemical has been linked to asthma.<b><br>
        <br>
        Blue 1 &amp; 2<br>
        <br>
      </b>Amazingly, colors can actually be flavors as well.
      Unfortunately, I think a lot of us probably know what blue tastes
      like. Blue No. 1 and 2 can both be found in ice cream,
      marshmallows, canned peas, sports drinks, icing, popsicles, blue
      raspberry flavoured products, and even dairy products. It can also
      be found in soaps, shampoos and mouthwash.<br>
      <br>
      Safety? A study reported in 2007 by D. McCann and colleagues in
      the journal The Lancet showed that artificial colorings such as
      blue no. 1 &amp; 2 were linked to hyperactivity. Almost 300
      children who participated in the study were given a beverage
      containing artificial colors. Drinking the beverage resulted in
      increased hyperactivity in the children. It is noteworthy to
      mention that hyperactivity is often linked to Attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder or (ADHD).<b><br>
        <br>
        Yellow 5<br>
        <br>
      </b>Yellow # 5 is also commonly known as Tartrazine. It is widely
      used in the making of potato chips, jams, candy, drinks and pet
      food; as well as shampoo and various other cosmetic products.<br>
      <br>
      Banned in Austria and Norway, other European countries have issued
      warnings about its potential health concerns.<br>
      <br>
      Safety? Yellow 5 has seemed to show behavioral changes in some
      children including hyperactivity. The Food Standards Agency (FSA)
      which is the UK’s equivalent to the FDA issued a warning in 2008
      that stated that certain colorings, including tartrazine, can
      cause behavioral changes in children that included a loss of
      concentration and impulsive, hard-to-control activity.<b><br>
        <br>
        BHA and BHT<br>
        <br>
      </b>Butylated hydroxvanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene
      (BHT) are chemicals that are often found in: cereals, trail mixes,
      gum, butter, meat, dehydrated potatoes and beer. These substances
      prevent oils in foods from oxidizing and going rancid.<br>
      <br>
      Banned in Japan, the U.K. and other European countries.<br>
      <br>
      Safety? The National Toxicology Program has concluded that BHA “is
      reasonable anticipated to be a human carcinogen,” and places BHT
      in its “caution” column.<b><br>
        <br>
        Arsenic<br>
        <br>
      </b>That name even sounds toxic! I think a lot of people know that
      arsenic is a straight-up poison, so why is the U.S. allowing it in
      their food supply? Arsenic can be found in poultry because it is
      used in chicken feed to make the meat appear more pink and fresh,
      how appealing.<br>
      <br>
      Banned in the entire European Union and Canada.<br>
      <br>
      Safety? Arsenic is a poison. Eat enough of it and it will kill
      you. Arsenic is also a known carcinogen.<b><br>
        <br>
        rBGH and rBST<br>
        <br>
      </b>Recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH) and recombinant
      bovine somatotropin (rBST) are synthetic hormones used to increase
      milk production in cows.<br>
      <br>
      Banned in the European Union, Canada and many other countries.<br>
      <br>
      Safety? Milk from cows treated with rBGH has higher levels of
      IGF-1, a hormone that encourages certain cells to grow. Several
      studies have found that high IGF-1 levels may influence the
      development of certain tumors. Studies have found a relationship
      between blood levels of IGF-1 and prostate, breast, colorectal and
      other cancers.<b><br>
        <br>
        Potassium Bromate<br>
        <br>
      </b>Potassium Bromate, aka brominated flour is found in bread
      products such as: rolls, wraps, loaves, flatbreads, buns and even
      bagel chips. This is a powerful oxidizing agent that chemically
      ages flour faster than open air and cuts down baking time, which
      in turn lowers costs.<br>
      <br>
      Banned in the European Union, Canada, Brazil and elsewhere.<br>
      <br>
      Safety? This additive has been associated with kidney and nervous
      system disorders and gastrointestinal discomfort. Interestingly
      enough the FDA has not banned the use of bromated flour, they do
      however urge bakers to voluntarily leave it out. I think that’s
      enough of a reason for me to avoid it.<b><br>
        <br>
        Brominated Vegetable Oil<br>
        <br>
      </b>Aka BVO, is a synthetic chemical created when vegetable oil is
      bonded to the element bromine. Bromine keeps oils from floating to
      the top of water-based solutions such as soft drinks and fruit
      drinks. I remember when I was about 12 or 13 drinking a bottle of
      Sunny D lemonade and looking at the label and seeing “vegetable
      oil” listed as the second or third ingredient. I couldn’t finish
      the drink and never drank it again. That thoroughly disgusted me.
      BVO is commonly added to citrus flavored drinks such as orange,
      lemon, lime and grapefruit as these flavors are oily, BVO acts as
      an emulsifier to help the flavors mix better.<br>
      <br>
      Banned in Japan and the European Union.<br>
      <br>
      Safety? “There have been toxilogical concerns around brominated
      vegetable oils, mainly to do with the accumulation of bromine in
      fatty tissues of experimental animals and isolated human case
      reports, although the data are quite old and the levels
      experimentally fed were quite high.” – Michael Walker, Independent
      Food Consultant.<b><br>
        <br>
        Olestra<br>
        <br>
      </b>Olestra, also known as “Olean,” is found in “fat free” potato
      chips and was actually named on Time Magazine’s “The 50 Worst
      Inventions” list.<b><br>
        <br>
      </b>Banned in the U.K. and Canada<b><br>
        <br>
      </b>Safety? This fat substitute appears to cause a dramatic
      depletion of fat-soluble vitamins and carotenoids, robbing us of
      vital micro-nutrients. It is also known to cause anal leakage.<b><br>
        <br>
        Diphenylamine<br>
      </b><br>
      Aka DPA is found in apples, apple juice, pears and baby food. It
      is used to give apples their shiny coat and protect them from
      blackening and browning during long months in storage.<b><br>
        <br>
        Banned in the European Union.<br>
        <br>
      </b>Safety? The European Food and Safety Authority just deemed
      this chemical as a poison. The chemicals in DPA can break down and
      form nitrosamines, which are known carcinogens.<b><br>
        <br>
        Bottom Line?<br>
        <br>
      </b>Avoid these chemicals and additives. Read the ingredient
      labels before you purchase anything. Know what you’re putting into
      your body! If you stick to a primarily organic, whole foods diet
      you will drastically limit your exposure to these sorts of
      chemicals. Spread the word. Tell your friends and family to look
      out for these chemicals. If everyone became aware of the potential
      harmful effects of these additives and stopped eating them, the
      companies that manufacture toxic foods would have no choice but to
      change their ways and update their recipes to use safer
      ingredients, like the countries that have banned them - or risk
      going out of business.<br>
      <br>
      The choice is yours.<b><br>

          <br>
          A virus that infects human brains and makes us more stupid has
          been discovered, according to scientists in the US.<br>
          <br>
          The algae virus, never before observed in healthy people, was
          found to affect cognitive functions including visual
          processing and spatial awareness. <br>
          <br>
          Scientists at Johns Hopkins Medical School and the University
          of Nebraska stumbled upon the discovery when they were
          undertaking an unrelated study into throat microbes.<br>
          <br>
          Surprisingly, the researchers found DNA in the throats of
          healthy individuals that matched the DNA of a virus known to
          infect green algae.<br>
          <br>
          Dr Robert Yolken, a virologist who led the original study,
          said: “This is a striking example showing that the ‘innocuous’
          microorganisms we carry can affect behaviour and cognition.<br>
          <br>
          “Many physiological differences between person A and person B
          are encoded in the set of genes each inherits from parents,
          yet some of these differences are fuelled by the various
          microorganisms we harbour and the way they interact with our
          genes.”<br>
          <br>
          Of the 90 participants in the study, 40 tested positive for
          the algae virus. Those who tested positive performed worse on
          tests designed to measure the speed and accuracy of visual
          processing. They also achieved lower scores in tasks designed
          to measure attention.<br>
          <br>
          Humans’ bodies contain trillions of bacteria, viruses and
          fungi. Most are harmless, but the findings of this research
          show that there some microbes can have a detrimental impact on
          cognitive functions, while leaving individuals healthy.<br>
          <br>
          The study’s findings were published in the Proceedings of the
          National Academy of Sciences.<br>

          Human mucosal surfaces contain a wide range of microorganisms.
          The biological effects of these organisms are largely unknown.
          Large-scale metagenomic sequencing is emerging as a method to
          identify novel microbes. Unexpectedly, we identified DNA
          sequences homologous to virus ATCV-1, an algal virus not
          previously known to infect humans, in oropharyngeal samples
          obtained from healthy adults. The presence of ATCV-1 was
          associated with a modest but measurable decrease in cognitive
          functioning. A relationship between ATCV-1 and cognitive
          functioning was confirmed in a mouse model, which also
          indicated that exposure to ATCV-1 resulted in changes in gene
          expression within the brain. Our study indicates that viruses
          in the environment not thought to infect humans can have
          biological effects.<br>
          Abstract<br>
          <br>
          Chloroviruses (family Phycodnaviridae) are large DNA viruses
          known to infect certain eukaryotic green algae and have not
          been previously shown to infect humans or to be part of the
          human virome. We unexpectedly found sequences homologous to
          the chlorovirus Acanthocystis turfacea chlorella virus 1
          (ATCV-1) in a metagenomic analysis of DNA extracted from human
          oropharyngeal samples. These samples were obtained by throat
          swabs of adults without a psychiatric disorder or serious
          physical illness who were participating in a study that
          included measures of cognitive functioning. The presence of
          ATCV-1 DNA was confirmed by quantitative PCR with ATCV-1 DNA
          being documented in oropharyngeal samples obtained from 40
          (43.5%) of 92 individuals. The presence of ATCV-1 DNA was not
          associated with demographic variables but was associated with
          a modest but statistically significant decrease in the
          performance on cognitive assessments of visual processing and
          visual motor speed. We further explored the effects of ATCV-1
          in a mouse model. The inoculation of ATCV-1 into the
          intestinal tract of 9–11-wk-old mice resulted in a subsequent
          decrease in performance in several cognitive domains,
          including ones involving recognition memory and sensory-motor
          gating. ATCV-1 exposure in mice also resulted in the altered
          expression of genes within the hippocampus. These genes
          comprised pathways related to synaptic plasticity, learning,
          memory formation, and the immune response to viral exposure.<br>

          Nearly half of us could be infected with a virus which makes
          us more stupid, scientists have found.<br>
          <br>
          The startling discovery suggests that millions may be carrying
          a long-lasting infection which dulls the brain.<br>
          <br>
          Scientists found the virus living in the throats of 44 per
          cent of patients tested in a small US study.<br>
          <br>
          A viral infection that could make more than half of us stupid
          has been discovered by scientists in America<br>
          <br>
          Those who were carrying the infection performed worse in
          intelligence tests, even when education and age were taken
          into account.<br>
          <br>
          The virus - called chlorovirus ATCV-1 - was previously only
          known to appear in green algae in freshwater lakes.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers, from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore
          and the University of Nebraska, have not established how the
          virus comes to infect humans.<br>
          <br>
          It does not seem to have infected just swimmers or watersports
          fans, probably ruling out a link to algae itself.<br>
          <br>
          Instead it could be that humans have long carried the virus,
          but it had not previously been looked for by doctors.<br>
          <br>
          Study author Professor Robert Yolken, of Johns Hopkins medical
          school, said the millions of viruses living in the human body
          are being investigated by experts for the first time.<br>
          <br>
          ‘We’re really just starting to find out what some of these
          agents that we’re carrying around might actually do,’ he told
          the Healthline website.<br>
          <br>
          ‘It’s the beginning, I think, of another way of looking at
          infectious agents — not agents that come in and do a lot of
          damage and then leave, like Ebola virus or influenza virus.<br>
          <br>
          ‘This is kind of the other end of the spectrum. These are
          agents that we carry around for a long time and that may have
          subtle effects on our cognition and behaviour.’<br>
          <br>
          The research, published in the Proceedings of the National
          Academy of Sciences, suggests that the ATCV-1 virus alters the
          genes in the brain.<br>
          <br>
          The team found the virus in throat swabs from 40 out of 92
          volunteers, and discovered those with the virus performed
          measurably worse in cognitive testing.<br>
          <br>
          They then confirmed their findings in tests on mice. Giving
          the virus to mice resulted in a decrease in recognition memory
          and other brain functions, they found.<br>
          <br>
          Tests showed the virus had broken through the barrier between
          blood and tissue, altering the activity of genes in the brains
          of the mice.<br>
          <br>
          The genes affected including those producing dopamine - a
          vital hormone which influences memory, spatial awareness,
          emotion and pleasure.<br>
          <br>
          Professor James Van Etten, a biologist from the University of
          Nebraska who first identified the virus in algae 30 years ago,
          said: ‘There’s more and more studies showing that
          microorganisms in your body have a bigger influence than
          anything anyone would have predicted, and this could be
          something along those lines.’<br>
          <br>
          Professor Yolken added: ‘The thing that’s different about what
          we found is that chlorovirus ATCV-1 is something that we
          wouldn’t have suspected would actually have any effect on
          humans or animals.<br>
          <br>
          ‘It points us in a direction of looking to see if we can
          improve people’s cognition, their behaviour, by changing the
          composition of their microbiome [the balance of bacteria and
          viruses in the body].<br>

          <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While studying cognitive function in
            healthy adults, researchers discovered DNA from an algal

          The human body is host to trillions of microbes. These
          microbes significantly outnumber the body’s cells. Although
          most are beneficial to human health, some of these microbes
          can cause problems. Research in both humans and animal models
          has shown that microbial communities can affect many
          biological functions, including cognitive performance.<br>
          <br>

          Nebraska-Lincoln.<br>
          <br>
          Most studies of microbial communities and their genes,
          collectively known as the microbiome, have focused on
          bacterial and fungal communities. DNA is extracted from
          samples, and then specific regions that are universal to
          bacteria or fungi are analyzed to distinguish the microbes.
          The viral components of the microbiome (the virome) have
          received less attention, largely because viruses are so
          diverse that there are no universal viral target regions.
          Recent advances, however, have made whole-genome sequencing
          faster and less expensive. Thus scientists can now sequence
          entire viral genomes.<br>
          <br>
          A group led by Dr. Robert Yolken at Johns Hopkins University
          has been studying the links between viral infections and brain
          development. They were analyzing viruses taken from the
          throats of 33 healthy adults who were participating in a study
          that involved the assessment of cognitive functioning.
          Unexpectedly, the researchers discovered genetic sequences
          from Acanthocystis turfacea chlorella virus 1 (ATCV-1). ATCV-1
          is a type of Chlorovirus, which infects green algae. These
          viruses are common in fresh water, such as lakes and ponds,
          but weren’t thought to infect humans or animals.<br>
          <br>
          To further investigate, the group teamed with Dr. James Van
          Etten, an expert on algal viruses at the University of
          Nebraska-Lincoln. Their work was supported in part by NIH’s
          National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and National Center
          for Research Resources (NCRR). Results appeared online on
          October 27, 2014, in Proceedings of the National Academy of
          Sciences.<br>
          <br>
          A sequence-specific assay detected ATCV-1 in throat samples
          from 40 of 92 (44%) people in the study. The team next
          examined the link between ATCV-1 and performance on a battery
          of cognitive tests. ATCV-1 was associated with decreases on
          tests of visual processing. There was no difference on tests
          of general knowledge.<br>
          <br>
          Studies in people can involve many complex factors, so the
          scientists infected a group of mice with ATCV-1. The exposed
          mice performed worse than control mice in several cognitive
          tests, such as navigating mazes. The researchers next studied
          gene expression in the hippocampus, a brain region essential
          for learning, memory, and behavior. Exposure to ATCV-1 was
          associated with significant changes in the regulation of over
          1,000 genes.<br>
          <br>
          “People have conducted studies looking for more conventional
          viruses and bacteria in throat swabs, but the way those
          studies were done meant that they could have easily missed the
          ones that we work with,” Van Etten says.<br>
          <br>
          More study will be needed to learn how ATCV-1 may alter
          cognitive functioning. If confirmed, these findings hint that
          other yet-unknown viruses may have subtle effects on human
          health and behavior.<br>

          immediate early in infection, sixteen genes were specifically
          found to be expressed in the host cells. These genes include
          those for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, nucleolin, ribosomal
          protein S5, hyaluronan synthase, TFIID etc. All of these
          transcripts were polyadenylated and most likely expressed in

          In chlorovirus infection, immediate-early gene expression
          occurs within 5–20 min post infection (p.i.). We identified 16
          major immediate-early transcripts. On Northern blot analysis,
          these transcripts showed unusual behaviors: (I) after 40 min
          p.i., their sizes reduced by approximately 100 nt, most likely
          caused by loss of a poly(A) tail and (II) after 40 min p.i.,
          often appeared a few larger additional transcripts that may be
          formed by read-through from an upstream gene or into a

          Recently, disease researchers yet again have discovered an
          emerging virus.<br>
          <br>
          Scientists at Johns Hopkins Medical School and the University
          of Nebraska stumbled on to chlorovirus ATCV-1, a DNA virus
          which comes from algae, while doing an unrelated test on
          throat microbes. Forty-three percent of patients tested had it
          in their throats. Among other things it is found to lead to
          cognitive problems. You can read some mainstream articles
          here, here, here and here.<br>
          <br>
          I think the headlines should have read a lot differently. This
          discovery could have big implications for people for a few
          reasons. Yet, where is the media panic now? No...now it's been
          made cute and funny by dubbing it the "stupid virus."<br>
          <br>
          Before we get carried away with giddy headlines pointing out
          how so many people must have "caught stupid" - let's get a
          couple of things straight.<br>
          <br>
          1. This is not a "stupid virus," per se - The "stupid virus"
          title is meant to be a humorous, eye catching marketing hook
          for bored journalists. It's actually an unwittingly cruel
          joke. In the original study, the researchers refer to
          cognitive decline and memory problems due to the virus. The
          researchers who had swabbed healthy people wrote that they
          found a "modest but statistically significant decrease in the
          performance on cognitive assessments of visual processing and
          visual motor speed." As well as changes of gene expression in
          the hippocampus, memory formation and immune response. They
          also said it affects behavior.<br>
          <br>
          However, do you know how many things lead to cognitive issues?
          Do we call Alzheimer's "Stupid Dementia"? Do we say an
          epileptic is acting "dumb again" when they go into seizures,
          thought to stem from the hippocampus? No. But if cognitive
          decline equates stupidity then I vote to call BPA a "stupidity
          chemical"; fluoridated water is "stupid juice"; heavy metal
          toxicity in food, air and water are "stupidizers"; pesticides
          could be "smartcides." Because all of those things directly
          affect the brain. But cognitive problems are not indicative of
          stupidity, so it's a cruel misnomer to detract and minimize
          them by calling a damaging virus a stupid maker.<br>
          <br>
          2. It could have been called the ADHD virus. If this virus can
          mimic symptoms that are often left to the mental health field
          then shouldn't people with Alzheimer's and ADHD be properly
          tested to make sure a virus isn't actually causing their
          symptoms? Or even epilepsy, schizophrenia and PTSD. The fact
          that it affects the hippocampus is a concern. Forget stupid,
          do you want to have early onset Alzheimer's and not be able to
          create new memories? And it would be cruel to call someone
          with that serious brain issue "stupid."<br>
          <br>
          The more I read up on this, the more it sounds like the exact
          picture of the group of symptoms commonly called ADHD.<br>
          <br>
          From the Daily Mail:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tests showed the virus had broken through
          the barrier between blood and tissue, altering the activity of
          genes in the brains of the mice. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The genes affected including those
          producing dopamine - a vital hormone which influences memory,
          spatial awareness, emotion and pleasure. (emphasis added)<br>
          <br>
          ADHD with a forecast of Alzheimer's.<br>
          <br>
          3. Another more accurate headline would actually be freaking
          out about yet another kingdom-jumping disease. This time
          involving plants-to-humans. That really isn't normal. The
          people who tell me this are parroting the articles that are
          sensitizing people to get used to it. Historically speaking, I
          don't see the rampant cases of kingdom or even species jumps
          that have exploded in the last 50-100 years. Let's be clear:
          this virus comes from algae and hadn't been observed in
          healthy humans before. When it was, they didn't think it was
          harmful. But they conclude: "Our study indicates that viruses
          in the environment not thought to infect humans can have
          biological effects."<br>
          <br>
          It seems like I read about these "isolated incidents" once a
          week now. Furthermore, researchers say they don't KNOW how the
          jump happens - or if it's contagious or if we make good hosts.
          That's a problem and deserves more than a stupid, passing
          headline.<br>
          <br>
          The human body houses many viruses, no less, DNA viruses. I
          just wanted to point that out to alleviate potential panic.
          This isn't necessarily "bad" it just is what it is for now,
          although I would love to see how people could live if they did
          not have the bulk of them. Most people have had Chicken Pox
          (varicella zoster) and it stays latent. Later, one could have
          Shingles (herpes zoster) during a time of immune suppression
          or stress. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (cold sores of the
          mouth) are present in 80-90% of people and appear during times
          of stress. The above also happen to be DNA viruses. This list
          goes on and on...<br>
          <br>
          But how many of these latent and emerging viruses can one
          person handle? Especially those that affect the brain? And
          what happens when the immune system is compromised and the
          viruses come roaring out like a sleeping dragon? That creates
          a mega load on the body and constant stress of the immune
          system.<br>
          <br>
          Can I recommend one source for helping the body slough off
          some of those problems and prevent more? It's Herbal
          Antivirals:Natural Remedies for Emerging &amp; Resistant Viral
          Infections by Stephen Buhner. He says, when it comes to
          emerging disease, that garlic and colloidal silver from the
          healthfood store just aren't going to cut it. Not when it
          comes to mystery illnesses or mutated disease. He himself
          reversed chronic Lyme (bacteria) and helps others do the same.
          If he could overcome a questionable animal-to-human disease
          that only emerged in the late 1970s, I would act on his herbal
          sensibilities to help the immune system fight off more.<br>
