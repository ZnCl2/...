      systems, ideally a mental patient, chemically controlled, and too
      fragile to leave the man-made environment and venture out into the

      </b>A new study seeking to measure the overall competency of age
      groups throughout the globe has found that American Millennials
      are without a doubt the least skilled population in the world.<br>
      <br>
      The ETS study tested individuals aged 16 to 65 across 23
      countries, and measured Literacy, Numeracy, and “problem-solving
      in technology-rich environments.” Across the board American
      Millennials scored a ‘feeble wet fart’ on the competency scale
      when compared with their foreign counterparts. Long thought to be
      the most technologically savvy and educated generation in history,
      American Millennials (people aged 16-34) just can’t hack it when
      it comes to the skills employers are looking for.<br>
      <br>
      Japan crushed it, but there was no indication as to whether or not
      the Japanese culture’s infatuation with tentacle porn had any
      bearing on workplace competency.<br>
      <br>
      Here are some key findings from the ETS study:<br>
      <br>
      In literacy, U.S. millennials scored lower than 15 of the 22
      participating countries. Only millennials in Spain and Italy had
      lower scores.<br>
      <br>
      In numeracy (ability to apply math to everyday situations), U.S.
      millennials ranked last, along with Italy and Spain.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b>In PS-TRE (problem solving in a technology rich environment),
      U.S. millennials also ranked last, along with the Slovak Republic,
      Ireland, and Poland.<br>
      <br>
      The youngest segment of the U.S. millennial cohort (16- to
      24-year-olds), who could be in the labor force for the next 50
      years, ranked last in numeracy along with Italy and among the
      bottom countries in PS-TRE. In literacy, they scored higher than
      their peers in Italy and Spain.<br>
      <br>
      Top-scoring U.S. millennials (those at the 90th percentile) scored
      lower than top-scoring millennials in 15 of the 22 participating
      countries, and only scored higher than their peers in Spain.<br>
      <br>
      Low-scoring U.S. millennials (those at the 10th percentile) ranked
      last along with Italy and England/Northern Ireland and scored
      lower than millennials in 19 participating countries.<br>
      <br>
      Although a greater percentage of young adults in the U.S. are
      attaining higher levels of education since 2003, the numeracy
      scores of U.S. millennials whose highest level of education is
      high school and above high school have declined.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. millennials with a four-year bachelor’s degree scored higher
      in numeracy than their counterparts in only two countries: Poland
      and Spain.<br>
      <br>
      To summarize: American Millennials are the overall worst
      generation in the world when it comes to useful skills. Even if
      American Millennials didn’t finish dead last in EVERY SINGLE
      CATEGORY, they managed to finish at or near the bottom across the
      board...<br>

        <b>Dana Varinsky&nbsp; </b><br>

      <b><br>
      </b>Our atmosphere contains approximately 3,100 cubic miles of
      water — enough to cover the entire planet in one inch of water.<br>
      <br>
      That water surrounds us in the form of vapor — water’s gaseous,
      evaporated state. We’re usually only reminded of this on
      especially humid days, but our air can actually be considered a
      water source.<br>
      <br>
      Zero Mass Water, a sustainable water startup, is trying to create
      an easy, off-grid way for anyone to harvest that liquid with its
      first product, Source.<br>
      <br>
      Each Source unit looks like a solar panel resting on top of a
      metal box. Company CEO Cody Friesen, a material scientist and
      engineering professor at Arizona State University, says the device
      essentially uses sunlight to produce electricity and heat, and
      which allows a set of proprietary materials to passively catch the
      humidity in the air.<br>
      <br>
      Friesen won’t say how those materials are engineered or what
      they're made of, but explains that they’re designed to have an
      ideal binding energy for water vapor.Zero Mass Source at
      SunsetZero Mass<br>
      <br>
      He compares the process to the grains of rice you’ll sometimes
      find inside salt shakers in humid locations. That rice, he says,
      is placed there because it binds more strongly to water than the
      salt does, so the moisture will stick to the rice, and won’t make
      the salt wet and clumpy.<br>
      <br>
      “You want to make sure that these materials that are going to
      passively absorb water from the air hold onto that water strongly
      enough that they’ll do so under dry conditions, but not so
      strongly that under any condition it takes a lot of energy to get
      that water back off,” he says.<br>
      <br>
      Friesen says that on average, one Source device can harvest 5
      liters of water per day. Because of the device depends on solar
      power, he says, that number doesn’t vary too drastically between
      dry and wet climates — solar radiation is stronger in dry places
      where there are fewer water molecules in the air to absorb it, and
      water vapor is more prevalent in wet places where solar radiation
      is less intense.<br>
      <br>
      Once the water vapor is harvested and turned into liquid, the
      device adds minerals to bring the water’s pH levels up, which
      makes it taste more like the water sold in bottles. It then gets
      stored in a metal compartment underneath the solar panel that can
      hold 30 liters. The reservoir gets connected to a pipe, and sends
      the water from the device to a faucet.<br>
      <br>
      "When you're making solar energy, you have to use it or lose it
      unless you have a battery," Friesen says. "In our case, we're
      storing solar energy in a glass."<br>
      <br>
      Zero Mass Water boasts that one Source is able to produce enough
      clean drinking water each day to satisfy a family of four; however
      if all four members followed the 8-glasses-per-day rule, that
      family would wind up about 3 liters short. The panels can be
      connected, however, to combine their outputs. When that happens,
      Zero Mass Water programs one to act as the hub, and when that hub
      uses up the water in its reservoir, it can communicate with the
      other panels, which act as spokes and sent their water over.<br>
      <br>
      The Source isn’t available for retail sale yet — Friesen says he
      expects sales to start in early 2017 — so the company hasn't
      released a cost estimate for individual units. But Zero Mass Water
      suggests one device will pay itself off in bottled water savings
      over two to four years. In other words, each one would be equal to
      what you'd pay for somewhere between 964 and 1,928 gallons of
      bottled water at a store like Costco or Walmart. (By our math that
      would price it somewhere between $1,000 and $4,000 dollars.)<br>
      <br>
      Several countries and organizations have already started putting
      the devices to use. In August 2015, Jordan’s King Abdullah II
      installed Zero Mass Water panels in locations throughout the
      country. Duke Energy has installed panels in schools, homes, and a
      clinic in Ecuador, and the Zero Mass Water earned a USAID grant to
      deploy panels to refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon.<br>
      <br>
      Zero Mass Water’s products seem especially promising for emergency
      situations, since they are 100% sustainable and don’t require and
      electrical inputs. Though other companies are also devising ways
      to extract water vapor from the air — Israeli company Water Gen
      has a similar technology — many require electricity to run.<br>
      <br>
      Zero Mass Water estimates that because they don't need to be
      hooked up to a home's electrical system or to a power grid, the
      panels only take about 20 minutes to install. That allows the
      product to easily brought to places where populations don’t have
      access to clean drinking water, like rural communities in the
      developing world or make-shift refugee camps. Source units could
      also be deployed to help Californians weather the state’s drought,
      or to provide residents of places with polluted water, like Flint,
      Michigan, with an alternative source.<br>
      <br>
      “One of the fundamental tenants [of the business] is that drinking
      water is a human right and everybody should have access to it and
      control over it and security over it the same way we have those
      things around air,” Friesen says. “It shouldn’t be something that
      you have to secure through a government source, through
      infrastructure, or by purchasing water at the store.”<br>
      <br>
      The Source, of course, is not designed to provide enough water for
      an entire family’s total daily usage (the average American uses
      about 100 gallons per day). Rather, it ensures that a moderate
      supply drinking water is always clean and available — something
      that's currently not the case for 10% of the world’s population.<br>
      <br>
      “We are taking an inexhaustible source of water — vapor — and
      we’re making it free to make it liquid,” Friesen says, adding,
      “From a technology perspective, of course, we are moving as fast
      as we can, because this is no joke.”<br>

          Discovered</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>For the first time, physicists have observed a strange
      molecule called the butterfly Rydberg molecule – a weak pairing of
      highly excitable atoms that was first predicted back in 2002.<br>
      <br>
      The find not only confirms a 14-year-old prediction – it also
      confirms the existence of a whole new type of atomic bond.<br>
      <br>
      Rydberg molecules form when an electron is kicked far from an
      atom’s nucleus, making them super electronically excited.<br>
      <br>
      On their own, they’re common enough. But back in 2002, a team of
      researchers from Purdue University in Indiana predicted that a
      Rydberg molecule could attract and bind to another atom –
      something that was thought impossible according to our
      understanding of how atoms bind at the time.<br>
      <br>
      They called that hypothetical molecule combination the butterfly
      Rydberg molecule, because of the butterfly-like distribution of
      the orbiting electrons.<br>
      <br>
      And now, 14 years later, the same team has finally observed a
      butterfly Rydberg molecule in the lab, and in the process, has
      discovered a whole new type of weak atomic bond.<br>
      <br>
      “This new binding mechanism, in which an electron can grab and
      trap an atom, is really new from the point of view of chemistry,”
      <br>
      <br>
      explained lead researcher Chris Greene. “It’s a whole new way an
      atom can be bound by another atom.”<br>
      <br>
      Rydberg molecules are unique because they can have electrons that
      are between 100-1,000 times further away from the nucleus than
      normal.<br>
      <br>
      The team was able to create them for this experiment by cooling
      Rubidium gas to a temperature of 100 nano-Kelvin – one
      ten-millionth of a degree above absolute zero – then exciting the
      atoms into a Rydberg state using lasers.<br>
      <br>
      The team kept these Rydberg molecules under observation to see if
      they could indeed attract another atom. They were looking for any
      changes in the frequency of light the molecules could absorb,
      which would be a sign that an energy binding had occurred.<br>
      <br>
      Eventually, they discovered that the distant electrons could
      indeed help attract and bind with other atoms, just as they had
      predicted in 2002.<br>
      <br>
      “This [distant] electron is like a sheepdog,” said Greene. “Every
      time it whizzes past another atom, this Rydberg atom adds a little
      attraction and nudges it toward one spot until it captures and
      binds the two atoms together.”<br>
      <br>
      “It’s a really clear demonstration that this class of molecules
      exist,” he added.<br>
      <br>
      These special butterfly Rydberg molecules are substantially larger
      than normal molecules dueto their distantly orbiting electrons,
      and now that we know they exist, they could be used in the
      development of molecular-scale electronics and machines because
      they require less energy to move.<br>
      <br>
      “The main excitement about this work in the atomic and molecular
      physics community has related to the fact that these huge
      molecules should exist and be observable, and that their electron
      density should exhibit amazingly rich, quantum mechanical peaks
      and valleys,” Greene told The Telegraph’s Roger Highfield in 2012.<br>
      <br>
      We’re looking forward to seeing what happens with them now.<b><br>

        Abstract<br>
        <br>
      </b>Engineering molecules with a tunable bond length and defined
      quantum states lies at the heart of quantum chemistry. The
      unconventional binding mechanism of Rydberg molecules makes them a
      promising candidate to implement such tunable molecules. A very
      peculiar type of Rydberg molecules are the so-called butterfly
      molecules, which are bound by a shape resonance in the
      electron–perturber scattering. Here we report the observation of
      these exotic molecules and employ their exceptional properties to
      engineer their bond length, vibrational state, angular momentum
      and orientation in a small electric field. Combining the variable
      bond length with their giant dipole moment of several hundred
      Debye, we observe counter-intuitive molecules which locate the
      average electron position beyond the internuclear distance...<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>New US research suggests emulsifiers commonly used in
      processed foods may trigger colon cancer and may be to blame for
      the increase in incidence of the disease.<br>
      <br>
      A common food additive used to extend shelf life promotes the
      growth of colon cancer in mice, according to a new study.<br>
      <br>
      Emulsifiers are added to most processed foods to aid texture and
      keep them fresh but the findings of the US study, published in
      journal Cancer Research, suggests they are toxic to the body and
      potentially deadly.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers at Georgia State University found regular consumption
      of dietary emulsifiers in mice exacerbated tumour development.<br>
      <br>
      It's believed the emulsifiers alter the microbiota inside the
      intestines to create the ideal conditions for cancer growth.<br>
      <br>
      The team of researchers fed mice with two very commonly used
      emulsifiers, polysorbate 80 and carboxymethylcellulose.<br>
      <br>
      They observed that consuming the emulsifiers drastically changed
      the composition of the gut microbiota in a manner that made it
      more inflamed. This change in the intestinal microbiota enhanced
      tumour development.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Emilie Viennois, who led the study, says the findings support
      the belief that environmental factors have played a pivotal role
      in the dramatic increase in the incidence of colorectal cancer.<br>
      <br>
      "The incidence of colorectal cancer has been markedly increasing
      since the mid-20th century," said Dr Viennois.<br>
      <br>
      "A key feature of this disease is the presence of an altered
      intestinal microbiota that creates a favourable niche for
      tumorigenesis," he said.<br>
      <br>
      In Australia, bowel cancer is the second most common cancer in
      both men and women and is more common in people over the age of
      50.<br>
      <br>
      Bowel cancer, also known as colorectal cancer, develops from the
      inner lining of the bowel and is preceded by growths called
      polyps, which may become invasive cancer if undetected.<br>
      <br>
      The risk of being diagnosed by age 85 is 1 in 11 for men and 1 in
      15 for women.<br>
      <br>
      It is the country's second biggest cancer killer, second to lung
      cancer, with more than 4000 deaths in 2013.<br>

            New Study: All 3 WTC Towers Collapsed Due to Controlled

      <br>
      Over the past 15 years many highly respected academics and experts
      have come forward to challenge the official narrative on the
      collapse of the WTC towers forwarded by the U.S. government. The
      official government position holds that the collapse of all three
      towers was due to intense heat inside of the buildings.<br>
      <br>
      But a new forensic investigation into the collapse of the three
      World Trade Center towers on 9/11, published in Europhysics News –
      a highly respected European physics magazine – claims that “the
      evidence points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that all three
      buildings were destroyed by controlled demolition.”<br>
      <br>
      While many in the mainstream have attempted to label anyone
      questioning the official narrative as “tin foil hat” conspiracy
      theorist, many highly respected experts have come forward to
      lampoon the idea that the buildings collapsed due to the intense
      heat and fires following two terrorist-directed plane crashes.<br>
      <br>
      “Given the far-reaching implications, it is morally imperative
      that this hypothesis be the subject of a truly scientific and
      impartial investigation by responsible authorities,” the four
      physicists conclude in the damning report.<br>
      <br>
      The new study is the work of Steven Jones, former full professor
      of physics at Brigham Young University, Robert Korol, a professor
      emeritus of civil engineering at McMaster University in Ontario,
      Canada, Anthony Szamboti, a mechanical design engineer with over
      25 years of structural design experience in the aerospace and
      communications industries and Ted Walter, the director of strategy
      and development for Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 Truth, a
      nonprofit organization that today represents more than 2,500
      architects and engineers.<br>
      <br>
      The comprehensive study in Europhysics Magazine directly
      challenges the official narrative and lends to a growing body of
      evidence that seriously questions the veracity of the government
      narrative.<br>
      <br>
      In 2002, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
      remarked that the case was exceptionally bizarre. There were no
      other known cases of total structural collapses in high-rise
      buildings caused by fires and so it is deeply unusual that it
      should have happened three times in the space of one day, noted
      NIST.<br>
      <br>
      Official investigations have never been able to thoroughly and
      coherently explain how this might have happened and various teams
      tasked with examining the collapse have raised difficult questions
      about the veracity of the government’s story.<br>
      <br>
      Perhaps most damning of all, the experts claimed that after a
      thorough forensic analysis of video footage of the building’s
      collapse, it revealed signs of a controlled implosion.
      Additionally, Jones has co-authored a number of papers documenting
      evidence of unreacted nano-thermitic material in the WTC dust.<br>
      <br>
      The authors of the study note that the buildings fell with such
      speed and symmetry that they there was no other feasible
      explanation for the sudden collapse at free fall speeds – directly
      refuting studies that attempted to debunk the idea that the
      building fell without resistance. <br>
      <br>
      These respected experts’ new forensic analysis only adds to the
      growing movement of people calling for a new and impartial
      investigation into the collapse of the World Trade Center.<br>
      <br>
      Revealing the scope and breadth of public disbelief in the
      official government narrative surrounding the events of 9/11, even
      presidential candidate Jill Stein has recently called for a new
      investigation.<br>

        <br>
        <b>By NATHANIEL RICH</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>After more than 4,000 years — almost since the dawn of
      recorded time, when Utnapishtim told Gilgamesh that the secret to
      immortality lay in a coral found on the ocean floor — man finally
      discovered eternal life in 1988. He found it, in fact, on the
      ocean floor. The discovery was made unwittingly by Christian
      Sommer, a German marine-biology student in his early 20s. He was
      spending the summer in Rapallo, a small city on the Italian
      Riviera, where exactly one century earlier Friedrich Nietzsche
      conceived “Thus Spoke Zarathustra”: “Everything goes, everything
      comes back; eternally rolls the wheel of being. Everything dies,
      everything blossoms again. . . .”<br>
      <br>
      Sommer was conducting research on hydrozoans, small invertebrates
      that, depending on their stage in the life cycle, resemble either
      a jellyfish or a soft coral. Every morning, Sommer went snorkeling
      in the turquoise water off the cliffs of Portofino. He scanned the
      ocean floor for hydrozoans, gathering them with plankton nets.
      Among the hundreds of organisms he collected was a tiny,
      relatively obscure species known to biologists as Turritopsis
      dohrnii. <br>
      <br>
      Today it is more commonly known as the immortal jellyfish.<br>
      <br>
      Sommer kept his hydrozoans in petri dishes and observed their
      reproduction habits. After several days he noticed that his
      Turritopsis dohrnii was behaving in a very peculiar manner, for
      which he could hypothesize no earthly explanation. Plainly
      speaking, it refused to die. It appeared to age in reverse,
      growing younger and younger until it reached its earliest stage of
      development, at which point it began its life cycle anew.<br>
      <br>
      Sommer was baffled by this development but didn’t immediately
      grasp its significance. (It was nearly a decade before the word
      “immortal” was first used to describe the species.) But several
      biologists in Genoa, fascinated by Sommer’s finding, continued to
      study the species, and in 1996 they published a paper called
      “Reversing the Life Cycle.” The scientists described how the
      species — at any stage of its development — could transform itself
      back to a polyp, the organism’s earliest stage of life, “thus
      escaping death and achieving potential immortality.” This finding
      appeared to debunk the most fundamental law of the natural world —
      you are born, and then you die... &amp;c.<b><br>

      The jellyfish "Turritopsis nutricula" from the Mediterranean
      region has the ability to reprogram their genes and to be young
      again. It would therefore be logical to use the DNA of jellyfish,
      in which the rejuvenation program is coded, to find application in
      the human field. So you take the chromosomes of the jellyfish,
      extract from the DNA and mince them. In tablet form you could try
      a taper so in humans. <br>

      </b>More than 4,000 political appointees, many of whom hold
      important leadership and policymaking positions, will be heading
      out the door next year with the change in administrations. Finding
      qualified people to fill these jobs is an enormous undertaking,
      but it is critically important to making the federal government
      work effectively for the American public.<br>
      <br>
      There are four basic types of appointments:<br>
      <br>
      Presidential Appointments with Senate Confirmation (PAS): There
      are 1,212 senior leaders, including the Cabinet secretaries and
      their deputies, the heads of most independent agencies and
      ambassadors, who must be confirmed by the Senate. These positions
      first require a Senate hearing in addition to background checks
      and other vetting.<br>
      <br>
      Presidential Appointments without Senate Confirmation (PA): There
      are 353 PA positions which make up much of the White House staff,
      although they are also scattered throughout many of the smaller
      federal agencies.<br>
      <br>
      Non-career Senior Executive Service (NA): Members of the Senior
      Executive Service (SES) work in key positions just below the top
      presidential appointees, bridging the gap between the political
      leaders and the civil service throughout the federal government.
      Most SES members are career officials, but up to 10 percent of the
      SES can be political appointees. <br>

      Schedule C Appointments (SC): There are 1,403 Schedule C
      appointees who serve in a confidential or policy role. They range
      from schedulers and confidential assistants to policy experts.<br>
      <br>
      Among other things, the chart below shows high numbers of PAS
      positions in the State and Justice Departments. That’s due to the
      hundreds of ambassadors, U.S. Attorneys, and U.S. Marshals, all of
      whom require Senate confirmation. You can also see that nearly a
      third of the total number of PA positions are concentrated in the
      Executive Office of the President.<br>
      <br>
      The scale and breadth of the task of making so many critical
      appointments is daunting, and underscores the need for transition
      teams to get started early in order to fully staff the leadership
      of the next administration.<br>

            It Puts Holes In Mice Brains</b><br>
        </big><br>
        <b>By Vicki Batts</b><br>
        <br>
      </div>
      Aspartame is a substance that has been relentlessly scrutinized by
      the natural health community, and yet also receives an astonishing
      amount of praise from many mainstream medical practitioners. It's
      heralded as a safe alternative to sugar - and some big businesses
      have even tried to pretend that their aspartame-loaded diet
      beverages could even be better than water. Sugar-free sweets,
      beverages and baked goods make it an easy concept for the majority
      to hold on to; it allows them to have what they want, guilt-free.<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, the history of how aspartame came to be a societal
      mainstay is not a sweet one. Before becoming legal, aspartame was
      banned twice by the FDA. According to The Daily Health Post, in
      1977, aspartame triggered the first criminal investigation of a
      manufacturer to ever be launched by the agency. The FDA went on to
      ban aspartame in 1980, after having three separate independent
      scientists study the sweetener.<br>
      <br>
      Why? Because they found that there was a strong risk for aspartame
      to cause brain tumors. And of course, aspartame consumption is
      linked to a whole host of other health issues. According to New
      Zealand's Safe Food Campaign, aspartame is linked to more health
      problems than MSG - a substance that is widely regarded as
      unhealthy and toxic.<br>
      <br>
      Emails belonging to John Podesta that were released by WikiLeaks,
      didn't just provide a broader view of establishment corruption;
      they also uncovered concerns about NutraSweet, which is primarily
      comprised of aspartame. A person identified as Wendy Abrams
      forwarded an email chain about NutraSweet to Podesta in 2015. <br>
      <br>
      Abrams had been emailing a man identified as Don Kennedy, and
      expressed her concern about the addition of aspartame to chocolate
      milk used in school lunches. Chocolate milk is consumed at a ratio
      of 4 to 1, compared to plain white milk. <br>
      <br>
      Abrams writes, "The current proposal from the Dairy lobby is to
      put NutraSweet in the chocolate milk we serve to school children."
      She also expresses her belief that this effort needs to be brought
      to a grinding halt.<br>
      <br>
      In another email with Kennedy, Abrams writes about her own
      negative experiences with aspartame. She said that in college, she
      drank so many beverages sweetened with NutraSweet that she
      developed exercise-induced asthma and headaches. Abrams also made
      note of concerning information she had acquired.<br>
      <br>
      "I also have a friend who worked for the researchers at University
      of Chicago (which has a top rated neurology dept) and the doctors
      there said when they gave nutrasweet to lab mice, it literally
      blew holes in their brains. <br>
      <br>
      They said they will tell a pregnant woman to drink any amount of
      alcohol before touching a sip of nutrasweet, it is that bad."<br>
      <br>
      Kennedy responds by noting that he too has had great concerns over
      artificial sweeteners, and by divulging some concerning details
      about how aspartame finally came to be legalized. He explains that
      the day after Ronald Reagan's inauguration, January 21, 1981,
      Searle - the original developer of aspartame - applied to the FDA
      for approval to use aspartame in food sweetener for a second time.
      Arthur Hayes Hull, Jr., Reagan's newly appointed FDA commissioner,
      proceeded to appoint a 5-person scientific commission to review
      the board of inquiry's decision.<br>
      <br>
      When it became clear that the panel was going to uphold the ban
      with a 3-2 decision, Hull placed a sixth member on the commission
      so the vote would become deadlocked. Then Hull personally broke
      the tie in aspartame's favor. <br>
      <br>
      Kennedy writes, "Hull later left the FDA under allegations of
      impropriety, served briefly as Provost at New York Medical
      College, and then took a position with Burston-Marsteller, the
      chief public relations firm for both Monsanto and GD Searle. Since
      that time he has never spoken publicly about aspartame."<br>
      <br>
      Does that seem a little suspicious to you? What is perhaps more
      upsetting is that people are aware this substance was approved
      under false pretenses, and yet no one has done anything to end its
      reign in American food.<br>
      <br>
      It's also worth noting that Monsanto acquired the patent on
      aspartame during the mid-80s. <br>
      <br>
      Perhaps that has something to do with it?<br>

          healthy mice</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Safety of NMN being tested in small clinical trial</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Much of human health hinges on how well the body manufactures and
      uses energy. For reasons that remain unclear, cells' ability to
      produce energy declines with age, prompting scientists to suspect
      that the steady loss of efficiency in the body's energy supply
      chain is a key driver of the aging process.<br>
      <br>
      Now, scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St.
      Louis have shown that supplementing healthy mice with a natural
      compound called NMN can compensate for this loss of energy
      production, reducing typical signs of aging such as gradual weight
      gain, loss of insulin sensitivity and declines in physical
      activity.<br>
      <br>
      The study is published Oct. 27 in the journal Cell Metabolism.<br>
      <br>
      "We have shown a way to slow the physiologic decline that we see
      in aging mice," said Shin-ichiro Imai, MD, PhD, a professor of
      developmental biology and of medicine. "This means older mice have
      metabolism and energy levels resembling that of younger mice.
      Since human cells rely on this same energy production process, we
      are hopeful this will translate into a method to help people
      remain healthier as they age."<br>
      <br>
      Imai is working with researchers conducting a clinical trial to
      test the safety of NMN in healthy people. The phase 1 trial began
      earlier this year at Keio University School of Medicine in Tokyo.<br>
      <br>
      With age, the body loses its capacity to make a key element of
      energy production called NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide).
      Past work by Imai and co-senior author Jun Yoshino, MD, PhD, an
      assistant professor of medicine, has shown that NAD levels
      decrease in multiple tissues as mice age. Past research also has
      shown that NAD is not effective when given directly to mice so the
      researchers sought an indirect method to boost its levels. To do
      so, they only had to look one step earlier in the NAD supply chain
      to a compound called NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide).<br>
      <br>
      NMN can be given safely to mice and is found naturally in a number
      of foods, including broccoli, cabbage, cucumber, edamame and
      avocado. The new study shows that when NMN is dissolved in
      drinking water and given to mice, it appears in the bloodstream in
      less than three minutes. Importantly, the researchers also found
      that NMN in the blood is quickly converted to NAD in multiple
      tissues.<br>
      <br>
      "We wanted to make sure that when we give NMN through drinking
      water, it actually goes into the blood circulation and into
      tissues," Imai said. "Our data show that NMN absorption happens
      very rapidly."<br>
      <br>
      To determine the long-term effects of giving NMN, Imai, Yoshino
      and their colleagues studied three groups of healthy male mice fed
      regular mouse chow diets. Starting at five months of age, one
      group received a high dose of NMN-supplemented drinking water,
      another group received a low dose of the NMN drinking water, and a
      third group served as a control, receiving no NMN. The researchers
      compared multiple aspects of physiology between the groups, first
      at 5 months of age and then every three months, until the mice
      reached 17 months of age. Typical laboratory mice live about two
      years.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers found a variety of beneficial effects of NMN
      supplementation, including in skeletal muscle, liver function,
      bone density, eye function, insulin sensitivity, immune function,
      body weight and physical activity levels. But these benefits were
      seen exclusively in older mice.<br>
      <br>
      "When we give NMN to the young mice, they do not become healthier
      young mice," Yoshino said. "NMN supplementation has no effect in
      the young mice because they are still making plenty of their own
      NMN. We suspect that the increase in inflammation that happens
      with aging reduces the body's ability to make NMN and, by
      extension, NAD."<br>
      <br>
      In skeletal muscle, the investigators -- including the study's
      first author, Kathryn Mills, the research supervisor in Imai's lab
      -- found that NMN administration helps energy metabolism by
      improving the function of mitochondria, which operate as cellular
      power plants. They also found that mice given NMN gained less
      weight with aging even as they consumed more food, likely because
      their boosted metabolism generated more energy for physical
      activity. The researchers also found better function of the mouse
      retina with NMN supplementation, as well as increased tear
      production, which is often lost with aging. They also found
      improved insulin sensitivity in the older mice receiving NMN, and
      this difference remained significant even when they corrected for
      differences in body weight.<br>
      <br>
      In a paper published earlier this year in Cell Reports, Yoshino
      and his colleagues revealed more details of how NAD works in
      influencing glucose metabolism and the body's fat tissue. In that
      study, the mice had a defect in the ability to manufacture NAD
      only in the body's fat tissue. The rest of their tissues and
      organs were normal.<br>
      <br>
      "Even though NAD synthesis was stopped only in the fat tissue, we
      saw metabolic dysfunction throughout the body, including the
      skeletal muscle, the heart muscle, the liver and in measures of
      the blood lipids," Yoshino said. "When we gave NMN to these mice,
      these dysfunctions were reversed. That means NAD in adipose tissue
      is a critical regulator of whole body metabolism."<br>
      <br>
      Added Imai, "This is important because Jun showed that if you mess
      up NAD synthesis only in fat tissue, you see insulin resistance
      everywhere. Adipose tissue must be doing something remarkable to
      control whole body insulin sensitivity."<br>
      <br>
      During the long-term NMN study in healthy mice, Imai also said
      they monitored the animals for any potential increase in cancer
      development as a result of NMN administration.<br>
      <br>
      "Some tumor cells are known to have a higher capability to
      synthesize NAD, so we were concerned that giving NMN might
      increase cancer incidence," Imai said. "But we have not seen any
      differences in cancer rates between the groups."<br>
      <br>
      The phase 1 trial in Japan is using NMN manufactured by Oriental
      Yeast Co., which also provided the NMN used in these mouse
      studies. Outside of this clinical trial, high-grade NMN for human
      consumption is not commercially available. But there's always
      broccoli.<br>

      </b><b>Summary</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      NAD+ availability decreases with age and in certain disease
      conditions. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a key NAD+
      intermediate, has been shown to enhance NAD+ biosynthesis and
      ameliorate various pathologies in mouse disease models. In this
      study, we conducted a 12-month-long NMN administration to regular
      chow-fed wild-type C57BL/6N mice during their normal aging. Orally
      administered NMN was quickly utilized to synthesize NAD+ in
      tissues. Remarkably, NMN effectively mitigates age-associated
      physiological decline in mice. Without any obvious toxicity or
      deleterious effects, NMN suppressed age-associated body weight
      gain, enhanced energy metabolism, promoted physical activity,
      improved insulin sensitivity and plasma lipid profile, and
      ameliorated eye function and other pathophysiologies. Consistent
      with these phenotypes, NMN prevented age-associated gene
      expression changes in key metabolic organs and enhanced
      mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and mitonuclear protein
      imbalance in skeletal muscle. These effects of NMN highlight the
      preventive and therapeutic potential of NAD+ intermediates as
      effective anti-aging interventions in humans.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      A new compound, discovered jointly by international pharmaceutical
      company Servier, headquartered in France, and Vernalis (R&amp;D),
      a company based in the U<br>
      K, has been shown by researchers at the Walter and Eliza Hall
      Institute and Servier to block a protein that is essential for the
      sustained growth of up to a quarter of all cancers. <br>
      <br>
      The research presents a new way to efficiently kill these
      cancerous cells and holds promise for the treatment of blood
      cancers such as acute myeloid leukaemia, lymphoma and multiple
      myeloma, as well as solid cancers such as melanoma and cancers of
      the lung and breast. It is published online today in the journal
      Nature.<br>
      <br>
      The Servier compound - S63845 - targets a protein of the BCL2
      family, called MCL1, which is essential for the sustained survival
      of these cancer cells<br>
      <br>
      Institute scientist Associate Professor Guillaume Lessene, who led
      the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute’s research team in Melbourne,
      Australia, said the work provided the first clear preclinical
      evidence that inhibiting MCL1 was effective in targeting several
      cancer types.<br>
      <br>
      “MCL1 is important for many cancers because it is a pro-survival
      protein that allows the cancerous cells to evade the process of
      programmed cell death that normally removes cancer cells from the
      body,” Associate Professor Lessene said. “Extensive studies
      performed in a variety of cancer models have shown that S63845
      potently targets cancer cells dependent on MCL1 for their
      survival.” <br>
      <br>
      The institute team of Associate Professor Lessene worked with
      haematologist Associate Professor Andrew Wei and Dr Donia
      Moujalled from The Alfred Hospital and Servier scientists, to
      demonstrate that not only was S63845 effective against several
      cancer types, but that it could also be delivered at doses that
      were well tolerated by normal cells.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Olivier Geneste, Director of Oncology Research at Servier, said
      this preclinical research represented major findings regarding the
      druggability of MCL1, a valuable and highly challenging target.
      “S63845 was discovered through collaboration with the fragment and
      structure based discovery expertise at Vernalis,” he said. “As
      part of the ongoing Servier / Novartis collaboration on this
      target class, clinical development of a MCL1 inhibitor should be
      launched in the near future.” <br>
      <br>
      Associate Professor Lessene said the research provided further
      evidence of the usefulness of a new class of anti-cancer drugs
      called BH3 mimetics. “BH3 mimetics inhibit a group of proteins
      known as the ‘pro-survival BCL-2 proteins’,” he said. “MCL1 is a
      member of this protein family, and inhibiting it activates the
      process of programmed cell death. Walter and Eliza Hall Institute
      researchers revealed the role of BCL-2 in cancer more than 28
      years ago and the essential role of MCL1 for the survival of
      malignant cells four years ago.”<br>

      Prof. Jerry Kroth, a psychologist, looks at that question. What
      brings down an Empire?<br>
      <br>
      Kroth looks at things slightly differently from financial pundits
      and stock market gurus. Instead of economics, he looks through the
      prism of social science. Which country produces over 80% of
      hardcore porn in the world? Which country has the highest rate of
      rape? What is the truth behind horror films or reality shows such
      a Fear Factor?<br>
      <br>
      For example, while Mr Trump continues to claim that Climate Change
      is just Chinese propaganda, what toll is Climat Change, and its
      ensuing natural disasters since 1982, actually having on the US? <br>

      </div>
      <br>
      A recent poll asked Americans if they felt America actually was an
      empire. Forty percent said "No." Lawrence Vance alleges the U.S.
      is the largest empire in the history of the world, dwarfing the
      British, Ottoman, and Roman empires in size and scope. Prof. Jerry
      Kroth looks at the delusion and denial rampant within the American
      population on this issue, examining our 55 military interventions
      since World War II, our long and close relationship with
      dictators, juntas, and monarchs in building our empire, our
      military presence in over 130 countries of the world (70% of the
      planet) and what life might look like if we actually dismantled
      it. This lecture is based on Dr. Kroth'd book Duped! delusion,
      denial, and the end of the American dream. However Duped has been
      replaced by a newer edition: Implosion: delusion, denial, and the
      prospect of collapse; coming out shortly. More info at

        <i>New study demonstrates silent, eyes-free text entry</i><i><br>
        </i></div>

      It's not exactly beating something into someone's head. More like
      tapping it into the side.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have developed
      a system that teaches people Morse code within four hours using a
      series of vibrations felt near the ear. Participants wearing
      Google Glass learned it without paying attention to the signals --
      they played games while feeling the taps and hearing the
      corresponding letters. After those few hours, they were 94 percent
      accurate keying a sentence that included every letter of the
      alphabet and 98 percent accurate writing codes for every letter.<br>
      <br>
      This is the latest chapter of passive haptic learning (PHL)
      studies at Georgia Tech. The same method -- using vibrations while
      participants aren't paying attention -- has taught people braille,
      how to play the piano and improved hand sensation for those with
      partial spinal cord injury.<br>
      <br>
      The PHL projects are all led by Georgia Tech Professor Thad
      Starner and his Ph.D. student Caitlyn Seim. The team decided to
      use Glass for this study because it has both a built-in speaker
      and tapper (Glass's bone-conduction transducer).<br>
      <br>
      In the study, participants played a game while feeling vibration
      taps between their temple and ear. The taps represented the dots
      and dashes of Morse code and passively "taught" users through
      their tactile senses -- even while they were distracted by the
      game.<br>
      <br>
      The taps were created when researchers sent a very low-frequency
      signal to Glass's speaker system. At less than 15 Hz, the signal
      was below hearing range but, because it was played very slowly,
      the sound was felt as a vibration.<br>
      <br>
      Half of the participants in the study felt the vibration taps and
      heads a voice prompt for each corresponding letter. The other half
      -- the control group -- felt no taps to help them learn.<br>
      <br>
      Participants were tested throughout the study on their knowledge
      of Morse code and their ability to type it. After less than four
      hours of feeling every letter, everyone was challenged to type the
      alphabet in Morse code in a final test.<br>
      <br>
      The control group was accurate only half the time. Those who felt
      the passive cues were nearly perfect.<br>
      <br>
      The research was recently presented in Germany at the 20th
      International Symposium on Wearable Computers.<br>
      <br>
      "Does this new study mean that people will rush out to learn Morse
      code? Probably not," said Starner. "It shows that PHL lowers the
      barrier to learn text-entry methods -- something we need for
      smartwatches and any text-entry that doesn't require you to look
      at your device or keyboard."<br>
      <br>
      Previous research on PHL used custom hardware to provide the
      tactile stimuli, but here researchers use an existing wearable
      device.<br>
      <br>
      "This research also shows that other common devices with an
      actuator could be used for passive haptic learning," he says.
      "Your smartwatch, Bluetooth headset, fitness tracker or phone."<br>
      <br>
      "In our Braille and piano PHL studies, people felt vibrations on
      their fingers, then used their fingers for the task," said Seim.
      "This study was different and surprising. People were tapped on
      their heads, but the skill they learned was using their finger."<br>

          Cover-Up</b><br>

      Some scandals are so massive that they're simply hard to believe.
      As many as one million white English children may have been the
      victims of Muslim rape gangs, better known as grooming gangs, in
      towns up and down Great Britain. <br>
      <br>
      Policy analyst George Igler says, "When you encounter an issue
      that is just so unbelievable, just so outside your frame of
      reference and understanding, the immediate human reaction is just
      one to not believe it at all."<br>
      <br>
      Perhaps even harder to believe is that while there have been
      prosecutions, the British government has still not stopped this
      criminal activity...<br>
      <br>
      ISIS has publicly defended sexual slavery, saying, "enslaving the
      families of the infidels and taking their women as concubines is a
      firmly established aspect of the Sharia, or Islamic law."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Victims of a Multicultural Revolution</b><br>
      <br>
      The reason these crimes were covered up and continue to this day
      is political correctness. No one wanted to be called a racist.<br>
      <br>
      The definitive book on this scandal is "Easy Meat" by Peter
      McLoughlin, who declined an on-camera interview for safety
      reasons. He told us, "Journalists would not speak about it,
      because the perpetrators were mostly dark-skinned and Muslim.
      Childcare professionals used Political Correctness as an 'omerta,'
      a code of silence concerning what the public was allowed to know."<br>
      <br>
      "These girls are the victims of the multicultural revolution,"
      says Igler, "and it is certainly an indication of the fact that
      this accusation of racism is potentially the most powerful weapon
      known to man."&nbsp; "This is also an example of what can happen
      in a country of 60 million where the press just refuses to report;
      where the cries of all these agencies fail; fail to merely discuss
      what is going on." <br>
      <br>
      The cover up was eventually exposed, yet the grooming gangs
      continue to operate. One victim told a British newspaper, "Nothing
      has changed, not in the slightest. It's still the same scale as
      before."<br>
      <br>
      Igler said of the grooming gangs, "They get sexual kicks out of
      ruining the most precious possession that people have, their
      daughters."<br>
      <br>
      Stephen Lennon warned that there will be repercussions.<br>
      <br>
      He told us, "There's no blood on my hands, but there will be a lot
      of blood spilled in this country, and it will be on the hands of
      our leaders. And there will come a time when they will realize
      what they have done, and the country's people will realize what
      they've done, as well. They've sold us out. They've destroyed our
      nation. They've destroyed our culture."<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      Years of permissive multiculturalism is to blame for the rise of
      Sharia courts and the Rotherham rape scandal, an academic claimed
      yesterday.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Rumy Hasan, a senior lecturer at the University of Sussex’s
      Centre for Migration Research, said “do-what-you-want” and
      “laissez-faire” policies had let immigrant communities live as if
      they were still in countries such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.<br>
      <br>
      This has led to a “psychiatric detachment” from mainstream British
      culture, he added, which in turn leads to a “social detachment”
      where minority communities do not mix with wider society.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Hasan – who is a former Muslim – also said that Muslim rape
      gangs in towns such as Rochdale and Rotherham were an “inevitable
      consequence” of this.<br>
      <br>
      The Sun quotes him as saying: “The authorities in towns and cities
      — Rochdale, Rotherham, Oxford, Oldham, Birmingham — kept quiet
      because they were embarrassed.<br>
      <br>
      “It’s time we woke up and smelled the coffee.”...<br>

      </b><b>7. To treat eczema, make herbal lotion</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Six months after Lula Balmond was born, the Brighton-native began
      showing signs of chronic eczema. Red scaly rashes covered her
      entire body, and the irritation caused her to impulsively scratch
      until she bled, which often prevented her from sleeping. None of
      her doctors’ emollients and steroid creams alleviated the
      symptoms, so Lula’s mother Natalie set out to create her own
      remedy. After studying an old herbology book she got from a
      friend, she began experimenting with various herbs known for their
      gentle and calming effects, including beeswax, nettle, chickweed,
      and chamomile. After trial and error, she created the formula for
      a beeswax-based lotion that cleared her daughter’s eczema
      symptoms. Since then, Natalie has started an alternative herbals,
      lotions, and salves business, Purepotions. The skin treatment is
      called “Pure Potions Skin Salvation,” and is now recognized by the
      United Kingdom’s National Health Service as clinically effective.<br>

          Tomorrow </b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Whitley talks about the Day After Tomorrow and how, despite what
      most scientists are saying, the fossil record shows that extreme
      weather changes have happened in hours in the past and lasted for
      millennia. Then Jay Weidener on the mysteries of the Great Cross
      of Hendaye and the equally mysterious Fulcanelli, a Master of the
      Key-like man who revealed the cross's hidden code. Finally, Linda
      gets a scientist to admit that life is almost certainly on Mars.<br>
      <br>
      The Great Cross of Hendaye (French: Croix d'Hendaye) is a stone
      cross located on the town square of Hendaye, in the
      Pyrénées-Atlantiques, in southwestern France. A physical
      representation of the belief by ancient Christians, Rosicrucians,
      and alchemists that the world's end is rapidly approaching, and
      will occur in the midst of fire. Many, including devotees of
      Nostradamus, the Bible Code, and especially the 2012 phenomenon,
      believe that a great comet will pass by, or into, the earth in the
      year 2012 and interpret the Cross of Hendaye as another reminder
      that 2012 is the end.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fulcanelli's Deciphering: Base</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The four symbols found on the base are: Sun, Moon, Great Star, and
      a Simple circle. The circle is divided by two perpendicular
      diameters into four sectors in which there are four As displayed.<br>
      <br>
      The four As can be used to explain the four phases of the Great
      Cyclic Period in Medieval times. The four phases were represented
      either by: the four evangelists; by their symbolic letter, which
      is the Greek letter alpha; or by the four evangelical beasts
      surrounding Christ. These four quadrants are believed to stand for
      the four ages of the world. This symbolizes the diagram used to
      indicate the solar cycle, upon which the Galactic Alignment and
      procession rest.<br>
      <br>
      This traditional formula is often seen on the tympana of Roman
      porches. Where Jesus is shown seated with his left hand resting on
      a book and his right hand is raised in the gestures of
      benediction. He is separated from the four beasts which attend him
      by an ellipse, which is called the mystic almond. These groups are
      seen in many chapel and cathedrals throughout Europe, including
      Church of Templars at Luz in Hautes Pyrénées<br>
      <br>
      <b>Interpreting the Cross: End of the World</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Through analysis of all the alchemical symbols found on the cross,
      it is believed that the Cross of Hendaye is a physical
      representation of the belief that the world is quickly coming to
      an end. And, as the symbols suggest, the end of the world will
      occur in the midst of fire. This belief was brought upon by the
      ancient Christian group, the Rosicrucians, and alchemists. Many
      believe that the end will be the return of Christ as referenced in
      the Bible.<br>
      <br>
      As Jay Weidner sites Fulcanelli's quote, "The age of iron has no
      other seal than that of Death. Its hieroglyph is the skeleton,
      bearing the attributes of Saturn: the empty hourglass, symbols of
      time run out..."<br>
      The Great Cross of Hendaye is believed to describe the end of both
      the four ages of the Hindu Yoga system as well as the four ages of
      alchemical chronological time keeping. .<br>

        <br>
        <b>Mihai Andrei</b><br>

      <br>
      Researchers in Finland have developed a new device which can grow
      plant cell material from a seed culture, in a bioreactor. It
      develops all the proteins, fibres, and other plant-based
      compounds, offering you all the value of having your own
      greenhouse without any need for farming. They call it CellPod.<br>
      <br>
      “CellPod utilizes the possibilities of modern biotechnology,”
      researchers write on their page. “The technology allows to grow
      plant cell material from a seed culture. Basically any living
      plant, or combination of different plants can be used. After few
      days of growing the seed culture produces few liters of plant cell
      mass. It contains proteins, fibers and other beneficial compounds
      that the plants are naturally producing.”<br>
      <br>
      The reasoning for producing something like this is simple: due to
      urbanization and high population density in cities, bringing in
      food often comes at a great environmental cost. The food is also
      often not as tasty or nutritious as it should be, so people
      sometimes choose to grow their own. The only thing is that having
      a house greenhouse can be quite messy and time-consuming. This is
      where CellPod comes in.<br>
      <br>
      “Urbanisation and the environmental burden caused by agriculture
      are creating the need to develop new ways of producing food –
      CellPod is one of them. It may soon offer consumers a new and
      exciting way of producing local food in their own homes,” said
      research scientist Lauri Reuter, from the Technical Research
      Centre of Finland (VTT).<br>
      <br>
      Well it certainly looks nutritious. VTT<br>
      <br>
      Basically, you don’t grow the whole plant, just the ‘good’ parts –
      the ones you eat. You don’t cultivate the shrub or leaves. This
      means that the food won’t really look like proper fruits and
      instead will resemble a kind of oaty breakfast cereal. It also
      isn’t designed to grow full meals, but rather provide healthy
      supplements.<br>
      <br>
      “These cells contain the plant’s entire genetic potential, so they
      are capable of producing the same healthy compounds – such as
      antioxidants and vitamins – as the whole plant,” the team said.
      “The nutritional value of a cloudberry cell culture, for example,
      is similar to or even better than that of the berry itself.”<br>
      <br>
      So far, there’s been no peer-reviewed publication so we don’t
      really know how well it works and how nutritious the foods really
      are, but this idea seems to be picking up more and more steam.
      Just last month, a Kickstarter campaign successfully funded a
      product called the Nanofarm which allows people to grow their own
      food inside a climate controlled container. The future of food may
      be creeping up on us.<br>

      <b>What is CellPod?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is a new kind of kitchen appliance. For production of plant
      based food ingredients in your own home. It requires a starter
      pack –“the seed”, nutrients, sunlight and air. The same things as
      a plant growing in the field, but you do it more efficiently and
      quicker in the CellPod machine.<br>
      <br>
      CellPod utilizes the possibilities of modern biotechnology. The
      technology allows to grow plant cell material from a seed culture.
      Basically any living plant, or combination of different plants can
      be used. After few days of growing the seed culture produces few

      beneficial compounds that the plants are naturally producing. You
      get the same result as growing different plants in a greenhouse,
      but faster and it requires much less space than a greenhouse.<br>

      <br>
      Nature provides us with two alternatives for the origin of
      electromagnetic zero-point energy (ZPE): existence by fiat as part
      of the boundary conditions of the universe, or generation by the
      (quantum-fluctuation) motion of charged particles that constitute
      matter. A straightforward calculation of the latter possibility
      has been carried out in which it is assumed that the ZPE spectrum
      (field distribution) drives particle motion, and that the particle
      motion in turn generates the ZPE spectrum, in the form of a
      self-regenerating cosmological feedback cycle. The result is the
      appropriate frequency-cubed spectral distribution of the correct
      order of magnitude, thus indicating a dynamic-generation process
      for the ZPE fields.<br>

      <br>
      Relatively recent proposals have been made in the literature for
      extracting energy and heat from electromagnetic zero-point
      radiation via the use of the Casimir force. The basic
      thermodynamics involved in these proposals is analyzed and
      clarified here, with the conclusion that, yes, in principle, these
      proposals are correct. Technological considerations for actual
      application and use are not examined here, however.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Sakharov has proposed a suggestive model in which gravity is not a
      separately existing fundamental force, but rather an induced
      effect associated with zero-point fluctuations (ZPF’s) of the
      vacuum, in much the same manner as the van der Waals and Casimir
      forces. In the spirit of this proposal we develop a
      point-particle–ZPF interaction model that accords with and
      fulfills this hypothesis. In the model gravitational mass and its
      associated gravitational effects are shown to derive in a fully
      self-consistent way from electromagnetic-ZPF-induced particle
      motion (Zitterbewegung). Because of its electromagnetic-ZPF
      underpinning, gravitational theory in this form constitutes an
      ‘‘already unified’’ theory.<br>

      <br>
      It is shown that the principles of general relativity as developed
      by Sachs [1] can be used to explain the principles of the
      motionless electromagnetic generator (MEG), which takes
      electromagnetic energy from Riemannian curved space-time and in
      consequence outputs about twenty times more energy than inputted
      [2]. Therefore, it is shown in the most general manner that
      electromagnetic energy can be extracted from vacuum and used to
      power working devices such as the MEG, devices which are
      reproducible and repeatable [2].<br>

        </big></div>
      <big> </big><br>
      George Washington may not have been a prophet, but the concluding
      statements in his written inauguration address are coming to pass
      today!<br>
      <br>
      The last page of Washington’s speech, handwritten by the first
      president, himself, was discovered recently and sold at auction in
      London for $306,000. Washington had handwritten 60 pages intended
      to be delivered at his inauguration in New York City, April 30,
      1789. During the last century, each page of the discourse was sold
      to autograph hunters in America and Europe – a common practice in
      the 19th century. It is believed that the page was brought to
      England in the 1840s by the wife of Charles Lyell, a British
      scientist. The manuscript page was placed in an album of American
      memorabilia.<br>
      <br>
      According to a Reuter’s report, “the manuscript page was
      discovered under a sofa in an old autograph album in a house in
      Suffolk, a county in eastern England, by auctioneers who came to
      value the contents after the owner died.”<br>
      <br>
      Though Washington did not actually deliver this speech at the
      ceremony, opting for a shorter one instead, he clearly intended to
      share his vision of America’s future as a great nation that would
      not again submit to foreign rule… “until the people of America
      shall have lost all virtue: until they shall have become totally
      insensible to the difference between freedom and slavery: until
      they shall have been reduced to such poverty of spirit as to be
      willing to sell that pre-eminent blessing, the birthright of a
      freeman, for a mess of pottage: in short, until they have been
      found incapable of governing themselves and ripe for a master…”<br>
      <br>
      This was the message on the page sold at auction in London. There
      are four statements that appear to be coming to pass at this
      time...<br>

          cheaper way to generate solar-powered energy using aluminum
          before he even graduated high school. He took his first
          physics course just two years ago.</i><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      This kid is brighter than the lights his brilliant invention will
      one day power.<br>
      <br>
      Faizullah Mashriqi, 18, is waiting for a U.S. patent for his
      innovative solar energy-generating invention, which is meant to
      save consumers money.<br>
      <br>
      Using aluminum instead of costlier silicon, which carries an
      average $50,000 price tag per home, he found a cheaper way to
      produce the roof-mounted panels that harness the sun to create
      electricity.<br>
      <br>
      “Silicon is not economically feasible; it’s almost like taking out
      another mortgage,” said the Fresh Meadows dynamo, who graduated
      Francis Lewis High School last year with a straight-A average.
      “Aluminum, which is extremely abundant, costs nearly one-tenth
      less.”<br>
      <br>
      The ingenious idea had challenges, said Faizullah, a
      first-generation American whose parents are from Afghanistan.<br>
      <br>
      He and three other researchers had to pierce through the
      aluminum’s surface layer, which prevents electrons from moving
      freely. Researchers typically steer clear of the metal because of
      its aluminum oxide layer, the budding scientist said.<br>
      <br>
      It took two years of trial and error, but eventually they reached
      their goal.<br>
      <br>
      “It’s a great feeling. I know the work I did paid off,” said the
      topnotch teen whiz, who took his first physics course just two
      years ago. “This is only one part. There’s much more that we can
      do from here.”<br>
      <br>
      They filed their patent application two years ago, and it is
      published on the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office website.<br>
      <br>
      But they’ll have to wait a little longer before they get the
      office’s go-ahead to start developing and perfecting a product for
      worldwide distribution, said Dr. Alan N. Wolf, a patent lawyer who
      chairs Cooper Union’s physics department.<br>
      <br>
      That’s a task supporters say Faizullah — now a first year at
      CUNY's Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education program — is
      more than ready to conquer.<br>
      <br>
      “I knew he was a real mover and shaker since the very beginning,”
      said Dr. Bonnie Blackwell, who teaches science research at
      Faizullah’s alma mater. “It blows you away at times. He’s going be
      one of the great thinkers of his generation.”<br>

      </b><br>
      Silk is a naturally sourced fiber popular in textile applications
      not just for its beauty, but also for its mechanical strength, and
      one study has now reported that the gossamer threads become even
      stronger and tougher when silkworms are fed carbon nanotubes and
      graphene.<br>
      <br>
      Graphene, a carbon nanoparticle considered a “miracle material,”
      has shown massive potential in energy, electronics, medicine, and
      more. Silkworms, the larvae of silk moths, spin their threads from
      silk proteins produced in their salivary glands, so a study led by
      Yingying Zhang from Tsinghua University examined the effects of
      adding graphene to the silkworms’ diet of mulberry leaves.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers sprayed mulberry leaves with aqueous solutions
      containing 0.2 percent by weight of either carbon nanotubes or
      graphene, and then collected the silk after the worms spun their
      cocoons. Collecting the as-spun silk fibers is standard in silk
      production, so feeding the silkworms the carbon nanotubes and
      graphene was a much simpler method than treating regular silk with
      the nanomaterials dissolved in chemical solvents after collection.<br>
      <br>
      According to the study, the carbon-enhanced silk was twice as
      tough as regular silk and could withstand at least 50 percent
      higher stress before breaking. Zhang’s team tested conductivity
      and structure after heating the silk fibers at 1,050°C (1,922°F)
      to carbonize the silk protein, and unlike untreated silk, the
      carbon-enhanced silk conducted electricity. Additionally,
      spectroscopy and microscopic imaging showed that the modified silk
      fibers had a more ordered crystal structure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Textiles of the Future</b><br>
      <br>
      Garments made using smart textiles have so many more potential
      uses than those created using traditional materials. A conductive
      fabric using this carbon-enhanced silk could have applications in
      biomechanics, showing an athlete the tension and pressure applied
      on areas of the body during exertion. It could be used in tech for
      electronic clothing that can “talk to our smartphones,” and
      scientists creating biodegradable medical implants could
      potentially incorporate these enhanced silks into their work.<br>
      <br>
      According to materials scientist Yaopeng Zhang of Donghua
      University, the method used by the team at Tsinghua University is
      an “easy way to produce high-strength silk fibers on a large
      scale,” so we could be one step closer to an exciting future of
      readily available wearable tech that could improve the lives of
      everyone.<br>

      Silkworm silk is gaining significant attention from both the
      textile industry and research society because of its outstanding
      mechanical properties and lustrous appearance. The possibility of
      creating tougher silks attracts particular research interest.
      Carbon nanotubes and graphene are widely studied for their use as
      reinforcement. In this work, we report mechanically enhanced silk
      directly collected by feeding Bombyx mori larval silkworms with
      single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and graphene. We found that
      parts of the fed carbon nanomaterials were incorporated into the
      as-spun silk fibers, whereas the others went into the excrement of
      silkworms. Spectroscopy study indicated that nanocarbon additions
      hindered the conformation transition of silk fibroin from random
      coil and α-helix to β-sheet, which may contribute to increased
      elongation at break and toughness modules. We further investigated
      the pyrolysis of modified silk, and a highly developed graphitic
      structure with obviously enhanced electrical conductivity was
      obtained through the introduction of SWNTs and graphene. The
      successful generation of these SWNT- or graphene-embedded silks by
      in vivo feeding is expected to open up possibilities for the
      large-scale production of high-strength silk fibers.<br>

      <br>
      Silk — the stuff of lustrous, glamorous clothing — is very strong.
      Researchers now report a clever way to make the gossamer threads
      even stronger and tougher: by feeding silkworms graphene or
      single-walled carbon nanotubes (Nano Lett. 2016, DOI:
      10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b03597). The reinforced silk produced by the
      silkworms could be used in applications such as durable protective
      fabrics, biodegradable medical implants, and ecofriendly wearable
      electronics, they say.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers have previously added dyes, antimicrobial agents,
      conductive polymers, and nanoparticles to silk—either by treating
      spun silk with the additives or, in some cases, by directly
      feeding the additives to silkworms. Silkworms, the larvae of
      mulberry-eating silk moths, spin their threads from a solution of
      silk protein produced in their salivary glands.<br>
      <br>
      To make carbon-reinforced silk, Yingying Zhang and her colleagues
      at Tsinghua University fed the worms mulberry leaves sprayed with
      aqueous solutions containing 0.2% by weight of either carbon
      nanotubes or graphene and then collected the silk after the worms
      spun their cocoons, as is done in standard silk production.
      Treating already spun silk would require dissolving the
      nanomaterials in toxic chemical solvents and applying those to the
      silk, so the feeding method is simpler and more environmentally
      friendly.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast to regular silk, the carbon-enhanced silks are twice
      as tough and can withstand at least 50% higher stress before
      breaking. The team heated the silk fibers at 1,050 °C to carbonize
      the silk protein and then studied their conductivity and
      structure. The modified silks conduct electricity, unlike regular
      silk. Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy imaging showed
      that the carbon-enhanced silk fibers had a more ordered crystal
      structure due to the incorporated nanomaterials.<br>
      <br>
      Some questions remain. One is exactly how the silkworms
      incorporate the nanomaterials in their silk. Another is what
      percentage of the nanomaterials eaten by the worms make it into
      the silk instead of being excreted or otherwise metabolized. The
      carbon materials are not visible in the cross sections of the silk
      threads, perhaps because the nanoparticle content is low, Zhang
      says. Answering these questions might be a task for biologists,
      she adds.<br>
      <br>
      Polymer chemist Qing Shen at Donghua University reported similar
      work in 2014 using 30-nm-wide multiwalled carbon nanotubes, which
      also increased the silk fibers’ strength and toughness (Mater.
      Sci. Eng., C 2014, DOI: 10.1016/j.msec.2013.09.041). Zhang says
      that the smaller, 1- to 2-nm-wide single-walled nanotubes her team
      uses “are more suitable for incorporation into the crystalline
      structures of silk protein.”<br>
      <br>
      This work provides an “easy way to produce high-strength silk
      fibers on a large scale,” says materials scientist Yaopeng Zhang
      of Donghua University, who has fed titanium dioxide nanoparticles
      to silkworms to create superstrong silk resistant to ultraviolet
      degradation. The electrical conductivity of the carbon-reinforced
      silk might make it suitable for sensors embedded in smart textiles
      and to read nerve signals, he says.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Fuel from water becoming reality says
            Kiwi firm </b><br>
        </big></div>
      <big> </big><br>
      &nbsp;Imagine watering the garden, then turning the hose into your
      petrol tank and filling up the car.<br>
      <br>
      It has been a holy grail for an age, a water-based fuel. Well,
      that technology may already be here, claims small Kiwi company
      Bios Fuel.<br>
      <br>
      But scientists remain sceptical and say an engine running on water
      defies the laws of physics.<br>
      <br>
      Bios Fuel began with a concept in 1996, as founder Steve Ryan was
      tinkering with an old motorbike engine in an Auckland garage.<br>
      <br>
      He started to believe that burning the hydrogen contained in water
      in a combustion engine was not just science fiction.<br>
      <br>
      In 2002 he left a finance career to focus on researching the
      concept.<br>
      <br>
      Two years ago Mr Ryan went public, running a 350cc motorbike on
      water for the 60 Minutes television show.<br>
      <br>
      Now Bios Fuel is preparing to drive 3000 kilometres from Darwin to
      Adelaide on a blend of waste oil and water, as part of the
      Panasonic World Solar Challenge.<br>
      <br>
      Mr Ryan says the water-based fuel allows hydrogen to be housed
      safely in water and released.<br>
      <br>
      It is blended with waste oil for lubrication and a bonding agent,
      but the power comes from the water.<br>
      <br>
      Waikato University senior engineering lecturer Mike Duke is deeply
      sceptical of the claims.<br>
      <br>
      He says the problem is that the amount of energy needed to extract
      energy from water is greater than the energy produced.<br>
      <br>
      There was "a lot of pseudo science out there," Dr Duke said.
      "They're claiming something that I don't buy, but if they can
      prove it to me, then I'll buy them a beer."<br>
      <br>
      But Mr Ryan says the fuel runs via a normal combustion system -
      it's the delivery system that is the key and must remain under
      wraps.<br>
      <br>
      The Solar Challenge will demonstrate the potential of alternative
      fuel technology to operate in an extreme environment, says company
      spokesman Cam Feast.<br>
      <br>
      "It gives us the opportunity to show that recycling second- and
      third-generation waste is an option when emulsified with water."<br>
      <br>
      A battered old 1989 Land Cruiser with 400,000 kilometres on the
      clock will be used for the challenge.<br>
      <br>
      The implications of water-based fuels are huge, he says.<br>
      <br>
      "Water doesn't have to be spring-fed, it can be waste water, from
      your shower or sink, rainwater from the gutter, or seawater.<br>
      <br>
      Diesel engines can be run on very high percentages of water and
      small amounts of waste oil for lubrication. It requires no
      electricity, no heat, and emissions consist mainly of water
      vapour."<br>
      <br>
      So why isn't this technology already on the shelf?<br>
      <br>
      Mr Ryan says scepticism from the scientific community and the
      public remains the main barrier to water-fuel technology.<br>
      <br>
      He says there has been more support from the United States, and
      that is where Bio Fuels will focus its efforts.<br>
      <br>
      "New Zealand will still be the home base, but there's a need to go
      where the market is."<br>

            3000 km on Water and Waste Oil</b></big><br>

      Bios Fuel Corporation of New Zealand drove a 1989 Toyota
      Landcruiser 3000 kilometers across the Australian Desert, running
      a virtually unmodified diesel engine on their H2W+ fuel blend
      comprising of 40% Water and 60% Waste Mineral oil as part of the
      Panasonic World Solar Challenge that commenced in Darwin on
      October 21 and finished in Adelaide six days later.<br>
      <br>
      It was one of 18 vehicles participating in the "Greenfleet
      Technology Class", travelling alongside the solar-powered
      vehicles, demonstrating the potential of its alternate fuel mix.
      (Ref.)&nbsp; It broke down a couple of times, and helped a 60
      Minutes television crew that broke down.<br>
      <br>
      Bios Fuel claims to have developed a water-based fuel technology
      that allows hydrogen to be housed safely in water and released on
      demand for numerous applications.&nbsp; A proprietary catalyst
      allows water to be suspended in waste oil as an emulsion.&nbsp;
      The fuel is designed for power generation. It is one of several
      blends that Bios Fuel has certified to American ASTM standards.<br>
      <br>
      While it is not designed for vehicles, it ran well in the 1989
      Toyota Landcruiser Troop Carrier, or “Troupy” as they are
      affectionately called in the outback.&nbsp; “We thought testing in
      a harsh environment such as the Australian desert would
      demonstrate the viability of our fuel beyond doubt, and show that
      2nd and 3rd generation waste can be combined with water to provide
      an energy source”, said Bios Fuel founder and CEO Steve Ryan.
      “Using an old Troupy shows that you don’t necessarily have to
      compromise lifestyle to reduce your effect on the environment”. <br>
      <br>
      The waste oil was sourced directly from the local environment and
      mixed on location, with Panasonic World Solar Challenge
      scrutineers and officials ensuring transparency.&nbsp; The engine
      was also fitted with an Eco Tube™, which is a simple stainless
      steel heat exchanger that treats the fuel of internal combustion
      engines (petrol or diesel) with the heat generated by a vehicle’s
      cooling system to increase fuel economy and further reduce
      emissions.<br>
      <br>
      Emissions testing en route showed a total reduction in emissions
      of 90%, including a reduction of Nitrous Oxides or NOX, one of the
      worst greenhouse gases, by more than 80%. Fuel consumption of the
      Bios Fuels H2W+ blend was about the same as when using diesel. The
      heavily loaded vehicle consumed 17.77 litres of diesel per 100
      kilometres.<br>
      <br>
      Dynamometer tests back in New Zealand showed a similar engine
      running the H2W+ blend to be 10% more efficient than with diesel.
      <br>
      <br>
      By comparison a new Landcruiser consumes an average 11.9 litres of
      diesel per 100 kilometres. “[The Troupy]’s not the most efficient
      vehicle, and we had some issues resulting from choosing to blend
      and filter the fuel on location in Darwin with a very basic setup,
      but on the whole it ran really well,” said Ryan.<br>
      <br>
      Regarding running on of 40% Water and 60% Waste Mineral oil, Ryan
      said: “Both the reduction in emissions, particularly NOX, and the
      relative fuel consumption shows conclusively we are releasing the
      energy from water on demand. We’ve run up to 90% water in diesel
      engines back home, but in this environment, and our first public
      display, we thought we’d be a little conservative”.<br>
      <br>
      Breaking scientific tradition is not unfamiliar to Ryan and Bios
      Fuel. In 2005, 60 minutes featured him running a standard 350cc
      motorbike on 100% water using a process to entrain Hydrogen within
      the water, without the use of power. Similarly the process for
      emulsifying Waste Oils with water requires very little power and
      no heat, making production extremely economical.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      The Team Bios Fuel crew was supported by the NZ based tertiary
      institution WelTec and the Centre for Smart Product; one of NZ’s
      top development engineers, Tony Devos; and mechanic Andrea Mendoza
      from Auckland based Pitchix.<br>
      <br>
      Bios Fuel is opening two plants in the US to produce large
      quantities of waste recycled fuels before the end of the year. It
      also has joint ventures in New Zealand, Turkey and Chile, with
      further developments planned.<br>

      Inventor Steve Ryan from Auckland, New Zealand, is not a
      biochemist, his expertise is in financing. But he has developed
      process by which a stock Suzuki 350cc motorcycle can run on
      regular tap water (after it has been processed in his invention
      for approximately 40 minutes). His company, Biosfuel, is convinced
      that H2O is the power that will fuel the next commerical and
      industrial revolution. This New Zealand version of the 60 Minutes
      show aired last October in Australia. American companies such as
      Aquygen with their HHO fuel project feel Steve is right on about
      water technology as well. Rumors have been flying around about a
      water-powered Hummer to be released in the near future. I wonder
      why so few people on this side of the world have heard about this

      The website for Steve’s company is http://www.biosfuel.org. I just
      had to include his credo which was taken from the website and
      attributed to comments made by Henry Ford in 1922.<br>
      <br>
      Henry pretty much summed things up about his life’s work this way:<br>
      <br>
      I refuse to recognize that there are impossibilities. I cannot
      discover that any one knows enough about anything on this earth
      definitely to say what is and what is not possible.<br>
      <br>
      The right kind of experience, the right kind of technical
      training, ought to enlarge the mind and reduce the number of
      impossibilities.<br>
      <br>
      It unfortunately does nothing of the kind. Most technical training
      and the average of that which we call experience, provide a record
      of previous failures and, instead of these failures being taken
      for what they are worth, they are taken as absolute bars to
      progress.<br>
      <br>
      If some man, calling himself an authority, says that this or that
      cannot be done, then a hoard of unthinking followers start the
      chorus: “it can’t be done” -Henry Ford<br>
      <br>
      Obviously a man way ahead of his time. Thinking out of the box
      will never grow old.<br>

      Dr. Nun S. Amen Ra is a living testament to the power of
      intermittent fasting. He eats only one meal a day, eats no meat,
      yet has a warrior physique and is a world weight lifting champion.
      This inspirational video is so full of eye opening information
      about the vegan diet, maximum life extension, fasting, meditation,
      yoga, the dangers of glycation and how sugar ages the body. Eating
      less lengthens lifespan, where eating a lot shortens it. HGH human
      growth hormone is increased in the body when fasting. This is
      great inspiration for fat loss, healthy vegetarian diet, muscle
      building and how powerful the results can be when determination,
      focus, willpower and steadfastness can be attained. Amen-Ra eats
      beans, rice, grains, peanut butter and plant-based supplements and

        <i>Engineer Juan Baigorri Velar, is said to have made a device
          in the 1930's that could make it rain</i><i><br>

      <br>
      In Beyond Science, Epoch Times explores research and accounts
      related to phenomena and theories that challenge our current
      knowledge. We delve into ideas that stimulate the imagination and
      open up new possibilities. Share your thoughts with us on these
      sometimes controversial topics in the comments section below.<br>
      <br>
      “Let it rain, let it rain<br>
      Baigorri is in the cave<br>
      Plug in the device, and watch it rain…”<br>
      <br>
      An accordion accompanies these verses, dedicated to a man capable
      of reaching the sky. He is said to have made it rain in the middle
      of a drought.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      To combat the excesses of nature, some scientists have yearned to
      control the weather. But while controversial silver iodide
      cloud-seeding represents some of the more recent attempts at
      weather modification, one man is said to have invented an
      effective rainmaking machine in the 1930s. So did this mythical
      rainmaking machine really work as so many reports claimed?
      Unfortunately, we will probably never know.<br>
      <br>
      The inventor of this mysterious device, Argentinean born Juan
      Baigorri Velar, was a student of engineering. Later, he traveled
      to Italy to study Geophysics at the University of Milan. This
      training led him to accidentally construct what history would know
      as the “rainmaking machine.”<br>
      <br>
      Initially, Velar set out to make a device that could measure
      potential electricity and electromagnetic conditions of the Earth.
      But, in 1938, when working in the attic of his Buenos Aires home,
      he discovered that the device induced a little rain that dispersed
      amid his surroundings. Baigorri Velar realized that his little
      machine could be the start of something big.<br>
      <br>
      When the gifted scientist made it rain in some of the country’s
      more remote and driest regions, his mysterious machine quickly
      became the talk of Argentina. According to some accounts, Velar’s
      most memorable feat was his ability to bring rain over provinces
      that had seen droughts for many months or even years.<br>
      <br>
      In Santiago, Velar’s machine was said to have ended a drought that
      had lasted for one year and four months. Dr. Pio Montenegro noted
      that before Velar, the area hadn’t seen rain for three years. Yet
      in just two hours under the influence of Velar’s visit, the area
      saw 2.36 inches of rain.<br>
      <br>
      In Carhue, Velar was said to have made it rain enough to bring
      back an old lagoon. In 1951, in a rural area of San Juan where
      rain hadn’t fallen in eight years, Velar’s visit was said to have
      immediately produced 1.2 inches.<br>
      <br>
      Velar kept the internal workings of the machine a secret, but it’s
      known that it had an “A” circuit for slight drizzles and a “B”
      circuit for heavy rains.<br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Because the machine has disappeared, much of the “evidence” of
      Baigorri Velar’s revolutionary invention is in the form of
      national and foreign interviews.<br>
      <br>
      Velar was granted the nickname “Wizard of Villa Luro,” which
      naturally encouraged a flood of skeptics and nonbelievers,
      including the director of the National Meteorological Service,
      Alfred G. Galmarini. However, Galmarini’s insistence on
      discrediting Velar would make him the victim of his own demise
      when he challenged the “Lord of the Rain” to induce a storm on
      June 2 in 1939.<br>
      <br>
      Velar accepted the challenge. He was so confident in his machine
      that he sent Galmarini a raincoat with a note that read: “To be
      used on June 2nd.” True to his word, on that day, Velar’s miracle
      began to materialize. Clouds quickly began to form and turn dark.
      Then a deluge of divine proportions continued well into the next
      day.<br>
      <br>
      With these miraculous performances, one would think that Baigorri
      Velar and his machine were destined to earn a place in history,
      but who is familiar with the name today? Velar is said to have
      received a couple of foreign offers to buy his machine, but he
      refused, insisting that it was built to benefit Argentina.<br>
      <br>
      In 1972, Baigorri Velar (81) died poor and few knew of his great
      accomplishments. Nobody is sure what became of his enigmatic
      machine, but it is said that on the day he was buried, there was
      was huge downpour.<br>
      <br>
      The fame of Baigorri Velar has always been seen as questionable.
      Many continued to refute his machine, arguing that the weather it
      was said to create was merely a convenient coincidence.<br>

        </i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scientists discovered that a vitamin

        </i></div>
      <br>
      <b>A different approach</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Usually, curing a disease born of a genetic defect lies in fixing
      the problematic gene, like in the case of Duchenne muscular
      dystrophy. However, researchers from the Ecole Polytechnique
      Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) suggest a different approach. In a
      study published in Science Translational Medicine, a team led by
      Johan Auwerx discovered that a vitamin called nicotinamide
      riboside is highly effective in large doses for halting the
      progress of the disease in animals.<br>
      <br>
      Considered as one of the most severe and common forms of muscular
      dystrophy, Duchenne affects one out of every 3,500 children. It’s
      caused by a genetic mutation that disables the production of
      dystrophin, a protein required to keep muscles intact. The
      deformed cells mechanically cause inflammation that gradually
      destroy muscles.<br>
      <br>
      It leads to progressive general paralysis, and eventually death,
      due to respiratory failure. Children with this disease end up in a
      wheelchair by the age of 12.<br>
      <br>
      Auwerx and his team focused on the second cycle in the progression
      of Duchenne, where initial inflammation causes a certain gene to
      consume large amounts of NAD+ — an essential component serving as
      fuel for the mitochondria. NAD+ shortage in mitochondria weakens
      muscles and aggravate inflammation that further destroys muscles<br>
      Clinical tests within 2 years<br>
      <br>
      The researchers considered preventing this second cycle from
      occurring by sustaining the mitochondria through nicotinamide
      riboside, the vitamin precursor of NAD+. The approach was tested
      on C. elegans worms and on mice genetically modified to have the
      disease.<br>
      <br>
      The results were promising. After administering large doses of the
      vitamin, the worms did not have any of the symptoms of Duchenne’s
      second cycle. The mice, while demonstrating muscular inflammation
      at lower levels, showed reduced effects of muscular damage.<br>
      <br>
      “We have good reason to think that humans will also respond to
      this treatment and that we’ll be able to reduce inflammation,”
      explains Auwerx. While the water-soluble vitamin nicotinamide
      riboside is commercially available, clinical tests for viability
      on humans are expected within 2 years.<br>

      <b>Making a Time Crystal</b><br>
      <br>
      A time crystal, without going into much detail, is an object
      appearing to have movement while remaining at its ground state —
      an idea proposed by theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate Frank
      Wilczek in 2012. In an article published last month, we featured
      how “floquet time crystals” were theoretically possible, according
      to researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara
      (UCSB).<br>
      <br>
      This time, a team of scientists from the University of Maryland
      took the research further by actually building a working time
      crystal. The experiment involved creating a quantum system, where
      a group of ions form a ring shape structure cooled to their ground
      state.<br>
      <br>
      In order to observe the unobservable perpetual spontaneous break
      in time-translation symmetry of time crystals, the researchers
      used a quantum system that evolves over time.<br>
      <br>
      They used ytterbium ions, chaining them in an out-of-equilibrium
      state that localized them in a specific space, with spins
      interacting with one another. Then, a laser was used to change the
      spin of certain ytterbium ions, one after the other, creating
      continuous oscillation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>A Study in Strange</b><br>
      <br>
      The results were surprising: after observing and allowing the
      quantum system to evolve, the continuous interactions were
      occurring at twice the original period. “Since there is no driving
      force with that period, the only explanation is that the time
      symmetry must have been broken, thereby allowing these longer
      periods. In other words, [they] had created a time crystal,”
      according to MIT Technology Review.<br>

      We define what it means for time translation symmetry to be
      spontaneously broken in a quantum system and show with analytical

            (Update)</b></big><br>
        <br>
        <b>by Lisa Zyga</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Are time crystals just a mathematical curiosity, or could they
      actually physically exist? Physicists have been debating this
      question since 2012, when Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek first
      proposed the idea of time crystals. He argued that these
      hypothetical objects can exhibit periodic motion, such as moving
      in a circular orbit, in their state of lowest energy, or their
      "ground state." Theoretically, objects in their ground states
      don't have enough energy to move at all. <br>
      <br>
      In the years since, other physicists have proposed various
      arguments for why the physical existence of time crystals is
      impossible—and most physicists do seem to think that time crystals
      are physically impossible because of their odd properties. Even
      though time crystals couldn't be used to generate useful energy
      (since disturbing them makes them stop moving), and don't violate
      the second law of thermodynamics, they do violate a fundamental
      symmetry of the laws of physics.<br>
      <br>
      However, now in a new paper published in Physical Review Letters,
      physicists from the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB)
      and Microsoft Station Q (a Microsoft research lab located on the
      UCSB campus) have demonstrated that it may be possible for time
      crystals to physically exist.<br>
      <br>
      The physicists have focused on the implication of time crystals
      that seems most surprising, which is that time crystals are
      predicted to spontaneously break a fundamental symmetry called
      "time-translation symmetry." To understand what this means, the
      researchers explain what spontaneous symmetry breaking is.<br>
      <br>
      "The crucial difference here is between explicit symmetry breaking
      and spontaneous symmetry breaking," coauthor Dominic Else, a
      physicist at UCSB, told Phys.org. "If a symmetry is broken
      explicitly, then the laws of nature do not have the symmetry
      anymore; spontaneous symmetry breaking means that the laws of
      nature have a symmetry, but nature chooses a state that doesn't."<br>
      <br>
      If time crystals really do spontaneously break time-translation
      symmetry, then the laws of nature that govern time crystals
      wouldn't change with time, but the time crystals themselves would
      change over time due to their ground-state motion, spontaneously
      breaking the symmetry.<br>
      <br>
      "The crucial difference here is between explicit symmetry breaking
      and spontaneous symmetry breaking," coauthor Dominic Else, a
      physicist at UCSB, told Phys.org. "If a symmetry is broken
      explicitly, then the laws of nature do not have the symmetry
      anymore; spontaneous symmetry breaking means that the laws of
      nature have a symmetry, but nature chooses a state that doesn't."<br>
      <br>
      If time crystals really do spontaneously break time-translation
      symmetry, then the laws of nature that govern time crystals
      wouldn't change with time, but the time crystals themselves would
      change over time due to their ground-state motion, spontaneously
      breaking the symmetry.<br>
      <br>
      Although spontaneously broken time-translation symmetry has never
      been observed before, almost every other type of spontaneous
      symmetry breaking has been. One very common example of a
      spontaneously broken symmetry occurs in magnets. The laws of
      nature do not impose which side of a magnet will be the north pole
      and which will be the south pole. The distinguishing feature of
      any magnetic material, however, is that it spontaneously breaks
      this symmetry and chooses one side to be the north pole. Another
      example is ordinary crystals. Although the laws of nature are
      invariant under rotating or shifting (translating) space, crystals
      spontaneously break these spatial symmetries because they look
      different when viewed from different angles and when shifted a
      little bit in space.<br>
      <br>
      In their new study, the physicists specifically define what it
      would take to spontaneously break time-translation symmetry, and
      then use simulations to predict that this broken symmetry should
      occur in a large class of quantum systems called
      "Floquet-many-body-localized driven systems." The scientists
      explain that the key aspect of these systems is that they remain
      far from thermal equilibrium at all times, so the system never
      heats up.<br>
      <br>
      The new definition of broken time-translation symmetry is similar
      to the definitions of other broken symmetries. Basically, when the
      size of a system (such as a crystal) grows, the time taken for a
      symmetry-breaking state to decay into a symmetry-respecting state
      increases, and in an infinite system the symmetry-respecting state
      can never be reached. As a result, symmetry for the entire system
      is broken.<br>
      <br>
      "The significance of our work is two-fold: on one hand, it
      demonstrates that time-translation symmetry is not immune to being
      spontaneously broken," said coauthor Bela Bauer, a researcher at
      Microsoft Station Q. "On the other hand, it deepens our
      understanding that non-equilibrium systems can host many
      interesting states of matter that cannot exist in equilibrium
      systems."<br>
      <br>
      According to the physicists, it should be possible to perform an
      experiment to observe time-translation symmetry breaking by using
      a large system of trapped atoms, trapped ions, or superconducting
      qubits to fabricate a time crystal, and then measure how these
      systems evolve over time. The scientists predict that the systems
      will exhibit the periodic, oscillating motion that is
      characteristic of time crystals and indicative of spontaneously
      broken time-translation symmetry.<br>
      <br>
      "In collaboration with experimental research groups, we are
      exploring the possibility of realizing Floquet time crystals in
      systems of cold atomic gases," said coauthor Chetan Nayak at
      Microsoft Station Q and UCSB.<br>
      <br>
      Update: A team of physicists at the Joint Quantum Institute at the
      University of Maryland have now experimentally confirmed the
      existence of time crystals for the first time. The team observed
      the time-crystal behavior predicted in a system of trapped ions. A

      Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a fundamental concept in many
      areas of physics, ranging from cosmology and particle physics to
      condensed matter. A prime example is the breaking of spatial
      translation symmetry, which underlies the formation of crystals
      and the phase transition from liquid to solid. Analogous to
      crystals in space, the breaking of translation symmetry in time
      and the emergence of a "time crystal" was recently proposed, but
      later shown to be forbidden in thermal equilibrium. However,
      non-equilibrium Floquet systems subject to a periodic drive can
      exhibit persistent time-correlations at an emergent sub-harmonic
      frequency. This new phase of matter has been dubbed a "discrete
      time crystal" (DTC). Here, we present the first experimental
      observation of a discrete time crystal, in an interacting spin
      chain of trapped atomic ions. We apply a periodic Hamiltonian to
      the system under many-body localization (MBL) conditions, and
      observe a sub-harmonic temporal response that is robust to
      external perturbations. Such a time crystal opens the door for
      studying systems with long-range spatial-temporal correlations and
      novel phases of matter that emerge under intrinsically
      non-equilibrium conditions. <br>

      Crystals are extraordinary objects, not least because of their
      symmetry. Crystals form repeating patterns that are the same in
      some directions but not all directions. That’s something of a
      surprise given that the laws of physics, which govern their
      formation, are the same in all directions.<br>
      <br>
      That the laws of physics are spatially symmetrical but crystals
      are not is a phenomenon known as symmetry breaking. It comes about
      not by adding energy to a system, but by taking it away. Indeed,
      crystals are a manifestation of systems in their lowest energy
      states.<br>
      <br>
      But the laws of physics are not only symmetrical in space but also
      in time. And that raises the interesting question of whether it is
      possible to break temporal symmetry in the same way. In other
      words, is it possible to create time crystals?<br>
      <br>
      Today, we get an answer thanks to the work of Chris Monroe at the
      University of Maryland in College Park and a few pals, who have
      created a time crystal in their laboratory for the first time.<br>
      <br>
      The basic process for making time crystals is straightforward. The
      idea is to create a quantum system, such as a group of ions
      arranged in a ring, and cool them until they are in their lowest
      energy state. In these circumstances, the laws of physics would
      suggest that the ring should be perfectly stationary.<br>
      <br>
      But if time symmetry were broken, then the ring could vary
      periodically in time. In other words, it would rotate. Of course,
      it would never be possible to extract energy from this motion—that
      would violate the conservation of energy. But the temporal
      symmetry-breaking would manifest itself in this repeating motion
      in time, just as spatial symmetry-breaking manifests itself as
      repeating patterns in space.<br>
      <br>
      That’s the theory, but in the real world, things are not quite as
      simple. The main problem is that the quantum world is not governed
      by time-dependent variables, so time symmetry cannot be broken on
      this scale. So in ordinary circumstances, cooling a ring of ions
      to their lowest energy state would leave them stationary.<br>
      <br>
      But there are circumstances in which quantum systems do evolve
      over time. Munro and co have focused on these: quantum systems
      that are not in equilibrium. Their quantum system is a line of
      ytterbium ions with spins that interact with each other. <br>
      <br>
      That interaction leads to a special kind of behavior. One of the
      strange features of quantum particles is that they do not usually
      exist in specific locations. Instead they are smeared out in space
      with the chances of them appearing anywhere governed by the laws
      of probability.<br>
      <br>
      But in some circumstances this can change. For example, a single
      electron inside a material can interfere with itself in a way that
      forces it to appear in a single location. This is known as
      Anderson localization, after the physicist who predicted it in the
      1950s.<br>
      <br>
      More recently, physicists have investigated groups of quantum
      particles that interact with each other in a way that causes them
      all to become localized. This so-called many body localization is
      a delicate state that maintains the quantum particles in an
      out-of-equilibrium state. In other words, it forces them to be
      localized. And that’s exactly how this chain of ytterbium ions
      behaves.<br>
      <br>
      One of the key properties of these ions is their magnetization or
      spin, which can be flipped up or down using a laser. Flipping the
      spin of one ion causes the next to flip, and so on. These spin
      interactions then oscillate at a rate that depends on how
      regularly the laser flips the original spin. In other words, the
      driving frequency determines the rate of oscillation.<br>
      <br>
      But when Monroe and co measured this, they found another effect.
      These guys discovered that after allowing the system to evolve,
      the interactions occurred at a rate that was twice the original
      period. Since there is no driving force with that period, the only
      explanation is that the time symmetry must have been broken,
      thereby allowing these longer periods. In other words, Monroe and
      co had created a time crystal.<br>
      <br>
      The team went on to measure some of the properties of these
      crystals. They found, for example, that changing the driving
      frequency did not change the frequency of the time crystal. “This
      represents the ‘rigidity’ of the discrete time crystal,” they say.<br>
      <br>
      And they found that other perturbations could eventually destroy
      the time crystal. “When the perturbations are too large, the
      crystal ‘melts,’” say Monroe and co.<br>
      <br>
      That’s interesting, if esoteric, work. It shows that the time
      crystals can actually exist, as predicted in 2012 by the
      Nobel-prize winning physicist Frank Wilczek at MIT and Al Shapere
      at the University of Kentucky.<br>
      <br>
      As for applications, Monroe and co make a couple of suggestions.
      They say, for example, that time crystals could be used for
      quantum information tasks, such as implementing a robust quantum
      memory.<br>
      <br>
      But the exotic nature of many body localization and the fact that
      it is still poorly understood may mean that other physicists will
      want to check out the nature of this effect carefully before
      confirming that it really shows the existence of time crystals.<br>
      <br>
      So there’s more exciting work to be done.<br>

      <b>Revisiting an old solution</b><br>
      <br>
      Having a heart attack or a stroke might seem like an inevitable
      part of life, but medical researchers haven’t given up on trying
      to prevent these tragic events. One cardiologist, Harry Selker is
      focused on improving and getting to market a drug that could mean
      a lower mortality rate from cardiac arrest: GIK.<br>
      <br>
      GIK is really not a new drug. The cocktail of glucose, insulin,
      and potassium (K) was discovered around 50 years ago. When it was
      tested in baboons and rabbits, it seemed to be preventing heart
      attacks. The concoction had protected heart muscles against
      damage. Selker says: “So it was very encouraging.”<br>
      <br>
      But when applied to humans, the results were less promising. GIK
      did nothing to prevent or treat the heart attack, so the idea was
      shelved.<br>
      <br>
      Selker wanted to better understand why the human trials had
      failed. He tried to marry the GIK research with his own study on
      immediate treatment for heart attacks. He theorized that if GIK
      was administered immediately, even before bringing the patient to
      the hospital, it could be more effective.<br>
      <br>
      His 2012 study delivered huge results: a 50% reduction in
      mortality if GIK was administered immediately. A 40% reduction
      over the succeeding month. In fact, in ST-elevation heart attacks,
      there was a 60% reduction in deaths.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Affordable but not Available</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      From here, Selker thought it seemed pretty clear-cut. Continue the
      research, and hopefully save lives using a simple therapy that’s
      affordable.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I thought, pretty much, my work was done and
      people call me up and say you know, ‘when would we get this GIK
      stuff?’ And I realized nobody’s making it, nobody’s selling it.
      And so I started talking to the pharmaceutical companies saying,
      ‘You know, would you make this stuff?’ And they basically weren’t
      interested.”<br>
      <br>
      Why? It may have something to do with the fact that GIK costs just
      $50. It’s not going to make anyone a huge profit. But Selker
      remains determined. He is in contact with the FDA to conduct
      further studies on the effectiveness of GIK in acute coronary
      emergencies.<br>
      <br>
      “If you’re going to try to improve things, you have to work on all
      angles, you have to work in all disciplines,” says Selker.<br>

      they received would determine the percentage of an AMI
      recovery.&nbsp; Those that received a low dose during an AMI

      group.&nbsp; Those that had a high dose of GIK during an AMI
      occurance had up to a 48% decrease in mortality rate than the
      placebo group.&nbsp; The result of this study is comparable to the
      previous meta-analysis of GIK solution.<br>
      The controversy of GIK study.<br>
      <br>
      In the past 40 years, there are numerous studies of the use of
      GIK, and since it is currently used in cardiac surgical
      treatments, it is not recommended for infusion of AMI. The reason
      is from an early meta-analysis that found flaws from the length of
      time to infuse from the onset of AMI till treatment.&nbsp; Another
      flaw is the number of participants and randomness of patients
      which limited accual data of results.&nbsp; The studies have had
      trouble keeping a controlled setting since AMI’s are acute and in
      emergency settings.&nbsp; The requirement is more studies should
      be conducted with the use of GIK with larger groups over time...<br>

        </big><br>
        <b>By Will Ferguson, College of Arts &amp; Sciences</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Washington State University biologist Mechthild Tegeder has
      developed a way to dramatically increase the yield and quality of
      soybeans.<br>
      <br>
      Her greenhouse-grown soybean plants fix twice as much nitrogen
      from the atmosphere as their natural counterparts, grow larger and
      produce up to 36 percent more seeds.<br>
      <br>
      Tegeder designed a novel way to increase the flow of nitrogen, an
      essential nutrient, from specialized bacteria in soybean root
      nodules to the seed-producing organs. She and Amanda Carter, a
      biological sciences graduate student, found the increased rate of
      nitrogen transport kicked the plants into overdrive.<br>
      <br>
      Their work, published recently in Current Biology, is a major
      breakthrough in the science of improving crop yields. It could
      eventually help address society’s critical challenge of feeding a
      growing human population while protecting the environment. See the
      paper at <br>
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982216306157.<br>
      <br>
      “The biggest implication of our research is that by ramping up the
      natural nitrogen allocation process we can increase the amount of
      food we produce without contributing to further agricultural
      pollution,” Tegeder said. “Eventually we would like to transfer
      what we have learned to other legumes and plants that humans grow
      for food.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Improving grain yields</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Legumes account for around 30 percent of the world’s agricultural
      production. They consist of plants like soybeans, alfalfa, peas,
      beans and lentils, among others.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike crops that rely on naturally occurring and artificially
      made nitrogen from the soil, legumes contain rhizobia bacterioids
      in their root nodules that have the unique capability of
      converting or “fixing” nitrogen gas from the atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      For years, scientists have tried to increase the rate of nitrogen
      fixation in legumes by altering rhizobia bacterioid function or
      interactions that take place between the bacterioid and the root
      nodule cells.<br>
      <br>
      Tegeder took a different approach: She increased the number of
      proteins that help move nitrogen from the rhizobia bacteria to the
      plant’s leaves, seed-producing organs and other areas where it is
      needed.<br>
      <br>
      The additional transport proteins sped up the overall export of
      nitrogen from the root nodules. This initiated a feedback loop
      that caused the rhizobia to start fixing more atmospheric
      nitrogen, which the plant then used to produce more seeds.<br>
      <br>
      They are bigger, grow faster and generally look better than
      natural soybean plants,” Tegeder said. “Some evidence we have
      suggests they might also be highly efficient under stressful
      conditions like drought.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Protecting the environment</b><br>
      <br>
      Nitrogen is a macronutrient essential for plant growth. Large
      amounts of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer are applied around the
      world to ensure high plant productivity.<br>
      <br>
      Application is an environmental issue in industrialized countries
      like the United States because of high energy input, increased
      greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution and other adverse
      effects on ecosystems and human health.<br>
      <br>
      In developing countries, where nitrogen fertilizer is scarce,
      insufficient plant nitrogen results in low crop yields and limited
      food supplies.<br>
      <br>
      Tegeder thinks her soybean-focused research can eventually be
      applied to varieties of legumes suited for a diverse array of
      climates. One major benefit of growing legumes such as chickpeas,
      common beans, peas and soybeans is that they not only can use
      atmospheric nitrogen for their own growth but also leave residual
      nitrogen in the soil for subsequent crops.<br>
      <br>
      Hence, increasing nitrogen fixation could improve overall plant
      productivity for farmers who grow legumes in both industrial and
      developing countries while diminishing or eliminating the need for
      nitrogen fertilizers.<br>
      <br>
      “Legumes with higher yields have huge implications for agriculture
      and food production around the world,” Tegeder said. “Our research
      also has the potential to be transferred to other crop plants that
      don’t fix nitrogen from the atmosphere but would benefit from
      being able to uptake nitrogen more efficiently from the soil.”<br>
      <br>
      Her work is in keeping with WSU’s Grand Challenges, a suite of
      research initiatives aimed at large societal issues. It is
      particularly relevant to the challenge of sustainable resources
      and its theme of supplying food for future generations.<br>

            Development in Soybean Requires Complex Adjustments of
            Nodule Nitrogen Metabolism and Partitioning Processes</b><br>
        </big><br>

      </b><b>Summary</b><br>
      <br>
      Legumes are able to access atmospheric di-nitrogen (N2) through a
      symbiotic relationship with rhizobia that reside within root
      nodules. In soybean, following N2 fixation by the bacteroids,
      ammonia is finally reduced in uninfected cells to allantoin and
      allantoic acid [ 1 ]. These ureides present the primary
      long-distance transport forms of nitrogen (N), and are exported
      from nodules via the xylem for shoot N supply. Transport of
      allantoin and allantoic acid out of nodules requires the function
      of ureide permeases (UPS1) located in cells adjacent to the
      vasculature [ 2, 3 ]. We expressed a common bean UPS1 transporter
      in cortex and endodermis cells of soybean nodules and found that
      delivery of N from nodules to shoot, as well as seed set, was
      significantly increased. In addition, the number of transgenic
      nodules was increased and symbiotic N2 fixation per nodule was
      elevated, indicating that transporter function in nodule N export
      is a limiting step in bacterial N acquisition. Further, the
      transgenic nodules showed considerable increases in nodule N
      assimilation, ureide synthesis, and metabolite levels. This
      suggests complex adjustments of nodule N metabolism and
      partitioning processes in support of symbiotic N2 fixation. We
      propose that the transgenic UPS1 plants display metabolic and
      allocation plasticity to overcome N2 fixation and seed yield
      limitations. Overall, it is demonstrated that transporter function
      in N export from nodules is a key step for enhancing atmospheric
      N2 fixation and nodule function and for improving shoot N
      nutrition and seed development in legumes.<br>

      <br>
      Inventor(s): FROMMER WOLF-BERND; TEGEDER MECHTHILD, et al.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a method for producing a transgenic plant
      in which the capability for incorporating undesired nitrogen
      compounds, especially amino acids, in the storage organs is
      reduced compared with the wild type, comprising the steps:
      introducing at least one DNA sequence and/or at least one RNA
      sequence corresponding to the DNA sequence and/or a mixed sequence
      composed of DNA and RNA nucleotides corresponding to the DNA
      sequence with the coding region for an amino acid transporter or
      parts thereof into a plant cell, wherein the DNA and/or RNA
      sequence and/or mixed sequence is used in sense or antisense
      orientation and the expression of an endogenous amino acid
      transporter gene is prevented or reduced, and regenerating a plant
      from this plant cell, wherein the DNA and/or RNA sequence is a
      sequence from Beta vulgaris.<br>

      <br>
      <b>THE NEED FOR THE PRIZE</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Water is a key element of life on our planet. More than 71% of the
      Earth’s surface is covered with water, yet over 780 million people
      in 43 countries are facing water scarcity due to lack of
      availability, uneven distribution and access, and contamination.
      By 2025, an estimated 1.8 billion people will be living in areas
      with absolute water scarcity, with 2/3 of the global population
      living under water stressed conditions.<br>
      <br>
      While opportunities exist to augment currently available fresh
      water resources, including desalination and wastewater treatment,
      these approaches have been environmentally destructive and
      expensive thus far.<br>
      <br>
      With over 3 quadrillion gallons of water in the atmosphere, or
      enough to meet the needs of every person on the planet for a year,
      atmospheric extraction could revolutionize access to fresh water,
      generating fresh water where it is currently unavailable or
      inaccessible.<br>

          healthy mice</b><br>
        <br>
        <i>Safety of NMN being tested in small clinical trial</i><i><br>
        </i></div>
      <br>
      Much of human health hinges on how well the body manufactures and
      uses energy. For reasons that remain unclear, cells' ability to
      produce energy declines with age, prompting scientists to suspect
      that the steady loss of efficiency in the body's energy supply
      chain is a key driver of the aging process.<br>
      <br>
      Now, scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St.
      Louis have shown that supplementing healthy mice with a natural
      compound called NMN can compensate for this loss of energy
      production, reducing typical signs of aging such as gradual weight
      gain, loss of insulin sensitivity and declines in physical
      activity.<br>
      <br>
      The study is published Oct. 27 in the journal Cell Metabolism.<br>
      <br>
      "We have shown a way to slow the physiologic decline that we see
      in aging mice," said Shin-ichiro Imai, MD, PhD, a professor of
      developmental biology and of medicine. "This means older mice have
      metabolism and energy levels resembling that of younger mice.
      Since human cells rely on this same energy production process, we
      are hopeful this will translate into a method to help people
      remain healthier as they age."<br>
      <br>
      Imai is working with researchers conducting a clinical trial to
      test the safety of NMN in healthy people. The phase 1 trial began
      earlier this year at Keio University School of Medicine in Tokyo.<br>
      <br>
      With age, the body loses its capacity to make a key element of
      energy production called NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide).
      Past work by Imai and co-senior author Jun Yoshino, MD, PhD, an
      assistant professor of medicine, has shown that NAD levels
      decrease in multiple tissues as mice age. Past research also has
      shown that NAD is not effective when given directly to mice so the
      researchers sought an indirect method to boost its levels. To do
      so, they only had to look one step earlier in the NAD supply chain
      to a compound called NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide).<br>
      <br>
      NMN can be given safely to mice and is found naturally in a number
      of foods, including broccoli, cabbage, cucumber, edamame and
      avocado. The new study shows that when NMN is dissolved in
      drinking water and given to mice, it appears in the bloodstream in
      less than three minutes. Importantly, the researchers also found
      that NMN in the blood is quickly converted to NAD in multiple
      tissues.<br>
      <br>
      "We wanted to make sure that when we give NMN through drinking
      water, it actually goes into the blood circulation and into
      tissues," Imai said. "Our data show that NMN absorption happens
      very rapidly."<br>
      <br>
      To determine the long-term effects of giving NMN, Imai, Yoshino
      and their colleagues studied three groups of healthy male mice fed
      regular mouse chow diets. Starting at five months of age, one
      group received a high dose of NMN-supplemented drinking water,
      another group received a low dose of the NMN drinking water, and a
      third group served as a control, receiving no NMN. The researchers
      compared multiple aspects of physiology between the groups, first
      at 5 months of age and then every three months, until the mice
      reached 17 months of age. Typical laboratory mice live about two
      years.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers found a variety of beneficial effects of NMN
      supplementation, including in skeletal muscle, liver function,
      bone density, eye function, insulin sensitivity, immune function,
      body weight and physical activity levels. But these benefits were
      seen exclusively in older mice.<br>
      <br>
      "When we give NMN to the young mice, they do not become healthier
      young mice," Yoshino said. "NMN supplementation has no effect in
      the young mice because they are still making plenty of their own
      NMN. We suspect that the increase in inflammation that happens
      with aging reduces the body's ability to make NMN and, by
      extension, NAD."<br>
      <br>
      In skeletal muscle, the investigators -- including the study's
      first author, Kathryn Mills, the research supervisor in Imai's lab
      -- found that NMN administration helps energy metabolism by
      improving the function of mitochondria, which operate as cellular
      power plants. They also found that mice given NMN gained less
      weight with aging even as they consumed more food, likely because
      their boosted metabolism generated more energy for physical
      activity. The researchers also found better function of the mouse
      retina with NMN supplementation, as well as increased tear
      production, which is often lost with aging. They also found
      improved insulin sensitivity in the older mice receiving NMN, and
      this difference remained significant even when they corrected for
      differences in body weight.<br>
      <br>
      In a paper published earlier this year in Cell Reports, Yoshino
      and his colleagues revealed more details of how NAD works in
      influencing glucose metabolism and the body's fat tissue. In that
      study, the mice had a defect in the ability to manufacture NAD
      only in the body's fat tissue. The rest of their tissues and
      organs were normal.<br>
      <br>
      "Even though NAD synthesis was stopped only in the fat tissue, we
      saw metabolic dysfunction throughout the body, including the
      skeletal muscle, the heart muscle, the liver and in measures of
      the blood lipids," Yoshino said. "When we gave NMN to these mice,
      these dysfunctions were reversed. That means NAD in adipose tissue
      is a critical regulator of whole body metabolism."<br>
      <br>
      Added Imai, "This is important because Jun showed that if you mess
      up NAD synthesis only in fat tissue, you see insulin resistance
      everywhere. Adipose tissue must be doing something remarkable to
      control whole body insulin sensitivity."<br>
      <br>
      During the long-term NMN study in healthy mice, Imai also said
      they monitored the animals for any potential increase in cancer
      development as a result of NMN administration.<br>
      <br>
      "Some tumor cells are known to have a higher capability to
      synthesize NAD, so we were concerned that giving NMN might
      increase cancer incidence," Imai said. "But we have not seen any
      differences in cancer rates between the groups."<br>
      <br>
      The phase 1 trial in Japan is using NMN manufactured by Oriental
      Yeast Co., which also provided the NMN used in these mouse
      studies. Outside of this clinical trial, high-grade NMN for human
      consumption is not commercially available. But there's always
      broccoli.<br>

          Nicotinamide Mononucleotide Mitigates Age-Associated
          Physiological Decline in Mice. </b><br>

      <br>
      <b>Summary</b><br>
      <br>
      NAD+ availability decreases with age and in certain disease
      conditions. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a key NAD+
      intermediate, has been shown to enhance NAD+ biosynthesis and
      ameliorate various pathologies in mouse disease models. In this
      study, we conducted a 12-month-long NMN administration to regular
      chow-fed wild-type C57BL/6N mice during their normal aging. Orally
      administered NMN was quickly utilized to synthesize NAD+ in
      tissues. Remarkably, NMN effectively mitigates age-associated
      physiological decline in mice. Without any obvious toxicity or
      deleterious effects, NMN suppressed age-associated body weight
      gain, enhanced energy metabolism, promoted physical activity,
      improved insulin sensitivity and plasma lipid profile, and
      ameliorated eye function and other pathophysiologies. Consistent
      with these phenotypes, NMN prevented age-associated gene
      expression changes in key metabolic organs and enhanced
      mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and mitonuclear protein
      imbalance in skeletal muscle. These effects of NMN highlight the
      preventive and therapeutic potential of NAD+ intermediates as
      effective anti-aging interventions in humans.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>New compound shows promise in treating
          multiple human cancers</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A new compound, discovered jointly by international pharmaceutical
      company Servier, headquartered in France, and Vernalis (R&amp;D),
      a company based in the U<br>
      K, has been shown by researchers at the Walter and Eliza Hall
      Institute and Servier to block a protein that is essential for the
      sustained growth of up to a quarter of all cancers. <br>
      <br>
      The research presents a new way to efficiently kill these
      cancerous cells and holds promise for the treatment of blood
      cancers such as acute myeloid leukaemia, lymphoma and multiple
      myeloma, as well as solid cancers such as melanoma and cancers of
      the lung and breast. It is published online today in the journal
      Nature.<br>
      <br>
      The Servier compound - S63845 - targets a protein of the BCL2
      family, called MCL1, which is essential for the sustained survival
      of these cancer cells<br>
      <br>
      Institute scientist Associate Professor Guillaume Lessene, who led
      the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute’s research team in Melbourne,
      Australia, said the work provided the first clear preclinical
      evidence that inhibiting MCL1 was effective in targeting several
      cancer types.<br>
      <br>
      “MCL1 is important for many cancers because it is a pro-survival
      protein that allows the cancerous cells to evade the process of
      programmed cell death that normally removes cancer cells from the
      body,” Associate Professor Lessene said. “Extensive studies
      performed in a variety of cancer models have shown that S63845
      potently targets cancer cells dependent on MCL1 for their
      survival.” <br>
      <br>
      The institute team of Associate Professor Lessene worked with
      haematologist Associate Professor Andrew Wei and Dr Donia
      Moujalled from The Alfred Hospital and Servier scientists, to
      demonstrate that not only was S63845 effective against several
      cancer types, but that it could also be delivered at doses that
      were well tolerated by normal cells.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Olivier Geneste, Director of Oncology Research at Servier, said
      this preclinical research represented major findings regarding the
      druggability of MCL1, a valuable and highly challenging target.
      “S63845 was discovered through collaboration with the fragment and
      structure based discovery expertise at Vernalis,” he said. “As
      part of the ongoing Servier / Novartis collaboration on this
      target class, clinical development of a MCL1 inhibitor should be
      launched in the near future.” <br>
      <br>
      Associate Professor Lessene said the research provided further
      evidence of the usefulness of a new class of anti-cancer drugs
      called BH3 mimetics. “BH3 mimetics inhibit a group of proteins
      known as the ‘pro-survival BCL-2 proteins’,” he said. “MCL1 is a
      member of this protein family, and inhibiting it activates the
      process of programmed cell death. Walter and Eliza Hall Institute
      researchers revealed the role of BCL-2 in cancer more than 28
      years ago and the essential role of MCL1 for the survival of
      malignant cells four years ago.”<br>

      <b>What is Ultrasonic Motor ?</b><br>
      <br>
      In December 25,1986, the completely new motor which uses neither a
      Coil nor any Magnet for driving force was put on the market from
      SHINSEI CORPORATION.<br>
      <br>
      The motor is just an Ultrasonic Motor. The name of the production
      is USR-60-4-100. The motor is first type of the present Ultrasonic
      Motor: USR series.<br>
      <br>
      Ultrasonic Motor rotates using modification when voltage is
      applied to piezo-electric ceramics.<br>
      The name of an ultrasonic motor was named from the frequency of
      the voltage that is exceeding people's audible sound region.(Over
      20kHz).<br>
      <br>
      Ultrasonic motor: The main structures of USR series is the
      followings.<br>
      <br>
      The Stator part transmits vibration<br>
      The Rotor which is a rotation part<br>
      The Shaft which transmits rotation<br>
      The Bearing<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the structure of a stator part is the following.<br>
      <br>
      The Piezo-Electric Ceramics which generate vibration<br>
      The Stator metal which makes vibration amplify<br>
      The Friction material which contacts with a rotor<br>
      <br>
      Each element is calculated strictly and the following capability
      is realized.<br>
      <br>
      Stable Rotation Performance<br>
      High Holding Power<br>
      High Silence<br>
      <br>
      The component of a Standard Model Motor and a Non-magnetic Model
      Motor do not generate electromagnetic waves.<br>
      Furthermore, the Non-magnetic Model Motor uses for stator metal
      and a bearing the material which is not affected at all by the
      influence of magnetic.<br>
      <br>
      Summary ：<br>
      The Ultrasonic Motor uses piezo-electric ceramics for the source
      of a drive. If voltage is impressed to piezo-electric ceramics,
      the form of piezo-electric ceramics will change.<br>
      <br>
      The modification is made to amplify and spread with stator metal,
      and a traveling wave is generated on the surface of stator metal.
      This wave rotates the rotor which is in contact with the stator.<br>
      <br>
      High holding power of Ultrasonic Motor ：<br>
      <br>
      High pressure is applied between the rotor and the stator. 　For
      this reason, the biggest frictional force at the time of a stop is
      the holding power of an ultrasonic motor.<br>
      <br>
      Rotation principle of Ultrasonic Motor :<br>
      <br>
      If voltage is made to apply to piezo-electric ceramics, the shape
      of piezo-electric ceramics will be changed or distorted. The
      modification amplifies and spreads with stator metal, and
      generates a traveling wave on the surface of stator metal.<br>
      <br>
      Here, the stator metal touches the rotor only at each peak of a
      traveling wave, and each of that peak carries out elliptical
      movement. A rotor rotates in response to the influence of the
      elliptical movement.<br>
      <br>
      The direction of movement of this ellipse is a direction contrary
      to the direction which a traveling wave follows. And a rotor
      rotates in the direction contrary to a traveling wave under the
      influence.<br>
      <br>
      So, When a traveling wave progresses in the clockwise direction
      (CW) on the circumference of a stator, each peak of the traveling
      wave in contact with a rotor carries out elliptical movement in
      the counterclockwise direction (CCW).<br>
      <br>
      And the rotor in contact with the peak of the wave rotates in the
      counterclockwise direction (CCW).<br>
      <br>
      By controlling the speed and direction of this traveling wave,
      control of an Ultrasonic Motor is possible.<br>

      <br>
      All NuTesla Instruments are based on our patented technologies,
      inspired by the original resonant energy and frequency discoveries
      of Nikola Tesla. The therapeutic use of electrical currents began
      long before the Christian Era but it wasn’t until Nikola Tesla
      discovered in the late 1880’s how alternating currents of high
      potential could be effectively applied in healing situations that
      Electromedicine emerged as a standard of medical practice.
      Unfortunately, one of the Tesla’s greatest gifts to humanity was
      quashed by those who could not understand the simplicity of its
      operations and influences on living bodies.<br>
      <br>
      The discovery of semiconductors in the 1950s saw the reemergence
      of Electromedicine with the development of the first cardiac
      pacemaker in 1960. Research in the field of Electromedicine has
      boomed within the last thirty years. Dr. Robert O. Becker was one
      of the premier physicians and authors studying energy medicine in
      the past century. In 2004 he wrote: “We are now in the process of
      revising the past century’s biochemical concept, under which all
      major life processes are chemical in nature, to one that proposes
      that such processes are electromagnetic in nature. Because the
      practice of medicine is a direct descendant of each new scientific
      paradigm we now have energy medicine as an alternative to chemical
      medicine. This new paradigm rests quite solidly on the fact that
      all chemical reactions are basically electrical or electromagnetic

      response”.<br>

      <b>Energy Medicine, Electromedicine and Bioelectronics</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      All NuTesla Instruments are based on our patented technologies,
      inspired by the original resonant energy and frequency discoveries
      of Nikola Tesla. The therapeutic use of electrical currents began
      long before the Christian Era but it wasn’t until Nikola Tesla
      discovered in the late 1880’s how alternating currents of high
      potential could be effectively applied in healing situations that
      Electromedicine emerged as a standard of medical practice.
      Unfortunately, one of the Tesla’s greatest gifts to humanity was
      quashed by those who could not understand the simplicity of its
      operations and influences on living bodies.<br>
      <br>
      The discovery of semiconductors in the 1950s saw the reemergence
      of Electromedicine with the development of the first cardiac
      pacemaker in 1960. Research in the field of Electromedicine has
      boomed within the last thirty years. Dr. Robert O. Becker was one
      of the premier physicians and authors studying energy medicine in
      the past century. In 2004 he wrote: “We are now in the process of
      revising the past century’s biochemical concept, under which all
      major life processes are chemical in nature, to one that proposes
      that such processes are electromagnetic in nature. Because the
      practice of medicine is a direct descendant of each new scientific
      paradigm we now have energy medicine as an alternative to chemical
      medicine. This new paradigm rests quite solidly on the fact that
      all chemical reactions are basically electrical or electromagnetic
      in nature.” Stephen Hawking noted in A Brief History of Time, “the
      universal force of electromagnetism controls all biological
      response”.<br>

      <br>
      Prof. Jerry Kroth, a psychologist, looks at that question. What
      brings down an Empire?<br>
      <br>
      Kroth looks at things slightly differently from financial pundits
      and stock market gurus. Instead of economics, he looks through the
      prism of social science. Which country produces over 80% of
      hardcore porn in the world? Which country has the highest rate of
      rape? What is the truth behind horror films or reality shows such
      a Fear Factor?<br>
      <br>
      For example, while Mr Trump continues to claim that Climate Change
      is just Chinese propaganda, what toll is Climat Change, and its
      ensuing natural disasters since 1982, actually having on the US? <br>

          deception</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A recent poll asked Americans if they felt America actually was an
      empire. Forty percent said "No." Lawrence Vance alleges the U.S.
      is the largest empire in the history of the world, dwarfing the
      British, Ottoman, and Roman empires in size and scope. Prof. Jerry
      Kroth looks at the delusion and denial rampant within the American
      population on this issue, examining our 55 military interventions
      since World War II, our long and close relationship with
      dictators, juntas, and monarchs in building our empire, our
      military presence in over 130 countries of the world (70% of the
      planet) and what life might look like if we actually dismantled
      it. This lecture is based on Dr. Kroth'd book Duped! delusion,
      denial, and the end of the American dream. However Duped has been
      replaced by a newer edition: Implosion: delusion, denial, and the
      prospect of collapse; coming out shortly. More info at

      psychodramas, like the cases of JonBenet Ramsey, Casey Anthony,
      and Elizabeth Smart and how tabloid titillations keep Americans
      progressively warped in their contact with reality. Dr. Kroth also
      addresses major "blindspots" in our collective consciousness and
      looks at the U.S. shooting down of Iranian flight 655, Israel's
      nuclear hegemony in the Middle East, and the 2016 presidential
      election as gargantuan pockets of ignorance in American public

      <div align="center"><b>100 Top WikiLeaks In Easy To Read Format</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>About wikileaks</b><b><br>
      </b><b>General FAQ</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. What is WikiLeaks?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      WikiLeaks is a non-profit organization created to protect
      whistleblowers and journalists who have sensitive materials to
      communicate to the public. They believe that transparent
      governments leads to better governments and less corruption. Led
      by Australian, Julian Assange, WikiLeaks was started 10 years ago
      with the goal of "opening governments" to help prevent criminal
      corruption. No information is leaked that could harm innocent
      civilians or those not involved in corruption.<br>
      <br>
      <b>​2. Can we believe WikiLeaks?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In short, yes. In its 10 year history, not one single leak has
      ever proven to be false, something WikiLeaks prides itself on. If
      the leaks were false, everyone implicated in them would have
      immediately and aggressively denied their claims rather than
      simply change the subject in speculating if Russia did it. For
      more hard proof within the emails, read this source.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3. Is WikiLeaks related to Wikipedia?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      No. Wikipedia can be edited by anyone, WikiLeaks cannot. The only
      thing they share in common are their first 4 letters. According to
      their website, "WikiLeaks combines the protection and anonymity of
      cutting-edge cryptographic technologies with the comfortable
      presentation style of Wikipedia, although the two are not
      otherwise related."<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. Why are they only going after Hillary Clinton? </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      10 years ago, WikiLeaks became famous for exposing elements of the
      Bush administration and the Iraq wars, and quickly became heroes
      to the left. This year, Hillary Clinton is being exposed because
      of the unprecedented levels of corruption throughout her history.
      Julian Assange, who is not necessarily pro-Trump, has stated that
      if any controversial Trump material is found, it will be
      published. However, everything controversial they have has already
      been said by Trump himself, according to Assange.<br>
      <br>
      <b>5. Why is the media barely covering them?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Because almost 100% of mainstream media sources, as well as
      several prominent publishing news sources are implicated in the
      leaks in colluding with the Clinton campaign. These "news" sources
      (as you will find in the leaks below) have conspired to get
      Hillary elected, by only reporting anti-Trump smear pieces,
      manufacturing or exaggerating scandals, and hiding anything
      damaging to Hillary. Most are even donating big money to the
      Clinton campaign in order to keep the globalist status-quo. These
      revelations are the stories journalists dream of, but CNN, ABC,
      NBC, MSNBC, New York Times, Washington Post, Politico, Huffington
      Post, AP, and several more are all implicated in the leaks. This
      is why the media has been so one sided this election season, and
      why only 6% of people trust the mainstream media. Trump hasn't
      helped with some past comments, but as CNN said here, the media is
      doing everything they can to help Hillary and give her a free
      ride.<br>
      <br>
      <b>6. Is Russia behind the leaks?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Despite Hillary stating at the third debate that 17 intelligence
      agencies have said Russia is behind it, there is no proof that
      Russia is responsible for these leaks against her and the DNC. In
      fact, even Politico (who has been implicated in these leaks
      several times with Glenn Thrush) gave her claim a negative
      fact-check. There is no definitive proof, even from Hillary, only
      theories that it "could" be Russia. The reason for this constant
      claim by the media (as if it is 100% truth) is to pivot away from
      what is actually in the damning leaks and get your attention onto
      "evil" Russia. This immature approach by Hillary and the media, in
      conjunction with other recent foreign policy blunders, has led to
      extremely increased levels of tension with Russia, not seen since
      the Cold War. Julian Assange has strongly indicated that insiders
      in the DNC and US government are responsible for the leaks,
      including hinting at one DNC insider who was killed shortly after
      the DNC leaks. Regardless of who the hacker is, it does not take
      away from the validity of what is actually in the leaks.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Cliff High - Trump Wins By A Landslide</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>From Greg Hunter</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Internet data mining expert Cliff High says the “naked data” on
      the Internet shows Trump winning the 2016 Presidential election by
      a “landslide.” High explains, “You can do a search on YouTube that
      brings back a list of primary speeches by both candidates.&nbsp; I
      am not talking about Fred Smith’s copy of a video he made of
      Trump.&nbsp; I am talking about a speech took officially of Trump,
      and they released it officially.&nbsp; If you take just those, you
      can see you’ve got Hillary Clinton on one side with 2,165 views,
      and Trump on the other side with 775,653 views.&nbsp; So, that is
      not anecdotal. This is a very crude level of statistical analysis,
      but it is nonetheless statistical analysis, and it is very pointed
      because it is extremely self-selecting.&nbsp; There is nobody
      watching you when you choose to watch something on YouTube.&nbsp;
      So, there is no peer pressure or external person polling you. . .
      . It’s what I call a very naked data set because there is no
      pressure on an emotional level on people.”<br>
      <br>
      How big is Trump winning by? High says, “Basically, when you go
      through all the analysis and all the other video archives, you
      come up with a 25 to 1 ratio (in favor of Trump). High says the
      Trump’s winning vote total will be orders of magnitude greater
      than Clinton’s.&nbsp; High uses a program he invented that he says
      uses the “art of predictive linguistics” to forecast future
      events.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the phrases that High comes up with in
      his own linguistic data mining program is “Hillary is missing.”
      High’s data also comes up with the phrase “It doesn’t matter.”
      High explains, “This is all tied up with one other phrase and that
      is ‘It doesn’t matter.’&nbsp; That is a very interesting phrase to
      come up in our data set because usually they’re not at a hard
      level making a conclusion.&nbsp; That’s what ‘It does not matter’
      is.&nbsp; It’s a conclusion.&nbsp; It’s a conclusion about a set
      of circumstances or facts.&nbsp; We rarely get straight out
      conclusions. . . . It is my interpretation that the Deep State may
      be so fixated on their candidate winning that it won’t matter how
      the election actually comes out.&nbsp; There is another layer on
      top of that that is seen in our recent data . . . the focus is
      economic, fiscal or financial pointedness . . . it may be saying
      the election part does not matter.&nbsp; If we take that
      interpretation, we are talking about the dollar and everything
      else in the economic system.”<br>
      <br>
      High contends the mainstream media polls are “100% manufactured.”
      High says, “Always look at the source.&nbsp; All these polls are
      part of the six propaganda outlets the government uses.&nbsp; So,
      obviously, it’s propaganda, and they are manufacturing it.&nbsp;
      It’s made for a specific agenda.&nbsp; It’s propaganda.&nbsp; They
      need to have it in everybody’s mind conceptually.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Basically, they are doing mind framing or collective brainwashing,
      if you want to think about it that way.&nbsp; What they want is
      everyone to understand there is very little difference between the
      candidates, that it’s a neck and neck race.&nbsp; They will do
      anything and are doing everything to engineer that perception.”<br>
      <br>
      High’s data also predicts, “The economy in our data set takes a
      terrible hit on the 9th of November.&nbsp; That is being forecast
      straight out.&nbsp; The kind of hit it’s going to take is going to
      affect FOREX all the way over to retail sales.&nbsp; We have a
      huge amount of things happening leading up to the larger problems
      we face next March in the economic system.”<br>
      <br>
      So, are we going to take a cliff dive economically speaking? High
      says, “It’s more like we are in a depression now and the illusion
      that everybody has been manufacturing and they just give up the
      Potemkin Village on the 9th of November.&nbsp; If the Deep State
      is confused how things are going to occur going forward, in other
      words, they know their candidate lost, but they are still going to
      potentially try to engineer things.&nbsp; That level of confusion
      on the Deep State’s part is what is going to draw in the collapse
      component on the other.&nbsp; That will happen instantly on the
      9th because the Deep State is so involved in our predatory
      cronyism financial structure.”<br>
      <br>
      Inflation is coming, and that will be very positive for precisions
      metals. High contends, “Gold and silver are going to rise relative
      to the falling currencies.&nbsp; Gold and silver in actual
      purchasing power will also rise.&nbsp; They won’t be saying an
      ounce of gold bought a good suit 100 years ago and an ounce of
      gold will buy a good suit now.&nbsp; That’s going to change, and
      it’s also going to change radically with silver.&nbsp; Also, in
      our data sets between 2019 and 2024, silver becomes the metal to
      have. . . . You need to have silver.&nbsp; The reason being the
      innovations that will be occurring over those next five
      years.&nbsp; Silver will become much more in demand than we can
      imagine now.”<br>
      <br>
      High also talks about energy, war and the fate of the mainstream
      media in this in-depth interview.<br>

        </b><i>New study demonstrates silent, eyes-free text entry</i><i><br>
        </i></div>
      <br>
      It's not exactly beating something into someone's head. More like
      tapping it into the side.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have developed
      a system that teaches people Morse code within four hours using a
      series of vibrations felt near the ear. Participants wearing
      Google Glass learned it without paying attention to the signals --
      they played games while feeling the taps and hearing the
      corresponding letters. After those few hours, they were 94 percent
      accurate keying a sentence that included every letter of the
      alphabet and 98 percent accurate writing codes for every letter.<br>
      <br>
      This is the latest chapter of passive haptic learning (PHL)
      studies at Georgia Tech. The same method -- using vibrations while
      participants aren't paying attention -- has taught people braille,
      how to play the piano and improved hand sensation for those with
      partial spinal cord injury.<br>
      <br>
      The PHL projects are all led by Georgia Tech Professor Thad
      Starner and his Ph.D. student Caitlyn Seim. The team decided to
      use Glass for this study because it has both a built-in speaker
      and tapper (Glass's bone-conduction transducer).<br>
      <br>
      In the study, participants played a game while feeling vibration
      taps between their temple and ear. The taps represented the dots
      and dashes of Morse code and passively "taught" users through
      their tactile senses -- even while they were distracted by the
      game.<br>
      <br>
      The taps were created when researchers sent a very low-frequency
      signal to Glass's speaker system. At less than 15 Hz, the signal
      was below hearing range but, because it was played very slowly,
      the sound was felt as a vibration.<br>
      <br>
      Half of the participants in the study felt the vibration taps and
      heads a voice prompt for each corresponding letter. The other half
      -- the control group -- felt no taps to help them learn.<br>
      <br>
      Participants were tested throughout the study on their knowledge
      of Morse code and their ability to type it. After less than four
      hours of feeling every letter, everyone was challenged to type the
      alphabet in Morse code in a final test.<br>
      <br>
      The control group was accurate only half the time. Those who felt
      the passive cues were nearly perfect.<br>
      <br>
      The research was recently presented in Germany at the 20th
      International Symposium on Wearable Computers.<br>
      <br>
      "Does this new study mean that people will rush out to learn Morse
      code? Probably not," said Starner. "It shows that PHL lowers the
      barrier to learn text-entry methods -- something we need for
      smartwatches and any text-entry that doesn't require you to look
      at your device or keyboard."<br>
      <br>
      Previous research on PHL used custom hardware to provide the
      tactile stimuli, but here researchers use an existing wearable
      device.<br>
      <br>
      "This research also shows that other common devices with an
      actuator could be used for passive haptic learning," he says.
      "Your smartwatch, Bluetooth headset, fitness tracker or phone."<br>
      <br>
      "In our Braille and piano PHL studies, people felt vibrations on
      their fingers, then used their fingers for the task," said Seim.
      "This study was different and surprising. People were tapped on
      their heads, but the skill they learned was using their finger."<br>
      <br>
      Seim's next study will go a step further, investigating whether
      PHL can teach people how to type on the trusted QWERTY keyboard.
      That would mean several letters assigned to the same finger,
      rather than using only one finger like Morse code.<br>

          Cover-Up</b><br>

      <br>
      Some scandals are so massive that they're simply hard to believe.
      As many as one million white English children may have been the
      victims of Muslim rape gangs, better known as grooming gangs, in
      towns up and down Great Britain. <br>
      <br>
      Policy analyst George Igler says, "When you encounter an issue
      that is just so unbelievable, just so outside your frame of
      reference and understanding, the immediate human reaction is just
      one to not believe it at all."<br>
      <br>
      Perhaps even harder to believe is that while there have been
      prosecutions, the British government has still not stopped this
      criminal activity...<br>
      <br>
      ISIS has publicly defended sexual slavery, saying, "enslaving the
      families of the infidels and taking their women as concubines is a
      firmly established aspect of the Sharia, or Islamic law."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Victims of a Multicultural Revolution</b><br>
      <br>
      The reason these crimes were covered up and continue to this day
      is political correctness. No one wanted to be called a racist.<br>
      <br>
      The definitive book on this scandal is "Easy Meat" by Peter
      McLoughlin, who declined an on-camera interview for safety
      reasons. He told us, "Journalists would not speak about it,
      because the perpetrators were mostly dark-skinned and Muslim.
      Childcare professionals used Political Correctness as an 'omerta,'
      a code of silence concerning what the public was allowed to know."<br>
      <br>
      "These girls are the victims of the multicultural revolution,"
      says Igler, "and it is certainly an indication of the fact that
      this accusation of racism is potentially the most powerful weapon
      known to man."&nbsp; "This is also an example of what can happen
      in a country of 60 million where the press just refuses to report;
      where the cries of all these agencies fail; fail to merely discuss
      what is going on." <br>
      <br>
      The cover up was eventually exposed, yet the grooming gangs
      continue to operate. One victim told a British newspaper, "Nothing
      has changed, not in the slightest. It's still the same scale as
      before."<br>
      <br>
      Igler said of the grooming gangs, "They get sexual kicks out of
      ruining the most precious possession that people have, their
      daughters."<br>
      <br>
      Stephen Lennon warned that there will be repercussions.<br>
      <br>
      He told us, "There's no blood on my hands, but there will be a lot
      of blood spilled in this country, and it will be on the hands of
      our leaders. And there will come a time when they will realize
      what they have done, and the country's people will realize what
      they've done, as well. They've sold us out. They've destroyed our
      nation. They've destroyed our culture."<br>

      <br>
      Years of permissive multiculturalism is to blame for the rise of
      Sharia courts and the Rotherham rape scandal, an academic claimed
      yesterday.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Rumy Hasan, a senior lecturer at the University of Sussex’s
      Centre for Migration Research, said “do-what-you-want” and
      “laissez-faire” policies had let immigrant communities live as if
      they were still in countries such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.<br>
      <br>
      This has led to a “psychiatric detachment” from mainstream British
      culture, he added, which in turn leads to a “social detachment”
      where minority communities do not mix with wider society.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Hasan – who is a former Muslim – also said that Muslim rape
      gangs in towns such as Rochdale and Rotherham were an “inevitable
      consequence” of this.<br>
      <br>
      The Sun quotes him as saying: “The authorities in towns and cities
      — Rochdale, Rotherham, Oxford, Oldham, Birmingham — kept quiet
      because they were embarrassed.<br>
      <br>
      “It’s time we woke up and smelled the coffee.”...<br>

      </b><b>7. To treat eczema, make herbal lotion</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Six months after Lula Balmond was born, the Brighton-native began
      showing signs of chronic eczema. Red scaly rashes covered her
      entire body, and the irritation caused her to impulsively scratch
      until she bled, which often prevented her from sleeping. None of
      her doctors’ emollients and steroid creams alleviated the
      symptoms, so Lula’s mother Natalie set out to create her own
      remedy. After studying an old herbology book she got from a
      friend, she began experimenting with various herbs known for their
      gentle and calming effects, including beeswax, nettle, chickweed,
      and chamomile. After trial and error, she created the formula for
      a beeswax-based lotion that cleared her daughter’s eczema
      symptoms. Since then, Natalie has started an alternative herbals,
      lotions, and salves business, Purepotions. The skin treatment is
      called “Pure Potions Skin Salvation,” and is now recognized by the
      United Kingdom’s National Health Service as clinically effective.<br>

      Whitley talks about the Day After Tomorrow and how, despite what
      most scientists are saying, the fossil record shows that extreme
      weather changes have happened in hours in the past and lasted for
      millennia. Then Jay Weidener on the mysteries of the Great Cross
      of Hendaye and the equally mysterious Fulcanelli, a Master of the
      Key-like man who revealed the cross's hidden code. Finally, Linda
      gets a scientist to admit that life is almost certainly on Mars.<br>
      <br>
      The Great Cross of Hendaye (French: Croix d'Hendaye) is a stone
      cross located on the town square of Hendaye, in the
      Pyrénées-Atlantiques, in southwestern France. A physical
      representation of the belief by ancient Christians, Rosicrucians,
      and alchemists that the world's end is rapidly approaching, and
      will occur in the midst of fire. Many, including devotees of
      Nostradamus, the Bible Code, and especially the 2012 phenomenon,
      believe that a great comet will pass by, or into, the earth in the
      year 2012 and interpret the Cross of Hendaye as another reminder
      that 2012 is the end.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fulcanelli's Deciphering: Base</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The four symbols found on the base are: Sun, Moon, Great Star, and
      a Simple circle. The circle is divided by two perpendicular
      diameters into four sectors in which there are four As displayed.<br>
      <br>
      The four As can be used to explain the four phases of the Great
      Cyclic Period in Medieval times. The four phases were represented
      either by: the four evangelists; by their symbolic letter, which
      is the Greek letter alpha; or by the four evangelical beasts
      surrounding Christ. These four quadrants are believed to stand for
      the four ages of the world. This symbolizes the diagram used to
      indicate the solar cycle, upon which the Galactic Alignment and
      procession rest.<br>
      <br>
      This traditional formula is often seen on the tympana of Roman
      porches. Where Jesus is shown seated with his left hand resting on
      a book and his right hand is raised in the gestures of
      benediction. He is separated from the four beasts which attend him
      by an ellipse, which is called the mystic almond. These groups are
      seen in many chapel and cathedrals throughout Europe, including
      Church of Templars at Luz in Hautes Pyrénées<br>

      <b>Interpreting the Cross: End of the World</b><br>
      <br>
      Through analysis of all the alchemical symbols found on the cross,
      it is believed that the Cross of Hendaye is a physical
      representation of the belief that the world is quickly coming to
      an end. And, as the symbols suggest, the end of the world will
      occur in the midst of fire. This belief was brought upon by the
      ancient Christian group, the Rosicrucians, and alchemists. Many
      believe that the end will be the return of Christ as referenced in
      the Bible.<br>
      <br>
      As Jay Weidner sites Fulcanelli's quote, "The age of iron has no
      other seal than that of Death. Its hieroglyph is the skeleton,
      bearing the attributes of Saturn: the empty hourglass, symbols of
      time run out..."<br>
      The Great Cross of Hendaye is believed to describe the end of both
      the four ages of the Hindu Yoga system as well as the four ages of
      alchemical chronological time keeping. .<br>
