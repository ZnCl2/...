      Would this ever work in aircraft propulsion? I doubt it. You have
      to turn extremely high RPMs to fly at high altitude. Fly behind
      tornadoes, would not good for the health of birds. <br>
      <br>
      "GE-90-115<br>
      N1=2,550 (max) This is really high for that diameter! I believe
      the fan tips go supersonic at ~2,100 RPM during takeoff (but I'm
      going from memory). This implies a peak tip Mach #=1.2. That's
      much higher than what I'm used to seeing! (Peak M=1.1 to 1.15 is
      much more typical) Yes, a M=0.05 difference is huge!<br>
      <br>
      N2=10,850 RPM (which is actually slow for a high turbine)<br>
      http://www.turbokart.com/about_ge90.htm<br>
      <br>
      High turbines turn anywhere from 8,000 to 15,000 RPM. The trend is
      back toward higher RPMs. For a long while, the trend was slower?
      Why? Best engine efficiency was obtained by putting one of the
      rows of compressor blades from the low turbine onto the high
      tubine. But this new row of larger diameter blades thus became the
      RPM limiting component on the high spool. Now with improved LPC
      efficiencies, we're seeing high spool RPMs creep back up.
      Obviously in a triple spool or GTF the trade study shifts to
      putting more onto the LPC due to the much higher RPM (~4,000)
      compared to the GE-90.<br>
      <br>
      That said, the Trent 900 has high RPM's too (notice a trend in new
      engines?)<br>
      N1: 3,000 RPM with peak tip Mach#=1.5&nbsp; wideeyed&nbsp;&nbsp;
      wideeyed&nbsp;&nbsp; wideeyed <br>
      N2: 7,500 RPM (Trent 800, I didn't find the 900's... close
      enough)&nbsp; wideeyed <br>
      N3 (high spool): 12,500&nbsp; yawn&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><br>

      </b>Biomimicry is a rapidly growing discipline in which nature’s
      solutions are adapted to solve man-made design challenges. At the
      core of the PAX Water Mixer is the Lily impeller, named after its
      resemblance to the calla lily. The Lily replicates nature’s spiral
      flow pattern – observed in whirlpools and tornados – to
      significantly improve the performance and energy usage of mixing
      water storage tanks. While the Lily is only 8 inches (21 cm) tall,
      it is capable of circulating millions of gallons of water with the
      same energy footprint as three 100-watt light bulbs.<br>

                  Worm Turns</b> -- </font>The new type of boat
              illustrated below has been specially designed for
              propulsion by a kind of turbine in reverse. The after end
              of the hull is recessed to accommodate the propeller
              mechanism, which is in two cylindrical sections, one
              inside the other. The inside division is stationary and
              houses the power unit, while the outside section, which
              revolves, is fitted on its exterior with a spiral fin or
              blade. When this turns, boring through the water like an
              auger, there is a long-continued thrust that sends the
              boat forward at a steady speed. Unlike the conventional
              propeller, the device makes a continuous "bite" at the
              water over a considerable distance. Forward of the
              propeller is a cabin with control apparatus. The man who
              invented the boat is Harold B. Harvey, Pensacola FL</font>

      <br>
      I don't know that I ever posted the results of Bert Pool's
      experiment to test inertia affecting time as claimed by Bruce
      DePalma;<br>
      <br>
      The Experiment: A good way to detect a field whose effect is a
      spatial inertial anisotropy is to use a time measurement based on
      an inertial property of space and compare it to a remote
      reference. With reference to figure ( 1 ) we have a situation
      where the timekeeping rate of an Accutron tuning fork regulated
      wrist watch is compared to that of an ordinary electric clock with
      a synchronous sweep second hand.<br>
      <br>
      The Accutron timepiece is specified to be accurate to one minute a
      month. Examination of the relative time drift of the Accutron -
      electric clock combination shows a cumulative drift of .25 second
      Accutron ahead for 4 hours of steady state operation. This is
      within the specification of the watch. DePalmas' Nature 5.<br>
      <br>
      With the flywheel spinning at 7600 r.p.m. and run steadily for
      1000 seconds (17 minutes), the Accutron loses .9 second relative
      to the electric clock.<br>
      <br>
      Much experimentation has shown that the effect is greatest with
      the position of the tuning fork as shown. Magnetic effects from
      leakage fields from the gyro drive motors are almost entirely
      absent; any remaining leakage is removed by co-netic magnetic
      shielding. The Accutron is also in a "non-magnetic" envelope.<br>
      <br>
      The purpose of the experiment is a simple demonstration of one of
      the effects of the od field of a rotating object. The
      demonstration may easily be repeated using any one of a variety of
      rotating objects, motor flywheels, old gyrocompasses, etc.<br>
      <br>
      The rotating mass of the flywheels used in these experiments is 29
      1/2 pounds. The rotational speed of 7600 r.p.m. is easily
      accessible. The effect is roughly proportional to the radius and
      mass of the rotating object and to the square of the rotational
      speed.<br>
      <br>
      Finer measurements can be made using an external electrically
      powered tuning fork oscillator and an electronic frequency
      counter. In this case the inertial anisotropy of the od field of a
      rotating object can be much more quickly and precisely measured.
      Field strength lines can be plotted along contours of constant
      frequency shift for the two orientation conditions of fork
      vibration direction parallel to, and perpendicular to, the axis of
      rotation of the test object.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusions and Observations: </b>The proper conclusions and
      evaluations of the above experiment will affect present
      conceptions of Cosmology. Before this can happen, simple tests
      must be performed to show the existence of a new phenomenon. It is
      hoped the apparatus for the performance of these tests is widely
      enough available to lead to quick verification.<br>

      So Bert read the bit about DePalmas claim in an early discussion
      list post and wrote the details and RESULTS of his experiment to
      share with all, thanks Bert!<br>
      <br>
      Hola, Jerry!<br>
      <br>
      Depalma's claim that a spinning heavy mass causes a nearby watch
      to gain or lose time is crap. I have actually performed this
      experiment, to much tighter specs that that in the claim cited.<br>
      <br>
      Norm gave me a large stack of precision aluminum platters and
      spindle out of a large IBM hard disk drive. The disks were clamped
      together on the spindle to create about a 40 pound mass. I had
      several quartz clock modules with digital read outs.<br>
      <br>
      I matched two modules so their readouts matched within 1/2 second
      per week. I soldered each inside a copper envelope for EM
      shielding purposes. The "control" clock was placed in a closet 50
      feet from the spinning mass.<br>
      <br>
      The other was placed within 1/8 inch of the surface of the
      spinning platter mass.<br>
      <br>
      I ran it for 8 hours, then opened the sealed copper shields of
      both clocks and compared the two clocks. there was NO time
      difference.<br>
      <br>
      I went even further. I did the same experiment again, but this
      time one of the clock modules was epoxied directly to the spinning
      mass and spun with the platters.<br>
      <br>
      I used a third clock module to act as an opposing balance mass.
      Again, after 8 hours, NO time difference was noted.<br>
      <br>
      My conclusion? The claim about the Bulova Accura watch gaining or
      losing time near a high speed spinning mass is crap!<br>
      <br>
      Norm and I are not "arm chair" experimenters (Norm has a pet term
      for those who make claims but never build devices as "strap
      hangers.") We are both "builders" and I have dis-proven more than
      one claim like this by building the things, doing the experiment
      and seeing null results. - Bert<br>

        <b>Robert M.L. Baker Jr., Bonnie Sue Baker</b><br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      An apparatus or structure is proposed for generating
      high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) between pairs of
      force–producing elements by means of the simultaneous production
      of a third time derivative of mass motion of the pair of
      force–producing elements. The elements are configured as a
      cylindrical array in the proposed structure and are activated by a
      radiation wavefront moving along the axis of symmetry of the
      array. The force-producing elements can be micro-electromechanical
      systems or MEMS resonators such as film-bulk acoustic resonators
      or FBARs. A preferred cylindrical array is in the form of a double
      helix and the activating radiation can be electromagnetic as
      generated by microwave transmitters such as Magnetrons. As the
      activating radiation wavefront moves along the axis of the
      structure it simultaneously activates force elements on opposite
      sides of the structure and thereby generates a gravitational wave
      between the pair of force elements. It is also indicated that the
      Earth is completely transparent to the HFGWs. Thus a sensitive
      HFGW detector, such as the Li-Baker under development by the
      Chinese, can sense the generated HFGW at an Earth-diameter
      distance and could, in theory, be a means for implementing
      transglobal HFGW communications.<br>

      An extract from the thunder god vine, used in traditional Chinese
      medicine, has been found to help obese mice. Researchers say the
      compound, Celastrol, quickly reduces food intake by 80 percent and
      causes up to a 45 percent decrease in body weight.<br>
      <br>
      The extract could potentially be used to improve the health of
      many suffering from obesity and associated complications such as
      heart disease, fatty liver and type 2 diabetes.<br>

      An extract from the thunder god vine, used in traditional Chinese
      medicine, has been found to help obese mice. Researchers say the
      compound, Celastrol, quickly reduces food intake by 80 percent and
      causes up to a 45 percent decrease in body weight.<br>
      <br>
      The extract could potentially be used to improve the health of
      many suffering from obesity and associated complications such as
      heart disease, fatty liver and type 2 diabetes.<br>
      <br>
      “If Celastrol works in humans as it does in mice, it could be a
      powerful way to treat obesity and improve the health of many
      patients,” says senior study author Umut Ozcan, an endocrinologist
      at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School.<br>
      <br>
      Within one week of Celastrol treatment, obese mice cut food intake
      by about 80 percent. By the end of the third week, treated mice
      lost 45 percent of their initial body weight almost entirely by
      burning fat stores.<br>
      <br>
      This weight loss is greater than that from bariatric surgery, an
      operation on the stomach which helps patients with extreme obesity
      to lose weight.<br>
      <br>
      Celastrol also decreased cholesterol levels and improved liver
      function and glucose metabolism which collectively may translate
      into a lower risk of heart disease, fatty liver, and type 2
      diabetes.<br>
      <br>

      acoustic, magnetic and electric resonance circuits of the Coler
      device the magneto-acoustic resonance was measured with a
      frequency scan through a function generator and a lock-in
      amplifier. The frequency generator was powering a driving coil,
      while the lock-in was connected to a pickup coil. Both coils were
      placed on a magnetic rod. Resonances were observed up to the 17th
      harmonic. The quality Q of the observed resonances was 270. To
      study the magneto-acoustic resonance in the time domain a pair of
      Permendur rods were employed. The magneto-acoustic resonances of
      the Permendur rods were observed with an oscilloscope. Spectra of
      the magneto acoustic resonance were measured for the Permendur
      rods and for a Coler replica magnet in the frequency range from 25
      kHz to 380 kHz. The next step was to bring the resonances of the
      Permendur rods close together so that they overlap. The
      10thharmonic was chosen because it was close to the 180 kHz that
      Hans Coler related to ferromagnetism. Further more
      magneto-acoustic coupling between the Permendur rods was studied.
      Finally the question was explored if Hans Coler converted vacuum
      fluctuations via magnetic and acoustic resonance into electricity.
      There is a strong connection between magnetism and quantum field
      zero point energy (ZPE). An outlook is given on next steps in the
      experiments to unveil the working mechanism of the Coler magnetic
      current apparatus.<br>

      Polyurethane seemed like it couldn’t interact with the earth’s
      normal processes of breaking down and recycling material. That’s
      just because it hadn’t met the right mushroom yet.<br>
      <br>
      The Amazon is home to more species than almost anywhere else on
      earth. One of them, carried home recently by a group from Yale
      University, appears to be quite happy eating plastic in airless
      landfills.<br>
      <br>
      The group of students, part of Yale’s annual Rainforest Expedition
      and Laboratory with molecular biochemistry professor Scott
      Strobel, ventured to the jungles of Ecuador. The mission was to
      allow "students to experience the scientific inquiry process in a
      comprehensive and creative way." The group searched for plants,
      and then cultured the microorganisms within the plant tissue. As
      it turns out, they brought back a fungus new to science with a
      voracious appetite for a global waste problem: polyurethane.<br>
      <br>
      The common plastic is used for everything from garden hoses to
      shoes and truck seats. Once it gets into the trash stream, it
      persists for generations. Anyone alive today is assured that their
      old garden hoses and other polyurethane trash will still be here
      to greet his or her great, great grandchildren. Unless something
      eats it.<br>
      <br>
      The fungi, Pestalotiopsis microspora, is the first anyone has
      found to survive on a steady diet of polyurethane alone and—even
      more surprising—do this in an anaerobic (oxygen-free) environment
      that is close to the condition at the bottom of a landfill.<br>
      <br>
      Student Pria Anand recorded the microbe’s remarkable behavior and
      Jonathan Russell isolated the enzymes that allow the organism to
      degrade plastic as its food source. The Yale team published their
      findings in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology
      late last year concluding the microbe is "a promising source of
      biodiversity from which to screen for metabolic properties useful
      for bioremediation." In the future, our trash compactors may
      simply be giant fields of voracious fungi.<br>
      <br>
      Who knows what the students in the rainforest will turn up next?<br>

          Of Plastics!</b><br>

      <br>
      On an expedition to the Ecuadorian rainforest, Yale students
      discovered a new type of fungus which may speed up the
      decomposition process of discarded plastics in landfills.<br>
      <br>
      fungusFew think twice about what to do with their disposable water
      bottle after they’ve drunk its contents, but environmentalists are
      aware that it is the entire eco-system which has to pay the price
      for misguided actions in the present.<br>
      <br>
      Currently, Americans discard about 33.6 million tons of plastic
      each year. Only 6.5 percent of it is recycled and 7.7 percent is
      combusted in waste-to-energy facilities, which create electricity
      or heat from garbage. In result, there is a massive amount of
      non-biodegradable materials being tossed into landfills with a
      wait of about 1,000 years or so before they decompose. What’s
      worse, many of these materials may leak pollutants into the soil
      and water.<br>
      <br>
      But thanks to a group of Yale students who discovered a new type
      of fungus in the Ecuadorian rainforest, a semi-solution may soon
      be available to help speed up the decomposition process of
      plastics sitting in landfills.<br>
      <br>
      Students from Yale’s Department of Molecular Biophysics and
      Biochemistry discovered a previously unknown type of fungus that
      has a hearty appetite for polyurethane, a polymer that is used in
      everything from hard plastics to synthetic fibers.<br>
      <br>
      As shared by Fast Company, the fungus is the first one that is
      known to survive on polyurethane alone, and it can do so in an
      anaerobic (oxygen-free) environment, suggesting it could be used
      at the bottom of landfills.<br>
      <br>
      “Many microbes can do cool tricks, like degrading pollutants,”
      said Jonathann Russell to the Yale alumni magazine. But a large
      reason plastics like polyurethane take so long to break down is
      that microorganisms don’t typically recognize it as food,&nbsp;
      therefore it can take centuries for man-made polymers to break
      down into microscopic granules.<br>
      <br>
      But the discovery of <i>Pestalotiopsis microspora</i> may change
      all that.<br>
      <br>
      The students of Yale isolated the enzyme that enables the fungus
      to break down plastic then observed its potential.<br>
      <br>
      “The broad distribution of activity observed and the unprecedented
      case of anaerobic growth using [polyester polyurethane] as the
      sole carbon source suggest that endophytes are a promising source
      of biodiversity from which to screen for metabolic properties
      useful for bioremediation,” they wrote in a report published in
      the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology.<br>
      <br>
      No doubt the first step in reducing environmental pollution is to
      completely eliminate the production of materials which take
      thousands of years to biodegrade, and second, to re-use or recycle
      already produced materials into new form.<br>
      <br>
      Ultimately, however, this finding opens up an entire new area of
      intrigue as its potential to break down plastics is tested and
      evaluated.<br>

      </b><b>ABSTRACT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Bioremediation is an important approach to waste reduction that
      relies on biological processes to break down a variety of
      pollutants. This is made possible by the vast metabolic diversity
      of the microbial world. To explore this diversity for the
      breakdown of plastic, we screened several dozen endophytic fungi
      for their ability to degrade the synthetic polymer polyester
      polyurethane (PUR). Several organisms demonstrated the ability to
      efficiently degrade PUR in both solid and liquid suspensions.
      Particularly robust activity was observed among several isolates
      in the genus Pestalotiopsis, although it was not a universal
      feature of this genus. Two Pestalotiopsis microspora isolates were
      uniquely able to grow on PUR as the sole carbon source under both
      aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Molecular characterization of
      this activity suggests that a serine hydrolase is responsible for
      degradation of PUR. The broad distribution of activity observed
      and the unprecedented case of anaerobic growth using PUR as the
      sole carbon source suggest that endophytes are a promising source
      of biodiversity from which to screen for metabolic properties
      useful for bioremediation.<br>

          MONSANTO and Change The World</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>This may be some of the most important information we ever
      share here at LoveClicks.org. What you are about to read holds
      tremendous potential to radically change the entire world in many
      positive ways.<br>
      <br>
      Monsanto does not want this article to go viral, for if it does,
      it could very well bring about their demise.<br>
      <br>
      In 2006 a patent was granted to a man named Paul Stamets. Even
      though Paul is the world’s leading mycologist, his patent has
      received very little attention and exposure. Why? As stated by
      executives in the pesticide industry, this patent represents “the
      most disruptive technology we have ever witnessed.” And when they
      say disruptive, they are referring to it being disruptive to their
      chemical pesticides industry.<br>
      <br>
      We can no longer deny that the pesticide industry is causing
      incredibly detrimental effects to the earth, people, animals,
      plants &amp; insects too. The rapid decline of the world’s bee
      populations is being attributed to Monsanto’s chemical concoctions
      that are being sprayed over farmers fields around the world.
      (Though the number of countries who have kicked out &amp; banned
      Monsanto is growing) The use of chemical pesticides is a practice
      that absolutely must stop and new methods must be employed before
      it’s too late.<br>
      <br>
      Yet with Monsanto generating nearly $16 BILLION dollars in 2014,
      they certainly do not want anything getting in the way of that
      money flow. That kind of revenue gives them a lot of resources and
      abilities to suppress information that may be damaging to them.<br>
      <br>
      Like this patent of Paul Stamet’s. Paul has figured out how to use
      mother nature’s own creations to keep insects from destroying
      crops. It is what’s being called SMART pesticides. These
      biopesticides provide a safe &amp; nearly permanent solution for
      controlling over 200,000 species of insects, and it is all thanks
      to the ‘magic’ of mushrooms.<br>
      <br>
      I won’t go into the specifics of how it all works, for most of us
      won’t really understand it anyway, but to summarize, he does this
      by taking entomopathogenic Fungi (fungi that destroys insects) and
      morphs it into not producing spores. This in turn actually
      attracts the insects who then eat and turn into fungi from the
      inside out!<br>
      <br>
      For those who do want to do their own further reseach on the
      topic, I have provided a list of links below to help you along.<br>
      <br>
      As more people wake up to the damaging effects of Monsanto’s
      chemicals &amp; GMO foods, the demand for truly nutritious,
      pesticide free, non-gmo, organic foods is on the rise. We are
      seeing more community gardens &amp; urban forests being created.
      More people are starting to grow food, not lawns. Permaculture is
      becoming more widely talked about and understood. There is a major
      paradigm shift happening right now as our collective consciousness
      expands and awakens.<br>
      <br>
      These truly are exciting, monumental times we live in. We are
      seeing old world ways crumble and power structures fall as we wake
      up and step up to collectively create a more healthy and
      sustainable way of working, living &amp; playing together on this
      planet. The time has come. We can do this!<br>

            Heart Disease And Stroke</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A mathematical model constructed by researchers at Imperial
      College London predicts the risk of cardiovascular disease (heart
      attacks, stroke) associated with low background levels of
      radiation. The model shows that the risk would vary almost in
      proportion with dose.<br>
      <br>
      Results, published October 23 in the open-access journal PLoS
      Computational Biology, are consistent with risk levels reported in
      previous studies involving nuclear workers.<br>
      <br>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and one of
      the leading causes of disability in developed countries, as
      reported in the paper and also by the World Health Organization.
      For some time, scientists have understood how high-dose
      radiotherapy (RT) causes inflammation in the heart and large
      arteries and how this results in the increased levels of
      cardiovascular disease observed in many groups of patients who
      receive RT. However, in the last few years, studies have shown
      that there may also be cardiovascular risks associated with the
      much lower fractionated doses of radiation received by groups such
      as nuclear workers, but it is not clear what biological mechanisms
      are responsible.<br>
      <br>
      The Imperial College London team, led by Dr. Mark Little, has
      explored a novel mechanism that suggests that radiation kills
      monocytes (a type of white blood cell) in the arterial wall, which
      would otherwise bind to monocyte chemo-attractant protein 1
      (MCP-1). The resultant higher levels of MCP-1 cause inflammation
      which leads to cardiovascular disease. As well as being consistent
      with what is seen in nuclear workers, the changes in MCP-1 caused
      by dietary cholesterol that are predicted by the model are also
      consistent with experimental and epidemiologic data.<br>
      <br>
      If the mechanism is valid it implies that risks from low dose
      radiation exposures (e.g., medical and dental X-rays), which until
      now have been assumed to result only from cancer, may have been
      substantially underestimated, say the authors.<br>
      <br>
      The biological mechanism has yet to be experimentally tested.
      Further research is planned to investigate this.<br>

            Using Only Proteins Secreted by Stem Cells</b><br>

        <i>The new strategy is more sustainable and less risky than the
          current standard therapies</i><i><br>

      <br>
      SAN FRANCISCO, CA — MAY 11, 2015 — Scientists have discovered a
      way to regrow bone tissue using the protein signals produced by
      stem cells. This technology could help treat victims who have
      experienced major trauma to a limb, like soldiers wounded in
      combat or casualties of a natural disaster. The new method
      improves on older therapies by providing a sustainable source for
      fresh tissue and reducing the risk of tumor formation that can
      arise with stem cell transplants.<br>
      <br>
      The new study, published in Scientific Reports, is is the first to
      extract the necessary bone-producing growth factors from stem
      cells and to show that these proteins are sufficient to create new
      bone. The stem cell-based approach was as effective as the current
      standard treatment in terms of the amount of bone created.<br>
      <br>
      “This proof-of-principle work establishes a novel bone formation
      therapy that exploits the regenerative potential of stem cells,”
      says senior author Todd McDevitt, PhD, a senior investigator at
      the Gladstone Institutes. “With this technique, we can produce new
      tissue that is completely stem cell-derived and that performs
      similarly with the gold standard in the field.”<br>
      <br>
      Instead of using stem cells themselves, the scientists extracted
      the proteins that the cells secrete — such as bone morphogenetic
      protein (BMP) — in order to harness their regenerative power. To
      do so, the researchers first treated stem cells with a chemical
      that helped coax them into early bone cells. Next, they mined the
      essential factors produced by the cells that send the signal to
      regenerate new tissue. Finally, the researchers delivered these
      proteins into mouse muscle tissue to facilitate new bone growth.<br>
      <br>
      The current standard method involves grinding up old bones in
      order to extract the proteins and growth factors needed to
      stimulate new bone growth — a substance dubbed demineralized bone
      matrix (DBM). However, this approach has significant restrictions
      as it relies on bones taken from cadavers, which can be highly
      variable in terms of tissue quality and how much of the necessary
      signals they still produce. Moreover, as is the problem in organ
      donation, cadaver tissue is not always available.<br>
      <br>
      “These limitations motivate the need for more consistent and
      reproducible source material for tissue regeneration,” says Dr.
      McDevitt, who conducted the research while he was a professor at
      the Georgia Institute of Technology. “As a renewable resource that
      is both scalable and consistent in manufacturing, pluripotent stem
      cells are an ideal solution.”<br>
      <br>
      Other researchers on the study include Ken Sutha, Zvi Schwartz,
      Yun Wang, Sharon Hyzy, and Barbara Boyan from the Gladstone
      Institutes, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Virginia
      Commonwealth University.<br>

      The progressive loss of endogenous regenerative capacity that
      accompanies mammalian aging has been attributed at least in part
      to alterations in the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition of
      adult tissues. Thus, creation of a more regenerative
      microenvironment, analogous to embryonic morphogenesis, may be
      achieved via pluripotent embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation
      and derivation of devitalized materials as an alternative to
      decellularized adult tissues, such as demineralized bone matrix
      (DBM). Transplantation of devitalized ESC materials represents a
      novel approach to promote functional tissue regeneration and
      reduce the inherent batch-to-batch variability of
      allograft-derived materials. In this study, the osteoinductivity
      of embryoid body-derived material (EBM) was compared to DBM in a
      standard in vivo ectopic osteoinduction assay in nude mice. EBM
      derived from EBs differentiated for 10 days with osteogenic media
      (+ß-glycerophosphate) exhibited similar osteoinductivity to active
      DBM (osteoinduction score?=?2.50?±?0.27 vs. 2.75?±?0.16) based on
      histological scoring, and exceeded inactive DBM (1.13?±?0.13,
      p?&lt;?0.005). Moreover, EBM stimulated formation of new bone,
      ossicles, and marrow spaces, similar to active DBM. The potent
      osteoinductivity of EBM demonstrates that morphogenic factors
      expressed by ESCs undergoing osteogenic differentiation yield a
      novel devitalized material capable of stimulating de novo bone
      formation in vivo.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Superhydrophobic glass coating offers
            clear benefits</b></big><br>
      </div>
      &nbsp;<br>
      A moth's eye and lotus leaf were the inspirations for an
      antireflective water-repelling, or superhydrophobic, glass coating
      that holds significant potential for solar panels, lenses,
      detectors, windows, weapons systems and many other products.<br>
      <br>
      The discovery by researchers at the Department of Energy's Oak
      Ridge National Laboratory, detailed in a paper published in the
      Journal of Materials Chemistry C, is based on a mechanically
      robust nanostructured layer of porous glass film. The coating can
      be customized to be superhydrophobic, fog-resistant and
      antireflective.<br>
      <br>
      "While lotus leaves repel water and self-clean when it rains, a
      moth's eyes are antireflective because of naturally covered
      tapered nanostructures where the refractive index gradually
      increases as light travels to the moth's cornea," said Tolga
      Aytug, lead author of the paper and a member of ORNL's Materials
      Chemistry Group. "Combined, these features provide truly
      game-changing ability to design coatings for specific properties
      and performance."<br>
      <br>
      To be superhydrophobic, a surface must achieve a water droplet
      contact angle exceeding 150 degrees. ORNL's coating has a contact
      angle of between 155 and 165 degrees, so water literally bounces
      off, carrying away dust and dirt. This property combined with the
      suppression of light reflection from a glass surface is critical
      for improved performance in numerous optical applications, Aytug
      said.<br>
      <br>
      The base material -- a special type of glass coating -- is also
      highly durable, which sets it apart from competing technologies,
      according to Aytug, who described the process.<br>
      <br>
      "We developed a method that starts with depositing a thin layer of
      glass material on a glass surface followed by thermal processing
      and selective material removal by etching," he said. "This
      produces a surface consisting of a porous three-dimensional
      network of high-silica content glass that resembles microscopic
      coral."<br>
      <br>
      The fact the coating can be fabricated through industry standard
      techniques makes it easy and inexpensive to scale up and apply to
      a wide variety of glass platforms.<br>
      <br>
      "The unique three-dimensionality interconnected nanoporous nature
      of our coatings significantly suppresses Fresnel light reflections
      from glass surfaces, providing enhanced transmission over a wide
      range of wavelengths and angles," Aytug said. The Fresnel effect
      describes the amount of light that is reflected versus the amount
      transmitted.<br>
      <br>
      Where solar panels are concerned, the suppression of reflected
      light translates into a 3-6 percent relative increase in
      light-to-electricity conversion efficiency and power output of the
      cells. Coupled with the superhydrophobic self-cleaning ability,
      this could also substantially reduce maintenance and operating
      costs of solar panels. In addition, the coating is highly
      effective at blocking ultraviolet light.<br>
      <br>
      Other potential applications include goggles, periscopes, optical
      instruments, photodetectors and sensors. In addition, the
      superhydrophobic property can be effective at preventing ice and
      snow buildup on optical elements and can impede biofouling in
      marine applications.<br>
      <br>
      Aytug emphasized that the impact abrasion resistance of the
      coating completes the package, making it suitable for untold
      applications.<br>
      <br>
      "This quality differentiates it from traditional polymeric and
      powder-based counterparts, which are generally mechanically
      fragile," Aytug said. "We have shown that our nanostructure glass
      coatings exhibit superior mechanical resistance to impact abrasion
      -- like sand storms -- and are thermally stable to temperatures
      approaching 500 degrees Celsius."<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>A revolutionary impact on the performance of many optical
      systems and components can come from the integrative design of
      multifunctional coatings. Such coatings should be mechanically
      robust, and combine user-defined optical and wetting functions
      with scalable fabrication formulations. By taking cues from the
      properties of some natural biological structures, we report here
      the formation of low-refractive index antireflective glass films
      that embody omni-directional optical properties over a wide range
      of wavelengths, while also possessing specific wetting
      capabilities. The coatings comprise an interconnected network of
      nanoscale pores surrounded by a nanostructured silica framework.
      These structures result from a novel fabrication method that
      utilizes metastable spinodal phase separation in glass-based
      materials. The approach not only enables design of surface
      microstructures with graded-index antireflection characteristics,
      where the surface reflection is suppressed through optical
      impedance matching between interfaces, but also facilitates
      self-cleaning ability through modification of the surface
      chemistry. Based on near complete elimination of Fresnel
      reflections (yielding &gt;95% transmission through a single-side
      coated glass) and corresponding increase in broadband
      transmission, the fabricated nanostructured surfaces are found to
      promote a general and an invaluable [similar]3–7% relative
      increase in current output of multiple direct/indirect bandgap
      photovoltaic cells. Moreover, these antireflective surfaces also
      demonstrate superior resistance against mechanical wear and
      abrasion. Unlike conventional counterparts, the present
      antireflective coatings are essentially monolithic, enabling
      simultaneous realization of graded index anti-reflectivity,
      self-cleaning capability, and mechanical stability within the same
      surface. The concept represents a fundamental basis for
      development of advanced coated optical quality products,
      especially where environmental exposure is required.<br>

          <br>
        </big></div>
      Many of us are familiar with electrolytic splitting of water from
      their school days: if you hold two electrodes into an aqueous
      electrolyte and apply a sufficient voltage, gas bubbles of
      hydrogen and oxygen are formed. If this voltage is generated by
      sunlight in a solar cell, then you could store solar energy by
      generating hydrogen gas.This is because hydrogen is a versatile
      medium of storing and using "chemical energy." Research teams all
      over the world are therefore working hard to develop compact,
      robust, and cost-effective systems that can accomplish this
      challenge. But it is not that simple, due to corrosion of
      electrodes, unless they are made of expensive materials.
      Electrodes that so far have been used are made of very expensive
      elements such as platinum or platinum-iridium alloys.<br>
      <br>
      <b>New photocathode with several advantages</b><br>
      <br>
      Under the "Light2Hydrogen" BMBF Cluster project and an on-going
      "Solar H2" DFG Priority programme, a team from the HZB Institute
      for Solar Fuels has now developed a novel photoelectrode that
      solves these problems: it consists of chalcopyrite (a material
      used in device grade thin film solar cells) that has been coated
      with a thin, transparent, conductive oxide film of titanium
      dioxide (TiO2). The special characteristics are: the TiO2 film is
      polycrystalline and contains a small amount of platinum in the
      form of nanoparticles. This new composite presents some special
      talents. Firstly, it produces under sun light illumination a
      photovoltage of almost 0.5 volts and very high photocurrent
      densities of up to 38 mA/cm2; secondly, it acts as a catalyst to
      accelerate the formation of hydrogen, and finally, it is
      chemically protected against corrosion as well. Since TiO2 is
      transparent, almost all sun light reaches the photoactive
      chalcopyrite, leading to the observed high photocurrent density
      and photovoltage comparable with those of a conventional
      device-grade thin-film solar cell.<br>
      <br>
      <b>HZB recipe and technology</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The recipe for this novel and elegant coating was developed by
      Anahita Azarpira in the course of her doctoral studies in a team
      headed by Assoc. Prof. Thomas Schedel-Niedrig. She uses a chemical
      vapour coating technique (sprayed ion-layer gas
      reaction/Spray-ILGAR) that was developed and patented at the HZB
      Institute for Heterogeneous Material Systems (EE-IH). In this
      process, the titanium dioxide and platinum precursors are
      dissolved in ethanol and converted to a fog using an ultrasonic
      bath. The produced aerosol is directed over the heated substrate
      using a stream of nitrogen gas resulting into a polycrystalline
      thin film grown on the chalcopyrite substrate over time with
      embedded nanoparticles of platinum.<br>
      <br>
      <b>More than 80 % of light converted</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Azarpira and her colleagues varied the amount of platinum in the
      precursor solution in order to optimize the properties of the
      novel composite photoelectrode device.The properties were optimal
      with a volumetric proportion of about 5 % platinum (H2PtCl6) in
      the precursor solution." More than 80 % of the incident visible
      sunlight was photoelectrically converted by this composite system
      into electric current available for the hydrogen generation," says
      Schedel-Niedrig. That means little light is lost and the quantum
      efficiency is virtually very high. In addition, it has been
      reported in the very recently published article that the composite
      shows high long-term stability over 25 hours and reveals large
      photoelectrocatalytic activity of about 690 hydrogen molecules
      produced per second and per active center at the surface under
      illumination.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Feasibility demonstrated</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      However, there is still a lot to do. Currently, the majority of
      the required voltage between the composite photocathode and a
      platinum counter electrode of around 1.8 volts is still coming
      from a battery. Hence the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency has to be
      clearly improved. "But anyway, we demonstrate the feasibility of
      such future-oriented chemical robust photoelectrocatalytic systems
      that have the potential to convert solar energy to hydrogen, i.e
      to chemical energy for storage. As a consequence we have
      successfully developed and tested a demonstrator device for solar
      hydrogen production with a company in Schwerin under the
      Light2Hydrogen project, according to Schedel-Niedrig.<br>

      Solar energy appears to be the only form of renewable that can be
      exploited at level that matches the world's growing needs.
      However, it is equally necessary to find efficient ways to store
      solar energy in order to ensure a consistent energy supply when
      sunlight is scarce. One of the most efficient ways to achieve this
      is to use solar energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen,
      and get the energy back by consuming hydrogen in a fuel cell. But
      collecting solar energy on a large and sustainable scale means
      that such cells must be made from materials that are cheap,
      abundant, and have 10% solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      Publishing in Nature Communications, an EPFL-led team of
      scientists has found a method to create a high-efficiency,
      scalable solar water splitting device using cheap materials.<br>
      <br>
      Although one of the best means of sourcing renewable energy, solar
      systems cannot consistently produce adequate energy since sunlight
      varies from time to time and place to place. A solution to this
      problem is a device that can store energy in the form of hydrogen
      for later use, offering a consistent output over time with very
      little pollution.<br>
      <br>
      One of the most sustainable methods of producing hydrogen is
      photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting. Solar energy is used
      to break water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen through a
      process called "hydrogen evolution reaction." This reaction
      requires a catalyst, which is a chemical agent that increases its
      speed. In PEC water-splitting devices, a common catalyst used to
      split water is platinum, which is deposited on the surface of the
      solar panel's photocathode -- the solar panel's electrode that
      converts light into electric current.<br>
      <br>
      A research team at EPFL has now found a way to make efficient
      solar-powered water splitting devices using abundant and cheap
      materials. The group of Xile Hu developed a molybdenum-sulfide
      catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction, and the group of
      Michael Grätzel developed copper(I) oxide as a photocathode. The
      researchers found that the molybdenum sulfide can be deposited on
      the copper(I) oxide photocathode for use in PEC water splitting
      through a simple deposition process that can be easily expanded
      onto a large scale.<br>
      <br>
      The technique shows comparable efficiency to other hydrogen
      evolution reaction catalysts like platinum, it preserves the
      optical transparency for the light-harvesting surface and it shows
      improved stability under acidic conditions, which could translate
      into lower maintenance. But more importantly, both the catalyst
      and the photocathode are made with cheap, earth-abundant materials
      that could greatly reduce the cost of PEC water-splitting devices
      in the future. According to senior author Xile Hu, the work
      represents a state-of-the-art example for solar hydrogen
      production devices.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>&nbsp;<br>
      Concerns over climate change resulting from accumulation of
      anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the uncertainty
      in the amount of recoverable fossil fuel reserves are driving
      forces for the development of renewable, carbon-neutral energy
      technologies. A promising clean solution is photoelectrochemical
      water splitting to produce hydrogen using abundant solar energy.
      Here we present a simple and scalable technique for the deposition
      of amorphous molybdenum sulphide films as hydrogen evolution
      catalyst onto protected copper(I) oxide films. The efficient
      extraction of excited electrons by the conformal catalyst film
      leads to photocurrents of up to -5.7?mA?cm-2 at 0?V versus the
      reversible hydrogen electrode (pH 1.0) under simulated AM 1.5
      solar illumination. Furthermore, the photocathode exhibits
      enhanced stability under acidic environments, whereas
      photocathodes with platinum nanoparticles as catalyst deactivate
      more rapidly under identical conditions. The work demonstrates the
      potential of earth-abundant light-harvesting material and
      catalysts for solar hydrogen production.<br>

      Here, we report the production of silk incorporating graphene and
      carbon nanotubes directly by spider spinning, after spraying
      spiders with the corresponding aqueous dispersions. We observe a
      significant increment of the mechanical properties with respect to
      the pristine silk, in terms of fracture strength, Young's and
      toughness moduli. We measure a fracture strength up to 5.4 GPa, a
      Young's modulus up to 47.8 GPa and a toughness modulus up to 2.1
      GPa, or 1567 J/g, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the
      highest reported to date, even when compared to the current
      toughest knotted fibres. This approach could be extended to other
      animals and plants and could lead to a new class of bionic
      materials for ultimate applications. <br>

      The wave–particle dual nature of light and matter and the fact
      that the choice of measurement determines which one of these two
      seemingly incompatible behaviours we observe are examples of the
      counterintuitive features of quantum mechanics. They are
      illustrated by Wheeler’s famous ‘delayed-choice’ experiment1,
      recently demonstrated in a single-photon experiment2. Here, we use
      a single ultracold metastable helium atom in a Mach–Zehnder
      interferometer to create an atomic analogue of Wheeler’s original
      proposal. Our experiment confirms Bohr’s view that it does not
      make sense to ascribe the wave or particle behaviour to a massive
      particle before the measurement takes place. This result is
      encouraging for current work towards entanglement and Bell’s
      theorem tests in macroscopic systems of massive particles.<br>

      California is in its fourth year in the worst drought the state
      has seen in 1,200 years. <br>
      <br>
      Yet many Californians continue to use virtually the same amounts
      of water they were using before the drought began.<br>
      <br>
      Some have cited almonds as the culprit, since the tasty snack use
      a whole gallon of water per nut.<br>
      <br>
      Compared with noshing on a few almonds, though, many other
      activities are far worse in terms of the amount of water they
      require, from watering huge lawns to keeping sprawling waterparks
      open all season.<br>
      <br>
      Keeping their swimming pools full — especially in the middle of
      the desert. The average Palm Springs resident uses a whopping 201
      gallons of water, more than twice the state average.<br>
      <br>
      Playing golf. A single golf course requires roughly 400,000
      gallons of water per day, reports the hospitality association
      Hotel &amp; Leisure Advisors.<br>
      <br>
      Filling decorative ponds. New state regulations proposed last week
      ask communities like Palm Springs — where residents use more than
      165 gallons of water per person per day — to cut back their usage
      by 35%.<br>
      <br>
      Watering the lawn. [ Photo of a home in Beverly Hills, April 8,
      2015 ]<br>
      <br>
      Eating burgers. Every ounce of beef requires 106 gallons of water,
      the Los Angeles Times reports.<br>
      <br>
      Keeping the sprinklers on. A typical sprinkling system can use up
      to 265 gallons an hour, according to UK water-conservation group
      Waterwise.<br>
      <br>
      Washing the car. Cleaning the car at home can use 80 to 140
      gallons of water, reports Kaady Car Washes. In comparison, getting
      the car cleaned at your standard car wash can use less than half
      that amount, or roughly 30 to 45 gallons.<br>
      <br>
      Going to waterparks. The 21-acre Wet 'n Wild water park in Palm
      Springs, which will be open most of this summer, uses roughly
      1,200,000 gallons of water per day, estimates Hotel &amp; Leisure
      Advisors.<br>
      <br>
      Eating dairy products. Whether or not we eat their meat, just
      feeding dairy cattle requires lots of water — the foods they
      forage on are water and land intensive. A single serving of Greek
      yogurt, for example, uses 90 gallons of water, according to a
      report by Mother Jones.<br>
      <br>
      Water skiing on artificial lakes. This lake is located in Indio,
      just to the east of Palm Desert.<br>
      <br>
      Doing the dishes by hand. Even if you're careful about your water
      use, a typical hand washing session requires about 20 gallons of
      water. Leaving the water running while washing can use up to 40
      gallons. By comparison, the average dishwasher requires just 10
      gallons per typical load, estimates the American Water Works
      Association.<br>
      <br>
      Not covering the swimming pools they have. Each year, about 55
      inches of water evaporate from the average uncovered backyard
      swimming pool.<br>
      <br>
      Building new homes in the middle of the desert. These developments
      are in Cathedral City, just south of Palm Springs.<br>

          A team at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in the US
          has demonstrated desalination technology using free-standing,
          porous graphene membranes. Seawater desalination is usually
          performed via reverse-osmosis polymer-based filters, which
          require significant pressure to push water from one side to
          the other.<br>
          <br>
          By offering a more porous and thinner membrane, explains study
          co-leader Shannon Mark Mahurin of the ORNL, graphene could
          increase the flux and achieve the same purification rate with
          a smaller membrane area. "That all serves to reduce the amount
          of energy that it takes to drive the process," he says.<br>
          <br>
          Water molecules are too big to pass through graphene's fine
          mesh, so the team made holes using a silicon-nitride stencil
          and an oxygen plasma that knocked carbon atoms out of the 2D
          hexagonal lattice.<br>
          <br>
          The resulting membrane allowed water - but not salt ions - to
          penetrate, with the optimum pore size for effective
          desalination found to be 0.5-1 nm (Nature Nanotechnology
          10.1038/nnano.2015.37). "It's a huge advance," says Mahurin.
          "The flux through the current graphene membranes was at least
          an order of magnitude higher than [that through]
          state-of-the-art reverse-osmosis polymeric membranes."<br>
          <br>
          Menachem Elimelech of Yale University in the US, who was not
          involved in the study, says that the challenge for
          graphene-based membranes is to scale them up to larger areas,
          and warns that seawater desalination demands a salt-rejection
          level of greater than 99.9%.<br>
          <br>
          "This work represents progress in the development of
          graphene-based desalination membranes, but it shows a much
          lower salt rejection," Elimelech told Physics World. "It is
          now well known that high-flux membranes will not reduce the
          energy of seawater desalination because the transport of water
          through the membrane is governed to a large degree by the
          osmotic pressure, and further graphene membranes will need to
          be tested under hydraulic pressures, as in real operation."<br>

          "It's prophesied in our Instructions that the end of the world
          will be near when the trees start dying from the tops down.
          That's what the maples are doing today. Our Instructions say
          the time will come when there will be no corn, when nothing
          will grow in the garden, when water will be filthy and unfit
          to drink. Then a great monster will rise up from the water and
          destroy mankind. One of the names of that monster is "the
          sickness that eats you up inside" like diabetes or cancer or
          AIDS. Maybe AIDS is the monster. It's coming. It's already
          here.<br>
          <br>
          "Our prophet Handsome Lake told of it in the 1700s. He saw
          Four Beings, like four angels, coming from the Four
          Directions. They told him what would happen, how there would
          be diseases we'd never heard of before. You will see many
          tears in this country. Then a great wind will come, a wind
          that will make a hurricane seem like a whisper. It will
          cleanse the earth and return it to its original state. That
          will be the punishment for what we've done to the Creation...<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
          "These are the End times and the people must know the truth,
          share what we have taught you. There can be no more secrets
          now if we are to survive as a thinking species through these
          times." "This," they say, "must be done because the dream of
          humanity can only be preserved through the combined efforts of
          all peoples, and the joining and merging of all cultures into
          a oneness."&nbsp; (Statement of the traditional Hopi Elders as
          told to Cho Qosh Auh Ho Oh, a Chumash/Yaqui/Maya Native)<br>
          <br>
          <b>SEVENTH GENERATION </b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Haudenosaunee ( Mohawk ) -- Legend has it that the Spirit
          Doctors who predicted the arrival of the white man and the
          near destruction of the Red People also foretold the
          resurgence of the Indigenous people seven lifetimes after
          Columbus. According to the Haudenosaunee the current
          population is the seventh generation. <br>
          <br>
          The Mohawk prophecy states that the Onkwehonwe would see the
          day when the elm trees would die; strange animals would be
          born deformed and without the proper limbs; huge stone
          monsters would tear open the face of the earth;. The rivers
          would burn; the air would burn the eyes of humans; the birds
          would fall from the sky; The fish would die in the water; And
          humans would grow ashamed of the way that they had treated
          their Mother and Provider, the Earth.<br>
          <br>
          The Haudenosaunee draw their inspiration from the
          Gayaneshakgowa, the Great Law of Peace, the Six Nations
          Iroquois Confederacy. Providing wisdom to its people and the
          inspiration for their Nations constitution. The Gayaneshakgowa
          states: "...in our every deliberation we must consider the
          impact of our decisions on the next seven generations." <br>
          <br>
          That idea embodies everything the Haudenosaunee believe: that
          the environment is only temporarily entrusted to them and
          their actions within and upon it will affect it well into the
          future... And so their name was chosen, a name that reflected
          not only their philosophy but their dream of restoring and
          protecting the earth for their children and all who would
          follow in their path. <br>
          <br>
          Finally, after seven generations of living in close contact
          with the Europeans, the Onkwehonwe would rise up and demand
          that their rights and stewardship over the Earth be respected
          and restored.<br>
          <br>
          'When Deganawida was leaving the Indians in the Bay of Quinte
          in&nbsp; Ontario, he told the Indian people that they would
          face a time of great&nbsp; suffering. They would distrust
          their leaders and the principles of peace of&nbsp; the League,
          and a great white serpent was to come upon the Iroquois, and
          that for a time it would intermingle with the Indian people
          and would be&nbsp; accepted by the Indians, who would treat
          the serpent as a friend. This serpent would in time become so
          powerful that it would attempt to&nbsp; destroy the Indian,
          and the serpent is described as choking the life's blood out
          of the Indian people."<br>

          </b><br>
          Mad Bear (Wallace Anderson, Tuscarora) describeS how the
          appearance ofa red serpent distracts the white serpent. As the
          two serpents feud, the Native retreats to the "land of the
          hilly country" and revives the spirit and principles of peace
          that Deganawida had established. A seer in the form of a young
          boy appears and, while watching the contest between the red
          and white serpents, would impart a message of hope to the
          Iroquois people, with the promise: "And Deganawida said that
          they will gather in the land of the hilly country, beneath the
          branches of an elm tree, and they should burn tobacco and call
          upon Deganawida by name when we are facing our darkest hours,
          and he will return." The prophecy ends as follows:<br>
          <br>
          The next direction that he [a young leader, possibly in his
          teens, who would be a chosen seer] will face will be eastward
          and at that time he will be momentarily blinded by a light
          that is many times brighter than the sun. The light will be
          coming from the east to the west over the water.... Deganawida
          said as this light approaches that he would be that light, and
          he would return to his Indian people, and when he returns, the
          Indian people would be a greater nation than they ever were
          before.<br>

          </b><br>
          The prophecy of Deganawida's return is sufficiently attested
          in Iroquoian tradition to be considered an essential, though
          not prominent, feature in the Deganawida cycle.<br>

          Guboo Ted Thomas( Australian Aboriginal Tribal Elde) -- "I was
          in dreamtime. I see this great wave going. I tell people about
          this wave. It wasn't a tidal wave. This was a spiritual wave.
          So, to me, I believe that the Dreamtime is going to be that. I
          believe the revival is going to start in Australia when we're
          dreaming. It's the hummingbee that I'm talking about. And
          love. We've got to learn to love one another. You see, that's
          really what's going to happen to the earth. We're going to
          have tidal waves. We're going to have earthquakes. That's
          coming because we don't consider this land as our Mother.
          We've taken away the balance, and we're not putting it back. I
          look at the bush, and those trees are alive. They're not dead,
          they're alive. And they want you to cuddle them."<br>

          <b>WHEN THE WORLD CHANGED FOREVER</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          (Tsimshian, Hopi) -- The old one sat in contemplative silence,
          smoking his pipe and thinking about the future. "There will
          come a time," he said, "when the world will be choked by a
          huge snake that has wrapped itself around and around the world
          below us. The snake will have coloured eyes...different
          colours.&nbsp; Each time he shivers, his coloured eyes will
          create a firefly.&nbsp; Firefly will burst through the earth
          and flash out into Father Sky pulling a tail of coloured
          light. As Father Sky continues to turn, more and more
          fireflies will cover the world until the tails of coloured
          lights intertwine so much it will be hard to see between or
          around them. They will control the people and the world in a
          way that pits human against human."<br>
          <br>
          For 500 years the Incan Q'ero Elders preserved a sacred
          prophecy of a great change, or "pachacuti," in which the world
          would be turned right-side-up, harmony and order would be
          restored, and chaos and disorder ended. The Q'ero had lived in
          their villages high in the Andes in virtual solitude from the
          world until their "discovery" in 1949.<br>
          <br>
          According to ancient prophecy, this is the time of the great
          gathering called the "mastay" and reintegration of the peoples
          of the four directions.<br>
          <br>
          The Q'ero are releasing their teachings to the West, in
          preparation for the day the Eagle of the North and the Condor
          of the South (the Americas) fly together again.<br>
          <br>
          They believe that "munay," love and compassion, will be the
          guiding force of this grade gather of people.<br>
          <br>
          The new caretakers of the Earth will come from the West, and
          those that have made the greatest impact on Mother Earth now
          have the moral responsibility to remake their relationship
          with Her, after remaking themselves," said Don Antonio
          Morales, a master Q'ero shaman.<br>
          <br>
          The prophecy holds that North America will supply the physical
          strength, or body; Europe will supply the mental aspect, or
          head; and the heart will be supplied by South America.<br>
          <br>
          When the Spanish conquered the Incas 500 years ago, the last
          pachacuti, or great change, occurred. The Q'ero have been
          waiting ever since for the next pachacuti, when order would
          emerge out of chaos.<br>
          <br>
          The prophecies are optimistic. They refer to the end of time
          as we know it -- the death of a way of thinking and a way of
          being, the end of a way of relating to nature and to the
          earth. In the coming years, the Incas expect us to emerge into
          a golden age, a golden millennium of peace. The prophecies
          also speak of tumultuous changes happening in the earth, and
          in our psyche, redefining our relationships and spirituality.<br>
          <br>
          The next Pachacuti, or great change, has already begun, and it
          promises the emergence of a new human after this period of
          turmoil. The chaos and upheaval characteristic of this period
          will last another four years, according to the Q'ero.<br>
          <br>
          "There was the cycle of the mineral, the rock. There was the
          cycle of the plant. And now we are in the cycle of the animal
          coming to the end of that and beginning the cycle of the human
          being. When we get into the cycle of the human being, the
          highest and greatest powers that we have will be released to
          us. They will be released from that light or soul that we
          carry to the mind. But right now we're coming to the end of
          the animal cycle and we have investigated ourselves and
          learned what it is to be like an animal on this earth." --

          "And so he gave each of us a responsibility and we call that
          the Guardianship." <br>
          <br>
          "To the South, the red people, were given the Guardianship of
          the earth. We were to learn during this cycle of time the
          teachings of the earth, the plants that grow from the earth,
          the foods that we could eat, and the herbs that are healing so
          that when we came back together with the other brothers and
          sisters we could share this knowledge with them. Something
          good was to happen on the earth."<br>
          <br>
          "To the East,&nbsp; the yellow people were given the
          Guardianship of the wind. They were to learn about the sky and
          breathing and how to take that within ourselves for spiritual
          advancement. They were to share that with is at this time."<br>
          <br>
          "To the West, the black race were given the Guardianship of
          the water. They were to learn the teachings of the water which
          is the chief of the elements, being the most humble and the
          most powerful. When I went to the University of Washington and
          I learned that it was a black man that discovered blood
          plasma, it didn't surprise me because blood is water and the
          elders already told me the black people would bring the
          teachings of the water."<br>
          <br>
          "To the North, the white race were given the Guardianship of
          the fire. If you look at the center of many of the things they
          do you will find the fire. They say a light bulb is the white
          man's fire. If you look at the center of a car you will find a
          spark. If you look at the center of the airplane and the train
          you will find the fire. The fire consumes, and also moves.
          This is why it was the white brothers and sisters who began to
          move upon the face of the earth and reunite us as a human
          family." -- (Lee Brown, Cherokee)<br>

          <b>ANISHINAABE (OJIBWA)</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Seven major Nee gawn na kayg (prophets) came to the
          Anishinaabe. They came at a time when the people were living a
          full and peaceful life on the northeastern coast of North
          America. These prophets left the people with seven predictions
          of what the future would bring. Each of these prophecies was
          called a fire and each fire referred to a particular era of
          time that would come in the future. Thus, the teachings of the
          seven prophets are now called the Neesh wa swi ish ko day kawn
          (seven fires) of the Ojibwa.<br>
          <br>
          The First Fire said to the people, ”in the time of the first
          fire, the Anishinaabe nation will rise up and follow the
          Sacred Shell of the Midewiwin Lodge [post European contact].
          The Midewiwin lodge will serve as a rallying point for the
          people and its traditional ways will be the source of much
          strength. <br>
          <br>
          The Second Fire said to the people, ”you will know the second
          fire because at this time the nation will be camped by a large
          body of water.&nbsp; In this time the direction of the Sacred
          Shell will be lost. The Midewiwin will diminish in strength.<br>
          <br>
          A boy will be born to point the way back to the traditional
          ways. He will show the direction to the stepping stones to the
          future of the Anishinaabe people.”<br>
          <br>
          The Third Fire said to the people, ”In the third fire, the
          Anishinaabe will find the path to their chosen ground, a land
          in the west to which they must move their families. This will
          be the land where food grows on water.”<br>
          <br>
          <b>WARNING OF THE ARRIVAL OF THE EUROPEANS</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          The Fourth Fire was originally given to the people by two
          prophets. They came as one. They told of the coming of the
          light skinned race.&nbsp; One of the prophets said,” you will
          know the future of our people by what face the light skinned
          race wears. If they come wearing the face of nee kon nis i win
          (brotherhood), then there will come a time of wonderful change
          for generations to come. They will bring new knowledge and

          be different from the other prophets. He was young and had a
          strange light in his eyes. He said, ”in the time of the
          seventh fire a osh ki bi ma di zeeg (new people) will emerge.
          They will retrace their steps to find what was left by the
          trail. Their steps will take them to the Elders who they will
          ask to guide them on their journey. But many of the Elders
          will have fallen asleep. They will awaken to this new time
          with nothing to offer. Some of the Elders will be silent out

          It is at this time that the light skinned race will be given a
          choice between two roads. If they choose the right road, then
          the seventh fire will light the eighth and final fire, an
          eternal fire of peace, love, brotherhood and sisterhood. If
          the light skinned race make the wrong choice of roads, then
          the destruction they brought with them in coming to this

          When the end is near, we will see a halo of mist around the

          death and resort to eating each other to survive a drought ,
          or further back , like the race of Mars , destroy our
          atmosphere and go underground and have to leave the planet and
          start over else where ... cultures rise and fall because of
          the actions of men , when women take over the planet =sanity
          will return ... they will one day fix what man has broken ...
          the plejaren's own past , their ancestors destroyed a galaxy ,
          they had to leave Lyra ... they know the result of war , which

          I am a retired mental-health therapist who now writes
          young-adult science fiction novels, and I also do my best to
          interpret the climate crisis for the same audience since the
          crisis is so often presented in thick adult language.&nbsp;
          I’m working on a new page for my web site (www.nebador.com)
          that will list the important events since 2000, and the future
          events that seem likely.&nbsp; I’m putting the future events
          in 5-year blocks based on my best guess of when they will
          occur.&nbsp; My thinking on this is similar to Dr.
          McPherson’s.&nbsp; I plan to move the items around as I learn
          more, or as they come to pass.<br>
          <br>
          I’d appreciate any opinions on the events I’ve chosen, my
          wording, or the tricky issue of timing.&nbsp; I am
          purposefully avoiding vague items like “the IPCC stated that
          there is a 75% chance that by 2050 …” as those are not
          digestible by young adults.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I am not
          including “piggybacked” issues like economics and social
          justice, unless there appears to be a very close linkage with
          the climate crisis.<br>

          WAR: Several North American and European nations, in an
          attempt to improve their economies and pacify civil unrest,
          provoke a war with several Eurasian nations.<br>
          <br>
          COMMERCIAL COLLAPSE: With businesses unable to get credit,
          travel and shipping dangerous, and civil unrest everywhere,
          most products and services become unavailable.<br>
          <br>
          MARTIAL LAW AND FASCISM: To keep some order and protect those
          in power, governments suspend civil rights and due process,
          and hand most remaining functions to corporations.<br>

          POLITICAL COLLAPSE: Governments are unable to provide any
          services and hold onto power, and large political units break
          down into smaller kingdoms and tribes.<br>
          <br>
          PLAGUE: With public health systems no longer working and
          malnutrition rising, influenza, dysentery, dengue fever, and
          other diseases will easily get started and run their course
          unhindered.<br>
          <br>
          FOOD CHAIN DISRUPTIONS: The disappearance of key species such
          as honey bees, krill, and sardines not only contribute to the
          collapse of agriculture and fisheries, but eventually disrupt
          most food chains, dooming all large animals.<br>
          <br>
          MASS EXTINCTION: Since the beginning of the “Anthropocene”
          (the man-made era), the world has lost about 1/4 of all living
          plant and animal species, with the total rapidly moving toward
          1/2.<br>
          <br>
          SOCIAL COLLAPSE: Social institutions, including churches, find
          they have absolutely no resources and become irrelevant to the
          remaining people.<br>
          <br>
          EAST ANTARCTICA: The last glaciated region rapidly melts,
          bringing sea level to about 260' (80 m) above the current
          level.<br>
          <br>
          FINAL DIASPORA: The equatorial regions become completely
          uninhabitable, and humanity is forced to migrate as far north
          or south as they can go, with little or no interaction between
          the 7 or 8 regions.<br>

          Birth Certificates --</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        <b>"Birth Certificates</b></b> -- Hi Jim. Ben from FEMA region 5
      again. Thank you for turning me onto Wayne Barbuto's book "It's
      Not the Law" [ http://www.itsnotthelaw.com ]...<br>
      <br>
      According to Wayne's book, everybody born on US soil is issued a
      birth certificate and those make it to the US Dept of Commerce
      where they're used as collateral against future expected earnings
      to obtain loans from foreign governments and the federal reserve.
      He said one guy using FOIA was able to get his actual birth
      certificate from the US Dept of Commerce and it had 17 different
      endorsements on it by foreign governments. My point is that the US
      government actually NEEDS all of these anchor babies as additional
      collateral to keep the government running since Americans are
      having fewer children. It can't go on forever but it will allow
      them to keep going for the short term while they continue to
      stockpile ammo, armored vehicles and build bunkers to use against
      us.<br>

      ... Previously, researchers estimated the field was weakening
      about 5 percent per century, but the new data revealed the field
      is actually weakening at 5 percent per decade, or 10 times faster
      than thought. As such, rather than the full flip occurring in
      about 2,000 years, as was predicted, the new data suggest it could
      happen sooner.<br>

              </b></big></big></font></div>
      <br>
      <b>Stunning new research conducted by a team of scientists at Rex
        Research Laboratories in Las Vegas NV clims to have has
        determined that the worldwide grid of alternating current power
        lines is degaussing the natural electrical field of Earth, and
        is "a major contributing factor that is severely aggravating the
        magnetic field flip" that is underway, according to a press
        statement released today.</b><br>
      <br>
      Robert Nelson, Director of Rex Research and putative lead
      "scientist" in the study, warns that "We must turn of all power
      plants immediately! Failure to do so will result in a permanent
      loss of the geomagnetic field, "<br>
      <br>
      " A natural shifting of the magnetic poles is underway enow, but
      our global network of alternating current lines and transmitters
      is interfering with the process. The geomagnetic field&nbsp; it is
      becoming wildly unstable, and the unpredictable consequences
      certainly will be unimaginably inconceivable !"<br>
      <br>
      Other scientists have dismissed the findings as "pseudo-scientific
      fear-porn, a travesty of a mockery of the scientific method."<br>
      <br>
      The eminent physicist Stephen Hawkings commented that, "Even if
      the theory is correct, the same technology that allegedly is
      degaussing the planet also could be used to 'jump-start' Earth's
      geomagnetic generator if need be, so there is no cause for alarm.
      "<br>
      <br>
      Nelson, who is a high-school dropout with no scientific
      credentials whatsoever, rebutted Hawking's opinion in a press
      release yesterday :<br>
      <br>
      "It's not a' theory', but rather, a 'factual intuition' received
      from akasa via my super-sensitized " Vagal Vortex " (tm). It is an
      abdominal&nbsp; nexus of nutated neurons that I cultivate with
      proprietary methods of quantum-mystic causality engineering, (
      formerly known as Taoist internal alchemy ). That may seem to be "
      magical thinking " to psychiatrists and neuroscientists, but
      actually, it is simply and fundamentally sub-elementary in its
      catholic nature ! I can teach anyone the basic principles and
      techniques within an hour !"<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, time and data will tell if the supposed "factual
      intuition" is true or not...<br>
