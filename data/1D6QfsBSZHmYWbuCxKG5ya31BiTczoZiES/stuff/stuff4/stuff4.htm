      </b>ProteinMusic is a Java program converting DNA sequences into
      music. The original idea for this project came from R. D. King
      here at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth and C. G Angus from
      the Shamen (King, R.D. &amp; Angus, C.G. (1996)). They developed a
      program written in C on an Apple Mac together with a MIDI
      connection to a synthesizer in 1996. This program here is a
      complete re-write of the original program in Java.<br>

        <br>
      </b>You wouldn't think there was music in me. But beautiful and
      strange music has been developed from the sequence of nucleotides
      in my DNA.<br>
      Using special software John Dunn selected and/or developed
      synthesizer sounds to be used to create music by translating the
      individual DNA codons, the strings of guanine, adenine, cytosine
      and thymine, into the proteins they form, taking account of
      "start" and "stop" signals.<br>
      <br>
      The amino acids of each protein sequence plus chemical properties
      of the amino acids and the bases themselves were interpreted as
      pitches, pan positions, transpose values, tempi, tone, colors and
      so on. The realization of the piece was developed manually, until
      the piece was right.<br>

        <br>
      </b>Hidden right there in plain sight is one of the most profound
      truths of our existence. From ancient Hindu mystics to modern
      quantum physicists the collective wisdom of humankind has
      repeatedly discovered that the universe is an immense energy field
      vibrating on a score of frequencies. No matter how we separate the
      individual notes, they all play together to create a single
      harmonious song.[2]<br>
      <br>
      The Bible, so central to the beliefs of many Western cultures,
      tells us that "In the beginning was the Word." Yet many Eastern
      and aboriginal cultures maintain that the world was not spoken,
      but, rather, SUNG into existence. For a growing number of
      scientists, their research into the impacts of music on the brain
      and consciousness now favors the influence of song over speech. In
      fact, quantum string theory describes our bodies, all physical
      matter, and even the Earth itself, as cosmic instruments staying
      in tune with a larger universal orchestra.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Peter Dena: DNA music for Genesis</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>The physio-musical conversion of DNA sequences occurs via a
      series of formulae that were worked out in a manner based on
      physical properties of DNA and musical parameters. Once the
      sequences are converted by my custom algorithms they are played by
      the DNA Mixer, which reads linearly much like the
      ribosomesâ€”organelles that read codons for amino acid
      conversionâ€”traverse the mRNA, mixing multiple sequences
      simultaneously just like in our cells.<br>
      <br>
      From the onset I believed that a musical reading of DNA ought to
      be rendered literally. As the sequences represent life of many
      sorts, I am reluctant to tamper with the â€œscore.â€ The DNA
      mixer can realize sequences as digital sound and/or print them out
      in musical notation. Ideally, performances of the gene sequences
      should be executed live from the computer as in an installation,
      where the ribosome simulations can be positioned spontaneously
      before playing. Red Blood Cells is a mix of five genes that are
      present in human blood: alpha and beta globin, heme synthetase,
      transaldolase, and glucose 6 phosphate. These are realized
      simultaneously, just as they are produced in the body. The piece
      was premiered in November, 1995 at the XI Colloquium on Musical
      Informatics at the University of Bologna. In May, 1996 it was
      aired over Icelandic National Radio during a series on American
      Electronic Music, and in August of the same year it was presented
      in Hong Kong at the 1996 International Computer Music Conference.<br>

      </b>DNA and music?? What is the connection? And why is it included
      in a page on correlation structure of DNA sequences? Because: the
      correlation stucture "1/f spectra" have been found in both musical
      signals and DNA sequences.<br>
      <br>
      Prof. Susumu Ohno (of Beckman Research Institute of the City of
      Hope, who died on January 13, 2000, at the age of 71) proposed
      years ago that the repetition process governs both the musical
      composition and the DNA sequence construction . see this paper by
      Ohno in Immunogenetics (1986) titled: "The all pervasive principle
      of repetitious recurrence governs not only coding sequence
      construction but also human endeavor in musical composition".<br>
      <br>
      When DNA sequences are converted to music, it sounds musical!<br>
      <br>
      Models with duplication and mutation operations, such as the
      "expansion-modification model" are able to generate sequences with
      1/f spectra.<br>

        <br>
      </b>Welcome to the World of Molecular Music -- The site for music
      derived from the molecules of life.<br>
      <br>
      Created by award-winning biochemist and musician Dr. Linda Long,
      Molecular Music provides a pioneering link between the seemingly
      disparate worlds of music and biological science. It involves the
      generation of music from three-dimensional biological molecules
      called proteins. Dr. Linda Long has developed it as tool for
      teaching molecular modelling of complex protein structures, and to
      generate music from herbs, medicinal plants and the human body for
      relaxation and therapeutic purposes.<br>
      <br>
      Molecular Music is computer generated music that creates a gateway
      into understanding life, allowing us to perceive nature in her
      many forms through sound. Music is not limited by words or logic
      and so may communicate with us on deeper levels, freeing us to
      directly experience the essence of all living matter and giving us
      an insight into the voice of nature.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><b>Music of the Body</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Music of the Body is a CD of music derived from protein
      hormones found in the human body. Its soothing and uplifting
      properties make it ideal for use by health professionals and
      alternative medicine practitioners to accompany their therapeutic
      work (e.g. massage therapy with essential oils, reiki and music
      therapy), and by individuals to enhance meditation, mind-body
      visualization techniques, and bodywork e.g. yoga. It may also be
      used to promote relaxation in health clubs, health clinics, spas
      and beauty salons, and induce calm in clinical settings such as
      hospitals and dentists.<br>
      <br>
      Computer generated note sequences, derived from protein hormones
      found in the human body, have been arranged by Dr. Linda Long to
      create complex 'multi-dimensional' musical pieces which contain
      sequences describing both the secondary and tertiary features of
      the individual hormones.<br>
      <br>
      Thyrotropin .. Thyroid hormone .. Parathyroid hormone ..&nbsp;
      Guanylin .. Somatostatin ..&nbsp; Growth hormone .. Progesterone

      <div align="center"><b>Crystals</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Crystals arise in accordance with laws of symmetry, so they
      have very simple orders which can be interpreted harmonically.
      These properties are already expressed in the atomic structure of
      the crystal. There are 32 crystal classes, covering all existing
      specimens. Crystal symmetry is classed in terms of rotation and
      mirroring. For rotational symmetry, the only possible values are
      360’, 180’, 120’, 90' and 60', which corresponds to the fractional
      series 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/6 (where 1/1 = 360'), and can in turn
      be interpreted harmonically (c, c’, g’, c”, g”).<br>
      <br>
      At the beginning of the 20th century, the German mineralogist
      Victor Goldschmidt discovered a mathematical formula to classify
      how crystals form surfaces. His table corresponds exactly to the
      Pythagorean Lambdoma right up to the number 4 (or 1/4) – this is
      particularly interesting because he was not familiar with the
      Lambdoma.<br>

        Red Blood Cells (1995), digitally synthesized DNA sequences --</b>
      The physio-musical conversion of DNA sequences occurs via a series
      of formulae that were worked out in a manner based on physical
      properties of DNA and musical parameters. Once the sequences are
      converted by my custom algorithms they are played by the DNA
      Mixer, which reads linearly much like the ribosomes—organelles
      that read codons for amino acid conversion—traverse the mRNA,
      mixing multiple sequences simultaneously just like in our cells.<br>
      <br>
      From the onset I believed that a musical reading of DNA ought to
      be rendered literally. As the sequences represent life of many
      sorts, I am reluctant to tamper with the “score.” The DNA mixer
      can realize sequences as digital sound and/or print them out in
      musical notation. Ideally, performances of the gene sequences
      should be executed live from the computer as in an installation,
      where the ribosome simulations can be positioned spontaneously
      before playing. Red Blood Cells is a mix of five genes that are
      present in human blood: alpha and beta globin, heme synthetase,
      transaldolase, and glucose 6 phosphate. These are realized
      simultaneously, just as they are produced in the body...<br>

        sequences -- </b>Collagen is the main structural protein found
      in animal connective tissue (it forms gelatin when boiled).
      Collagen and Bass Clarinet, was commissioned by Italian
      clarinetist Frederico Paci. He premiered it at the Aspekte Musik
      Festival in Salzburg, Austria in 1997. The six parts (the bass
      clarinet plus five computer tracks) are generated from two
      collagen DNA sequences (three copies of each). Thus, one of the
      six was outputted as musical notation (properly transposed) for
      the bass clarinet, and the remaining five "channels" were realized
      and played electronically by a DNA mixer, programmed by the
      composer in MAX/MSP.<br>

      unique DNA sequences that are put on call to fight off invading
      diseases. Each immune gene consists of one of three fixed lead
      sequences (Gamma, Kappa and Lambda), stitched at the head of a
      variable region, or randomly generated string. The programming
      effort requires an algorithm that initiates lead sequences and

        <b>A method of producing audibly discernible sounds&nbsp; </b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
        Inventor(s): Helen LONG<br>
        <br>
      </b>Means for producing an audibly discernable representation of a
      three dimensional structure such as a biological structure
      comprises a preliminary analysis of the structure to determine
      three dimensional positional coordinate data, processing this data
      to filter out large scale and small scale variations into
      successive sets of data, combining this data into a single
      sequence and generating audible sounds therefrom relating to the
      positional coordinate data. The biological structure represented
      are proteins whereby the CA carbon atoms of the amino acids of the
      proteins are analysed by x-ray crystallography to produce the data
      sets for generating the audible sounds.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates generally to a method for producing
      audibly discernible sounds, and particularly to a method in which
      the sounds are representative of complex structures.<br>
      <br>
      In the representation of complex structures occupying
      three-dimensional space it has been conventional either to use
      stylised models of the structures, themselves occupying the
      three-dimensional space, or to represent the structures in
      two-dimensions with an appropriate representational convention by
      which the information concerning the third dimension is conveyed.<br>
      <br>
      Each of these representational techniques has inherent drawbacks.
      Threedimensional models, although they can be produced accurately,
      are not readily transportable nor are is they indefinitely
      extendable, so that, for example, a highly complex structure may
      be limited to a representation of only a portion under immediate
      examination. Although two-dimensional representations are more
      readily portable, and can also be converted into a form suitable
      for display on a screen such as a computer screen, the necessity
      for a drawing convention to represent the third dimension results
      in a degree of imprecision and uncertainty in the accuracy of the
      representation. The present invention proposes a complete
      departure from conventional representational techniques by
      proposing to provide an audibly discernible representation of
      spatial information.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention finds particular (but not exclusive)
      application in the 2 representation of naturally-occurring
      structures such as biological structures, especially proteins.
      Structure, pattern and form are inherent in naturally-occurring
      biological material, and these features may be drawn upon to
      provide parameters for audibly discernible representations. In the
      representation of spatial information in audible form the audible
      information may approximate to, or be considered as, music.
      Culture and musical tradition has resulted in the evolution of
      music consisting of references and structures often not
      consciously appreciated by the listener but nevertheless having an
      effect on the physiological perception of the music. Recent
      developments in digital computing have made available to musicians
      further means by which musical composition may be developed, and
      it is not unknown for a digital computer to be used as a
      compositional tool for developing new structures in music. This
      new type of - music is sometimes called algorithmic, and such
      music, developed with computer process rules, may combine tonal
      and structural relationships which it would be difficult to
      calculate by traditional means.<br>
      <br>
      The audible representation of biological structures such as
      proteins may, therefore, result in sounds which may be musical in
      their form. Proteins are biological macro molecules which are the
      fundamental building blocks in all life forms. Proteins are
      composed of a plurality of sub units, amino acids, which are
      arranged according to the individual amino acid properties to form
      a three dimensional molecule. It is recognised that music is
      defined by the intervals between notes rather than the absolute
      pitches of the notes and, correspondingly, proteins may be
      considered as being defined more by their overall patterns than by
      their absolute or primary sequences. Proteins structures, may be
      considered to comprise four mains elements or levels of
      complexity, namely'a I w..<br>
      <br>
      3 primary structure which is the linear order in which the amino
      acid sub units occur. A secondary and a tertiary structure
      determined by the properties of these amino acids which give rise
      to structural features referred to by biologists as loops, turns,
      alpha helices and beta strands or beta sheets depending on the
      spatial arrangements of the sub units in the linear sequence.
      Quaternary structures are recognisable as the quaternary structure
      is the broadest structural level concerned with the'arrangement of
      individual protein "blocks" which fit together to form the final
      protein molecule.<br>
      <br>
      At the primary level, alpha helices are uniform coil-like
      structures in which the 10 functional groups or R-groups of the
      amino acid project outward from the helix axis.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand secondary structures known as beta strands fold
      back and forth with individual amino acid R-groups projecting from
      the folded chain on alternate sides. Different beta strands may be
      aligned with one another, adjacent strands forming weak bonds
      which connect them into what are called beta-sheets. Also at the
      secondary/tertiary level regions of the molecule referred to as
      "tums' follow a difFerent directional path and are commonly found
      connecting two regions of an alpha helix or beta strands. These
      are structures spanning both the secondary and tertiary level in
      that the folding patterns of the secondary structures are combined
      to produce the overall tertiary structure of a protein.
      Information concerning the relationship of these features is
      usually considered at a visual level and represented visually. The
      present invention provides an alternative means of representation
      allowing other senses to be involved.<br>
      <br>
      According to one aspect of the present invention, therefore, a
      method of producing an 4 audibly discernible representation of a
      three dimensional sti-ucture comprises the steps of:<br>
      <br>
      generating numerical information concerning the spatial position
      of identifiable components of the structure from analysis of the
      structure, converting the numerical information into a derived
      digital signal by forming moving averages of the numerical
      information, subjecting the derived digital signal to a conversion
      from the three- dimensional value to produce a signal having a
      scalar value representing at least one of the properties of a
      audibly discernible sound, and generating a sound having that or
      those properties.<br>
      <br>
      At a fundamental level it may be considered that each positional
      coordinate representing the presence of a feature or structural
      element of the structure may be allocated a unique discernible
      sound. It is of course important that the same sound is repeatably
      produced by the same feature, but it is not essential that only
      one feature produce that sound.applied to the representation of a
      naturally occurring structure, such as a protein the analysis may
      be performed by x-ray crystallography to determine the relative
      locations of the amino acids of which the protein is composed. In
      its application to other stru ctures, however, different analysis
      techniques may be used on order to generate the raw positional
      data and, of course, the coordinate. information may represent the
      positions of other significant elements in the structure. In an
      engineering structure, for example, the positional coordinates may
      represent the nodes in a load-bearing assembly and/or the stresses
      applied to elements of a structure during operation or when
      performing its function. For example, the stresses exerted on an
      element of a building may be represented by pitch, variation of
      which represents increases in the stress so that dynamic variation
      of the stress pattern can be represented audibly which enables a
      plurality of different signals to be perceived simultaneously even
      in a structure in which, with a traditional visual representation,
      certain 5 components may be masked or covered by others and
      therefore not visible.<br>
      <br>
      In the representation of structures such, as proteins the
      resultant data of the x-ray crystallography analysis may comprise
      a set of positional coordinates representing the relative
      positions of at least some of the atoms of the amino acids of the
      protein. In particular the positional coordinate data may
      represent the three dimensional positions in space, with respect
      to a given frame of reference, of the CA carbon atoms of the amino
      acids of the protein.<br>
      <br>
      Although individual unique sounds may be generated these sounds
      may not necessarily be represented-by individual musical notes,
      but could be other detectable sounds such as chords or discordant
      sounds.<br>
      <br>
      In the performance of the method of the invention the said moving
      averages comprise at least a first moving average of the value of
      the positional coordinate data scanned over successive groups of
      carbon atoms to provide an approximate representation of the
      secondary structure of the amino acids in the protein.<br>
      <br>
      Likewise, a second moving average of the values of the first
      moving average may be taken over a range of values thereof greater
      than the range used to form the first 6 moving average. This
      second moving average provides a further degree of "smoothing" to
      act effectively to filter out the smaller scale variations,
      without completely excluding larger scale variations.<br>
      <br>
      Further sequences of digital signals may be derived from the said
      first and second moving averages, for example by determining the
      differences between the first moving average and the positional
      coordinate data, whereby to provide a digital data signal in which
      larger scale variations are not present and smaller scale
      variations are amplified.<br>
      <br>
      The second further sequences of digital signals may be derived
      from the first and second moving averages by determining the
      differences between the first and second moving averages whereby,
      in effect, to act as a midfrequency filter on the data.<br>
      <br>
      The method may include deriving a third further sequence of
      digital signals by normallsing the second moving average values
      about a selected origin to represent the large scale features of
      the positional coordinate data stream. This, effectively, acts as
      a low frequency filter to produce signal dependent on the large
      scale features.<br>
      <br>
      The said first, second and third further sequences of digital
      signals may each be multiplied by a respective weighting factor
      and summed to produce a single sequence of averaged and processed
      three dimensional coordinate values which are then mapped onto a
      sequence of one-dimensional values. This may be achieved via a
      three dimensional wave form generated by spectral synthesis, using
      a fourier synthesis technique, or by other techniques which
      provide a repeatable mapping of a three- 7 dimensional point onto
      a one-dimensional point which can be interpreted as a musical
      parameter. A simple example might be to sum together the three
      coordinate values to get a single one-dimensional value.<br>
      <br>
      The one-dimensional value may be pitch or volume and other means
      may be provided for varying the attack and decay of the sound in
      order to generate musical notes.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention also comprehends a method of producing an
      audibly discernible representation of a three-dimensional
      structure in which the identification of the details of secondary
      structures in the positional coordinate data is obtained by means
      of a filter.<br>
      <br>
      In another aspect of the invention a method of producing audibly
      recognisable sounds representing respective amino acids in a
      protein structure comprises the steps of subjecting the protein
      structure to an x-ray crystallography analysis to produce a series
      of raw data signals representing the three-dimensional positional
      coordinates of the CA carbon atoms of the amino acids of which the
      protein is composed; filtering the said raw data signals to
      generate a plurality of derived moving averages thereof whereby to
      filter out large and small scale variations respectively;
      generating from the derived moving averages a composite signal
      including weighted moving averages as components thereof, and
      generating from the said composite signal an audible signal in
      which each amino acid is represented by an identifiable musical
      note.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention may be embodied in apparatus including
      visual display means by 8 which the raw data positional coordinate
      signals may be displayed graphically in synchronism with the
      audible output signals such that visual and aural correspondence
      is discernible.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention also comprehends apparatus for producing an
      audibly discernible representation of a three-dimensional
      structure, comprising: means for analysing numerical information
      to generate representations of the position of identifiable
      components thereof, means for forming moving averages of the said
      numerical information, means for converting the moving averages of
      the numerical information into scalar values, and means for
      allocating pitch or volume values to the said scalar values to
      generate audible sounds related to the structure.<br>
      <br>
      Various examples of the invention will now be more particularly
      described.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example I - </b>for the generation of musical notes
      representing the individual amino acids of a protein structure,
      each x, y and z positional coordinate of the CA carbon atom from
      each amino acid in an original protein sequence SO derived from
      x-ray crystallography analysis is processed twice, once to extract
      a first moving average SI, calculated by averaging the values of
      the sequence SO over a range of five amino acids, and then a
      second time to extract a second moving average S2 calculated by
      averaging the values of the moving average S I over a range of
      twenty five amino acids. The first moving average represents the
      secondary structure of the protein and the second 9 moving average
      represent the tertiary structure.<br>
      <br>
      From these three digital data streams S 50, 51, 52 may be derived
      three further sequences as follows:<br>
      <br>
      1 ' SO- 1 is calculated by subtracting the first moving average S
      1 from the original three dimensional data SO. This has the effect
      of emphasising the small twists and turns of the protein and of
      masking the larger scale curves over the protein structure as a
      whole. This in effect acts as a high 6equency filter on the
      three-dimensional structure of the protein and highlights the
      spiral shape of the alpha helices. By subtracting the first moving
      average from the original data all the short-term fluctuations are
      maintained within the structure of the alpha helices without
      interference from larger scale changes. By mapping this to pitch
      variation an accurate sonic representation of the alpha helices is
      obtained. This mapping results in the generation of sequences of
      arpeggios when the alpha helices are traversed, and the same or a
      slightly varying note is is heard when the beta sheets are
      traversed. This latter results from the fact that a beta sheet
      contains few small-scale changes.<br>
      <br>
      SI-2 is created by subtracting the second moving average from the
      first moving average. This has the effect of amplifying the medium
      sized turns of the protein whilst attenuating the higher frequency
      alpha helix turns and the lower frequency large scale curves. This
      process acts as a medium frequency filter on the three-dimensional
      structure.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, S2-3 is derived by calculating the mean position of all
      the amino acids in the raw data SO to create a second moving
      average by subtracting this mean from each value of a coordinate
      for an amino acid in the moving average S2. The resulting sequence
      S2-3 is essentially identical to the sequence S2 but is normalised
      about a central zero origin point. This sequence represents the
      larger scale curves of the 5 original three-dimensional protein
      structure, effectively acting as a low frequency filter.<br>
      <br>
      Weighting factors are then applied to each sequence and the
      weighted sequences summed to give a final sequence ST = a (SO-1) +
      b(S 1-2) + c (S2-3). The magnitude of the weighting factor a
      determines the proportion of the high frequency component of the
      protein in the final sequence ST whilst b and c determine the mid
      frequency and low frequency component.<br>
      <br>
      The sequence ST is than mapped onto musical parameters such as
      pitch via a threedimensional waveform generated by
      three-dimensional spectral synthesis, thus creating is sequences
      of notes which express visual features in musical form. The
      waveform maps a three-dimensional coordinate value onto a
      one-dimensional value, that is the value of that point in the
      waveform. The three dimensional input values are a sequence of
      coordinate values ftom ST and the output is a sequence of
      one-dimensional values which are interpreted as notes in musical
      scales or dynamic levels (volume). This mapping may be achieved as
      follows. First a random number (ranging from 5 to 20 or more) of
      vectors are provided which reside in a 2-dimensional
      frequency-space (the frequency-space is the spectral analog to the
      final 2 dimensional landscape). Each vector has a randomly
      determined position in this frequency-space and has a randomly
      determined phase and magnitude associated with it (represented by
      a complex number).<br>
      <br>
      11 For mathematical reasons, there must also exist for each vector
      a 'mirror' vector with the same vector location but having a
      complex number associated with it that is a complex conjugate of
      the original vector's complex number. Therefore there must always
      be an even number of these vectors.<br>
      <br>
      Once these vectors with their associated complex numbers have been
      generated it is a simple process of fourier synthesis so that
      given a 2-dimensional coordinate in cartesian space, one can sum
      the contributions of each vector (at the cartesian coordinate) to
      end up with a scalar (1 -dimensional) value which can be
      interpreted as a height value. Details are given by D. Saupe.
      Since the resulting "landscape" is constructed from a combination
      of waves, for a small list of vectors it has the property that two
      points close to each other in 2-dimensions have similar resulting
      height values (i.e. mathematically speaking, the landscape is
      continuously differentiable everywhere.<br>
      <br>
      is This process is extended to 3-dimensions by generating a list
      of 3dimensional vectors in frequency -space. When given a point in
      3-dimensional cartesian space, these vectors can be summed using
      complex arithmetic to provide a 1 - dimensional scalar value. This
      allows a 3-dimensional coordinate (i.e. 3-dimensional position of
      a CA atom after the moving average process) to be turned into a 1
      -dimensional scalar value.<br>
      <br>
      In an analogous way to the 2-dimensional synthesis, two points
      close to each other in 3-dimensional cartesian-space will have
      close 1 -dimensional results ftom the mapping.<br>
      <br>
      This means that close 3-dimensional positions will have close
      (audibly related) pitch, amplitude or other such musical value.<br>
      <br>
      12 Whilst this invention may make use of a fourier synthesis
      technique, fourier synthesis by such is not new, and this
      invention includes the use of any other method of mapping a
      3-dimensional point, for example derived from filters or moving
      averages of x-ray crystallography data to a 1dimensional point
      which can be interpreted in a musical fashion. A simple example
      might be simply to sum together the x, y, and z values of the
      3-dimensional coordinate to get a single 1 -dimensional value.
      Another alternative in the specific case of proteins may be to use
      the coordinates of the second moving average as an "axis" and to
      calculate "angular" offsets of the original data from that axis.
      As the alpha helix twists around a sequence of angles averaging
      around 360' may 10 then be derived.<br>
      <br>
      This output is then written to a NMI text file for conversion into
      music or a layer in a musical arrangement using known MIDI music
      software to produce complex multi timbral musical pieces
      containing melodies reflecting the large-scale tertiary structures
      15 or small repetitive arpeggios expressing the structural nature
      of the alpha helices.<br>
      <b><br>
        Example 2: </b>for the production of a musical representati-on
      of a protein. This follows the same basic method as described in
      relation to example I above, with the addition of tempo, rhythm
      and key changes derived from the x-ray crystallography coordinate
      20 data.<br>
      <br>
      In this example positions in the original data sequence are
      determined where the musical parameter changes are to take place
      corresponding to visual transmission points in the secondary
      structure of the protein, for example where an alpha helix, a 13
      beta sheet, a loop or a turn begins or ends.<br>
      <br>
      The secondary structure details are identified using a filter.
      This filter outputs secondary structure features from an input
      comprising the three-dimensional data.<br>
      <br>
      Two filter techniques may be used in the identification of the
      secondary structures, namely:<br>
      <b><br>
        Filter technique 1.</b> The three dimensional distance of each
      CA carbon atom is taken from the mean position of the CA carbon
      atoms of a particular section of the protein. The filter moves a
      vrindow containing data covering approximately 10 CA carbon atoms
      for different amino acids along a section of the crystallography
      data looking at the distance of each CA carbon atom from the mean
      value of all the carbon atoms in the current window. From these
      distances it is possible to determine the likelihood of the
      current window containing data from an alpha helix or a beta
      sheet. The termination points of these features may thus be
      identified.<br>
      <b><br>
        Filter technique 2.</b> In this technique matched filters are
      used with parameters tuned to those found in protein alpha helices
      and beta strands and the like. For example, alpha helices will
      have an approximate pitch of 4.6 angstrom units, beta sheets will
      have an approximate pitch of 13.5 angstrom units.<br>
      <b><br>
        Example 3.</b> This example may be embodied in a model giving
      participants the opportunity to create their own pieces of music
      from a range of onscreen three dimensional proteins. The three
      dimensional x-ray crystallography x, y, z coordinate data is used
      as the basis for an animated display of the progress of the
      generated music 14 along the physical structure of the proteins as
      displayed graphically on a computer screen. By choosing from a
      selection of moving average operations the user can see how the
      chosen proteins are converted into musical sounds. The weightings
      a, b, c of example 1 may be made available to the user for
      selection, and their combination by 5 the computer then results in
      a sequence of notes.<br>
      <br>
      Each note, corresponding to a specific arnino acid in the display,
      is then sounded with the an-dno acid on the display, with the
      visual representation of the protein being highlighted
      simultaneously whereby to demonstrate and emphasise the
      correspondence 10 between the musical notes and the protein
      sequences.<br>
      <b><br>
        Example 4: </b>a display booth or exhibition kiosk may be
      equipped with an interactive touch screen compute. system
      containing both the audio and visual components described in
      relation to examples 1 and 3. The screen may display graphics
      generated is using a graphics processor depicting a traverse
      through the biological material of a plant, animal, insect,
      fungal, bacteria, yeast or human Iandscape". The protein molecules
      are used to derive musical sounds identifying the proteins. This
      may also have an educational value in, enabling aural recognition
      of proteins.<br>
      <b><br>
        Example 5. </b>Another educational application may be developed
      as a three dimensional tactile model of a protein containing a
      plurality of switches connected to a computer system whereby the
      display of an audio visual information device may be influenced.
      On touching a particular amino acid (that is operating the
      associated switch) the an-dno acid on the display screen would be
      highlighted and the corresponding note, chord or is other musical
      sound representing this amino acid generated for the user to hear.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b>The present invention thus expands and crosses the boundaries
      between science and art, enabling new approaches to understanding
      biological structure to be achieved as S well as the generation of
      music for educational or purely entertainment purposes. Use of
      this invention in protein homology modelling, where fast and
      easily recognisable differences in proteins of similar structure
      are required, may be developed as there is a currently unfulfilled
      demand for such a tool in this widely used research technique.<br>
      <br>
      Protein-derived music may be of therapeutic interest in the
      treatment of conditions currently treated using music therapy. It
      is believed that such specialised music may offer a focused and
      precise application which optimises and hence is more cost
      efFective than, known music therapies utilising music derived from
      other sources.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b>Protein-derived music may be used to strengthen mind-body
      connections. Likewise, protein-derived music may be used for
      studying and modelling protein sequence data, complementing
      existing techniques which have wide application in drug design.
      Since alpha helices, beta strands and turns each have
      characteristic combinations of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino
      acids, different structural categories of proteins, which combine
      these secondary elements in different ways, also have different
      musical characteristics. The sounds generated therefrorn may
      therefore be used effectively in the discrimination and
      demonstration of different protein types.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b>Protein music may also be used in sequence alignment and
      structural homology determination as structural homology may be
      heard when it might not easily be 16 perceived visually.<br>

      </b>A plasmatron-catalyst system. The system generates
      hydrogen-rich gas and comprises a plasmatron and at least one
      catalyst for receiving an output from the plasmatron to produce
      hydrogen-rich gas. In a preferred embodiment, the plasmatron
      receives as an input air, fuel and water/steam for use in the
      reforming process. The system increases the hydrogen yield and
      decreases the amount of carbon monoxide.<b><br>

      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Plasmatron reformers are being developed at MIT and
      ArvinMeritor [1]. In these reformers a special low power
      electrical discharge is used to promote partial oxidation
      conversion of hydrocarbon fuels into hydrogen and CO. The partial
      oxidation reaction of this very fuel rich mixture is difficult to
      initiate. The plasmatron provides continuous enhanced volume
      initiation. To minimize electrode erosion and electrical power
      requirements, a low current, high voltage discharge with wide area
      electrodes is used. The reformers operate at or slightly above
      atmospheric pressure. Plasmatron reformers provide the advantages
      of rapid startup and transient response; efficient conversion of
      the fuel to hydrogen rich gas; compact size; relaxation or
      elimination of reformer catalyst requirements; and capability to
      process difficult to reform fuels, such as diesel and bio-oils.
      These advantages facilitate use of onboard hydrogen-generation
      technology for diesel exhaust after-treatment. Plasma-enhanced
      reformer technology can provide substantial conversion even
      without the use of a catalyst. Recent progress includes a
      substantial decrease in electrical power consumption (to about 200
      W), increased flow rate (above 1 g/s of diesel fuel corresponding
      to approximately 40 kW of chemical energy), soot suppression and
      improvements in other operational features.. Plasmatron reformer
      technology has been evaluated for regeneration of NOx adsorber
      after-treatment systems. At ArvinMeritor tests were performed on a
      dual-leg NOx adsorber system using a Cummins 8.3L diesel engine
      both in a test cell and on a vehicle. A NOx adsorber system was
      tested using the plasmatron reformer as a regenerator and without
      the reformer i.e., with straight diesel fuel based regeneration as
      the baseline case. The plasmatron reformer was shown to improve
      NOx regeneration significantly compared to the baseline diesel
      case. The net result of these initial tests was a significant
      decrease in fuel penalty, roughly 50% at moderate adsorber
      temperatures. This fuel penalty improvement is accompanied by a
      dramatic drop in slipped hydrocarbon emissions, which decreased by
      90% or more. Significant advantages are demonstrated across a wide
      range of engine conditions and temperatures. The study also
      indicated the potential to regenerate NOx adsorbers at low
      temperatures where diesel fuel based regeneration is not
      effective, such as those typical of idle conditions. Two vehicles,
      a bus and a light duty truck, have been equipped for plasmatron
      reformer NOx adsorber regeneration tests.<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>A novel apparatus and method is disclosed for a plasmatron
      fuel converter ("plasmatron") that efficiently uses electrical
      energy to produce hydrogen rich gas. The volume and shape of the
      plasma discharge is controlled by a fluid flow established in a
      plasma discharge volume. A plasmatron according to this invention
      produces a substantially large effective plasma discharge volume
      allowing for substantially greater volumetric efficiency in the
      initiation of chemical reactions within a volume of bulk fluid
      reactant flowing through the plasmatron.<b><br>

      <b><br>
      </b>A plasmatron fuel reformer has been developed for onboard
      hydrogen generation for vehicular applications. These applications
      include hydrogen addition to spark-ignition internal combustion
      engines, NOx trap and diesel particulate filter (DPF)
      regeneration, and emissions reduction from spark ignition internal
      combustion engines First, a thermal plasmatron fuel reformer was
      developed. This plasmatron used an electric arc with relatively
      high power to reform fuels such as gasoline, diesel and biofuels
      at an oxygen to carbon ratio close to 1. The draw back of this
      device was that it has a high electric consumption and limited
      electrode lifetime due to the high temperature electric arc. A
      second generation plasmatron fuel reformer was developed. It used
      a low-current high-voltage electric discharge with a completely
      new electrode continuation. This design uses two cylindrical
      electrodes with a rotating discharge that produced low temperature
      volumetric cold plasma., The lifetime of the electrodes was no
      longer an issue and the device was tested on several fuels such as
      gasoline, diesel, and biofuels at different flow rates and
      different oxygen to carbon ratios. Hydrogen concentration and
      yields were measured for both the thermal and non-thermal
      plasmatron reformers for homogeneous (non-catalytic) and catalytic
      reforming of several fuels. The technology was licensed to an
      industrial auto part supplier (ArvinMeritor) and is being
      implemented for some of the applications listed above. The
      Plasmatron reformer has been successfully tested on a bus for NOx
      trap regeneration. The successful development of the plasmatron
      reformer and its implementation in commercial applications
      including transportation will bring several benefits to the
      nation. These benefits include the reduction of NOx emissions,
      improving engine efficiency and reducing the nation's oil
      consumption. The objective of this program has been to develop
      attractive applications of plasmatron fuel reformer technology for
      onboard applications in internal combustion engine vehicles using
      diesel, gasoline and biofuels. This included the reduction of NOx
      and particulate matter emissions from diesel engines using
      plasmatron reformer generated hydrogen-rich gas, conversion of
      ethanol and bio-oils into hydrogen rich gas, and the development
      of new concepts for the use of plasmatron fuel reformers for
      enablement of HCCI engines.<b><br>

      <b><br>
      </b>Researchers have unveiled plans for a smart contact lens that
      could give its wearer infrared 'night vision'.<br>
      <br>
      The team say that by sandwiching graphene inside the lens they can
      build a sensor capable of capturing every from visible light to
      infrared.<br>
      <br>
      They have already built a prototype smaller than a fingernail, and
      experts say it could one day be built into lenses for soldiers and
      others who need to see in the dark.<br>
      <br>
      <b>WHAT IS GRAPHENE?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Graphene is made of a single layer of carbon atoms that are bonded
      together in a repeating pattern of hexagons.<br>
      <br>
      It is one million times thinner than paper, and Graphene’s flat
      honeycomb pattern grants it many unusual characteristics,
      including the status of strongest material in the world.<br>
      <br>
      Zhaohui Zhong at the University of Michigan say their layered
      approach can lead to ultrathin sensors.<br>
      <br>
      'We can make the entire design super-thin,' said Zhong, assistant
      professor of electrical and computer engineering.<br>
      <br>
      'It can be stacked on a contact lens or integrated with a cell
      phone.'<br>
      <br>
      The prototype device created by Zhong is already 'smaller than a
      pinky nail' and can be easily scaled down.<br>
      <br>
      'If we integrate it with a contact lens or other wearable
      electronics, it expands your vision,' Zhong said.<br>
      <br>
      'It provides you another way of interacting with your
      environment.'<br>
      <br>
      It takes advantage of graphene's 'supersensor' properties.<br>
      <br>
      The material shows a very strong effect when it’s struck by
      photons (light energy). <br>
      <br>
      It turns into what is known as a 'hot carrier' - an effect that
      can be measured, processed, and turned into an image.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The team developed a way to sandwich the graphene to make it as
      sensitive as CMOS silicon imaging sensors in commercial digital
      cameras.<br>
      <br>
      'Graphene is a promising candidate material for ultra-broadband
      photodetectors, as its absorption spectrum covers the entire
      ultraviolet to far-infrared range,' the team wrote in Nature.<br>
      The team are investigating using graphene to sandwich between two
      layers of a lens, rather like this Google prototype for a glucose
      monitoring lens for diabetics<br>
      <br>
      'Here, we report an ultra-broadband photodetector design based on
      a graphene double-layer heterostructure.<br>
      <br>
      'The detector is a phototransistor consisting of a pair of stacked
      graphene monolayers (top layer, gate; bottom layer, channel)
      separated by a thin tunnel barrier.<br>
      <br>
      'Under optical illumination, photoexcited hot carriers generated
      in the top layer tunnel into the bottom layer, leading to a charge
      build-up on the gate and a strong photogating effect on the
      channel conductance.<br>
      <br>

      visible to the mid-infrared range, with mid-infrared responsivity

      is flowed in the chamber at a relatively low pressure compared to
      conventional processes and the temperature in the reaction chamber
      is thereafter decreased relatively slowly compared to conventional
      processes. One application for uniform multilayer graphene is
      transparent conductors. In processes that require multiple
      transfers of single layer graphene to achieve multilayer graphene
      structures, the disclosed method can reduce the number of process
      steps by at least half.<b><br>
        <br>
        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
        <br>
      </b>[0003] Single and few-layer graphene has emerged as a
      promising material for novel applications in electronics due to
      certain advantageous optical and electrical properties and due to
      its potential for integrating bottom-up nanomaterial synthesis
      with top-down lithographic fabrication at a wafer size or macro
      scale. Its semi-metallic nature with high carrier mobility and low
      opacity also makes it a good candidate for use as transparent
      conductors for photovoltaic devices, touch panels, and displays,
      for example. Graphene structures also have high chemical
      resistance, low manufacturing costs, and, being atomically thin,
      are relatively flexible when compared to some other transparent
      conductor materials such as indium tin oxide (ITO). Bilayer
      graphene (BLG) in particular holds further promise for use in
      post-silicon electronics applications because a bandgap up to 250
      meV can be induced in the material using an electric field, which
      is not possible with single or monolayer graphene (SLG), and
      because exciton binding energies in BLG are tunable by electric
      field- induced bandgap.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] A monolayer or single layer graphene is a plane of carbon
      atoms bonded in a hexagonal array. Several methods have been used
      to synthesize graphene films including the reduction of graphene
      oxide, liquid exfoliation using organic solvents, and chemical
      vapor deposition (CVD). The CVD method has drawn much attention,
      as this method can yield high quality graphene films. Homogeneous
      single layer graphene has been synthesized on transition metal
      substrates, such as copper, that have low carbon solubility using
      low pressure CVD (LPCVD). But the sheet resistance of pristine or
      undoped SLG is on the order of 2000-6000[Omega]-too large to for
      use as a transparent conductor, for example. Stacking multiple
      individually produced layers of SLG and individually doping each
      layer is one method that has been used to achieve lower film
      resistance for graphene structures. But fabrication of a
      multi-sheet SLG stack can require a multitude of transfer
      processes, depending on the number of SLG sheets desired in the
      stack. This can lead to high processing time and cost, and a
      higher likelihood of defects in the films.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Bilayer graphene has been fabricated by initially producing
      two separate monolayers of graphene and subsequently using a
      sacrificial carrier to physically stack one of the separate
      monolayers on the other. BLG has also been fabricated via
      mechanical exfoliation of graphite to produce SLG that is
      subsequently stacked with another SLG, but the sheet size is
      limited to the square-micron range and such processes are not
      scalable to sizes large enough to be practical for use in many
      electronics applications. The synthesis of wafer scale uniform
      bilayer graphene product presents a tremendous challenge.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Graphene sheets having multiple layers of graphene with
      lower sheet resistance than SLG have been directly synthesized
      using an LPCVD method on other transition metals, such as nickel,
      that have relatively high carbon solubility and on copper using
      atmospheric pressure CVD (APCVD). Multiple layer graphene (MLG)
      structures produced by these methods typically have non-uniform
      thickness, with different numbers of graphene layers throughout
      the structure, and rough surfaces compared to LPCVD-grown SLG.
      Graphene sheet thickness variation can be problematic for use in
      electronics applications because it causes the sheet resistance
      and optical transmittance to vary among different areas of the
      sheet. Additionally, APCVD processes that are used to produce MLG
      can lead to higher numbers of defects compared to LPCVD SLG due to
      particulate deposition resulting from APCVD conditions.<br>

      graphene film is provided. The film has interlayer uniformity and
      also has the same number of graphene layers throughout a major
      portion of the sheet...<br>
      <b><br>
        Experimental Sample Preparation<br>
        <br>
      </b>[0093] A 25 [mu]m thick copper foil (99.8%, Alfa Aesar) was
      placed into an inner quartz tube reaction chamber inside a
      three-inch horizontal tube furnace of a commercial CVD system
      (First Nano EasyTube 3000). The system was purged with argon gas
      and evacuated to a pressure of about 0.1 Torr. The chamber was
      then heated to 1000[deg.] C. in an H2 (100 sccm) environment at a
      pressure of about 0.35 Torr. When a chamber temperature of
      1000[deg.] C. was reached, 70 sccm of CH4 was flowed through the
      chamber for 15 minutes at a pressure of 0.45 Torr. The sample was
      then cooled slowly to room temperature with a feedback loop to
      control the cooling rate. The pressure was maintained at 0.5 Torr
      with 100 sccm of argon flowing. A time vs. temperature plot from
      the CVD growth process is shown in FIG. 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] Two different methods were used to transfer the produced
      uniform multilayer graphene from copper foil substrate to SiO2
      substrates. The first method utilized thermal release tape (Nitto
      Denko) to transfer the graphene from the copper foil. The tape was
      applied to the copper surface and a force of 6.25 N/cm&lt;2
      &gt;was applied to the copper/graphene/tape stack for 10 minutes
      using a EVG EV520IS wafer bonder. The opposite side of the
      substrate was exposed to O2 plasma for30 seconds to remove the
      graphene on that side. The substrate was etched away using an iron
      (III) nitrate (Sigma Aldrich) solution (0.05 g/ml) for 12 hours. A
      4-inch silicon wafer with thermally grown SiO2 was precleaned with
      nP12 nanoPREP using plasma power of 500W for 40 seconds to modify
      the surface energy and produce a hydrophilic surface. The tape and
      graphene stack was transferred to the pre-cleaned SiO2 wafer and a
      force of 12.5N/cm&lt;2 &gt;was applied for 10 minutes. The
      substrate was then heated to 120[deg.] C. to overcome the adhesion
      of the thermal release tape. The tape was then peeled off and the
      adhesive residue was removed with warm acetone.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) film may be used in another
      method to transfer graphene. This method does not require a
      bonding tool but the edge portion of the graphene film may be
      rough due to uneven thickness of spin-coated PMMA at the edge. In
      this method, the growth side of the CVD graphene sample was coated
      with 950PMMA A6 (Microchem) resist and cured at 180[deg.] C. for 5
      minutes. The other side of the substrate was exposed to O2 plasma
      for 30 seconds to remove the graphene on that side. The sample was
      then left in iron (III) nitrate (Sigma Aldrich) solution (0.05
      g/ml) for at least 12 hours to completely dissolve away the copper
      layer. The sample was transferred onto a silicon substrate with a
      thermal oxide layer. The PMMA coating was removed with acetone and
      the substrate was rinsed several times. Raman spectroscopy as well
      as optical microscope were used to characterize the graphene films
      from all transfers, and electrical transport measurement was done
      with samples transferred by the PMMA method.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] For the above-described electrical testing, graphene
      devices were fabricated according to the following process. After
      the multilayer graphene was transferred onto SiO2/Si substrate,
      Ti/Au (5 nm/100 nm) was deposited to form the source/drain
      electrodes. Bilayer graphene films were then patterned into 1
      [mu]m*1 [mu]m, 1 [mu]m*2 [mu]m, and 2 [mu]m*2 [mu]m pieces using
      conventional lithography and oxygen plasma etching. After 40 nm of
      Al2O3 was deposited as the top gate dielectric by atomic layer
      deposition (ALD), top gates were patterned and the metals were
      evaporated (Ti/Au: 5 nm/100 nm). It is noted that the adhesion
      between metal electrodes and graphene was not perfect, as some
      metal peeled off. Gate leakage/breakdown at high field was also
      observed for some devices. These devices are regarded as
      fabrication defects, as described in conjunction with FIG. 4(a).<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>A new app that claims to be able to improve people's eyesight
      by 'training' them with a series of exercises has become a hit.<br>
      <br>
      Called GlassesOff, it uses a series of patterns to create 15
      minutes exercises for users.<br>
      <br>
      If done three times a week, its makers say it could mean they no
      longer need reading glasses after three months.<br>
      <br>
      The app uses a series of games, puzzles and tests to improve a
      user's eyesight - if they can play for 15 minutes three times a
      week for three months.<br>
      <b><br>
        HOW IT WORKS<br>
        <br>
      </b>GlassesOff uses a completely different approach that is
      exclusively aimed at teaching the visual system of the brain to
      better use its potential.<br>
      <br>
      This allows the brain to compensate for blurred information
      captured by the eyes as we age.<br>
      <br>
      The foundation for this technology is provided by the brain's
      ability to adapt, the app makers say.<br>
      <br>
      The app uses patterns designed to strengthen&nbsp; connections
      within circuits relevant to a task, such as recognizing letters
      when reading.<br>
      <br>
      'Traditionally, near distance reading improvement solutions were
      limited to optical corrections such as glasses, contact lenses and
      refractive surgery,' said said Nimrod Madar, CEO of GlassesOff.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      'However, human vision performance is in fact limited by two
      factors: the quality of an image captured by the eye and the image
      processing capability of the brain as it interprets such images.<br>
      <br>
      'Our solution is designed to improve reading by enhancing the
      image processing function of the visual cortex, demonstrating the
      amazing potential of the human brain.<br>
      <br>
      'We created this app because we wanted to empower people who
      experienced natural age-related changes in reading ability to take
      control of their vision and improve their quality of life.<br>
      <br>
      'Our personalized app constantly adapts according to users’
      progress, with the ultimate goal of freeing them from dependency
      on magnifying devices such as reading glasses.”<br>
      <br>
      The GlassesOff app is free to download from the App Store and
      offer users access to a vision evaluation and the first segment of
      the GlassesOff program.<br>
      <br>
      After Using the GlassesOff app for approximately two weeks, users
      will be given the option to subscribe to the full version, which
      includes additional advanced segments, for $59.99.<br>
      <br>
      However, during the launch, subscriptions will be offered at a
      special price of just $9.99.<br>
      <br>
      <b>App claims exercise will improve eyesight<br>
        <br>
      </b>The app gives users regular tests to check their progress,
      giving them a 'brain speed' ranking as they improve<br>
      <br>
      The researchers have also published several studies backing up the
      app's effectiveness.<br>
      <br>
      In a study carried out at the University of California at Berkeley
      and published in Nature Scientific Reports, all subjects who
      completed the GlassesOff program were able to read standard
      newspaper font size without the use of reading glasses, while
      improving their 'Eye Age' by an average of 8.6 years.<br>
      <br>
      A second study looks at the correlation between the fovea, which
      is part of the retina, and crowding, processing speed and vision
      sharpness.<br>
      <br>
      The findings demonstrate that the GlassesOff technology may be
      applicable to improved performance of daily tasks, such as sports,
      reading, driving, and more.<br>
      <br>
      'This study results reaffirm our product’s ability to help reading
      by improving visual processing speed.<br>
      <br>
      'The results are encouraging and relevant for our planned launch
      of a series of pipeline products for mass market segments,
      including those designed to improve visual functions in sports and
      reading speed,' said Madar.<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>Human vision is limited by two main factors:<br>
      <br>
      The quality of an image captured by the eyes.<br>
      <br>
      The image processing capabilities of the brain as it interprets an
      image captured by the eyes.<br>
      <br>
      GlassesOff scientists have developed a proprietary method for
      improving near vision sharpness, by improving the image processing
      function in the visual cortex of the brain.<br>
      <br>
      eople can impact their vision by increasing the quality of images
      captured by their eye (e.g., wearing glasses, going through
      corrective eye surgery), or by enhancing their brain’s image
      processing abilities.<br>
      <br>
      At some point, every person will suffer from the inevitable
      natural deterioration in near distance reading capabilities. This
      deficiency has typically been addressed by traditional products
      for improvement of reading capabilities, mainly magnification
      devices such as reading glasses or contact lenses that support
      reading.<br>
      <br>
      GlassesOff scientists have developed a patented method for
      boosting the image processing function in the visual cortex of the
      brain, thereby improving a person’s near vision sharpness and
      reading capabilities.<br>
      <b><br>
        Scientifically Proven Solution<br>
        <br>
      </b>Our technology is based on extensive scientific research and
      achievements that have been published in the leading scientific
      publications, such as Nature, Science, PNAS, Vision Research,
      Scientific Reports and others.<br>
      <br>
      During the last two decades, scientists have demonstrated that
      contrast-driven neural responses are robustly affected by lateral
      propagations between neurons in the visual cortex. A positive
      effect of this interaction is called “collinear facilitation”,
      which amplifies weak and slow responses and their underlying
      mechanism of neuronal excitations. This function strengthens
      selective synapses to elevate weak stimuli above the noise, and is
      the foundation of GlassesOff technology.<br>
      <br>
      Weaker and slower neuronal responses in the visual cortex, either
      as a consequence of blurred input from the eyes or abnormal
      development, result in degraded basic visual functions both in the
      spatial domain, e.g. contrast sensitivity, and the temporal
      domain, e.g. processing speed. These changes eventually affect
      high-level visual tasks, such as letter identification. GlassesOff
      scientists have shown that using neuronal plasticity retained in
      the adult brain, it is possible to increase collinear facilitation
      to compensate for spatial and temporal deficiencies.<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>Perceptual training was applied to an adult visual system with
      abnormal development of the primary visual cortex of the brain
      leading to amblyopia (“lazy eye”). Training yielded significant
      benefits that transfer to higher visual tasks, resulting in a
      two-fold improvement in contrast sensitivity and in
      letter-recognition tasks in patients between 9 and 55 years old.
      This is the first evidence for a remarkable vision improvement
      following perceptual learning in a condition previously
      acknowledged as untreatable in adults.<br>

      </b>Generalization, or transfer, of gains acquired on a trained
      task to other functions is crucial for both understanding the
      neural mechanisms and the practical values of the training. This
      study describes a perceptual learning method applied to amblyopia
      (“lazy eye”), myopia (near-sightedness) and presbyopia
      (age-related near vision decline). The gains were transferred to
      visual acuity, processing speed and reaction time. Thus,
      perceptual learning can become a practical method for improving
      visual functions in people with impaired or blurred vision.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      On October 24-27, the Turkish government will be holding a
      four-day Turkish Innovation Fair in Istanbul featuring the best
      Turkish technologies of the year, and that two of the Alperen
      Group technologies will be among the three on display.<br>
      <br>
      On September 7, Attila Alperen told me that his Alperen™ Group's
      TurXotor® motor is poised to be among the top three featured at
      the event. He said that the Turkish government wants to create a
      large electric car industry in Turkey around this invention that
      will enable electric vehicles to never have to be plugged in, and
      to be able to operate with only a few batteries on board, because
      the power source is onboard, pulling energy from the environment
      somehow -- harnessing the wheelwork of nature, as Tesla coined it.<br>
      <br>
      TurXotor® is a motor that works as a generator at the same time --
      the only system like this in the world, as far as Mr. Alperen is
      aware. So the TurXotor® motor powers the wheels of the electric
      vehicle -- and produces electricity at the same time, both to
      replenish the source battery and provide extra for the other
      electrical needs of the vehicle such as lights, radio, heat,
      windows, etc.<br>
      <br>
      The Alperen™ Group doesn't describe their technology as a "free
      energy" technology. They shy away from words like "overunity" as
      well. They depict it as merely an efficient regeneration of the
      used technology. But obviously, if they are propelling a vehicle
      down the road, they have to be harvesting energy from somewhere
      beside the battery, if they don't have to ever recharge the
      battery from an external source.<br>
      <br>
      Attila said this will solve two problems presently associated with
      electric cars: range, and battery costs. The range will become
      unlimited, and the battery costs will be significantly reduced,
      because the vehicle will only need enough to serve as a buffer for
      acceleration input and deceleration harvesting of regenerative
      braking. They won't be needed for storage for duration travel.
      You'll be able to travel as far as you want without ever stopping
      for fuel or to recharge your batteries.<br>
      <br>
      This will be the first time the TurXotor® will be publicly
      demonstrated. The event will enable interested parties worldwide
      to see the technology demonstrated as well as discuss licensing
      manufacturing of the technology. Normally, Attila is not very
      accommodating for people to come and see the technology
      demonstrated, so this will be a rare opportunity.<br>
      <br>
      Attila said that at the event, the TurXotor® motor-generator will
      be demonstrated in isolation, showing its attributes of torque,
      electricity generation, and efficiency. It will also be open to
      inspection, not concealed in a "black box" of any kind.<br>
      <br>
      Though such a technology has a myriad of applications, at present,
      the only application that is being licensed is for manufacturing
      the motor to fit electric vehicles, or trains, or ships. <br>

        <b>METHOD OF POWER EXTRACTION FROM PRESSURE</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The method of invention consists of the extraction and utilization
      of potential energy as usable energy contained in pressurized
      liquid, air, and gas which is transferred via transfer lines such
      as pipes without losing the pressure values of inlet and outlet of
      the system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The method of invention consists of the extraction and utilization
      of potential energy as usable energy contained in pressurized
      liquid, air, and gas which is transferred via transfer lines such
      as pipes without losing the pressure values of inlet and outlet of
      the system.<br>
      <br>
      Every pressurized liquid, air, and gas has a usable potential
      energy. In the current systems, the need for additional inlet
      pressure power increases at Inlet(3) in proportion to the amount
      of usable energy in the Turbine Shaft(5). Thanks to this invention
      this potential energy is converted into usable energy in the
      Turbine Shaft(5). Contrary to the current systems, during the
      utilization of this energy in the Turbine Shaft(5), the equality
      of Outlet(4) pressure power and Inlet(3) pressure power is
      preserved.<br>
      <br>
      The sample system showing the operating principle of the invention
      consists of eight parts. These are; Turbine(l), Pressure
      Preservation Chamber(2), Inlet(3), Outlet(4), Turbine Shaft(5),
      alternators, generators, and loads (6) Pressure Preservation
      Chamber Spaces(7), and Pressure Direction Nozzle(8).<br>
      <br>
      The operating principle of the invention is as follows: In order
      to generate mechanical energy, any or some of the pressurized
      liquid, air, and gas applied from Inlet(3) are directed to the
      Turbine(l) blades positioned in the Pressure Preservation
      Chamber(2) via Pressure Direction Nozzle(8). This mechanical
      energy generated in the Turbine(l) is transferred to the outside
      the system via the Turbine Shaft(5) and thus the generating of
      mechanical power necessary for any alternators, generators, and
      loads (6) is provided. The pressure power from Inlet(3), after
      applied to the Turbine(l) inside the Pressure Preservation
      Chamber(2) whose internal pressure is preserved and which is kept
      closed, is transferred to the outside of the system from the
      Outlet(4) without losing its (inlet's) own pressure power.<br>
      <br>
      Since the turbine is positioned in the Pressure Preservation
      Chamber(2), the counter power applied to the Turbine(l) via the
      Turbine Shaft(5) by the alternators, generators, and loads (6) is
      not reflected back to the Inlet(3).<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, while the pressure from Inlet(3) is transferred to the
      outside of the system without losing its pressure value at
      Outlet(4), the potential energy contained in this pressure power
      is extracted via the Turbine Shaft(5) as usable energy.<br>
      <br>
      There are no Pressure Preservation Chamber(2) and spaces in the
      current available systems. As a result, the counter power of the
      alternators, generators, and loads (6) is reflected back to the
      Inlet(3) via the Turbine Shaft(5) and the Turbine(l). However,
      thanks to this invention, the counter power is not reflected back
      to the Inlet(3) since the Turbine(l,) is positioned in the
      Pressure Preservation Chamber Spaces(7).<br>

        Venom used to paralyse their prey: The carnivorous tropical
        marine cone snail. <br>
        <br>
        A new drug extracted from snail venom could provide a
        breakthrough in treating severe chronic pain without the risk of
        addiction and dangerous side effects, researchers have found.<br>
        <br>
        The venom - considered 100 times stronger than morphine - could
        lead to the development of a new class of oral drugs used to
        relieve nerve pain associated with injury, cancer, AIDS and
        other diseases.<br>
        <br>
        ''It's a very exciting discovery which has the potential to be a
        blueprint for other protein-based medication,'' David Craik,
        lead researcher and professor of biomolecular structure at the
        University of Queensland, said.<br>
        <br>
        The prototype drug, which has been tested on rats, is taken from
        carnivorous tropical marine cone snails, which use their venom
        to paralyse their prey. The venom contains hundreds of peptides,
        or ''mini proteins'', known as conotoxins, which have a
        pain-killing effect.<br>
        <br>
        ''Snails have had 60 million years of evolution to fine-tune
        their venom, which contains some very powerful molecules,'' said
        Professor Craik, who will present his findings at an American
        Chemical Society meeting this week.<br>
        <br>
        ''If we can tap into that then it saves us having to do the hard
        work that evolution has already done for us,'' he said.<br>
        <br>
        A preliminary study using tiny proteins from the venom ''appears
        to significantly reduce pain'' in lab rats, he said. ''Our
        digestive system is designed to break down proteins. What we've
        done is taken a protein and re-enginered it to make it stable
        enough to work orally.''<br>
        <br>
        Only one conotoxin-derived drug, ziconotide, has been approved
        for human use but it must be injected into the spine.<br>

      Plastic shopping bags, an abundant source of litter on land and at
      sea, can be converted into diesel, natural gas and other useful
      petroleum products, researchers report. The conversion produces
      significantly more energy than it requires and results in
      transportation fuels -- diesel, for example -- that can be blended
      with existing ultra-low-sulfur diesels and biodiesels.<br>

      Used plastic shopping bags can be converted into petroleum
      products that serve a multitude of purposes. Plastic shopping
      bags, an abundant source of litter on land and at sea, can be
      converted into diesel, natural gas and other useful petroleum
      products, researchers report.<br>
      <br>
      The conversion produces significantly more energy than it requires
      and results in transportation fuels -- diesel, for example -- that
      can be blended with existing ultra-low-sulfur diesels and
      biodiesels. Other products, such as natural gas, naphtha (a
      solvent), gasoline, waxes and lubricating oils such as engine oil
      and hydraulic oil also can be obtained from shopping bags.<br>
      <br>
      A report of the new study appears in the journal Fuel Processing
      Technology.<br>
      <br>
      There are other advantages to the approach, which involves heating
      the bags in an oxygen-free chamber, a process called pyrolysis,
      said Brajendra Kumar Sharma, a senior research scientist at the
      Illinois Sustainable Technology Center who led the research. The
      ISTC is a division of the Prairie Research Institute at the
      University of Illinois.<br>
      <br>
      "You can get only 50 to 55 percent fuel from the distillation of
      petroleum crude oil," Sharma said. "But since this plastic is made
      from petroleum in the first place, we can recover almost 80
      percent fuel from it through distillation."<br>
      <br>
      Americans throw away about 100 billion plastic shopping bags each
      year, according to the Worldwatch Institute. The U.S.
      Environmental Protection Agency reports that only about 13 percent
      are recycled. The rest of the bags end up in landfills or escape
      to the wild, blowing across the landscape and entering waterways.<br>
      <br>
      Plastic bags make up a sizeable portion of the plastic debris in
      giant ocean garbage patches that are killing wildlife and
      littering beaches. Plastic bags "have been detected as far north
      and south as the poles," the researchers wrote.<br>
      <br>
      "Over a period of time, this material starts breaking into tiny
      pieces, and is ingested along with plankton by aquatic animals,"
      Sharma said. Fish, birds, ocean mammals and other creatures have
      been found with a lot of plastic particles in their guts.<br>
      <br>
      Whole shopping bags also threaten wildlife, Sharma said.<br>
      <br>
      "Turtles, for example, think that the plastic grocery bags are
      jellyfish and they try to eat them," he said. Other creatures
      become entangled in the bags.<br>
      <br>
      Previous studies have used pyrolysis to convert plastic bags into
      crude oil. Sharma's team took the research further, however, by
      fractionating the crude oil into different petroleum products and
      testing the diesel fractions to see if they complied with national
      standards for ultra-low-sulfur diesel and biodiesel fuels.<br>
      <br>
      "A mixture of two distillate fractions, providing an equivalent of
      U.S. diesel #2, met all of the specifications" required of other
      diesel fuels in use today -- after addition of an antioxidant,
      Sharma said.<br>
      <br>
      "This diesel mixture had an equivalent energy content, a higher
      cetane number (a measure of the combustion quality of diesel
      requiring compression ignition) and better lubricity than
      ultra-low-sulfur diesel," he said.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers were able to blend up to 30 percent of their
      plastic-derived diesel into regular diesel, "and found no
      compatibility problems with biodiesel," Sharma said.<br>
      <br>
      "It's perfect," he said. "We can just use it as a drop-in fuel in
      the ultra-low-sulfur diesel without the need for any changes."<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Pyrolysis of HDPE waste grocery bags followed by distillation
      resulted in a liquid hydrocarbon mixture with average structure
      consisting of saturated aliphatic paraffinic hydrogens (96.8%),
      aliphatic olefinic hydrogens (2.6%) and aromatic hydrogens (0.6%)
      that corresponded to the boiling range of conventional petroleum
      diesel fuel (#1 diesel 190–290 °C and #2 diesel 290–340 °C).
      Characterization of the liquid hydrocarbon mixture was
      accomplished with gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy, infrared
      and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies, size exclusion
      chromatography, and simulated distillation. No oxygenated species
      such as carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ethers, ketones, or alcohols
      were detected. Comparison of the fuel properties to the
      petrodiesel fuel standards ASTM D975 and EN 590 revealed that the
      synthetic product was within all specifications after addition of
      antioxidants with the exception of density (802 kg/m3). Notably,
      the derived cetane number (73.4) and lubricity (198 µm, 60 °C,
      ASTM D6890) represented significant enhancements over those of
      conventional petroleum diesel fuel. Other fuel properties included
      a kinematic viscosity (40 °C) of 2.96 mm2/s, cloud point of 4.7
      °C, flash point of 81.5 °C, and energy content of 46.16 MJ/kg. In
      summary, liquid hydrocarbons with appropriate boiling range
      produced from pyrolysis of waste plastic appear suitable as blend
      components for conventional petroleum diesel fuel.<br>

      <b>1. Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Plastic retail bags are ubiquitous in modern society because they
      represent a convenient means to transport purchased goods from the
      supermarket to the home. Plastic bags are plentiful, inexpensive
      to produce, sturdy yet low weight, and easy to store and
      transport. However, the same properties that make them
      commercially successful also contribute to their proliferation in
      the environment. Although they are recyclable, the U.S. EPA noted
      that only 13% of the approximately one trillion produced in 2009
      were recycled in the U.S. [1]. The remainder were disposed of in
      landfills, released into the environment as litter, or used in
      secondary applications by end-users eventually ending in
      landfills. Plastic bags may take centuries to naturally decompose
      due to their stable chemical composition [2]. In addition to being
      a source of litter in urbanized areas, plastic bags exacerbate
      localized flooding by clogging municipal drainage systems and
      constitute a significant portion of floating anthropogenic marine
      debris [3], [4] and [5]. In fact, plastic bags contribute to the
      so-called Great Pacific Garbage Patch of floating refuse in the
      Pacific Ocean and have been detected as far north and south as the
      poles [3], [4] and [5]. Once in the environment, plastic bags are
      lethal to animals that ingest or become entangled in them [6], [7]
      and [8]. Because of these and other factors, various regional and
      national governments have banned or are contemplating bans or fees
      on plastic bags [9].<br>
      <br>
      Standard plastic bags consist of thin polyethylene (PE) sheets
      produced commercially from polymerization of ethylene. PE is
      divided into categories based on density and molecular branching
      frequency. The two types most important to production of plastic
      bags are low-density PE (LDPE) and high-density PE (HDPE). HDPE is
      a copolymer with up to 1% 1-butene and is made historically with
      either Cr or Ziegler catalysts at 1–16 MPa at temperatures as low
      as 60 °C. More recently, single site catalysts such as
      metallocenes have been employed [10]. LDPE is produced at high
      temperatures (200–300 °C) and supercritical ethylene pressures
      (130–260 MPa) using peroxide-free radical initiators [10]. HDPE is
      a linear copolymer with a density range of 0.945–0.965 g/cm3
      whereas LDPE is branched with densities ranging from 0.915 to
      0.925 g/cm3[10]. Due to these differences in structure, the
      crystalline melting point, softening point and tensile strength of
      LDPE are considerably lower than the corresponding values for HDPE
      [10]. However, LDPE shows higher elongation at break and higher
      impact strength than does the more rigid HDPE [10]. It is also
      translucent rather than opaque due its lower crystallinity (55%)
      relative to HDPE (85–95%) [10]. HDPE is more commonly utilized for
      production of plastic bags due to its greater tensile strength
      coupled with its less energy-intensive production process.
      Pyrolysis is defined as the irreversible anaerobic thermochemical
      decomposition of material at elevated temperature (300 + °C). The
      principal benefit of pyrolysis is conversion of low energy density
      substrates into higher density liquid (bio-oil) and solid
      (biochar) fractions. A low-density volatile (syngas) fraction is
      also produced. Pyrolysis has been utilized for millennia to
      produce charcoal and coal. More recently, pyrolysis is used to
      produce charcoal, activated carbon, coke, carbon fiber, and
      methanol, among others. The distribution of products (bio-oil,
      biochar and syngas) is dependent on the type of pyrolysis,
      reaction conditions and feedstock. Pyrolysis is classified into
      four categories: slow, fast, flash, and gasification. Of these,
      fast and flash pyrolysis maximizes bio-oil production, slow
      pyrolysis augments the yield of biochar and gasification maximizes
      syngas production. With regard to production of liquid
      transportation fuels, fast or flash pyrolysis is employed to
      produce bio-oil [11], [12], [13] and [14]. The properties and
      composition of bio-oil such as high moisture and heteroatom
      content, presence of oxygenates such as organic acids, and broad
      distillation curve prevent its direct use as a transportation
      fuel; thus upgrading such as hydroprocessing and distillation is
      necessary [14], [15] and [16].<br>
      <br>
      Fast or flash pyrolysis has been reported on biological materials
      such as wood [13], triglycerides [17], grasses [18], shrubs [19],
      corn cobs and stover [20], alfalfa [21], oilseed presscakes [22],
      and pig compost [23], among others. Examples of fast pyrolysis on
      non-biological feedstocks include scrap tires [24] and [25],
      sewage sludge [25], general municipal solid waste [26], waste
      electrical and electronic equipment [27], and various plastics
      [25], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35] and [36]. The
      plastics include polystyrene [30], [31] and [32], poly(vinyl
      chloride) [30] and [31], polypropylene [31], [32], [33] and [34],
      PE terephthalate [32], acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene [32], and
      PE [30], [31], [32], [35] and [36]. In some cases plastics were
      co-pyrolyzed with other materials such as waste motor oil [32].
      With regard to fast pyrolysis of PE, pyrolysis of LDPE [30], HDPE
      [35] and [36] and various mixtures [31] and [32] was reported. In
      all PE studies, the properties of the resulting bio-oils were not
      reported, nor were the upgrading to fuel-grade hydrocarbons and
      subsequent fuel property determination.<br>
      <br>
      The objective of our study was the production, characterization
      and evaluation of alternative diesel fuel from pyrolysis of HDPE
      waste grocery bags. Comparison of our pyrolyzed polyethylene
      hydrocarbons (PPEH) with conventional petroleum-derived ultra-low
      sulfur (&lt; 15 ppm S) diesel (ULSD) fuel was a further objective,
      along with a comparison to petrodiesel standards such as ASTM D975
      and EN 590 (Table 1). Blends of PPEH with ULSD and biodiesel were
      prepared and the resultant fuel properties measured. It is
      anticipated that these results will further understanding of the
      applicability and limitations of HDPE as a feedstock for the
      production of alternative diesel fuel.<br>

      </b><b>2. Materials and methods</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>2.1. Materials</b><br>
      <br>
      Plastic HDPE grocery bags were collected from local retailers and
      represent the typical ones used in grocery stores. Summer grade
      ULSD was donated by a major petrochemical company. With the
      exception of conductivity and corrosion inhibitor additives, ULSD
      contained no performance-enhancing additives. Soybean oil methyl
      esters (SME) were donated by a BQ-9000 certified commercial
      producer. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
      Corp (St. Louis, MO). All materials were used as received.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2.2. Pyrolysis of HDPE to produce plastic crude oil</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Thermochemical conversion of plastic grocery bags (HDPE) to oils
      were conducted using a pyrolysis batch reactor in triplicate.
      Pyrolysis was performed in a Be-h desktop plastic to oil system
      (E-N-Ergy, LLC, Mercer Island, WA) containing a 2 L reactor and
      oil collection system using approximately 500 g of plastic grocery
      bags each time. The pyrolysis reactor has two heating zones (upper
      and lower); the upper and lower temperatures were set to 420 and
      440 °C, respectively. Once the reactor reached the set
      temperatures, a reaction time of 2 h was employed from that point
      on. Vapors produced as a result of pyrolysis were condensed over
      water as plastic crude oil (PCO). The upper oil layer was
      separated and weighed. The reactor lid was opened once the
      temperature was below 50 °C to remove the remaining residual solid
      material and weighed separately. The mass balance yields were
      calculated as the ratio of the corresponding product phase (liquid
      and solid) obtained in 12 batch experiments to the initial
      feedstock mass. Lastly, the gas-phase yields were calculated based
      on the resulting mass difference.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2.3. Distillation of plastic crude oil to yield diesel-range
        hydrocarbons</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Distillation of PCO was performed in a Be-h desktop plastic to oil
      system. A known amount of PCO (1 L) was added to the Be-h reactor
      vessel. The oil collection tank was cleaned by removing the water
      and dried before starting distillation. For collecting the
      gasoline equivalent fraction (&lt; 190 °C), the upper and lower
      temperatures were set to 175 and 190 °C, respectively. Once the
      liquid stopped dripping into the collection vessel, the gasoline
      equivalent fraction was removed, filtered, and weighed to provide
      yield. The upper zone temperature was then raised to 275 °C and
      lower zone to 290 °C to collect a #1 diesel equivalent fraction
      (190–290 °C). The # 2 diesel equivalent fraction (290–340 °C) was
      then collected by setting the upper zone temperature to 330 °C and
      lower zone to 340 °C. The material remaining in the reactor vessel
      was an atmospheric residue equivalent fraction (&gt; 340 °C),
      which was removed using a siphon pump once the reactor temperature
      was below 50 °C. All fractions except the atmospheric residue
      equivalent (&gt; 340 °C) were filtered through Whatman filter
      paper #4 to remove residual solid particles.<br>

      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>3.1. Preparation and chemical composition of pyrolyzed
        plastics</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The pyrolysis temperature range of 420–440 °C was chosen based on
      previous studies [34]. These temperatures resulted in
      decomposition reactions of HDPE to provide hydrocarbons of
      different chain lengths. Pyrolysis of waste plastic grocery bags
      at temperatures of 420–440 °C provided 74% yield of liquid product
      referred to as PCO, as shown in Fig. 1. Although not determined in
      the present paper, literature data suggested gaseous product
      obtained from pyrolysis of PE consisted primarily of ethane and
      ethene (C2, 52%) and C4 (32%) compounds [34]. The higher solid
      residue yield (17%) is likely due to the inorganic content and/or
      char content and/or unconverted HDPE. As the pyrolysis of PE has
      higher activation energy (280–320 kJ/mol) compared to
      polypropylene (190–220 kJ/mol), therefore, increasing the
      pyrolysis temperature to certain extent could result in increased
      amounts of the liquid fraction [34]. Also, this residue may have
      been the fraction boiling above 420 °C (analogous to the higher
      boiling vacuum gas oil fraction, VGO from petroleum distillation).
      Further thermal cracking of this product could have been achieved
      by increasing pyrolysis temperature and/or time, which we
      speculate would have resulted in higher yields of the desired PCO
      fraction. This residue along with the VGO fraction from PCO have
      potential to be used as lubricant basestocks, which upon further
      refining such as dewaxing/wax isomerization may yield API Group
      II/III lubricant base oils.<br>
      <br>
      The PCO thus obtained after pyrolysis of waste plastic grocery
      bags was distilled into four fractions (&lt; 190; 190–290;
      290–340; and 340 + °C equivalent of motor gasoline (MG), diesel#1
      (PPEH-L), diesel#2 (PPEH-H) and VGO respectively. The product
      yields are represented in Fig. 2. Similar results were obtained
      from SimDist analysis of PCOs with maximum coefficient of
      variation ranging from 0 to 7% (Table 2). In the absence of a
      catalyst, the major product is PPEH-L (41%). The product
      distribution can be changed with the use of zeolite catalysts such
      as ZSM-5, which will increase conversion to more low boiling
      products, such as MG and PPEH-L [34].<br>

        oils (PCO) using simulated distillation (HTGC–FID).</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Elemental analysis of waste plastic grocery bags and PCO fractions
      revealed less than 0.5% nitrogen content and less than 0.7% oxygen
      content (Table 3). As expected, waste plastic grocery bags have an
      empirical formula of CH2.1N0.005O0.007 quite similar to that of
      polyethylene (CH2). Higher carbon and hydrogen content and lower
      oxygen and nitrogen content resulted in a higher calculated HHV
      [37], [38] and [39] of 49–50 MJ/kg for most of the fractions,
      making these high energy liquid fuels <br>
      <br>
      <b>(Table 3). The calculated values were slightly higher than the
        actual determinations (Table 1)...</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The boiling point distribution of PCO fractions was obtained using
      high temperature GC–FID. Table 2 shows that the method developed
      for boiling point distribution was repeatable with a CV of less
      than 7% for distribution of various fractions in PCO and was
      similar to actual distillation data. All PCOs contained a large
      percentage of fraction 2 (PPEH-L) followed by PPEH-H and MG.
      Around 98% of the PCO was distilled under 400 °C, which is a good
      range for producing various fuels such as naphtha, <br>
      gasoline, aviation fuel, diesel, and fuel oil. The boiling point
      distribution of PCO and its four fractions is shown in Fig. 3. As
      boiling point and MW distribution of PCO were similar to petroleum
      fractions and contained negligible heteroatom content, therefore,
      we speculate that these PCOs will be compatible with petroleum
      crude oil for refining in a conventional refinery. The
      compatibility is further depicted in 10–50% blends of PPEH in ULSD
      as shown in Fig. 4. As the PPEH content increased in ULSD, the
      boiling point distribution shifted towards the higher boiling
      range, although overall the mixture remained within the boiling
      range of diesel fuel...<br>
      <br>
      Depicted in Table 7 and Table 8 are fuel properties of PPEH-L
      (Table 7) and PPEH-H (Table 8) blended with ULSD. For each sample,
      blends of 10 (P10), 20 (P20), 30 (P30), 40 (P40) and 50 (P50)
      vol.% in ULSD were investigated. With regard to cold flow
      properties, as the percentage of PPEH-L increased in blends with
      ULSD, values for CP, CFPP and PP became progressively lower due to
      the superior low temperature performance of PPEH-L relative to
      ULSD. In the case of PPEH-H, the opposite trend was elucidated in
      which cold flow properties (CP and PP) deteriorated as the
      concentration of PPEH-H in ULSD increased. CFPP of PPEH-H was not
      measured due to insufficient sample. Similarly, oxidative
      stability decreased as the percentage of PPEH increased in blends
      with ULSD. Comparison to the IP specification in EN 590 revealed
      that only the P10–30 blends of PPEH-H were above the minimum
      specification of 20 h. Results obtained from measurement of OT
      corroborated those obtained for IP: deterioration of stability as
      the concentration of PPEH increased in ULSD as indicated by
      progressively lower OTs.<br>

      </b><b>3.4. Influence of blending biodiesel with PPEH</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      ...It was found that diesel obtained from pyrolysis of plastic is
      as compatible with biodiesel as ULSD due to quite similar
      hydrocarbon structures and chain length distribution of molecules.<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. Conclusions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Pyrolysis of HDPE waste plastic grocery bags followed by
      distillation resulted in a major liquid hydrocarbon product
      (PPEH-L) with average structure consisting primarily of saturated
      aliphatic paraffinic hydrogens (94.0%) and smaller amounts of
      aliphatic olefinic hydrogens (5.4%) and aromatic hydrogens (1.0%)
      that corresponded to the boiling range typical of conventional
      petroleum diesel fuel (190–290 °C). Negligible
      heteroatom-containing species were detected from elemental
      analysis. Also obtained was a heavier boiling fraction (290–340
      °C) equivalent of diesel#2 from distillation of the crude
      pyrolysis product, PPEH-H, which also consisted of paraffinic
      protons (96.8%), olefinic protons (2.6%) and aromatic protons
      (0.6%). Based on the results obtained after determination of fuel
      properties and comparison to petrodiesel standards, the following
      conclusions were made regarding the applicability of these
      materials as alternative liquid transportation fuels:<br>
      <br>
      1. PPEH-H is more appropriate as an alternative diesel fuel
      because it exhibited higher values for FP, IP, KV, DCN, HHV,
      density, and lubricity than PPEH-L.<br>
      2. PPEH-H, after addition of antioxidants, met all ASTM D975 and
      EN 590 fuel specifications with the exception of density in the
      case of EN 590.<br>
      3. PPEH-L did not meet EN 590 specifications for IP, KV, FP, and
      density due to its higher content of lower MW constituents. <br>
      4. A 1:1 mixture of PPEH-H and PPEH-L met all ASTM D975 and EN 590
      specifications with the exception of density and IP in case of EN
      590, therefore PPEH-L and PPEH-H distillates can be collected
      together to provide ~ 64% diesel equivalent fraction from
      pyrolysis of plastic grocery bags.<br>
      5. P10–P30 blends of PPEH-H with ULSD met all ASTM D975
      specifications whereas only the P20–P30 blends met all EN 590
      limits. P40 and P50 blends require antioxidants to meet the
      oxidative stability specification listed in EN 590.<br>
      6. P10 blend of PPEH-L with ULSD met all ASTM D975 specifications
      except lubricity, while none of the blends of PPEH-L with ULSD met
      EN 590 specifications primarily due to poor DCN, IP, FP, and KV.<br>
      7. Diesel obtained from pyrolysis of plastic is as compatible with
      biodiesel as ULSD due to similar hydrocarbon structures and chain
      length distribution of molecules.<br>
      8. Biodiesel blends with PPEH-H met the specifications for
      lubricity and KV, while PPEH-L blends satisfied the lubricity
      limits, but not KV limits. PPEH-L improved low temperature
      properties of SME biodiesel whereas PPEH-H had the opposite
      effect.<br>
      <br>
      Based on these findings, PPEH-H and a mixture of PPEH-H/PPEH-L are
      suitable blend components for ULSD in the P10–P50 blend range so
      long as antioxidants are employed...<br>

            treatment revolution</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A revolution in cancer treatment could soon be underway following
      a breakthrough that may lead to a dramatic improvement in cancer
      survival rates.<br>
      <br>
      A new study at the University of Warwick, published today in the
      journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition, has developed a
      new drug that can manipulate the body’s natural signalling and
      energy systems, allowing the body to attack and shut down
      cancerous cells.<br>
      <br>
      Called ZL105, the drug is a compound based on the precious metal
      iridium. The study has found ZL105 could potentially replace
      currently used anticancer drugs, which become less effective over
      time, cause a wide-range of side-effects and damage healthy cells
      as well as cancerous.<br>
      <br>
      Commenting on the breakthrough, University of Warwick researcher
      and study co-author Dr Isolda Romero-Canelon said “The
      energy-producing machinery in cancer cells works to the limit as
      it attempts to keep up with quick proliferation and invasion. This
      makes cancer cells susceptible to minor changes in the cell
      ‘power-house’. Our drug pushes cancer cells over the limit causing
      them to slow and shut down, whilst normal cells can cope with its
      effects”.<br>
      <br>
      Preliminary data indicate that the novel drug may be ten times
      more effective in treating ovarian, colon, melanoma, renal, and
      some breast cancers, according to data obtained by the US National
      Cancer Institute. The researchers now aim to expand the study to
      cancers that are inherently resistant to existing drugs and to
      those which have developed resistance after a first round of
      chemotherapy treatments.<br>
      <br>
      Study co-author Professor Peter J. Sadler said “Existing cancer
      treatments often become less effective after the first course, as
      cancer cells learn how they are being attacked. The drug we have
      developed is a catalyst and is active at low doses. It can attack
      cancer cells in multiple ways at the same time, so the cancer is
      less able to adapt to the treatment. This means the new drugs
      could be much more effective than existing treatments.”<br>
      <br>
      “Platinum-based drugs are used in nearly 50% of all
      chemotherapeutic regimens, exert their activity by damaging DNA
      and cannot select between cancerous and non-cancerous cells,
      leading to a wide-range of side-effects from renal failure to
      neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, nausea and vomiting.<br>
      <br>
      “In contrast, the new iridium-based drug is specifically designed
      not to attack DNA, but to have a novel mechanism of action,
      meaning that it could not only dramatically slow down and halt
      cancer growth, but also significantly reduce the side effects
      suffered by patients” argues Professor Sadler.<br>
      <br>
      This research could also lead to substantial improvements in
      cancer survival rates. “Current statistics indicate that one in
      every three people will develop some kind of cancer during their
      life time, moreover approximately one woman dies of ovarian cancer
      every two hours in the UK according to Cancer Research UK .It is
      clear that a new generation of drugs is necessary to save more
      lives and our research points to a highly effective way of
      defeating cancerous cells” said Dr Romero-Canelon.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Platinum complexes are the most widely used anticancer drugs;
      however, new generations of agents are needed. The
      organoiridium(III) complex [(?5-Cpxbiph)Ir(phpy)(Cl)] (1-Cl),
      which contains p-bonded biphenyltetramethylcyclopentadienyl
      (Cpxbiph) and C^N-chelated phenylpyridine (phpy) ligands,
      undergoes rapid hydrolysis of the chlorido ligand. In contrast,
      the pyridine complex [(?5-Cpxbiph)Ir(phpy)(py)]+ (1-py) aquates
      slowly, and is more potent (in nanomolar amounts) than both 1-Cl
      and cisplatin towards a wide range of cancer cells. The pyridine
      ligand protects 1-py from rapid reaction with intracellular
      glutathione. The high potency of 1-py correlates with its ability
      to increase substantially the level of reactive oxygen species
      (ROS) in cancer cells. The unprecedented ability of these iridium
      complexes to generate H2O2 by catalytic hydride transfer from the
      coenzyme NADH to oxygen is demonstrated. Such organoiridium
      complexes are promising as a new generation of anticancer drugs
      for effective oxidant therapy.<br>

      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to novel iridium and/or
      rhodium containing complexes for use as cytotoxic, such as
      anti-cancer agents. There is also provided a method of preparing
      said compounds.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] A significant development of organometallic chemistry in
      recent years has been the increasing use of
      pentamethylcyclopentadienyl compounds. Not only are such compounds
      usually more soluble in organic solvents and more readily
      crystallized than their unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl analogs,
      but they are generally more stable as a result of the steric and
      electron-donation effects of the five methyl groups. This is
      particularly so for the
      ([eta]&lt;5&gt;-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)iridium complexes,
      where the [eta]&lt;5&gt;-C5Me5 acts as an excellent ligand toward
      Ir(III) since it is displaced only with considerable
      difficulty.&lt;1 &gt;<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Sheldrick's group in Germany has studied the biological
      activity of ([eta]&lt;5&gt;-pentamethyl cyclopentadienyl)iridium
      complexes with polypyridyl ligands. Their work focuses on the
      intercalative binding properties of polypyridyl (pp) ligands
      (pp=dpq, dppz and dppn) into DNA. Recently they have showed that
      [([eta]&lt;5&gt;-C5Me5)IrCl(dppz)](CF3SO3) and
      [([eta]&lt;5&gt;-C5Me5)Ir((NMe2)2CS)(dppn)](CF3SO3)2 possess in
      vitro cytotoxic activity towards MCF-7 and HT-29 cancer cell
      lines, while [([eta]&lt;5&gt;-C5Me5)Ir(phen)Cl](CF3SO3) and
      [([eta]&lt;5&gt;-C5Me5) Ir(en)Cl](CF3SO3) are inactive against
      MCF-7 (breast cancer).&lt;2 &gt;Furthermore they have studied the
      influence of polypyridyl ligands (pp=dpq, dppz and dppn) and
      monodentate ligands (L-Cl, (NH2)2CS, (NMe2)2CS) on DNA
      intercalation (see FIG. 1).&lt;3 &gt;They also found that the
      complexes [IrCl3(DMSO)(pp)] (pp=phen, dpq, dppz, dppn), (FIG. 1),
      are potent cytotoxic agents toward the human cell lines MCF-7 and
      HT-29 and their IC50 values are dependent on the size of the
      polypyridyl ligands.&lt;4 &gt;Their work on iridium and rhodium
      polypyridyl complexes of general formula [Me(hal)3(sol)(pp)], in
      which hal is a halogenide and sol is a solvent, is described in
      EP2072521.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] DNA binding of the type
      [([eta]&lt;5&gt;-C5Me5)Ir(Aa)(dppz)](CF3SO3)n containing
      S-coordinated amino acids has been studied and X-ray structure of
      [([eta]&lt;5&gt;-C5Me5)Ir(9-EtG)(phen)](CF3SO3)2 has been
      reported.&lt;5 &gt;<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The biological activity of three novel indium(III)
      complexes with 1,2-naphthoquinone-1-oximato ligand are also
      described.&lt;6 &gt;The complex [([eta]&lt;5&gt;-C5Me5)Ir
      (pyTz)Cl]&lt;+ &gt;containing the 2-(pyridine-2-yl)thiazole (pyTz)
      N,N-chelating ligand is reported to be inactive towards human
      ovarian cancer cell lines A2780 and A2780cisR
      (cisplatin-resistant)...<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Examples of cancers which may be treated by the active
      compounds include, but are not limited to, a carcinoma, for
      example a carcinoma of the bladder, breast, colon (e.g. colorectal
      carcinomas such as colon adenocarcinoma and colon adenoma),
      kidney, epidermal, liver, lung, for example adenocarcinoma, small
      cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung carcinomas, oesophagus,
      gall bladder, ovary, pancreas e.g. exocrine pancreatic carcinoma,
      stomach, cervix, thyroid, prostate, or skin, for example squamous
      cell carcinoma; a hematopoietic tumour of lymphoid lineage, for
      example leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell lymphoma,
      T-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, hairy
      cell lymphoma, or Burkett's lymphoma; a hematopoietic tumor of
      myeloid lineage, for example acute and chronic myelogenous
      leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome, or promyelocytic leukemia;
      thyroid follicular cancer; a tumour of mesenchymal origin, for
      example fibrosarcoma or habdomyosarcoma; a tumor of the central or
      peripheral nervous system, for example astrocytoma, neuroblastoma,
      glioma or schwannoma; melanoma; seminoma; teratocarcinoma;
      osteosarcoma; xenoderoma pigmentoum; keratoctanthoma; thyroid
      follicular cancer; or Kaposi's sarcoma.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Preferred cancers include leukaemia, CNS cancer, melanoma,
      prostrate cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer or any selection
      thereof.<br>
