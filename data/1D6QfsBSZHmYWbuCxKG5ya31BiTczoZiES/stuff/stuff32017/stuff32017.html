          </b>...Dr. Frank Brown, a pioneer in the study of interactions
          between magnetism and living organisms, found that when bean
          seeds were placed near one another there was an interaction
          between them that could not be explained in orthodox terms: it
          seemed to be due to the presence of a biofield or spin
          force.14 That the biofield was involved is supported by
          Brown’s observation of a connection between rotation and bean
          seed interaction. He found that the beans interacted more
          strongly when they were rotated counter-clockwise than when
          they were rotated clockwise. (The biofield is usually observed
          as a clockwise force as seen from above, though it reportedly
          flows in one direction for men and the opposite for women.)
          Brown also reported on the research of R.I. Jones, who
          reported in 1960 that plant growth could be altered by uniform
          daily rotation. Clockwise rotation depressed growth,
          suggesting the presence of a spin force around all plants
          might be a factor...<br>

            Pyramids as Torsion Conductors and Generators<br>
            <br>
          </b>Russian and Ukranian research into pyramids has yielded
          some very interesting results regarding torsion waves. The
          Russians found that the pyramid shape naturally harnesses
          torsion waves, as if amplifying them. It has been
          experimentally established that objects that feature the
          Golden Section (which expresses Phi) can be described as
          passive torsion generators.16 The team of Prof. A.G. Antonov
          from the Russian R&amp;D Institute of Pediatrics, Obstetrics
          and Gynecology tested the effects of a solution of 40% glucose
          in distilled water after it had been stored in the pyramid. By
          administering only 1 ml of the glucose to 20 different
          prematurely born infant patients with compromised immune
          systems, their levels of health were seen to increase rapidly
          up to practically normal values. The researchers furthermore
          discovered that the glucose was not necessary, as the same
          effect could be produced by simply using 1 ml of ordinary
          water that had been stored in the pyramid.17 Another study in
          Russia showed that mice drinking torsion-affected pyramid
          water had significantly fewer tumors develop than the mice
          drinking the ordinary water.18 (Elsewhere, Russian scientists
          have reported that mice subjected to static torsion fields
          showed significantly enhanced immune function.19)...<b><br>

            Abstract<br>
          </b><br>
          The “Anthropocene Epoch” has been proposed as a new
          post-Holocene geological time interval—a period characterized
          by the pervasive impact of human activities on the geological
          record. Prior to the influence of human technologies, the
          diversity and distribution of minerals at or near Earth’s
          surface arose through physical, chemical, and/or biological
          processes. Since the advent of human mining and manufacturing,
          particularly since the industrial revolution of the
          mid-eighteenth century, mineral-like compounds have
          experienced a punctuation event in diversity and distribution
          owing to the pervasive impact of human activities. We catalog
          208 mineral species approved by the International
          Mineralogical Association that occur principally or
          exclusively as a consequence of human processes. At least
          three types of human activities have affected the diversity
          and distribution of minerals and mineral-like compounds in
          ways that might be reflected in the worldwide stratigraphic
          record. The most obvious influence is the widespread
          occurrence of synthetic mineral-like compounds, some of which
          are manufactured directly for applications (e.g., YAG crystals
          for lasers; Portland cement) and others that arise indirectly
          (e.g., alteration of mine tunnel walls; weathering products of
          mine dumps and slag). A second human influence on the
          distribution of Earth’s near-surface minerals relates to
          large-scale movements of rocks and sediments—sites where large
          volumes of rocks and minerals have been removed. Finally,
          humans have become relentlessly efficient in redistributing
          select natural minerals, such as gemstones and fine mineral
          specimens, across the globe. All three influences are likely
          to be preserved as distinctive stratigraphic markers far into
          the future.<br>

          </b>The human handprint on the natural world has become
          evident in all too many ways in recent decades. The changing
          climate, the decline of wildlife and the loss of forests and
          other natural landscapes — all of these factors have led many
          scientists to conclude that we’re living in a new age they’ve
          dubbed the “Anthropocene,” in which the planet is dominated by
          human, rather than natural, influences.<br>
          <br>
          Now scientists have presented some stunning new evidence in
          support of this idea. They’ve found&nbsp; human activity is
          responsible for a huge explosion in the diversity of minerals
          on Earth — possibly the biggest such event in the history of
          the planet, according to Robert Hazen, a scientist at the
          Carnegie Institution of Washington’s Geophysical Laboratory
          who led the new research. The last major mineral
          diversification event is believed to have occurred about 2
          billion years ago...<b><br>

          <b><br>
          </b>Scientists have created a new hydrogel material reinforced
          with fibres that they say is up to five times harder to break
          than carbon steel – but still easy to bend and stretch.<br>
          <br>
          That combination of properties means the new fabric could be
          used as the basis for artificial ligaments and tendons
          designed to help the body heal – or in manufacturing or
          fashion where a very tough but elastic material is needed.<br>
          <br>
          Researchers from Hokkaido University in Japan developed the
          fabric, called fibre-reinforced soft composite(or FRSC), by
          combining hydrogels containing high levels of water with glass
          fibre fabric....<br>
          <br>
          The end result is a material that's 25 times tougher than
          glass fibre fabric; 100 times tougher than hydrogels; and five
          times as strong as carbon steel, in terms of the energy
          required to break them...<b><br>

          </b>A team of Hokkaido University scientists has succeeded in
          creating “fiber-reinforced soft composites,” or tough
          hydrogels combined with woven fiber fabric. These fabrics are
          highly flexible, tougher than metals, and have a wide range of
          potential applications.<br>
          <br>
          Efforts are currently underway around the world to create
          materials that are friendly to both society and the
          environment. Among them are those that comprise different
          materials, which exhibit the merits of each component.<br>
          <br>
          Hokkaido University researchers, led by Professor Jian Ping
          Gong, have focused on creating a reinforced material using
          hydrogels. Though such a substance has potential as a
          structural biomaterial, up until now no material reliable and
          strong enough for long-term use has been produced. This study
          was conducted as a part of the Cabinet Office’s Impulsing
          Paradigm Change through Disruptive Technologies Program
          (ImPACT).<br>
          <br>
          To address the problem, the team combined hydrogels containing
          high levels of water with glass fiber fabric to create
          bendable, yet tough materials, employing the same method used
          to produce reinforced plastics. The team found that a
          combination of polyampholyte (PA) gels, a type of hydrogel
          they developed earlier, and glass fiber fabric with a single
          fiber measuring around 10µm in diameter produced a strong,
          tensile material. The procedure to make the material is simply
          to immerse the fabric in PA precursor solutions for
          polymerization.<br>
          <br>
          When used alone, the fiber-reinforced hydrogels developed by
          the team are 25 times tougher than glass fiber fabric, and 100
          times tougher than hydrogels – in terms of the energy required
          to destroy them. Combining these materials enables a
          synergistic toughening. The team theorizes that toughness is
          increased by dynamic ionic bonds between the fiber and
          hydrogels, and within the hydrogels, as the fiber’s toughness
          increases in relation to that of the hydrogels. Consequently,
          the newly developed hydrogels are 5 times tougher compared to
          carbon steel.<br>
          <br>
          “The fiber-reinforced hydrogels, with a 40 percent water
          level, are environmentally friendly,” says Dr. Jian Ping Gong,
          “The material has multiple potential applications because of
          its reliability, durability and flexibility. For example, in
          addition to fashion and manufacturing uses, it could be used
          as artificial ligaments and tendons, which are subject to
          strong load-bearing tensions.” The principles to create the
          toughness of the present study can also be applied to other
          soft components, such as rubber.<br>

          <b>Abstract<br>
            <br>
          </b>Tough hydrogels have shown strong potential as structural
          biomaterials. These hydrogels alone, however, possess limited
          mechanical properties (such as low modulus) when compared to
          some load-bearing tissues, e.g., ligaments and tendons.
          Developing both strong and tough soft materials is still a
          challenge. To overcome this obstacle, a new material design
          strategy has been recently introduced by combining tough
          hydrogels with woven fiber fabric to create fiber reinforced
          soft composites (FRSCs). The new FRSCs exhibit extremely high
          toughness and tensile properties, far superior to those of the
          neat components, indicating a synergistic effect. Here, focus
          is on understanding the role of energy dissipation of the soft
          matrix in the synergistic toughening of FRSCs. By selecting a
          range of soft matrix materials, from tough hydrogels to weak
          hydrogels and even a commercially available elastomer, the
          toughness of the matrix is determined to play a critical role
          in achieving extremely tough FRSCs. This work provides a good
          guide toward the universal design of soft composites with
          extraordinary fracture resistance capacity.<b><br>

              cells</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>Vitamin C is up to ten times more effective at stopping
          cancer cell growth than common pharmaceuticals according to a
          new study by UK scientists.<br>
          <br>
          Cancer stem cells are the ‘seeds’ of new cancer cells. They
          are thought to be the root cause of chemotherapy resistance,
          leading to treatment failure in patients with advanced disease
          and the triggers of tumour recurrence and metastasis
          (regrowth).<br>
          <br>
          The researchers set out to assess the bioenergetics of cancer
          stem cells – the processes which allow the cells to live and
          thrive – with a view to disrupting their metabolism. Focusing
          on energy-transfer, they measured the impact on cell lines in
          a laboratory of seven substances:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clinically approved cancer drug,
          stiripentol<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three experimental pharmaceuticals:
          actinonin, FK866 and 2-DG.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three natural substances: caffeic acid
          phenyl ester (CAPE), silibinin and ascorbic acid<br>
          <br>
          While they found that natural antibiotic actinonin and the
          compound FK866 were the most potent, the natural products also
          inhibited cancer stem cell (CSC) formation, with vitamin C,
          outperforming 2-DG by tenfold in terms of potency.<br>
          <br>
          Vitamin C has previously been shown to be effective as a
          non-toxic anti-cancer agent in studies by Nobel Prize winner
          Linus Pauling and was recently shown to reduce mortality by
          18% on breast cancer patients in Japan.&nbsp; However, its
          effects on CSC activity have not been previously evaluated and
          in this context, say the researchers, it behaves as an
          inhibitor of glycolysis, which fuels energy production in
          mitochondria, the “powerhouse” of the cell.<br>
          <b><br>
            An exciting discovery<br>
            <br>
          </b>The study, published in Oncotarget, is the first evidence
          that vitamin C (ascorbic acid) can be used to target and kill
          cancer stem cells (CSCs), the cells responsible for fuelling
          fatal tumours.<br>
          <br>
          Dr Michael P. Lisanti, Professor of Translational Medicine at
          the University of Salford, said: “We have been looking at how
          to target cancer stem cells with a range of natural substances
          including silibinin (milk thistle) and CAPE, a honey-bee
          derivative, but by far the most exciting are the results with
          Vitamin C.<br>
          <br>
          “Vitamin C is cheap, natural, non-toxic and readily available
          so to have it as a potential weapon in the fight against
          cancer would be a significant step.”<br>
          <br>
          Dr Gloria Bonuccelli, lead author and another member of the
          Salford team added: “This is further evidence that Vitamin C
          and other non-toxic compounds may have a role to play in the
          fight against cancer.<br>
          <br>
          “Our results indicate it is a promising agent for clinical
          trials, and a as an add-on to more conventional therapies, to
          prevent tumour recurrence, further disease progression and
          metastasis.”<br>

            Abstract<br>
            <br>
          </b>Here, we assembled a broad molecular “tool-kit” to
          interrogate the role of metabolic heterogeneity in the
          propagation of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). First, we
          subjected MCF7 cells to “metabolic fractionation” by flow
          cytometry, using fluorescent mitochondrial probes to detect
          PCG1a activity, as well ROS and hydrogen-peroxide (H2O2)
          production; NADH levels were also monitored by
          auto-fluorescence. Then, the various cell populations were
          functionally assessed for “stem cell activity”, using the
          mammosphere assay (3D-spheroids). Our results indicate that a
          sub-population of MCF7 cells, with increased PGC1a activity,
          high mitochondrial ROS/H2O2 production and high NADH levels,
          all form mammospheres with a higher efficiency. Thus, it
          appears that mitochondrial oxidative stress and the
          anti-oxidant response both contribute to the promotion of
          mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism in CSCs.
          Further validation was provided by using specific inhibitors
          to target metabolic processes (the NAD+ salvage pathway,
          glycolysis, mitochondrial protein synthesis and OXPHOS),
          significantly reducing CSC propagation. As a consequence, we
          have now identified a variety of clinically-approved drugs
          (stiripentol), natural products (caffeic acid phenyl ester
          (CAPE), ascorbic acid, silibinin) and experimental
          pharmaceuticals (actinonin, FK866, 2-DG), that can be used to
          effectively inhibit CSC activity. We discuss the use of CAPE
          (derived from honey-bee propolis) and Vitamin C, as potential
          natural therapeutic modalities. In this context, Vitamin C was
          ~10 times more potent than 2-DG for the targeting of CSCs.
          Similarly, stiripentol was between 50 to 100 times more potent
          than 2-DG.<br>

          Could I just make an observation that’s been missing from this
          interesting discussion? Fukushima accident is not over – not
          by any means… The cancer rate in Japan is going to rise
          steadily. It’s going to be denied by the government because
          there’s no transparency on this issue in Japan. There’s a
          particular example of the problem that intrigues me is when
          they put the plant in, they not only dug it out so it’d be
          closer to the water source – the sea – but they put it where
          there was a river flowing underneath that area. They went up
          the hill and they diverted the river so that it flowed down on
          the sides of the large area there and that was no problem.
          They never anticipated an earthquake could wreck their
          diversion. So know we have a strong underground river flowing
          directly under the plant where three huge globs of molten fuel
          are sitting on the bottom, giving off radiation, and sending
          that radiation into the water through the river that’s
          underneath the plant. And it’s going out into the ocean and
          we’re seeing damage in the marine life in the West Coast of
          the U.S. and British Columbia. There’s no way that’s going to
          be stopped, until they get the molten cores out of there, and
          they have no way — that they know of — of doing that. Nobody
          has any idea what to do about the continuing Fukushima
          contamination...<br>

          A University of Colorado research group led by Alan Weimer has
          taken on the challenge of “Reinventing the Toilet.” In
          September of 2012, this group (with Principal Investigator
          Karl Linden) received funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda
          Gates Foundation to develop a novel toilet that produces char
          from waste using solar energy. This toilet, the Sol-Char, is a
          waterless, selfcontained toilet that can function completely
          off the grid by capturing readily available solar energy.
          Concentrated sunlight is delivered to fiber optic bundles
          located at the focus of parabolic concentrators; the fiber
          optic cables are fed to the reaction compartment of the
          Sol-Char where the various individual cables are terminated at
          an&nbsp; outer or “solar” lid positioned over the waste
          collection container. The innovative transmission of solar
          power illuminates the inner collection container and
          disinfects the waste though convection and radiation heat
          transfer. The reaction compartment comprises two containers
          that are alternated between “collection” and “reaction” modes
          via a simple carousel system that can be automated (powered
          with&nbsp; photovoltaic energy) or manually controlled.
          The&nbsp; reactor is designed to achieve high temperatures
          with minimal heat loss due to specially designed insulation
          and produces a safe and useable product. The Sol-Char toilet
          can be developed for virtually any number of users with solar
          power input scaled accordingly. Means for innovative odor
          control and final product storage/ collection (for later use
          as a soil amendment) are also being developed as a part of the
          Sol-Char.<br>

          Feeding knowledge directly into your brain, just like in
          sci-fi classic The Matrix, could soon take as much effort as
          falling asleep, scientists believe.<br>
          <br>
          Researchers claim to have developed a simulator which can feed
          information directly into a person’s brain and teach them new
          skills in a shorter amount of time, comparing it to “life
          imitating art”.<br>
          <br>
          They believe it could be the first steps in developing
          advanced software that will make Matrix-style instant learning
          a reality.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          In the neo-noir sci-fi classic, protagonist Neo is able to
          learn kung fu in seconds after the martial art is ‘uploaded’
          straight to his brain.<br>
          <br>
          Researchers from HRL Laboratories, based in California, say
          they have found a way to amplify learning, only on a much
          smaller scale than seen in the Hollywood film.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          They studied the electric signals in the brain of a trained
          pilot and then fed the data into novice subjects as they
          learned to pilot an aeroplane in a realistic flight simulator.<br>
          <br>
          The study, published in the journal Frontiers in Human
          Neuroscience, found that subjects who received brain
          stimulation via electrode-embedded head caps improved their
          piloting abilities and learnt the task 33 per cent better than
          a placebo group.<br>

          EV Gray's Splitting the Positive - History has it that the
          Ingenious Mr. Gray learned how to split the positive in 1958.
          This phrase means just what it says: positive potential is
          split so that it travels through two different branches of a
          circuit. In order to do this, Gray used a special home made
          wire wound resister which was a bifilar inductor. (Shown
          connected to the battery on the left in the first attached
          image.)<br>
          <br>
          After agents from the Federal Government seized the Black
          Boxes, Gray was forbidden to replicate the original
          technology. However, he knew what the effect was and hired a
          variety of workers to help find an alternate way to produce
          it. I'll point out why the circuit shown in the patent doesn't
          operate in the same way, but Gray plainly states in his last
          two patents that variations of the circuit might be used and
          still fall within the scope and intent of the claims. I've
          also discovered one of these variations.<br>
          <br>
          The term 'Splitting the Positive' is spoken in a lot of
          forums, I think everyone has been wrong so far. Marvin Cole is
          the originator of the Gray motor. It is understood that Gray
          did not know what Splitting the positive means, thus the Gray
          Tube was invented. Original motor did not have a 'Tube' per
          say. Arc's where in the motor.<br>
          <br>
          If you're wanting to replicate the technology it would be a
          mistake to disregard statements attributed to Gray. No one has
          ever said that Cole understood lightning, was fascinated by
          radar, or knew the advantages and applications of a delay
          line. Cole was a mechanical engineer. How many of the miracle
          million dollar cutting edge electrical inventions on the table
          with Bing Crosby's accountants did he invent? If Gray didn't
          know anything, how was he able to advance the technology,
          including his eventual 1,000 Hp White Motor? I think there
          WERE original CSETs, in the Black Boxes, represented by the
          power supply in Gray's first patent. The Internet has a lot of
          disinformation, perhaps designed to minimize clues. -

          fast-tracking the Islamization of Germany, as evidenced by the
          proliferation of no-go zones, Sharia courts, polygamy and
          child marriages. Mass migration has also been responsible for
          a host of social disruptions, including jihadist attacks, a
          migrant rape epidemic, a public health crisis, rising crime
          and a rush by German citizens to purchase weapons for

          Iraq and Syria have reached Europe so far: "Eight to ten
          million migrants are still on the way."<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are written instructions ... today
          we are not allowed to say anything negative about the

          non-governmental organization supporting persecuted
          Christians, reported that thousands of Christians in German
          refugee shelters are being persecuted by Muslims, sometimes
          even by their security guards.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 23-year-old Iraqi asylum seeker wearing a
          T-shirt with the words "I'm Muslim Don't Panic" was assaulted
          by fellow refugees for offending Islam. He was beaten so badly
          that he was hospitalized.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half of the three million ethnic Turks
          living in Germany believe it is more important to follow
          Islamic Sharia law than German law if the two are in conflict,
          according to a survey.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A document leaked to Der Spiegel revealed
          that more than 33,000 migrants who are supposed to be deported
          are still in Germany, being cared for by German taxpayers.
          Many of the migrants destroyed their passports and are
          believed to have lied about their countries of origin to make
          it impossible for them to be deported.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Migrants committed 142,500 crimes during
          the first six months of 2016, according to a report by the
          Federal Criminal Police Office. This is equivalent to 780
          crimes committed by migrants every day, or 32.5 crimes each
          hour, an increase of nearly 40% over 2015. The data includes
          only those crimes in which a migrant suspect has been caught.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bild, the largest-circulation newspaper in
          Germany, warned that the country was "capitulating to Islamic
          law."<br>
          <br>
          Germany's Muslim population surpassed six million in 2016 for
          the first time ever. Germany now vies with France for the
          highest Muslim population in Western Europe.<br>
          <br>
          The increase in Germany's Muslim population is being fueled by
          mass migration. An estimated 300,000 migrants arrived in
          Germany in 2016, in addition to the more than one million who
          arrived in 2015. At least 80% (or 800,000 in 2015 and 240,000
          in 2016) of the newcomers were Muslim, according to the
          Central Council of Muslims in Germany.<br>
          <br>
          In addition to the newcomers, the rate of population increase
          of the Muslim community already living in Germany is around
          1.6% per year (or 77,000), according to data extrapolated from
          a Pew Research Center study on the growth of the Muslim
          population in Europe.<br>
          <br>
          Based on Pew projections, which were proffered before the
          current migration crisis, the Muslim population of Germany was
          to have reached an estimated 5,145,000 by the end of 2015.<br>
          <br>
          Adding the 800,000 Muslim migrants who arrived in Germany in
          2015, and the 240,000 who arrived in 2016, combined with the
          77,000 natural increase, the Muslim population of Germany
          jumped by 1,117,000, to reach an estimated 6,262,000 by the
          end of 2016. This amounts to approximately 7.5% of Germany's
          overall population of 82 million.<br>
          <br>
          Mass migration from the Muslim world is fast-tracking the
          Islamization of Germany, as evidenced by the proliferation of
          no-go zones, Sharia courts, polygamy and child marriages. Mass
          migration has also been responsible for a host of social
          disruptions, including jihadist attacks, a migrant rape
          epidemic, a public health crisis, rising crime and a rush by
          German citizens to purchase weapons for self-defense — and
          even to abandon Germany altogether.<br>
          <br>
          What follows is a chronological round-up of some of the key
          stories about the Islamization of Germany during 2016.<br>

          Cindy Lever, an Australian journalist and mother, is urging
          parents to adopt a controversial “parenting strategy” that
          discourages parents from making their infants wear diapers to
          make them defecate “naturally” in the sink instead. It’s
          called Elimination Communication or Natural Infant Hygiene.<br>
          <br>
          Writing on an Australian parenting site, Lever says she uses
          the method on her two-week-old baby. She posted pictures
          (taken by her husband) holding up her baby over a sink.
          Makeup, medication, and soap can be seen strewn about the sink
          that her baby’s about to make a mess in.<br>
          Potty in a sink<br>
          <br>
          “Babies are no different from adults and naturally don’t want
          to soil themselves,” she writes. “Using a nappy is something
          they get used to when their cues to go the toilet are not
          heard or understood. This instinct is then lost altogether at
          about six months old if it has been ignored.”<br>
          <br>
          She claims that the nappy-free method she uses is “practiced
          by many cultures around the world, but unfortunately has been
          lost in the West.” ... <br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Caldicott: “Those incredibly high
          measurements [of radioactivity recently detected in Fukushima
          Daiichi's Reactor No. 2 containment vessel] mean, I think
          almost certainly, that they will never be able to clean it up
          or decommission it… Talk about decommissioning and cleaning it
          up in 100 years… I think it’s a fantasy.”<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Host: “What was also revealed in these new
          photos is what appears to be a hole in a grate at the bottom
          of the Unit 2 reactor containment vessel. It’s variously been
          described as one meter or two meters in diameter. What does
          that mean?”<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Caldicott: … “I spoke to Arnie
          Gundersen, who’s a nuclear engineer, and he said that the
          robot did pick up structural damage to the building of Unit 2,
          which means it makes it unstable should there be another
          earthquake greater than 7 on the Richter scale — which then
          means the building could collapse, which then means that would
          collapse onto the molten core, and also with the spent fuel
          rods which are incredibly radioactive in the spent fuel pool,
          they would go down as well. A huge amount of radiation would
          be released, such that it would be the end of Japan and
          certainly, very much radioactive fallout in the Northern
          Hemisphere such that I would probably get my family from
          Boston to come straight away to Australia.”<br>

          Scientists appear to be far closer to explaining the
          mechanisms of action within the body that cause autism. Most
          of the research that has created this understanding has been
          published in the last 36 months, and largely from
          international scientists in Canada, France, Israel, and China.
          Four clear, replicable, and related discoveries explaining how
          autism is triggered are forming an undeniably clear picture of
          autism's causation, and possibly ways to alleviate the
          symptoms, too.<br>
          <br>
          When Caltech scientist Dr. Paul Patterson passed away in 2014,
          I had little appreciation that he had triggered a chain of
          events over the course of his career that may now provide a
          clear and unambiguous explanation of how and why my son
          developed autism back in 2004. Knowing exactly how my son's
          autism was caused is incredibly important to my wife and I,
          because the more information we have about causation, the more
          chance we have to do something about it, and perhaps recover
          my son from an affliction now impacting 1 in 48 American kids.<br>
          <br>
          What you're about to read is the product of more than two
          dozen very recent peer-reviewed published scientific studies,
          with really no original thought by me. I'm a businessman and a
          father, but what follows is a "grand theory of autism" so
          complete and well-supported that I think it deserves the
          attention of every member of the autism community. When the
          totality of this explanation became clear to me, not only did
          my jaw hit the floor, but I was immediately consumed with
          thoughts about how this clear explanation might impact the way
          we treat our son's autism, and I hope it does the same for you
          and perhaps your doctor as well. What I'm certain of is that
          this "grand theory" needs to be heavily debated, and I hope by
          putting it in the public realm I help move it along that path.
          (I'm indebted to an anonymous scientist who runs a website
          called Vaccine Papers, where many of these insights came from.
          I will quote VP throughout this piece, referring to VP as
          "VP." I highly recommend you read the totality of his website,
          where the explanations are far more scientific than what you
          will read here.)<br>
          <br>
          It shouldn't be a surprise that the final piece of this puzzle
          came from China. I've listened closely to the stories of
          American scientists wanting to study autism and complaining
          that any studies that are even remotely controversial are
          nearly impossible to fund or get approved. As you will see,
          Chinese scientists do not appear to have that same constraint.
          In a way, many American, Canadian, and French scientists have
          pioneered a pretty clear picture of how autism is caused, and
          the Chinese helped tie it all together. That's at least my
          interpretation, please make your own judgment...<br>

          These children look like any other kids, but they have what
          some may call special superpowers, including the ability the
          read, write and play games, all while blindfolded.<br>
          <br>
          Nicola Farmer teaches them to awaken these abilities from her
          home school located in Essex, England. Seeing the children run
          around, read books, and play games while blindfolded reminded
          me of the X-Men Academy.<br>
          <br>
          Two of her students, Sonny and Lucy, spoke with me about their
          unique abilities.<br>
          <br>
          Lucy told me anyone can learn how to do what she does, saying
          the "light" within her guides her sight.<br>

          After the popularity of my video "Girl Demonstrates Cool

              smaller and denser storage devices: IBM</b><br>
            <br>
            <i>A new discovery could pave the way for magnetic storage
              systems that are smaller, denser, and more powerful,
              according to IBM Research.</i><br>

          By Tas Bindi<br>
          <br>
          IBM researchers have found a way to store one bit of data in a
          magnet consisting of just one atom, the company announced on
          Wednesday.<br>
          <br>
          Prior to the discovery, the smallest bistable magnetic bits
          consisted of 3 to 12 atoms, IBM said, and hard drives use
          about 10,000 atoms to store a single bit.<br>
          <br>
          The ability to read and write one bit of data on one atom
          creates new possibilities for developing smaller and denser
          storage devices, according to IBM. The company said the
          discovery makes it conceivable to store an entire library of
          35 million songs on a device no bigger than a credit card.<br>
          <br>
          Also: Data storage in synthetic DNA reaches new landmark but
          remains costly | DNA data storage landmark: Now it's 215
          petabytes per gram or over 100 million movies | Kingston's 2TB
          'world's highest capacity USB flash drive' costs almost as
          much as a MacBook Pro<br>
          <br>
          "Magnetic bits lie at the heart of hard-disk drives, tape and
          next-generation magnetic memory," said Christopher Lutz, lead
          nanoscience researcher at IBM Research Almaden in San Jose,
          California. "We conducted this research to understand what
          happens when you shrink technology down to the most
          fundamental extreme -- the atomic scale."<br>
          <br>
          Earlier this month, researchers at IBM Research Almaden
          announced that they had developed an electron-spin resonance
          (ESR) sensor consisting of a single iron atom on the tip of a
          scanning tunneling microscope (STM), allowing scientists to
          measure the magnetic field of individual atoms by placing the
          sensor right next to it. The single-atom magnet was created
          using the ESR sensor fitted on the STM.<br>
          <br>
          The single-atom, read-write storage system is arranged by
          placing atoms on a substrate of magnesium oxide that acts as
          an insulating layer between the metal electrodes beneath it
          and the magnetic atoms on top of it.<br>
          <br>
          Attached to the magnesium oxide surface is the holmium atom,
          which scientists say is an ideal data storage medium given its
          stability. It can hold its polarisation under many conditions
          including the presence of magnets.<br>
          <br>
          When the STM introduces electrical current to the holmium
          atom, it flips the magnetic north and south poles of the atom,
          IBM explained. The STM also uses liquid helium for cooling
          that allows the atoms to retain their magnetic orientations
          long enough to be written and read.<br>
          <br>
          The company demonstrated that two magnetic atoms could be
          written and read independently even when they were separated
          by just 1 nanometre, which could culminate in a magnetic
          storage system that is 1,000 times denser than today's hard
          disk drives and solid state memory chips. Additionally, with a
          one-bit-per-atom ratio, such a system could also store
          significantly more data which could pave the way for smaller
          datacentres, computers, and mobile devices, IBM said.<br>
          <br>
          However, while the discovery suggests a path towards data
          storage at the atomic level, IBM admitted that the way in
          which individual magnetic centres can be accessed is still
          unclear.<br>
          <br>
          Another recent breakthrough in storage technology at Columbia
          University and the New York Genome Center could allow us to
          store 215 petabytes of data into one gram of DNA. While
          practical applications are years away, DNA holds promise for
          data storage because of its superior density to tape, disk,
          and optical media. It can also store information for thousands
          of years when kept in the right conditions.<br>
          <br>
          Mid-last year, a team of physicists in the Netherlands
          developed a storage device composed of chlorine atoms on a
          tiny metal surface that promises to one day be scaled up to
          hold about 10 terabytes of data on a 1cm-square space.<br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mass migration from the Muslim world is
              fast-tracking the Islamization of Germany, as evidenced by
              the proliferation of no-go zones, Sharia courts, polygamy
              and child marriages. Mass migration has also been
              responsible for a host of social disruptions, including
              jihadist attacks, a migrant rape epidemic, a public health
              crisis, rising crime and a rush by German citizens to
              purchase weapons for self-defense — and even to abandon
              Germany altogether.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Development Minister Gerd Müller warned
              that the biggest refugee movements to Europe are still to
              come. He said that only 10% of the migrants from the chaos
              in Iraq and Syria have reached Europe so far: "Eight to
              ten million migrants are still on the way."<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are written instructions ...
              today we are not allowed to say anything negative about
              the refugees. This is government journalism, and this
              leads to a situation in which the public loses their trust
              in us. This is scandalous." — Wolfgang Herles,
              Deutschlandfunk public radio.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Turkish government has sent 970
              clerics — most of whom do not speak German — to lead 900
              mosques in Germany that are controlled by the
              Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs (DITIB), a
              branch of the Turkish government's Directorate for
              Religious Affairs, known in Turkish as Diyanet. Critics
              accuse Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of using
              DITIB mosques to prevent Turkish migrants from integrating
              into German society.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Cologne police superintendent
              revealed that he was ordered to remove the term "rape"
              from an internal police report about the mass sexual
              assaults in Cologne on New Year's Eve. He said that an
              official at the North-Rhine Westphalia Interior Ministry
              told him in an angry tone: "This is not rape. Remove this
              term from your report. Submit a new report."<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The German branch of Open Doors, a
              non-governmental organization supporting persecuted
              Christians, reported that thousands of Christians in
              German refugee shelters are being persecuted by Muslims,
              sometimes even by their security guards.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 23-year-old Iraqi asylum seeker
              wearing a T-shirt with the words "I'm Muslim Don't Panic"
              was assaulted by fellow refugees for offending Islam. He
              was beaten so badly that he was hospitalized.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half of the three million ethnic Turks
              living in Germany believe it is more important to follow
              Islamic Sharia law than German law if the two are in
              conflict, according to a survey.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A document leaked to Der Spiegel
              revealed that more than 33,000 migrants who are supposed
              to be deported are still in Germany, being cared for by
              German taxpayers. Many of the migrants destroyed their
              passports and are believed to have lied about their
              countries of origin to make it impossible for them to be
              deported.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Migrants committed 142,500 crimes
              during the first six months of 2016, according to a report
              by the Federal Criminal Police Office. This is equivalent
              to 780 crimes committed by migrants every day, or 32.5
              crimes each hour, an increase of nearly 40% over 2015. The
              data includes only those crimes in which a migrant suspect
              has been caught.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bild, the largest-circulation newspaper
              in Germany, warned that the country was "capitulating to
              Islamic law."<br>
              <br>
              Germany's Muslim population surpassed six million in 2016
              for the first time ever. Germany now vies with France for
              the highest Muslim population in Western Europe.<br>
              <br>
              The increase in Germany's Muslim population is being
              fueled by mass migration. An estimated 300,000 migrants
              arrived in Germany in 2016, in addition to the more than
              one million who arrived in 2015. At least 80% (or 800,000
              in 2015 and 240,000 in 2016) of the newcomers were Muslim,
              according to the Central Council of Muslims in Germany.<br>
              <br>
              In addition to the newcomers, the rate of population
              increase of the Muslim community already living in Germany
              is around 1.6% per year (or 77,000), according to data
              extrapolated from a Pew Research Center study on the
              growth of the Muslim population in Europe.<br>
              <br>
              Based on Pew projections, which were proffered before the
              current migration crisis, the Muslim population of Germany
              was to have reached an estimated 5,145,000 by the end of
              2015.<br>
              <br>
              Adding the 800,000 Muslim migrants who arrived in Germany
              in 2015, and the 240,000 who arrived in 2016, combined
              with the 77,000 natural increase, the Muslim population of
              Germany jumped by 1,117,000, to reach an estimated
              6,262,000 by the end of 2016. This amounts to
              approximately 7.5% of Germany's overall population of 82
              million.<br>
              <br>
              Mass migration from the Muslim world is fast-tracking the
              Islamization of Germany, as evidenced by the proliferation
              of no-go zones, Sharia courts, polygamy and child
              marriages. Mass migration has also been responsible for a

                  Shun Diapers and Toilet Train Infants ‘Like Puppies’
                  in the Sink</b><br>
                <br>

              Cindy Lever, an Australian journalist and mother, is
              urging parents to adopt a controversial “parenting
              strategy” that discourages parents from making their
              infants wear diapers to make them defecate “naturally” in
              the sink instead. It’s called Elimination Communication or
              Natural Infant Hygiene.<br>
              <br>
              Writing on an Australian parenting site, Lever says she
              uses the method on her two-week-old baby. She posted
              pictures (taken by her husband) holding up her baby over a
              sink. Makeup, medication, and soap can be seen strewn
              about the sink that her baby’s about to make a mess in.<br>

              <br>
              “Babies are no different from adults and naturally don’t
              want to soil themselves,” she writes. “Using a nappy is
              something they get used to when their cues to go the
              toilet are not heard or understood. This instinct is then
              lost altogether at about six months old if it has been
              ignored.”<br>
              <br>
              She claims that the nappy-free method she uses is
              “practiced by many cultures around the world, but
              unfortunately has been lost in the West.” ... <br>

              Germany has stepped up to claim the cuck crown. From the
              way they kowtow to Muslim migrants and celebrate the

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Caldicott: “Those incredibly high
              measurements [of radioactivity recently detected in
              Fukushima Daiichi's Reactor No. 2 containment vessel]
              mean, I think almost certainly, that they will never be
              able to clean it up or decommission it… Talk about
              decommissioning and cleaning it up in 100 years… I think
              it’s a fantasy.”<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Host: “What was also revealed in these
              new photos is what appears to be a hole in a grate at the
              bottom of the Unit 2 reactor containment vessel. It’s
              variously been described as one meter or two meters in
              diameter. What does that mean?”<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Caldicott: … “I spoke to Arnie
              Gundersen, who’s a nuclear engineer, and he said that the
              robot did pick up structural damage to the building of
              Unit 2, which means it makes it unstable should there be
              another earthquake greater than 7 on the Richter scale —
              which then means the building could collapse, which then
              means that would collapse onto the molten core, and also
              with the spent fuel rods which are incredibly radioactive
              in the spent fuel pool, they would go down as well. A huge
              amount of radiation would be released, such that it would
              be the end of Japan and certainly, very much radioactive
              fallout in the Northern Hemisphere such that I would
              probably get my family from Boston to come straight away
              to Australia.”..<br>

            "The 'new (west coast) weather patterns' are forecasting
            that the 'storms' will be 'so regular' as to be 'scrubbing
            off hillsides', 'moving houses', and of course, causing
            'flooding'. The 'flooding' words are also containing
            supporting sets for 'inland seas', and 'lakes' being
            'filled'. Many new sets for 'displaced persons', and
            'diaspora' as well as 'evacuations', and 'planned relocation
            (of) communities'. These latter are within the longer term
            value types...<br>
            <br>
            "New data sets with 'california' as a central geographic
            reference are showing that the 'flooding' forecast to cause
            problems over March of 2017 will also include 'high tech
            firms'. There are data sets going to the idea that
            'flooding' will 'breach' the 'protective sleeves' and cause
            'global internet problems'. These sets are forecasting that
            'flooding' will be 'filling up' the 'work areas' for 'large
            scale routing equipment' for some of the 'telephone
            companies' that will in turn cause 'wide spread internet
            failures'. The new sets have added support for 'flooding'
            being 'impacting' to the point of 'emergency operations'
            having to be 'activated'. Other sets have 'unprepared
            companies', many described as 'global head quarters' being
            'evacuated' not because of 'flooding' at their buildings,
            but rather due to the 'loss of services' including
            'electrical', 'potable water', 'sewage', and 'internet'.
            This is described as being an 'on-going problem' that will
            extend out into Spring. This is indicated to bring very
            large economic and 'dollar' impacts. Other 'financial
            problems' from the 'flooding' in California are forecast to
            include 'banking assets collapse' as 'thousands' of
            'properties' including 'houses', and 'commercial buildings',
            and 'production facilities', and 'growing lands' are hit by
            'disaster'. These sets have a very large economic impacts
            with long duration values. If these sets are accurate, the
            forecast is that the 'environment changes', both 'physical',
            and 'financial' for 'California' will persist for decades.
            The 'financial impacts' are also showing as affecting
            'national food supply' for years from the 'damage' that has
            already been sustained.<br>
            <br>
            The forecast within the new data is for at least 7/seven
            years of 'financial problems' that will be directly related
            to the 'unfolding flooding situation' this year...<br>

            A molecular robot consisting of biomolecules, such as DNA
            and protein, has now been developed by a team of scientists.
            <br>
            <br>
            A research group at Tohoku University and Japan Advanced
            Institute of Science and Technology has developed a
            molecular robot consisting of biomolecules, such as DNA and
            protein. The molecular robot was developed by integrating
            molecular machines into an artificial cell membrane. It can
            start and stop its shape-changing function in response to a
            specific DNA signal.<br>

            Inspired by origami, researchers have found a way to

            <br>
            Researchers at NC State have developed a way to print liquid
            metals into 3D structures at room temperature. The
            structures are stabilized by a thin oxide 'skin' that forms
            on the liquid metal. The approaches shown here represent new
            ways to direct write metals in 3D. In addition, the
            resulting components can, in principle, self-heal (
            "Self-healing stretchable wires"&nbsp;&nbsp;
            http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfAOEt1eNFU&nbsp; ) and be
            ultra-stretchable ( "Ultra-stretchable wires"

            The paper, "3D Printing of Free Standing Liquid Metal
            Microstructures," is published online in Advanced Materials.

            <div align="center"><b>U.S. scientists find way to safely
                thaw cryopreserved tissues;</b><br>
            </div>
            <b> </b><br>
            Although scientists have been able to successfully preserve
            organs cooled at ultra-low temperatures, they have had less
            success in thawing them out without causing cracks in the
            fragile tissues.<br>
            <br>
            To address this issue, researchers at the University of
            Minnesota developed a new heating method using iron oxide
            nanoparticles, which surround the frozen tissues. They act
            like tiny heaters when activated by an external magnetic
            field.<br>
            <br>
            Using this method, the researchers were able to uniformly
            warm frozen animal heart valves and tissues without causing
            harm to the tissues.<br>
            <br>
            "This paper takes the first practical step towards making
            tissue banking a reality," said Caitlin Czajka, an editor at
            Science Translational Medicine, which published the research
            on Tuesday.<br>
            <br>
            Currently, more than 60 percent of donated hearts and lungs
            are thrown out each year because they can only be kept on
            ice for four hours before they deteriorate.<br>
            <br>
            In prior work, teams have succeeded in reheating only about
            1 millilitre of tissue and solution. In the new study, the
            team reheated arteries and heart valves in 50 millilitre
            vials, said study senior author John Bischof, a mechanical
            engineering professor at the University of Minnesota which
            holds two patents on the technology.<br>
            <br>
            "What we found is we could bring these tissues back at very
            rapid rates and we were able to maintain the viability and
            functionality of the tissues," Bischof told reporters on a
            telephone briefing.<br>
            <br>
            After thawing, none of the tissues showed signs of damage
            and the nanoparticles were washed away.<br>

            </div>
            <br>
            By placing a propeller in a duct, the efficiency and maximum
            thrust can be increased, sometimes significantly. This video
            explains two of the mechanisms by which these improvements
            are obtained -- namely by reducing the losses due to the tip
            vortex which occurs when a propeller operates in free space
            and also by using an annular wing that harnesses the effects
            documented in Bernoulli's theorum.<br>

            Yaniv Erlich and colleagues encoded large media files in
            DNA, copied the DNA multiple times, and still managed to
            retrieve the files without any errors, they reported in
            Science today (March 2). Compared with cassette tapes and 8
            mm film, DNA is far less likely to become obsolete, and its
            storage density is roughly 215 petabytes of data per gram of
            genetic material, the researchers noted.<br>
            <br>
            To test DNA’s media-storage capabilities, Erlich, an
            assistant professor of computer science at Columbia
            University in New York City, and Dina Zielinski, a senior
            associate scientist at the New York Genome Center, encoded
            six large files—including a French film and a computer
            operating system (OS), complete with word-processing
            software—into DNA. They then recovered the data from
            PCR-generated copies of that DNA. The Scientist spoke with
            Erlich about the study, and other potential data-storage
            applications for DNA...<br>

            Scripps College resident assistants (RAs) recently hung two
            types of signs titled “Emotional Labor 101” across campus.
            One of the signs, printed on a white background, is titled,
            “Quick Guide For White Students.” The other poster, printed
            on black paper, is titled, “Quick Guide For People Of Color
            And Marginalized Backgrounds.”<br>
            <br>
            Both signs, which are marked with the Scripps College
            administration’s stamp of approval, define “emotional labor”
            as “the exertion of energy for the purpose of addressing
            people’s feelings, educating, making people comfortable, or
            living up to social ‘expectations.’”&nbsp; The sign
            addressing non-white students notes, “Victims of emotional
            labor can be cornered in the classrooms, on social media, or
            in social events. If you are constantly having to explain or
            defend this could be you.” The poster then asks, “What can I
            do about it?” and states, “First and Foremost: Take care of
            yourself. Decide if it’s worth your time. The burden does
            not rest on your shoulders! Remove yourself if
            possible/necessary. You don’t owe anyone anything at the
            expense of your mental health. / Second: If you do decide to
            engage, practice some of these tips to avoid overexertion
            for the sake of educating: Refer to a friendly Google search
            of the concept in question; Call in professors and white
            peers to help educate their peer(s); Charge for your
            services. If you’ve decided you’re going to do it, at least
            get paid; Visit your designated [dean of students on campus]
            to talk about ways to address the mental toll.”<br>
            <br>
            The guide addressed to white students, rather than
            discussing the ways one can undergo “emotional labor,” asks
            “How do I know I’m causing someone emotional labor? Ask
            yourself these questions: Could I have Googled the answer
            but I chose not to? Do I find myself in a situation where
            people of color or people from a marginalized group are
            educating me? What power dynamics are at play? Do I find
            myself getting defensive? Are people telling me I’m causing
            them emotional labor?” The message to white students ends by
            listing options for “What can I do about [causing others
            emotional labor]?” The poster states that white students
            should “Be mindful of your place and position. Google it!
            Seek community of white people who are educating
            themselves/thinking about social justice issues. Compensate
            the labor you caused. Educate yourself, take advantage of
            ethnic studies courses, the internet, and SCORE [Scripps
            Communities of Resources and Empowerment] . Take ownership
            for the harm you caused. Do better next time!”<br>
            <br>
            Neither the Scripps College nor the RAs whose email
            addresses are listed on the posters responded to requests
            for comment.<br>

              <br>
            </b>Paramotor gear for powered paragliding is life &amp;
            death important. Getting the right gear makes all the
            difference in the world. In a sport where there is no
            license or requirements or regulation the buyer must use
            their intelligence to see the huge differences between gear
            made just to sell stuff and what gear the best pilots in the
            world fly and put their own children on.<br>
            <br>
            The Flat Top is currently the only paramotor on the market
            to have all the WPPGA recommended safety standards. Things
            like protection from the prop, face plant protection,
            crumple zone, handless seating and other features you would
            think are just common sense but sadly that sense isn't so
            common. The Flat Top paramotor is the only unit that has all
            the recommended safety standards. Most other units don't
            even have ANY of them. While injuries &amp; deaths happen
            over and over and over on all the same gear out there it
            just makes the sport look bad when in fact it is actually
            incredibly safe if you just get the right gear and training.<br>
            <br>
            They real key to cutting through the piles of new or
            inexperienced pilots making less than expert recommendations
            on gear selection is to first find the very best pilot.
            SUPERDELL is without question the best paramotoring pilot in
            the history of the sport. With countless videos of him out
            there doing things no other pilots in the sport can do it
            makes it very easy and clear who truly knows what they are
            talking about. It is best to follow the advice of those you
            want to become like and SUPERDELL recommends the Flat Top
            paramotors and Dominator paraglider. Not only does he
            recommend it but that is the gear he chooses to put his own
            children on. You can imagine a good father is not going to
            put their own children on gear they don't truly believe in.<br>

            microscopy-related techniques have been used to investigate,
            at the nanoscale, how the polycrystallization of an
            Al2O3-based gate stack, after a thermal annealing process,
            affects the variability of its electrical properties. The
            impact of an electrical stress on the electrical conduction
            and the charge trapping of amorphous and polycrystalline
            Al2O3 layers have been also analyzed.<br>

            The cold exterminated all of them<br>
            <br>
            Through age determinations that are using the radioactive
            decay of uranium, scientists have discovered that one of the
            greatest mass extinctions was due to an ice age and not to a
            warming of Earth temperature.<br>
            <br>
            The Earth has known several mass extinctions over the course
            of its history. One of the most important happened at the
            Permian-Triassic boundary 250 million years ago. Over 95% of
            marine species disappeared and, up until now, scientists
            have linked this extinction to a significant rise in Earth
            temperatures. But researchers from the University of Geneva
            (UNIGE), Switzerland, working alongside the University of
            Zurich, discovered that this extinction took place during a
            short ice age which preceded the global climate warming.
            It’s the first time that the various stages of a mass
            extinction have been accurately understood and that
            scientists have been able to assess the major role played by
            volcanic explosions in these climate processes. This
            research, which can be read in Scientific Reports,
            completely calls into question the scientific theories
            regarding these phenomena, founded on the increase of CO2 in
            the atmosphere, and paves the way for a new vision of the
            Earth’s climate history.<br>
            <br>
            Teams of researchers led by Professor Urs Schaltegger from
            the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the
            Faculty of Science of the UNIGE and by Hugo Bucher, from the
            University of Zürich, have been working on absolute dating
            for many years. They work on determining the age of minerals
            in volcanic ash, which establishes a precise and detailed
            chronology of the earth’s climate evolution. They became
            interested in the Permian-Triassic boundary, 250 million
            years ago, during which one of the greatest mass extinctions
            ever took place, responsible for the loss of 95% of marine
            species. How did this happen? for how long marine
            biodiversity stayed at very low levels ?...<br>

            ALTA REport ( March 2017 ) notes ( excerpt ) :</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          "Further sets that DO seem to more specifically California
          focused are being supported by 'flooding over roads',
          'buildings awash on lower floors', and 'urban centers with
          boats floating over roadways'. Many of these sets are
          describing 'urban' and 'suburban' areas along the 'central
          valley' being 'flooded' with 'many homes' and 'buildings'
          suffering 'devastation'. The data sets have imagery of large
          numbers of 'small boats' that are 'active across the waters'.
          The depressing part of this set is magnified as the 'boats'
          are going to be 'necessary' for 'months'.<br>
          <br>
          "We have new sets for 'diving on city center streets' in order
          to 'recover valuables' from under the 'flood waters'. We have
          'divers' being required by 'government' to 'work emergency
          problems'. These sets are describing 'several hundreds of
          miles' of 'flood' and 'damage'. The data has 'rivers washing
          away' large sections of 'supporting banks' and 'levees' such
          that the 'landscape' is 'totally changed' with 'new river
          beds', and 'new lakes'...<br>
          <br>
          "The 'new (west coast) weather patterns' are forecasting that
          the 'storms' will be 'so regular' as to be 'scrubbing off
          hillsides', 'moving houses', and of course, causing
          'flooding'. The 'flooding' words are also containing
          supporting sets for 'inland seas', and 'lakes' being 'filled'.
          Many new sets for 'displaced persons', and 'diaspora' as well
          as 'evacuations', and 'planned relocation (of) communities'.
          These latter are within the longer term value types...<br>
          <br>
          "New data sets with 'california' as a central geographic
          reference are showing that the 'flooding' forecast to cause
          problems over March of 2017 will also include 'high tech
          firms'. There are data sets going to the idea that 'flooding'
          will 'breach' the 'protective sleeves' and cause 'global
          internet problems'. These sets are forecasting that 'flooding'
          will be 'filling up' the 'work areas' for 'large scale routing
          equipment' for some of the 'telephone companies' that will in
          turn cause 'wide spread internet failures'. The new sets have
          added support for 'flooding' being 'impacting' to the point of
          'emergency operations' having to be 'activated'. Other sets
          have 'unprepared companies', many described as 'global head
          quarters' being 'evacuated' not because of 'flooding' at their
          buildings, but rather due to the 'loss of services' including
          'electrical', 'potable water', 'sewage', and 'internet'. This
          is described as being an 'on-going problem' that will extend
          out into Spring. This is indicated to bring very large
          economic and 'dollar' impacts. Other 'financial problems' from
          the 'flooding' in California are forecast to include 'banking
          assets collapse' as 'thousands' of 'properties' including
          'houses', and 'commercial buildings', and 'production
          facilities', and 'growing lands' are hit by 'disaster'. These
          sets have a very large economic impacts with long duration
          values. If these sets are accurate, the forecast is that the
          'environment changes', both 'physical', and 'financial' for
          'California' will persist for decades. The 'financial impacts'
          are also showing as affecting 'national food supply' for years
          from the 'damage' that has already been sustained.<br>
          <br>
          The forecast within the new data is for at least 7/seven years
          of 'financial problems' that will be directly related to the
          'unfolding flooding situation' this year...<br>

          <br>
          Researchers at NC State have developed a way to print liquid
          metals into 3D structures at room temperature. The structures
          are stabilized by a thin oxide 'skin' that forms on the liquid
          metal. The approaches shown here represent new ways to direct
          write metals in 3D. In addition, the resulting components can,
          in principle, self-heal ( "Self-healing stretchable
          wires"&nbsp;&nbsp;

              cryopreserved tissues;</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Although scientists have been able to successfully preserve
          organs cooled at ultra-low temperatures, they have had less
          success in thawing them out without causing cracks in the
          fragile tissues.<br>
          <br>
          To address this issue, researchers at the University of
          Minnesota developed a new heating method using iron oxide
          nanoparticles, which surround the frozen tissues. They act
          like tiny heaters when activated by an external magnetic
          field.<br>
          <br>
          Using this method, the researchers were able to uniformly warm
          frozen animal heart valves and tissues without causing harm to
          the tissues.<br>
          <br>
          "This paper takes the first practical step towards making
          tissue banking a reality," said Caitlin Czajka, an editor at
          Science Translational Medicine, which published the research
          on Tuesday.<br>
          <br>
          Currently, more than 60 percent of donated hearts and lungs
          are thrown out each year because they can only be kept on ice
          for four hours before they deteriorate.<br>
          <br>
          In prior work, teams have succeeded in reheating only about 1
          millilitre of tissue and solution. In the new study, the team
          reheated arteries and heart valves in 50 millilitre vials,
          said study senior author John Bischof, a mechanical
          engineering professor at the University of Minnesota which
          holds two patents on the technology.<br>
          <br>
          "What we found is we could bring these tissues back at very
          rapid rates and we were able to maintain the viability and
          functionality of the tissues," Bischof told reporters on a
          telephone briefing.<br>
          <br>
          After thawing, none of the tissues showed signs of damage and
          the nanoparticles were washed away.<br>

          By placing a propeller in a duct, the efficiency and maximum
          thrust can be increased, sometimes significantly. This video
          explains two of the mechanisms by which these improvements are
          obtained -- namely by reducing the losses due to the tip
          vortex which occurs when a propeller operates in free space
          and also by using an annular wing that harnesses the effects
          documented in Bernoulli's theorum.<br>

      instead of the conventional, dogmatic explanations. The pyramids
      are energy amplifiers which have been sending and receiving
      information through the Sun. The discovery of the Tesla’s Torsion
      Fields above the top of the Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun, travelling
      faster than the speed of light, withholding energy while passing
      through the cosmic bodies, empowers the concept of the existence
      of the Cosmic Internet providing almost instant, intergalactic
      communication in the Universe...<br>
      <br>
      The teams from Croatia, Italy, Finland, Serbia, Germany and other
      countries have discovered, among other, the existence of energy
      beam over the Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun with the frequency of 28
      kHz, which is focused and continuous.<br>
      <br>
      In September 2016, an international team from Serbia, Croatia and
      Slovenia, led by the engineer Goran Marjanovic from Belgrade, went
      one step further. They have mounted the instruments on a drone and
      took it 50 meters above the Bosnian Pyramids. During the flight,
      it went horizontal every 10 meters, on all four sides of the
      world.<br>
      <br>
      The electrical field was measured over the top of the Bosnian
      Pyramid of the Sun. After two months of information processing,
      the engineer Marjanovic had two revolutionary conclusions:<br>
      <br>
      The energy beam over the pyramid top, with the previously
      established radius of 4.5 meters, is expanding in radius and
      getting stronger. It’s strongest at 21.3 meters above the pyramid,
      after what it gets weaker intensity when at 43.3 meters it has the
      same value as at the null point, on the ground. Or, in Engineer
      Marjanovic words:<br>
      <br>
      “The image shows the “E” field signal recording in a horizontal
      flight registered at 43.3 meters in the ninetieth second of the
      flight. The recorded value VRMS (Median Value/Median Square) on
      this “spot” is 156 mV and it is very close to the value
      measurements on the ground at the 0 position, 0 seconds of flight,
      with 150 mV. It is very interesting that during the takeoff (from
      position 0 to 1) the “E” field signal recordings grew along with
      the changes in height and afterwards dropped down to the value it
      had at the position 0. The more detailed description shows that
      the registered intensity of the field is the biggest at the 20th
      second of the flight, during the takeoff, at the reached height of
      21.3 meters. The synthesis of the recorded values and the “E”
      field intensity allocation analysis in vertical and horizontal
      flats allows us to conclude that the energy field above the
      Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun has the shape of an oval, uneven
      ellipsoid with the biggest density of the energy at the height
      similar to the virtual height of the Pyramid. The represented
      “waviness” in relation to the intensity and the orientation, in
      the wave mechanics terminology, would be appropriate with the
      affirmative interferent process terms, i.e. amplitude
      “composition”, and the phases of the particular energy fields, and
      the constitution of “3D Standing Wave”, ie. complex Scalar
      (torsion, axion, spinor, micro leptonic …)”.<br>
      <br>
      For many years, we have wondered about the orientation of this
      energy beam: is it directed towards the particular solar system
      (Orion, Pleiades, Alfa Centauri, etc.) or towards the particular
      planet in another solar system? The Earth’s rotation of 462 m/s
      doesn’t give enough time to focus the beam to a particular cosmic
      object or eventual information transmission. However, the findings
      of Goran Marjanovic’s team gave a completely logical explanation
      for the beam’s direction. Namely, Marjanovic found the following:<br>
      <br>
      “The VRMS analysis of the registered values during the horizontal
      flight, at about 40 meters of height, indicates slightly raised
      values in the south-southwest zone what indicates that the beam is
      slightly inclined in the direction of south-southwest.”<br>
      <br>
      Considering that the measurements were performed at noon and
      during the afternoon it is logical that the energy wave was
      following Sun’s movement. This is convincingly the largest cosmic
      object. Therefore, the communication between the Earth and its
      star is ongoing, during the most of the day.<br>
      <br>
      The research performed by this team lead to the following
      conclusion:<br>
      <br>
      “The 3D structure of the energy fields over the locations
      1-Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun, 2-Bosnian Pyramid of the Moon, 3-The
      Bell Tower Hill, has a similar configuration analogue with the
      scalar field term, in the shape of an oval ellipsoid with the
      maximum density on 21.3, 25 and 13 meters, respectively. The
      represented “waviness” in relation to the intensity and the
      orientation, in the wave mechanics terminology, would be
      appropriate with the affirmative interferent process terms, i.e.
      amplitude “composition”, and the phases of the particular energy
      fields and the constitution of “3D Standing Wave”, ie. complex
      Scalar Wave or Torsion Field...<br>

          significant health issues, tumors</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>by Ethan Huff</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      &nbsp;They’re a popular mealtime beverage for millions of people
      who believe that by drinking them, they’re avoiding the pitfalls
      of sugar consumption. But diet soda pop is neither healthy nor
      safe, as research continues to show that its primary sweetening
      constituent in most cases, aspartame, is a damaging neurotoxin
      that can lead to a host of chronic health issues, including
      cancer.<br>
      <br>
      The largest study of its kind ever conducted on aspartame was put
      together by researchers from the University of Iowa. They looked
      at 60,000 women who consumed aspartame-laden diet beverages over
      the course of 10 years and found that those who consume two or
      more diet drinks per day are significantly more prone than other
      women to develop cardiovascular disease — and to die from it.<br>
      <br>
      The paper compared the health outcomes of women who consume diet
      beverages to those who don’t, observing that those who do are 30
      percent more likely to suffer some kind of cardiovascular event
      such as a heart attack or stroke. Among those who suffer such a
      fate, those who consume aspartame are 50 percent more likely to
      die from it compared to non-diet beverage drinkers.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Ankur Vyas, lead investigator of the study, noted that this is
      one of the largest studies ever to look at aspartame, and that the
      findings are “consistent with some previous data, especially those
      linking diet drinks to metabolic syndrome.”<br>
      <br>
      “On average, women who consumed two or more diet drinks a day were
      younger, more likely to be smokers, and had a higher prevalence of
      diabetes, high blood pressure, and higher body mass index,” the
      paper explained.<br>
      Aspartame, artificial sweeteners make people fat<br>
      <br>
      It is hardly surprising, then, that diet soda sales have continued
      to plummet year after year as research such as this continues to
      emerge. Folks are waking up to the dangers of aspartame and
      switching to healthier alternatives like local honey and stevia
      extract. Not only is aspartame dangerous in these many ways, but
      it doesn’t even do the one thing that most people falsely believe
      it does — help them to lose weight.<br>
      <br>
      There are a number of reasons for this, not the least of which
      include the fact that artificial sweeteners like aspartame do not
      activate the food rewards pathway in the brain that tells people
      that they’re full, and that it’s time to stop eating. Instead,
      diet soda consumers can chug can after can, and bottle after
      bottle, of their favorite chemical-laced soft drink and simply not
      stop.<br>
      <br>
      Aspartame specifically has also been shown in studies to actually
      make people more hungry than if they simply consumed sugar. Since
      anything that tastes sweet enhances appetite, the hunger-promoting
      effects of aspartame end up leading people who consume it to also
      consume other foods — and lots of them!<br>
      <br>
      There is also evidence to suggest that consuming aspartame
      increases fat storage in the body. Since phenylalanine and
      aspartate, the two chemical components of aspartame, interfere
      with insulin and leptin, both of which control how fat is handled
      by the body, their consumption actually causes people to pack on
      more pounds rather than shed them.<br>
      <br>
      And then there’s the science suggesting that aspartame could
      increase the risk of brain tumors. A 1996 study published in the
      Journal of Neuropathology &amp; Experimental Neurology identified
      a strong correlation between aspartame consumption and brain
      tumors in mice, leading the researchers of that study to conclude
      that “there is need for reassessing the carcinogenic potential of
      aspartame.”<br>

      The invention relates to an electrical power generator, comprising
      a first part (1) configured to be located in a fluid and
      configured such that, when said fluid moves, it generates vortices
      in the fluid, so that a lift force is generated on the first part
      (1), which produces an oscillating movement of the first part (1),
      said oscillating movement having an amplitude. The natural
      oscillation frequency of the first part may be adjusted to wind
      speed by means of magnets, which repel each other. Magnets may
      also be used to generate electrical currents in coils. The first

        <br>
        <b>By Marcia Goodrich</b><br>

      <br>
      One of the most promising types of solar cells has a few
      drawbacks. A scientist at Michigan Technological University may
      have overcome one of them.<br>
      <br>
      Dye-sensitized solar cells are thin, flexible, easy to make and
      very good at turning sunshine into electricity. However, a key
      ingredient is one of the most expensive metals on the planet:
      platinum. While only small amounts are needed, at $1,500 an ounce,
      the cost of the silvery metal is still significant.<br>
      <br>
      Yun Hang Hu, the Charles and Carroll McArthur Professor of
      Materials Science and Engineering, has developed a new,
      inexpensive material that could replace the platinum in solar
      cells without degrading their efficiency: 3D graphene.<br>
      <br>
      Regular graphene is a famously two-dimensional form of carbon just
      a molecule or so thick. Hu and his team invented a novel approach
      to synthesize a unique 3D version with a honeycomb-like structure.
      To do so, they combined lithium oxide with carbon monoxide in a
      chemical reaction that forms lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) and the
      honeycomb graphene. The Li2CO3 helps shape the graphene sheets and
      isolates them from each other, preventing the formation of
      garden-variety graphite.&nbsp; Furthermore, the Li2CO3 particles
      can be easily removed from 3D honeycomb-structured graphene by an
      acid.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers determined that the 3D honeycomb graphene had
      excellent conductivity and high catalytic activity, raising the
      possibility that it could be used for energy storage and
      conversion. So they replaced the platinum counter electrode in a
      dye-sensitized solar cell with one made of the 3D honeycomb
      graphene. Then they put the solar cell in the sunshine and
      measured its output.<br>
      <br>
      The cell with the 3D graphene counter electrode converted 7.8
      percent of the sun’s energy into electricity, nearly as much as
      the conventional solar cell using costly platinum (8 percent).<br>
      <br>
      Synthesizing the 3D honeycomb graphene is neither expensive nor
      difficult, said Hu, and making it into a counter electrode posed
      no special challenges.<br>
      <br>
      The research has been funded by the American Chemical Society
      Petroleum Research Fund (PRF-51799-ND10) and the National Science
      Foundation (NSF-CBET-0931587). The article describing the work,

      for consumption during off hours.<br>

      A battery developed in Stanford Professor Hongjie Dai’s lab could
      provide low-cost storage for solar energy. (Image credit: Getty
      Images)<br>
      <br>
      Developed by Stanford chemistry Professor Hongjie Dai and doctoral
      candidate Michael Angell, the battery is nonflammable and contains
      electrodes made from abundant aluminum and graphite. Its
      electrolyte’s main ingredient, urea, is already industrially
      produced by the ton for plant fertilizers.<br>
      <br>
      “So essentially, what you have is a battery made with some of the
      cheapest and most abundant materials you can find on Earth. And it
      actually has good performance,” said Dai. “Who would have thought
      you could take graphite, aluminum, urea, and actually make a
      battery that can cycle for a pretty long time?”<br>
      <br>
      In 2015, Dai’s lab was the first to make a rechargeable aluminum
      battery. This system charged in less than a minute and lasted
      thousands of charge-discharge cycles. The lab collaborated with
      Taiwan’s Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) to power
      a motorbike with this older version, earning Dai’s group and ITRI
      a 2016 R&amp;D 100 Award. However, that version of the battery had
      one major drawback: it involved an expensive electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      The newest version includes a urea-based electrolyte and is about
      100 times cheaper than the 2015 model, with higher efficiency and
      a charging time of 45 minutes. It’s the first time urea has been
      used in a battery. According to Dai, the cost difference between
      the two batteries is “like night and day.” The team recently
      reported its work in Proceedings of the National Academy of
      Sciences.<br>

      Unlike energy derived from fossil fuels, solar energy can
      essentially be harnessed only when the sun is shining. A solar
      panel pumps energy into the electrical grid during daylight hours.
      If that energy isn’t consumed right away, it is lost as heat. As
      the demand for renewable technologies grows, so does the need for
      cheap, efficient batteries to store the energy for release at
      night. Today’s batteries, like lithium-ion or lead acid batteries,
      are costly and have limited lifespans.<br>
      <br>
      Dai and Angell’s battery could provide a solution to the grid’s
      storage problem.<br>
      <br>
      “It’s cheap. It’s efficient. Grid storage is the main goal,”
      Angell said.<br>
      <br>
      According to Angell, grid storage is also the most realistic goal,
      because of the battery’s low cost, high efficiency and long cycle
      life. One kind of efficiency, called Coulombic efficiency, is a
      measurement of how much charge exits the battery per unit of
      charge that it takes in during charging. The Coulombic efficiency
      for this battery is high – 99.7 percent.<br>
      <br>
      Though also efficient, lithium-ion batteries commonly found in
      small electronics and other devices can be flammable. By contrast,
      Dai’s urea battery is not flammable and therefore less risky.<br>
      <br>
      “I would feel safe if my backup battery in my house is made of
      urea with little chance of causing fire,” Dai said.<br>
      <br>
      The group has licensed the battery patents to AB Systems, founded
      by Dai. A commercial version of the battery is currently in
      development.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Future directions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To meet the demands of grid storage, a commercial battery will
      need to last at least ten years. By investigating the chemical
      processes inside the battery, Angell hopes to extend its lifetime.
      The outlook is promising. In the lab, these urea-based aluminum
      ion batteries can go through about 1,500 charge cycles with a
      45-minute charging time.<br>
      <br>
      According to Dai, there is plenty of demand for a grid-suitable
      battery; he receives numerous emails from firms or individuals
      interested in developing aluminum batteries. And with the battery
      now in development, its success rests on the interest of companies
      and consumers.<br>
      <br>
      “With this battery, the dream is for solar energy to be stored in
      every building and every home,” Dai said. “Maybe it will change
      everyday life. We don’t know.”<br>

      There were 2 small tac nukes that went off in Ukraine area last
      week. That is likely where the I-131 is coming from over Europe.
      Israeli news live covered it, at about 14 min the second one goes
      off.Fireball with WHITE cloud rising very high. TNT is black
      smoke, and does not have enough heat to rise that high. Not a
      weapons cache as there were no secondary explosions. This was
      about 2 miles away from the camera from the delay of the BOOM.
      Given the foreground things, it was BIG, much bigger than a 750
      lber. Which would have been BLACK, too.<br>

          Without Burning, Nears Pilot-Scale Development </b><br>
        <br>
        <b>by Pam Frost Gorder</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      COLUMBUS, Ohio—A new form of clean coal technology reached an
      important milestone recently, with the successful operation of a
      research-scale combustion system at Ohio State University. The
      technology is now ready for testing at a larger scale.<br>
      <br>
      For 203 continuous hours, the Ohio State combustion unit produced
      heat from coal while capturing 99 percent of the carbon dioxide
      produced in the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      Liang-Shih Fan, professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering
      and director of Ohio State’s Clean Coal Research Laboratory,
      pioneered the technology called Coal-Direct Chemical Looping
      (CDCL), which chemically harnesses coal’s energy and efficiently
      contains the carbon dioxide produced before it can be released
      into the atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      “In the simplest sense, combustion is a chemical reaction that
      consumes oxygen and produces heat,” Fan said. “Unfortunately, it
      also produces carbon dioxide, which is difficult to capture and
      bad for the environment. So we found a way to release the heat
      without burning. We carefully control the chemical reaction so
      that the coal never burns—it is consumed chemically, and the
      carbon dioxide is entirely contained inside the reactor.”<br>
      <br>
      Dawei Wang, a research associate and one of the group's team
      leaders, described the technology’s potential benefits. "The
      commercial-scale CDCL plant could really promote our energy
      independence. Not only can we use America's natural resources such
      as Ohio coal, but we can keep our air clean and spur the economy
      with jobs," he said.<br>
      <br>
      “We carefully control the chemical reaction so that the coal never
      burns—it is consumed chemically, and the carbon dioxide is
      entirely contained inside the reactor.”<br>
      <br>
      Though other laboratories around the world are trying to develop
      similar technology to directly convert coal to electricity, Fan’s
      lab is unique in the way it processes fossil fuels. The Ohio State
      group typically studies coal in the two forms that are already
      commonly available to the power industry: crushed coal
      “feedstock,” and coal-derived syngas.<br>
      <br>
      The latter fuel has been successfully studied in a second
      sub-pilot research-scale unit, through a similar process called
      Syngas Chemical Looping (SCL).&nbsp; Both units are located in a
      building on Ohio State’s Columbus campus, and each is contained in
      a 25-foot-high insulated metal cylinder that resembles a very tall
      home water heater tank.<br>
      <br>
      No other lab has continuously operated a coal-direct chemical
      looping unit as long as the Ohio State lab did last September. But
      as doctoral student Elena Chung explained, the experiment could
      have continued.<br>
      <br>
      “We voluntarily chose to stop the unit. We actually could have run
      longer, but honestly, it was a mutual decision by Dr. Fan and the
      students. It was a long and tiring week where we all shared
      shifts,” she said.<br>
      <br>
      Fan agreed that the nine-day experiment was a success. “In the two
      years we’ve been running the sub-pilot plants, our CDCL and SCL
      units have achieved a combined 830 operating hours, which clearly
      demonstrates the reliability and operability of our design,” he
      said.<br>
      <br>
      At any one time, the units each produce about 25 thermal
      kilowatts—that is, thermal energy, which in a full-scale power
      plant would be used to heat water and turn the steam-powered
      turbines that create electricity.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers are about to take their technology to the next
      level: a larger-scale pilot plant is under construction at the
      U.S. Department of Energy’s National Carbon Capture Center in
      Wilsonville, AL. Set to begin operations in late 2013, that plant
      will produce 250 thermal kilowatts using syngas.<br>
      <br>
      The key to the technology is the use of tiny metal beads to carry
      oxygen to the fuel to spur the chemical reaction. For CDCL, the
      fuel is coal that’s been ground into a powder, and the metal beads
      are made of iron oxide composites. The coal particles are about
      100 micrometers across—about the diameter of a human hair—and the
      iron beads are larger, about 1.5-2 millimeters across. Chung
      likened the two different sizes to talcum powder and ice cream
      sprinkles, though the mix is not nearly so colorful.<br>
      <br>
      The coal and iron oxide are heated to high temperatures, where the
      materials react with each other. Carbon from the coal binds with
      the oxygen from the iron oxide and creates carbon dioxide, which
      rises into a chamber where it is captured. Hot iron and coal ash
      are left behind. Because the iron beads are so much bigger than
      the coal ash, they are easily separated out of the ash, and
      delivered to a chamber where the heat energy would normally be
      harnessed for electricity. The coal ash is removed from the
      system.<br>
      <br>
      The carbon dioxide is separated and can be recycled or sequestered
      for storage.&nbsp; The iron beads are exposed to air inside the
      reactor, so that they become re-oxidized&nbsp; be used again. The
      beads can be re-used almost indefinitely, or recycled.<br>
      <br>
      Since the process captures nearly all the carbon dioxide, it
      exceeds the goals that DOE has set for developing clean energy.
      New technologies that use fossil fuels should not raise the cost
      of electricity more than 35 percent, while still capturing more
      than 90 percent of the resulting carbon dioxide. Based on the
      current tests with the research-scale plants, Fan and his team
      believe that they can meet or exceed that requirement.<br>

      <br>
      Overheard some alternate energy enthusiasts who were lavishly
      praising Sterling engines as the ultimate solution to low delta-t
      energy recovery.<br>
      <br>
      It quickly became obvious that they did not have the faintest clue
      of the underlying thermodynamics or economics.<br>
      <br>
      To date, the Sterling engine has been one of the largest and most
      monumental engineering ratholes of all times. Here is why...<br>
      <br>
      Carnot Matters -- There is a fundamental and unavoidable law of
      thermodynamics that says the best possible efficiency of any heat
      engine is proportional to the absolute temperature delta fraction.
      Thus your best possible efficiency a 20 degree rise at 70 degree F
      room temperature&nbsp; would be 20/(459+70) = 3.8 percent. And no
      real world system can be even this good. <br>
      <br>
      Efficiency Matters --As efficiency goes down, the size and
      complexity of the energy recovery device will disproportionately
      increase in a hyperbolic or worse manner for a given set of
      recovery values. Which is why absolutely free pv solar panels of
      less than six percent efficiency are totally commercially useless.
      <br>
      <br>
      Amortization Matters -- If your energy recovery device is
      producing an average of two cents worth of electricity per day and
      your total cost of ownership is three cents per day, you have a
      gasoline destroying net energy sink. The longer you run it, the
      more gasoline you destroy<br>
      <br>
      Gotchas Matter -- A Sterling engine needs a special part called a
      regenerator. Regenerators have to be long and thin and short and
      fat. They also have to be very good conductors of heat and
      outstanding insulators. Extreme engineering compromise is needed
      and nobody has come up with a good regeneration solution to date.<br>
