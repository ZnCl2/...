          <div align="center"><b>Prions in Plants? A new concern for
              chronic wasting disease</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Infectious, deformed proteins called prions, known to cause
          chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer, can be taken up by
          plants such as alfalfa, corn, and tomatoes, according to new
          research from the National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC) in
          Madison.<br>
          <br>
          The NWHC’s prion research further demonstrates that stems and
          leaves from tainted plants are infectious when injected into
          laboratory mice. Christopher Johnson, the research biologist
          who conducted the study, writes in the abstract: “Our results
          suggest that prions are taken up by plants and that
          contaminated plants may represent a previously unrecognized
          risk of human, domestic species, and wildlife exposure to
          CWD.”<br>
          <br>
          One of a class of neurological, prion-caused diseases known as
          transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, CWD affects deer by
          causing progressive loss of body condition, behavioral
          changes, excessive salivation, and death. Other prion-caused
          diseases include scrapie in sheep and goats, bovine spongiform
          encephalopathy—or mad cow disease—in cattle, and
          Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans.<br>
          <br>
          While it is thought that CWD is spread through the saliva and
          feces of deer infected with the fatal brain disease, according
          to NWHC researchers and other experts these new findings are
          significant because they reveal a previously unknown potential
          route of exposure.<br>
          <br>
          The disease has also become a pressing issue nationwide: The
          national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has
          identified chronic wasting disease in seventeen states and
          predicts it will spread to other states. CWD was discovered in
          Wisconsin’s deer herd in 2002 and has been found since the
          mid-1990s in northeastern Colorado and southeastern Wyoming.<br>
          <br>
          Courtesy of the Wisconsin Department of Natural ResourcesSoon
          after the discovery of CWD in Wisconsin, the Wisconsin
          Department of Natural Resources embarked on an aggressive
          effort to halt spread of the disease by putting in place
          additional and longer hunting seasons, requiring hunters to
          shoot a female deer before taking a buck, and hiring
          sharpshooters to kill deer.<br>
          <br>
          But the ambitious program grew unpopular with hunters and
          landowners, and the number of hunters participating in the
          state’s annual deer hunt declined. Meanwhile, the disease
          spread.<br>
          <br>
          Current reports by the DNR show that the prevalence of the
          disease has increased in all sex and age classes of deer.
          During the past eleven years, for example, agency data
          estimates the prevalence of CWD in adult males has risen from
          8–10% to more than 20%. And in adult females, the prevalence
          has grown from about 3–4% to about 9%. In a disease hot spot
          in southwestern Wisconsin, CWD prevalence has increased to 27%
          among deer two-and-a-half years or older.<br>
          <br>
          Tami Ryan, who heads the DNR’s Wildlife Health Section, says
          the agency is interested in learning more about Johnson’s
          study. Ryan would like to see more data, especially on whether
          lab animals can become infected by eating tainted plant
          material rather than just via injection.<br>
          <br>
          “I’m also interested in the contamination level,” says Ryan.
          “What is the concentration and frequency of exposure that
          would result in infection? Is this as great a risk as coming
          into contact with another infected animal? A level of risk
          assessment is necessary.” For the moment, she concludes, “I
          don’t hear alarm bells.”<br>
          <br>
          While more than 800 Wisconsin hunters who have consumed
          CWD-tainted venison show no signs of prion brain disease,
          Wisconsin Department of Health Services veterinarian James
          Kazmierczak says that a little-understood molecular species
          barrier prevents CWD prions from making people and cattle
          sick.<br>
          <br>
          But research on how prions affect humans is still ongoing. In
          2004, for example, a CDC study published in the scientific
          journal Emerging Infectious Diseases concluded that the
          transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow
          disease) to humans indicates that “the species barrier may not
          completely protect humans from animal protein diseases.”<br>
          <br>
          The article also cited lab studies in which CWD prions were
          found to infect human prion proteins. Still, the article
          concluded, “limited investigations have not identified strong
          evidence for CWD transmission to humans.”<br>
          <br>
          Another study, led by Marcelo Barria from the Mitchell Center
          for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Brain Disorders at the
          University of Texas and published in the Journal of Biological
          Chemistry in 2011, showed that CWD prions in the laboratory
          can be manipulated over generations to change and become more
          infectious to humans.<br>
          <br>
          “Our findings lead to a new view that the species barrier
          should not be seen as a static process but rather a dynamic
          biological phenomenon that can change over time when prion
          strains mature and evolve,” researchers concluded.<br>
          <br>
          NWHC researcher Christopher Johnson says he is testing whether
          animals can become infected by eating CWD-laden plant tissues,
          noting that his work will address Tami Ryan’s questions about
          the prion concentrations in plants necessary to cause
          infection.<br>
          <br>
          “We’re just scratching the surface here,” says Johnson.<br>

          </div>
          <br>
          &nbsp;The Labor Augsburg MVZ laboratory in Bavaria has blamed
          a high number of tests and time pressure after recording 58
          out of 60 false positives in a week.<br>
          <br>
          Gabriele Schoen, Managing Director of the Labor Augsburg MVZ
          laboratory, told Munich’s daily newspaper Muenchener Merkur
          that it’s not possible for them to constantly “double check”
          tests when they provided a positive result”, as they were
          under pressure and working with a “lack of equipment”.<br>
          <br>
          The laboratory was found to have wrongly diagnosed 58 out of
          60 coronavirus tests it identified as positive during a
          one-week period, after testing samples again following an
          unusual spike in confirmed cases. The false positives raise
          questions around the reliability of the results that are being
          provided in the region, as Germany weighs introducing a new
          lockdown to combat the rising number of coronavirus cases in
          the country....<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>Biosensing plays vital roles in multiple fields, including
          healthcare monitoring, drug screening, disease diagnosis, and
          environmental pollution control. In recent years,
          transistor-based devices have been considered to be valid
          platforms for fast, low-cost sensing of diverse analytes.
          Without additional functionalization, however, these devices
          lack selectivity; several strategies have been developed for
          the direct immobilization of bioreceptors on the transistor
          surface to improve detection capabilities. In this scenario,
          organic transistors have gained attention for their abilities
          to be coupled to biological systems and to detect
          biomolecules. In this Perspective, we discuss recent
          developments in organic-transistor-based biosensors,
          highlighting how their coupling with artificial membranes
          provides a strategy to improve sensitivity and selectivity in
          biosensing applications. Looking at future applications, this
          class of biosensors represents a breakthrough starting point
          for implementing multimodal high-throughput screening
          platforms.<br>

          <br>
          &nbsp;A professor who in an experiment infected himself with
          Covid-19 to become ill with the virus for a second time says
          hopes for herd immunity are overblown.<br>
          <br>
          Dr Alexander Chepurnov, 69, first caught coronavirus on a
          skiing trip to France in February.<br>
          <br>
          After recovering back home in Siberia without requiring
          hospitalisation, he and his team at the Institute of Clinical
          and Experimental Medicine in Novosibirsk launched a study into
          coronavirus antibodies.<br>
          <br>
          They studied 'the way antibodies behaved, how strong they
          were, and how long they stayed in the body' and found they
          decrease rapidly, he said. <br>
          Dr Alexander Chepurnov (pictured), 69, in an experiment
          infected himself with Covid-19 to become ill with the virus
          for a second time and now says hopes for herd immunity are
          overblown<br>
          <br>
          He said: 'By the end of the third month from the moment I felt
          sick, the antibodies were no longer detected.<br>
          <br>
          He decided to examine the probability of reinfection.<br>
          <br>
          In the interests of science, Chepurnov became a human guinea
          pig and deliberately exposed himself to COVID-19 patients
          wearing no protection, he said.<br>
          <br>
          He said: 'My body's defences fell exactly six months after I
          got the first infection. The first sign was a sore throat.'<br>
          <br>
          His second infection was far more serious and he was

          Electrical stimulation of the human cortex, undertaken for
          brain surgery, triggers percepts and feelings. A new study
          documents an ordering principle to these effects: the farther
          removed from sensory input or motor output structures, the
          less likely it is that a region contributes to consciousness.<br>

              continues to grow, options for understanding the content
              and ideas being shared on the platform are lacking. That
              is why we built Transparency.tube. In creating a

                  developed medicine that ‘cancels 100% of Covid-19’
                  with no side-effects </b><br>
              </div>
              <b><br>
              </b>&nbsp;Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro says his
              country has designed “a highly effective antiviral” that
              decimates coronavirus without any side effects. The drug
              will be presented to the WHO for certification, he added.<br>
              <br>
              "I want to say that Venezuela has developed a medicine
              that annihilates 100 percent of the coronavirus," Maduro
              said on Sunday, describing it as a “highly effective
              antiviral.”<br>
              <br>
              It was designed by the Venezuelan Institute for Scientific
              Research (IVIC), which has been working on a cure for the
              virus for the past six months, he noted.<br>
              <br>
              The medicine is based on a molecule called TR-10, which
              was isolated and, when pitted against the virus, proved
              its absolute effectiveness, he claimed.<br>
              <br>
              Maduro said the study has already been reviewed by experts
              and scientists, and will be presented to the World Health
              Organization (WHO) so that it can certify its findings. <br>
              <br>
              As he touted the potential breakthrough in Covid-19
              therapy, Maduro said Venezuela looks forward “to offering
              this treatment to the world,” congratulating the IVIC on
              “this great contribution to humanity.” Mass production of
              the drug will be facilitated through “international
              alliances,” he said, without elaborating.<br>
              <br>
              The newly-developed drug is completely safe, the institute
              claimed, insisting it “does not affect healthy molecules
              in the body” and does not result in any side effects. <br>
              <br>
              The studies were conducted on virus cells isolated from
              Venezuelan coronavirus patients, Gabriela Jiménez, the
              minister of science and technology, said.<br>
              <br>
              The molecule is an ursolic acid derivative, which “has
              shown 100 percent inhibition of virus replication in vitro
              [outside of a living organism],” she said, as cited by EFE

                  Pandemic Influenza in Nonhealthcare Settings—Personal
                  Protective and Environmental Measures</b><br>
                <b>Jingyi Xiao, et al. </b><br>
              </div>
              <b>Abstract</b><br>
              There were 3 influenza pandemics in the 20th century, and
              there has been 1 so far in the 21st century. Local,
              national, and international health authorities regularly
              update their plans for mitigating the next influenza
              pandemic in light of the latest available evidence on the
              effectiveness of various control measures in reducing
              transmission. Here, we review the evidence base on the
              effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical personal protective
              measures and environmental hygiene measures in
              nonhealthcare settings and discuss their potential
              inclusion in pandemic plans. Although mechanistic studies
              support the potential effect of hand hygiene or face
              masks, evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials of
              these measures did not support a substantial effect on
              transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza. We
              similarly found limited evidence on the effectiveness of
              improved hygiene and environmental cleaning. We identified
              several major knowledge gaps requiring further research,
              most fundamentally an improved characterization of the
              modes of person-to-person transmission...<br>
              <br>
              <b>Discussion</b><br>
              In this review, we did not find evidence to support a
              protective effect of personal protective measures or
              environmental measures in reducing influenza transmission.
              Although these measures have mechanistic support based on
              our knowledge of how influenza is transmitted from person
              to person, randomized trials of hand hygiene and face
              masks have not demonstrated protection against
              laboratory-confirmed influenza, with 1 exception (18). We
              identified only 2 RCTs on environmental cleaning and no
              RCTs on cough etiquette.<br>
              <br>
              Hand hygiene is a widely used intervention and has been
              shown to effectively reduce the transmission of
              gastrointestinal infections and respiratory infections
              (26). However, in our systematic review, updating the
              findings of Wong et al. (8), we did not find evidence of a
              major effect of hand hygiene on laboratory-confirmed
              influenza virus transmission (Figure 1). Nevertheless,
              hand hygiene might be included in influenza pandemic plans
              as part of general hygiene and infection prevention.<br>
              <br>
              We did not find evidence that surgical-type face masks are
              effective in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza
              transmission, either when worn by infected persons (source
              control) or by persons in the general community to reduce
              their susceptibility (Figure 2). However, as with hand
              hygiene, face masks might be able to reduce the
              transmission of other infections and therefore have value
              in an influenza pandemic when healthcare resources are
              stretched.<br>
              <br>
              It is essential to note that the mechanisms of
              person-to-person transmission in the community have not
              been fully determined. Controversy remains over the role
              of transmission through fine-particle aerosols (3,46).
              Transmission by indirect contact requires transfer of
              viable virus from respiratory mucosa onto hands and other
              surfaces, survival on those surfaces, and successful
              inoculation into the respiratory mucosa of another person.
              All of these components of the transmission route have not
              been studied extensively. The impact of environmental
              factors, such as temperature and humidity, on influenza
              transmission is also uncertain (47). These uncertainties
              over basic transmission modes and mechanisms hinder the
              optimization of control measures.<br>
              <br>
              In this review, we focused on 3 personal protective
              measures and 1 environmental measure. Other potential
              environmental measures include humidification in dry
              environments (48), increasing ventilation (49), and use of
              upper-room UV light (50), but there is limited evidence to
              support these measures. Further investigations on the
              effectiveness of respiratory etiquette and surface
              cleaning through conducting RCTs would be helpful to
              provide evidence with higher quality; evaluation of the
              effectiveness of these measures targeting specific
              population groups, such as immunocompromised persons,
              would also be beneficial (Table 2). Future
              cost-effectiveness evaluations could provide more support
              for the potential use of these measures. Further research
              on transmission modes and alternative interventions to
              reduce influenza transmission would be valuable in
              improving pandemic preparedness. Finally, although our
              review focused on nonpharmaceutical measures to be taken
              during influenza pandemics, the findings could also apply
              to severe seasonal influenza epidemics. Evidence from RCTs
              of hand hygiene or face masks did not support a
              substantial effect on transmission of laboratory-confirmed
              influenza, and limited evidence was available on other
              environmental measures.<br>

              <div align="center"><b>&nbsp;Researchers have found the
                  secret weapon used by SARS-CoV-2 which makes it so
                  much more infectious than its predecessor SARS-CoV was
                  17 years ago, potentially unlocking new ways to fight
                  the spread of the pandemic.</b><br>
              </div>
              <br>
              Much like the original SARS, SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2
              receptor to access our cells and spread rapidly throughout
              our respiratory systems and beyond. <br>
              <br>
              “The starting point of our study was the question why
              SARS-CoV, a coronavirus that led to a much smaller
              outbreak in 2003, and SARS-CoV-2, spread in such a
              different way even if they use the same main receptor
              ACE2,” says University of Helsinki virologist Ravi Ojha.<br>
              <br>
              Researchers from the Technical University of Munich in
              Germany and the University of Helsinki in Finland examined
              the virus’ spiky coating under an electron microscope and
              compared the genomes of the two viruses.<br>
              <br>
              They found that the novel coronavirus had ‘learned a new
              trick,’ so to speak, picking up a kind of ‘hook’ used by
              other nasty pathogens like Ebola, HIV and avian flu, to
              latch onto human tissues more aggressively. <br>
              <br>
              They discovered that the coronavirus uses this ‘grappling
              hook’ on the receptor neuropilin-1, which lines the nerve
              tissues inside the human nasal cavity. <br>
              <br>
              To confirm their suspicions, the researchers then deployed
              monoclonal antibodies (an antibody made by cloning white
              blood cells), which they engineered to block access to
              neuropilin-1. <br>
              <br>
              They then introduced ‘pseudoviruses,’ designed to mimic
              SARS-CoV-2 behaviors but without any of the intense
              self-replication properties, which found it far more
              difficult to infect cells when the neuropilin-1 was
              blocked.<br>
              <br>
              “If you think of ACE2 as a door lock to enter the cell,
              then neuropilin-1 could be a factor that directs the virus
              to the door,” says Balistreri. <br>
              <br>
              Given the density of neuropilin-1 along nerve tissues in
              the human nasal cavity, it essentially acts as a welcoming
              party for SARS-CoV-2 which then only needs to flash its
              ACE2 before it can engage in a free-for-all inside the
              human body, with destructive consequences witnessed the
              world over. <br>
              <br>
              Experiments on mice confirmed the receptor’s role in the
              virus gaining access to their nervous system, though a
              direct link to the traumatic damage witnessed on human
              brains after severe Covid-19 has yet to be properly
              studied. <br>
              <br>
              “We could determine that neuropilin-1, at least under the
              conditions of our experiments, promotes transport into the
              brain, but we cannot make any conclusion whether this is
              also true for SARS-CoV-2,” says neurologist Mika Simons
              from the Technical University of Munich.<br>
              <br>
              The researchers have begun exploring ways to interrupt the
              connection between the virus and neuropilin-1, with a view
              to making it less infectious, with promising early results
              and laboratory tests already underway.<br>

              On 22–23 June 2001, the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian
              Biodefense Strategies, in collaboration with the Center
              for Strategic and International Studies, the Analytic
              Services Institute for Homeland Security, and the Oklahoma
              National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of
              Terrorism, held a senior-level exercise entitled “Dark
              Winter” that simulated a covert smallpox attack on the
              United States. The first such exercise of its kind, Dark
              Winter was constructed to examine the challenges that
              senior-level policy makers would face if confronted with a
              bioterrorist attack that initiated outbreaks of highly
              contagious disease. The exercise was intended to increase
              awareness of the scope and character of the threat posed
              by biological weapons among senior national security
              experts and to bring about actions that would improve
              prevention and response strategies.<br>
              <br>
              On 22–23 June 2001, the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian
              Biodefense Strategies [1], in collaboration with the
              Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) [2],
              the Analytic Services (ANSER) Institute for Homeland
              Security [3], and the Oklahoma National Memorial Institute
              for the Prevention of Terrorism [4], held a senior-level
              exercise entitled “Dark Winter,” which simulated a covert
              smallpox attack on the United States. Tara O'Toole and
              Thomas Inglesby of the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian
              Biodefense Strategies and Randy Larsen and Mark DeMier of
              ANSER were the principal designers, authors, and
              controllers of the Dark Winter exercise. John Hamre of
              CSIS initiated and conceived of an exercise in which
              senior former officials would respond to a national
              security crisis caused by use of a biological weapon. Sue
              Reingold of CSIS managed administrative and logistical
              arrangements for the exercise. General Dennis Reimer of
              the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism
              provided substantial funding for exercise.<br>
              <br>
              The first such exercise of its kind, Dark Winter was
              undertaken to examine the challenges that senior-level
              policy makers would face if confronted with a bioterrorist
              attack that initiated outbreaks of highly contagious
              disease. The exercise was intended to increase awareness
              of the scope and character of the threat posed by
              biological weapons among senior national security experts
              and to catalyze actions that would improve prevention and
              response strategies...<br>

              The Dark Winter exercise portrayed a fictional scenario
              depicting a covert smallpox attack on U.S. citizens. The
              scenario is set in 3 successive National Security Council
              (NSC) meetings which take place over 2 weeks. Former
              senior government officials played the roles of NSC
              members; media representatives were among the observers
              and played journalists during the mock press conferences.
              The exercise was held at Andrews Air Force Base,
              Washington, DC<br>

              This report documents in detail how Dr. Anthony Fauci,
              head of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious
              Diseases (NIAID), has been the major force behind a series
              of research activities and other government actions that
              enabled the Chinese Communist Party to create lethal
              SARScoronaviruses,leading to the release of SARS-CoV-2from
              the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Fauci continues to cover
              for the Chineseand for himself, denying the origin of
              SARS-CoV-2, and delaying and thwarting worldwide attempts
              to deal rationally with the pandemic...<br>

                  </font></b><font color="#000000">On election day, you
                  will have to make a choice between two political
                  parties and two presidential candidates.&nbsp; Several
                  days later you will in all probability have to make
                  another choice.&nbsp; In the case of a closely
                  contested election, whose side will you take?<br>
                  <br>
                  No matter who wins, the losing side will very likely
                  charge that the election was stolen.&nbsp; And if, the
                  losing side is the Republicans, that claim could very
                  well be true.<br>
                  <br>
                  If Republicans produce solid evidence that the
                  election was, in fact, stolen, what then? Should they,
                  nevertheless, graciously step aside in favor of the
                  illegitimate “winners” for the sake of peace, and in
                  the hope that the American system will eventually
                  right itself.&nbsp; After all, our constitutional
                  system of checks and balances was designed to prevent
                  one faction in government from acquiring excessive
                  power.<br>
                  <br>
                  But what if this is the last chance election?&nbsp;
                  What if one side has no intention of respecting the
                  Constitution or of upholding the system of checks and
                  balances?&nbsp; What if one side wants to pack the
                  Supreme Court and give voting rights to Washington
                  D.C, Puerto Rico, and any other U.S. territory likely
                  to vote Democrat? What if future elections are no
                  freer than the sham elections held in totalitarian
                  societies?<br>
                  <br>
                  Our system of government assumes that all parties
                  adhere to the same basic principles—life, liberty,
                  equality under the law, freedom of speech, freedom of
                  religion.&nbsp; It’s understood, of course, that
                  different people will apply those principles in
                  different ways.&nbsp; The system is designed for
                  differences of opinion.&nbsp; But is it designed for
                  widespread betrayal? What if one faction or party
                  simply rejects those principles?&nbsp; What if, for
                  example, a political party only gives lip service to
                  freedom of speech while actively working to suppress
                  it? What if government representatives no longer
                  believe in the oath of office they took—”to support
                  and defend the Constitution of the United States
                  against all enemies foreign and domestic”?<br>
                  <br>
                  Generation after generation of Americans have assumed
                  that we would never come to that point.&nbsp; But
                  we’re at that point now.<br>
                  <br>
                  Some suggest that we’re on the brink of a coup.&nbsp;
                  That is quite likely.&nbsp; But the big coup that will
                  transform our government and our lives beyond
                  recognition has been built on the foundation of
                  numerous smaller coups.&nbsp; Of course, “smaller” is
                  not exactly the right word.&nbsp; Some of these
                  coups—such as the takeover of our educational system
                  from kindergarten through graduate school—have been
                  massive.&nbsp; While most Americans were looking the
                  other way, left-wing educators managed to steal the
                  affections and loyalties of our children.&nbsp; As
                  President Trump put it in his July 4th Mount Rushmore
                  speech: “Against every law of society and nature, our
                  children are taught in school to hate their own
                  country and to believe that the men and women who
                  built it were not heroes, but were villains.”<br>
                  <br>
                  In recent years, we have also witnessed two other
                  large-scale coups—the takeover of the mainstream media
                  by people who reject the American heritage, and the
                  takeover of social media by a collection of “woke”
                  billionaire technocrats who look upon freedom of
                  speech as an outmoded relic of the past.&nbsp;
                  However, the biggest coup of all, thus far, is the
                  takeover of the Democratic Party by the revolutionary
                  left.&nbsp; Should the Democrats win the election, the
                  245-year-old American experiment in liberty will come
                  to an end—perhaps gradually at first, but then with
                  increasing speed.<br>
                  <br>
                  When the full force of the new revolutionary order is
                  felt, people won’t know what hit them.&nbsp; They
                  won’t know because they don’t have the historical
                  context to understand that the taking away of
                  liberties is what revolutionary leftists always
                  do.&nbsp; Younger Americans will know everything about
                  the danger of climate change and the virtue of wearing
                  a mask, but they will have learned precious little
                  about the Soviet gulags, the Chinese communist
                  re-education camps, and the imprisonment and torture
                  of dissidents in communist Cuba.<br>
                  <br>
                  There is no guarantee that the American system of
                  government and the American way of life will
                  survive.&nbsp; We cannot, as columnist Tony Blankely
                  observed 15 years ago, “assume that the benign trends
                  of the recent past will continue.”&nbsp; Instead, he
                  cautioned, “we need to think in terms of when current
                  trends will stop—and what will follow them.”<br>
                  <br>
                  Of course, we should not think of the American
                  experiment with self-government as a trend.&nbsp;
                  Rather, it is one of history’s most splendid
                  achievements—a priceless gift to succeeding
                  generations. We must be prepared, however, for the
                  possibility that it can come to an end, or rather, be
                  put to an end.&nbsp; And we must, as Blankely warned,
                  think about what will follow.&nbsp; We may have to
                  start thinking about that future in as little as two
                  weeks.<br>

                  Humans possess a salamander-like ability to regrow
                  cartilage in joints, contrary to popular belief.<br>
                  <br>
                  Researchers have found potent molecules in the body
                  which encourage the growth of new proteins in the
                  connective tissue.<br>
                  <br>
                  The process is similar to that of salamanders,
                  lizard-like amphibians famed for their remarkable
                  ability to recover from damage to their body.<br>
                  <br>
                  Scientists hope the 'inner salamander' may lead to
                  treatments for osteoarthritis, a painful condition
                  that is currently incurable. <br>
                  <br>
                  The findings could even pave the way for treatments
                  which help a human grow their own limb back after
                  injury, the Duke University scientists said.<br>
                  <br>
                  Cartilage that covers bones is worn down in
                  osteoarthritis patients over the years, resulting in
                  the bones rubbing against each other. <br>
                  <br>
                  Cartilage repair is currently very limited because
                  injuries are difficult to heal due to there being no
                  blood supply to the tissue.<br>
                  <br>
                  Treatment for osteoarthritis, which affects around
                  nine million people in the UK and 30million in the US,
                  revolve around lifestyle changes to relieve pain. <br>
                  <br>
                  Experts believe a superficial boost of the molecules
                  may speed recovery in patients, preventing the
                  thinning of cartilage and therefore reducing joint
                  pain. <br>
                  <br>
                  The proteins are produced at different speeds in hips,
                  knees and ankles, which may explain why osteoarthritis
                  (OA) is most common in hips.<br>
                  <br>
                  Dr Ming-Fend Hsueh and his team looked at the age of
                  proteins in collagen - a main component of cartilage -
                  in 18 tissue samples of people with OA. <br>
                  <br>
                  They were able to spot which proteins were new by
                  looking at how many amino acid conversions they had -
                  the more there are, the older the protein is. <br>
                  <br>
                  The findings, published in the medical journal Science
                  Advances, showed the age of cartilage largely depended
                  on where it was in the body.<br>
                  Scientists then found molecules called microRNA drive
                  the creation of new proteins inside human cartilage -
                  the same as in animals. MicroRNA works by silencing a
                  messenger RNA, which then inhibits new collagen
                  production by controlling gene expression<br>

                  <b>WHAT ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS FOR KNEE
                    OSTEOARTHRITIS?</b><b><br>
                  </b><br>
                  The five most effective short-term pain-relievers for
                  knee oestoarthritis (OA) are, in order:<br>
                  <br>
                  1) Cortisone injections<br>
                  2) Ibuprofen<br>
                  3) Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections <br>
                  4) Naproxen <br>
                  5) Celecoxib<br>
                  <br>
                  Yet, naproxen is the best overall remedy to both
                  improve joint function and minimise discomfort. <br>
                  <br>
                  Hyaluronic acid (HA) injections appear to be
                  relatively ineffective at relieving pain or boosting
                  knee function in OA sufferers.<br>
                  <br>
                  The research was carried out by the non-profit health
                  system Dartmouth-Hitchcock, New England. <br>
                  <br>
                  Cartilage from the ankle is young, whereas the
                  connective tissue is older in the knee and oldest in
                  the hips.&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  It could explain why those with knee and hip joint
                  injuries face the longest road of recovery, while
                  those with ankle injuries spring back
                  quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  This correlation between the age of human cartilage
                  and its location in the body also reflects certain
                  animals, including zebrafish, African fresh water fish
                  and lizards.<br>
                  <br>
                  They regenerate limbs at faster rates at the furthest
                  tips, including the ends of their legs or tails.<br>
                  <br>
                  Scientists then found molecules called microRNA drive
                  the creation of new proteins inside human cartilage -
                  the same as in animals.<br>
                  <br>
                  MicroRNAs are found in higher levels in animals that
                  are known for limb, fin or tail repair, such as
                  salamanders.<br>
                  <br>
                  Again, the microRNA activity varied significantly by
                  its location - it was highest in ankles, compared to
                  knees and hips.<br>
                  <br>
                  MicroRNA works by silencing a messenger RNA, which
                  then inhibits new collagen production by controlling
                  gene expression.&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  Discussing the discovery that cartilage can be regrown
                  in joints, Dr Hsueh said: 'We call it our "inner
                  salamander" capacity.<br>
                  <br>
                  'We were excited to learn the regulators of
                  regeneration in the salamander limb appear to also be
                  the controllers of joint tissue repair in the human
                  limb.'<br>
                  <br>
                  Senior author Dr Virginia Byers Kraus said: 'We
                  believe that an understanding of this
                  "salamander-like" regenerative capacity in humans, and
                  the critically missing components of this regulatory
                  circuit, could provide the foundation for new
                  approaches to repair joint tissues and possibly whole
                  human limbs.<br>
                  <br>
                  'We believe we could boost these regulators to fully
                  regenerate degenerated cartilage of an arthritic
                  joint. <br>
                  <br>
                  'If we can figure out what regulators we are missing
                  compared with salamanders, we might even be able to
                  add the missing components back and develop a way
                  someday to regenerate part or all of an injured human
                  limb.<br>
                  <br>
                  'We believe this is a fundamental mechanism of repair
                  that could be applied to many tissues, not just
                  cartilage.'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

                  </font></b><font color="#000000">Nanotechnology is the
                  creation of functional materials, devices and systems
                  at atomic and molecular scales (1-100 nm), where
                  properties differ significantly from those at a larger
                  scale. The use of nanotechnology and nanomaterials in
                  medical research is growing rapidly. Recently,
                  nanotechnologic developments in microbiology have
                  gained importance in the field of chemotherapy.
                  Bacterial strains that are resistant to current
                  antibiotics have become serious public health problems
                  that raise the need to develop new bactericidal
                  materials. Metal oxide nanoparticles, especially
                  TiO(2) and Ag(2)O nanoparticles, have demonstrated
                  significant antibacterial activity. Therefore, it is
                  thought that this property of metal oxide
                  nanoparticles could effectively be used as a novel
                  solution strategy. In this review, we focus on the
                  unique properties of nanoparticles, their mechanism of
                  action as antibacterial agents and recent studies in
                  which the effects of visible and UV-light induced
                  TiO(2) and Ag(2)O nanoparticles on drug-resistant
                  bacteria have been documented. In addition, from to
                  previous results of our studies, antileishmanial
                  effects of metal oxide nanoparticles are also
                  demonstrated, indicating that metal oxide
                  nanoparticles can also be effective against eukaryotic
                  infectious agents. Conversely, despite their
                  significant potential in antimicrobial applications,
                  the toxicity of metal oxide nanoparticles restricts
                  their use in humans. However, recent studies infer
                  that metal oxide nanoparticles have considerable
                  potential to be the first-choice for antibacterial and
                  antiparasitic applications in the future, provided
                  that researchers can bring new ideas in order to cope
                  with their main problem of toxicity.<br>

                    SUMMARY<br>
                  </font></b><font color="#000000">As fuel efficiency
                  requirements increase, the transportation industry
                  continues to seek light-weight metals to use in
                  structural components. Magnesium shows promise with
                  its high strength-to-weight ratio and natural
                  abundance. Unfortunately, conventional methods to
                  extrude the light-weight metal consume large amounts
                  of energy, are costly because they use rare-earth
                  elements, and frequently result in inconsistent or
                  non-uniform internal structures that cause problems in
                  strength and reliability. PNNL’s shear-assisted
                  processing and extrusion (ShAPE™) process overcomes
                  these challenges to create high-strength structures
                  from harder metals and metal alloys. <br>

                  to kill bacteria and roundworm after just 5 minutes —
                  they all survived. Even after the radiation dose was
                  upped four times, about 60% of the reddish-brown bears
                  still lived for more than 30 days...<br>

                  nanoparticle assembly methods can serve as ideal
                  models to explore the fundamentals of homogeneous
                  crystallization phenomena, as interparticle
                  interactions can be readily tuned to modify crystal
                  nucleation and growth. However, heterogeneous
                  crystallization at interfaces is often more
                  challenging to control, as it requires that both
                  interparticle and particle–surface interactions be
                  manipulated simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate how
                  programmable DNA hybridization enables the formation
                  of single-crystal Winterbottom constructions of
                  substrate-bound nanoparticle superlattices with
                  defined sizes, shapes, orientations and degrees of
                  anisotropy. Additionally, we show that some crystals
                  exhibit deviations from their predicted Winterbottom
                  structures due to an additional growth pathway that is
                  not typically observed in atomic crystals, providing
                  insight into the differences between this model system
                  and other atomic or molecular crystals. By precisely
                  tailoring both interparticle and particle–surface
                  potentials, we therefore can use this model to both
                  understand and rationally control the complex process
                  of interfacial crystallization.<br>

                  While SARS-CoV-2 is a rampant virus that can cause
                  severe problems in vulnerable individuals, the real
                  pandemic - the underlying cause that makes people
                  susceptible to complications from the infection in the
                  first place - is poor metabolic health<br>
                  <br>
                  Aside from old age, obesity has been identified as one
                  of the primary risk factors for being hospitalized
                  with COVID-19 - doubling the risk of hospitalization
                  in patients under the age of 60 in one study&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  One hypothesis for why obesity is worsening COVID-19
                  has to do with the fact that obesity causes chronic
                  inflammation. Having more pro-inflammatory cytokines
                  in circulation increases your risk of experiencing a
                  cytokine storm<br>
                  <br>
                  Insulin resistance is another top risk factor for
                  COVID-19 that worsens outcomes and increases your risk
                  of death<br>
                  <br>
                  There are five primary parameters of metabolic health:
                  waist circumference, insulin sensitivity, blood
                  pressure, and triglyceride and HDL levels. Having
                  three or more abnormal parameters is indicative of
                  metabolic syndrome...<br>

              breakthrough has only been achieved using a carbonaceous
              sulphur hydride (combination of carbon, sulphur and
              hydrogen, crushed using a diamond anvil at 270 gigapascals
              or two million times standard atmospheric pressure).<br>
              <br>
              As a result, the superconductive materials only measure

              <br>
              Climate change has been a perplexing problem for years. In
              Dark Winter, author John L. Casey, a former White House
              national space policy advisor, NASA headquarters
              consultant, and space shuttle engineer tells the truth
              about ominous changes taking place in the climate and the
              Sun.<br>
              <br>
              Casey’s research into the Sun’s activity, which began
              almost a decade ago, resulted in discovery of a solar
              cycle that is now reversing from its global warming phase
              to that of dangerous global cooling for the next thirty
              years or more. This new cold climate will dramatically
              impact the world’s citizens. In Dark Winter, he provides
              evidence of the following:<br>
              <br>
               The end of global warming<br>
               The beginning of a solar hibernation,” a historic

                  Two dimensionless fundamental physical constants, the
                  fine structure constant α and the proton-to-electron
                  mass ratio mpme<br>
                  , are attributed a particular importance from the
                  point of view of nuclear synthesis, formation of heavy
                  elements, planets, and life-supporting structures.
                  Here, we show that a combination of these two
                  constants results in a new dimensionless constant that
                  provides the upper bound for the speed of sound in
                  condensed phases, vu. We find that vuc=α(me2mp)12,
                  where c is the speed of light in vacuum. We support
                  this result by a large set of experimental data and
                  first-principles computations for atomic hydrogen. Our
                  result expands the current understanding of how
                  fundamental constants can impose new bounds on
                  important physical properties.<br>

                  &nbsp;The following is a transcript of the highlights
                  (by Henna Maria) from Dr. Margarite Griesz-Brisson’s
                  recent extremely pressing video message, that was
                  translated on-air from German into English by Claudia
                  Stauber. Video at the end of the transcript.<br>
                  <br>
                  Dr. Margarite Griesz-Brisson MD, PhD is a Consultant
                  Neurologist and Neurophysiologist with a PhD in
                  Pharmacology, with special interest in
                  neurotoxicology, environmental medicine,
                  neuroregeneration and neuroplasticity. This is what
                  she has to say about masks and their effects on our
                  brains:<br>
                  <br>
                  “The rebreathing of our exhaled air will without a
                  doubt create oxygen deficiency and a flooding of
                  carbon dioxide. We know that the human brain is very
                  sensitive to oxygen depravation. There are nerve cells
                  for example in the hippocampus, that can’t be longer
                  than 3 minutes without oxygen – they cannot survive.
                  The acute warning symptoms are headaches, drowsiness,
                  dizziness, issues in concentration, slowing down of
                  the reaction time – reactions of the cognitive system.<br>
                  <br>
                  However, when you have chronic oxygen depravation, all
                  of those symptoms disappear, because you get used to
                  it. But your efficiency will remain impaired and the
                  undersupply of oxygen in your brain continues to
                  progress.<br>
                  <br>
                  We know that neurodegenerative diseases take years to
                  decades to develop. If today you forget your phone
                  number, the breakdown in your brain would have already
                  started 20 or 30 years ago.<br>
                  <br>
                  While you’re thinking, that you have gotten used to
                  wearing your mask and rebreathing your own exhaled
                  air, the degenerative processes in your brain are
                  getting amplified as your oxygen deprivation
                  continues.<br>
                  <br>
                  The second problem is that the nerve cells in your
                  brain are unable to divide themselves normally. So in
                  case our governments will generously allow as to get
                  rid of the masks and go back to breathing oxygen
                  freely again in a few months, the lost nerve cells
                  will no longer be regenerated. What is gone is gone.<br>
                  <br>
                  [..]I do not wear a mask, I need my brain to think. I
                  want to have a clear head when I deal with my
                  patients, and not be in a carbon dioxide induced
                  anaesthesia.<br>
                  <br>
                  [..]There is no unfounded medical exemption from face
                  masks because oxygen deprivation is dangerous for
                  every single brain. It must be the free decision of
                  every human being whether they want to wear a mask
                  that is absolutely ineffective to protect themselves
                  from a virus.<br>
                  <br>
                  For children and adolescents, masks are an absolute
                  no-no. Children and adolescents have an extremely
                  active and adaptive immune system and they need a
                  constant interaction with the microbiome of the Earth.
                  Their brain is also incredibly active, as it is has so
                  much to learn. The child’s brain, or the youth’s brain
                  is thirsting for oxygen. The more metabolically active
                  the organ is, the more oxygen it requires.&nbsp; In
                  children and adolescents every organ is metabolically
                  active.<br>
                  <br>
                  To deprive a child’s or an adolescent’s brain from
                  oxygen, or to restrict it in any way, is not only
                  dangerous to their health, it is absolutely criminal.
                  Oxygen deficiency inhibits the development of the
                  brain, and the damage that has taken place as a result
                  CANNOT be reversed.<br>

                  Researchers at the Institute of Industrial Science at
                  The University of Tokyo sifted through experimental
                  data to probe the possibility that supercooled water
                  has a liquid-to-liquid phase transition between
                  disordered and tetrahedrally structured forms. They
                  found evidence of a critical point based on the
                  cooperative formation of tetrahedra, and show its
                  minor role in water’s anomalies. This work shows that
                  water’s special qualities — which are essential for
                  life — originate predominantly from the two-state
                  feature.<br>
                  <br>
                  Liquid water is indispensable for life as we know it,
                  yet many of its properties do not conform with the way
                  other fluids behave. Some of these anomalies, such as
                  water’s maximum density at 4°C and its large heat
                  capacity, have important implications for living
                  organisms. The origin of these features has sparked
                  fierce debates in the scientific community since the
                  time of Röntgen.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now, researchers at The University of Tokyo have
                  utilized a two-state model that posits the dynamical
                  coexistence of two types of molecular structures in
                  liquid water. These are the familiar disordered
                  normal-liquid structure and a locally favored
                  tetrahedral structure. As with many other phase
                  transitions, there may be a “critical point” at which
                  the correlation between tetrahedra takes on a
                  power-law form, which means there will no longer be
                  any “typical” length scale.<br>
                  <br>
                  Using computer simulations of water molecules, along
                  with a comprehensive analysis of experimental
                  structural, thermodynamic, and dynamic data —
                  including X-ray scattering, density, compressibility,
                  and viscosity measurements — the researchers were able
                  to narrow down where a critical point should be, if it
                  exists.<br>
                  <br>
                  “If the formation of tetrahedral structures in liquid
                  water is cooperative under these conditions, then a
                  liquid-liquid phase transition with a critical point
                  is possible,” lead author Rui Shi says.<br>
                  <br>
                  The team showed that this occurs around a temperature
                  of -90°C and a pressure of about 1,700 atmospheres.
                  Experiments in this range are exceedingly difficult:
                  because the water is so far below its normal freezing,
                  ice crystals can quickly form. However, samples can
                  remain liquid in a metastable “supercooled” state at
                  these very high pressures.<br>
                  <br>
                  “We saw evidence that the critical point is real, but
                  its effect is almost negligible in the experimentally
                  accessible region of liquid water because it is too
                  far from the critical point. This means that water’s
                  anomalies come from the two-state feature and not from
                  criticality,” senior author Hajime Tanaka says. The
                  scientists anticipate that this project will lead to
                  the convergence of the long debate on the origin of
                  water’s anomalies and more experimental research to
                  access the second critical point of water.<br>

                sweetener, we put in the cup of war, the coffee, strong
                and military trained of course, as Trump is, he went to
                military academy and knows what is needed. He knows that

                without breaking a few eggs, thus meaning — for true
                change to come, we must first have some constructive

                beautiful in what it can achieve.<br>
                <br>
                Kissinger’s nurse, Hilda, hands over some fine brandy,
                and we get started. Kissinger speaks with a gentle
                lulling voice.<br>
                <br>
                “In our last conversation I spoke of the key to war.
                This key is Iran, and its catalyst was Iraq and Syria.
                One must remember that a conflict with Iran is
                effectively a conflict with Russia and China, and soon
                they will enter the fray, as was prophesied. We, the
                United States have been baiting the Russians and Chinese
                for some time, and slowly they are getting the message.
                They will be forced to make their move sooner than
                later. The supreme land of Eretz Ha’Avot, our
                motherland, our home will fight with all its might now
                to cleanse the Middle East of threats to Israel. This is
                the time to cut out the tumour that has haunted us for
                so long, and Bibi, my protégé, will take no prisoners.
                Rest assured, I was on the phone to him yesterday during
                the Iranian attack on the Golan Heights.”<br>
                <br>
                I ask Kissinger, in the last conversation we had in
                2011, he was quoted as saying “It is just that last
                stepping stone, i.e. Iran which will really tip the
                balance”. Why is Iran such a stepping stone for total
                global warfare?<br>
                <br>
                Kissinger pauses for a few seconds, then rasps quietly,
                yet forcibly.<br>
                <br>
                “The Persians are the ultimate prize in global hegemony.
                Once that line is crossed, then the onus and power play
                increases incrementally. The stepping stone to global
                domination ever closer for the United States. Iran is
                bolstered by Russia and China, and when we take that
                away from them, they will have less global power, they
                will have less global brinkmanship, they will see
                reduced global territorial influence in the region. This
                will cause them to make a move, because if they do not,
                then they are finished as well as the Iranians.<br>
                <br>
                “When General Wesley Clarke said that seven Middle
                Eastern countries were to be taken over, he was not
                joking or fooling around. This is the plan all along,
                and the internet is helping the spread of Western
                culture, Western ways, that these countries aspire to be
                like the West, especially when every day they see how we
                live very well in the West. Their poverty, their
                uncertain living standards, their constant state of war
                for them becomes unbearable. The people will also
                eventually revolt from the inside to dethrone the
                dictators. Look what happened in Libya, in Egypt and
                Tunisia, now in Yemen, and Syria, Iraq as well as the
                failed coup in Turkey. Hearts and minds first, then
                military.”<br>
                <br>
                I ask Dr. Kissinger about Obama’s style of presidency
                compared to Trump’s.<br>
                <br>
                “Essentially one was the sweetener before the cup of
                coffee. Obama’s role, and he played it very well was to
                sweeten up the chumps, and to think they had one over
                us. Naturally, Obama did not know that was his role, and
                he naively believed he was doing the right thing.
                However, we would never give in so easily, and this is
                why we put Trump in. Once we had the sweetener, we put
                in the cup of war, the coffee, strong and military
                trained of course, as Trump is, he went to military
                academy and knows what is needed. He knows that business
                is war, war is business, and he also knows that to
                really finish the job, we must have total war or nothing
                will ever change. You cannot make an omelette without
                breaking a few eggs, thus meaning — for true change to
                come, we must first have some constructive destruction.
                The purge may start with a virus, a few waves will be
                the starter. The moment of truth will be beautiful to
                behold, because war is both things, it is ugly yet
                beautiful in what it can achieve.”<br>
                <br>
                Did Dr. Kissinger know about the EU army, and its
                preparations for war with Russia in 2011? I ask the
                esteemed gentleman that question.<br>
                <br>
                “Yes, of course I knew. Yes, Russia has always been a
                thorn in Europe’s side, and the recent incursion into
                Ukraine was a small but decisive move by Putin. Here is
                a man that I respect highly because he acts decisively,
                yet secretively, almost akin to a grandmaster in chess,
                but we will always outmanoeuvre him with our technology,
                our technique, and we will outmanoeuvre the Chins too.
                We shackled them with communism in the first place,
                therefore they have their hands tied behind their backs
                and are literally too blind to see straight with their
                restrictive ideology. The Russians however have gone
                from communism to authoritarianism and vast amounts of
                mafia corruption, I might add. The Russians are still in
                a post-Soviet stupor, they have still not found
                themselves. As for Europe, they are in a sclerotic state
                as the drums of war are beating ever faster and louder
                every day.”<br>
                <br>
                By this time, Kissinger is getting tired, his head lilts
                slightly forward, and some spittle drools onto his
                dressing gown. The nurse quickly applies a handkerchief
                to his jowls, and I am permitted the final question for
                the session.<br>
                <br>
                I ask Dr. Kissinger about the New World Order that will
                come after the purging is completed. What will that
                entail?<br>
                <br>
                “Most of it, I cannot talk about, and I may not live to
                even see it, however as one of its architects, I can
                reveal a few slivers of information. Essentially the NWO
                means singular. There can only be one winner over all of
                earth’s last remaining resources, and no other factions
                can exist. It also means a controlled population below
                500 million where no other conflict will ever occur
                again. As I mentioned before, it could be a virus that
                suddenly erupts most probably from somewhere in Asia
                that will eventually lead to war through desperation.
                Invariably, the new technological society is in place
                now, because we have the technology and technique as we
                speak now, but the inherent problem is different
                factions, old ways of thinking and overpopulation. Of
                course, this is a very large topic, and I fear I have
                given away too much, but you do the math. If you survive
                into the next stage, you will be a truly esteemed member
                and honoured, illuminated fellow of the New World Order,
                but only if you survive.”<br>
                <br>
                It is with those last words, that Kissinger dismisses
                us, possibly for the last time. We leave him by the
                grand fireplace amongst his books and brandy.<br>
                <br>
                As I leave, I kick myself, as I did not ask him
                specifically how to survive through the next stage, but
                then remember the 2011 interview where he gave a few
                clues. Do you really have to be a billionaire to survive
                the next stage? I think to myself. Of course not, if you
                know how to survive, and are prepared, stocked up,
                anyone can do it, but you just have to get on with it as
                time really is running out...<br>

                Speaking from his luxurious Manhattan apartment, the
                elder statesman, Henry Kissinger, who will be 89 in May,
                is all too forward with his analysis of the current
                situation in the world forum of Geo-politics and
                economics.<br>
                <br>
                “The United States is baiting China and Russia, and the
                final nail in the coffin will be Iran, which is, of
                course, the main target of Israel. We have allowed China
                to increase their military strength and Russia to
                recover from Sovietization, to give them a false sense
                of bravado, this will create an all together faster
                demise for them. We’re like the sharp shooter daring the
                noob to pick up the gun, and when they try, it’s bang
                bang. The coming war will be so severe that only one
                superpower can win, and that’s us folks. This is why the
                EU is in such a hurry to form a complete superstate
                because they know what is coming, and to survive, Europe
                will have to be one whole cohesive state. Their urgency
                tells me that they know full well that the big showdown
                is upon us. O how I have dreamed of this delightful
                moment.<br>
                <br>
                Mr Kissinger then added: “If you are an ordinary person,
                then you can prepare yourself for war by moving to the
                countryside and building a farm, but you must take guns
                with you, as the hordes of starving will be roaming.
                Also, even though the elite will have their safe havens
                and specialist shelters, they must be just as careful
                during the war as the ordinary civilians, because their
                shelters can still be compromised.”<br>
                <br>
                After pausing for a few minutes to collect his thoughts,
                Mr Kissinger, carried on: <br>
                <br>
                “We told the military that we would have to take over
                seven Middle Eastern countries for their resources and
                they have nearly completed their job. We all know what I
                think of the military, but I have to say they have
                obeyed orders superlatively this time. It is just that
                last stepping stone, i.e. Iran which will really tip the
                balance. How long can China and Russia stand by and
                watch America clean up? The great Russian bear and
                Chinese sickle will be roused from their slumber and
                this is when Israel will have to fight with all its
                might and weapons to kill as many Arabs as it can.
                Hopefully if all goes well, half the Middle East will be
                Israeli. Our young have been trained well for the last
                decade or so on combat console games, it was interesting
                to see the new Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 game, which
                mirrors exactly what is to come in the near future with
                its predictive programming. Our young, in the US and
                West, are prepared because they have been programmed to
                be good soldiers, cannon fodder, and when they will be
                ordered to go out into the streets and fight those crazy
                Chins and Russkies, they will obey their orders. Out of
                the ashes we shall build a new society, a new world
                order; there will only be one superpower left, and that
                one will be the global government that wins. Don’t
                forget, the United States, has the best weapons, we have
                stuff that no other nation has, and we will introduce
                those weapons to the world when the time is right.”<br>
                <br>
                End of interview. Our reporter is ushered out of the
                room by Kissinger’s minder.<br>

                an attack as not only possible, but the first choice of
                countries like Iran, Russia, China and North
                Korea.&nbsp; So much so that an Executive Order in 2019
                tasked the Departments of Homeland Security and Energy
                to assess options to increase "resilience" before and

                CIA officials think even a moderate sized nuclear weapon
                detonated at the right altitude above the center of the
                U.S. could knock out power for most of the
                country.&nbsp; With no power, food, water, gasoline and
                telecommunications networks have a likelihood of
                failing.<br>
                <br>
                A Federal Energy Regulatory Commission report suggests
                that if just 9 of 55,000 substations in key locations
                were destroyed and one transformer manufacturer was
                disabled, the entire U.S. grid “would be down for at
                least 18 months, probably longer.”<br>
                <br>
                In 2013, an anonymous attack on a Silicon Valley

            <b>Chiaki Kobayashi, Amanda I. Karakas, Maria Lugaro</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To reach a deeper understanding of the
          origin of elements in the periodic table, we construct
          Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models for all stable
          elements from C (A=12) to U (A=238) from first principles,
          i.e., using theoretical nucleosynthesis yields and event rates
          of all chemical enrichment sources. This enables us to predict
          the origin of elements as a function of time and environment.
          In the solar neighborhood, we find that stars with initial
          masses of M&gt;30M_\odot can become failed supernovae if there
          is a significant contribution from hypernovae (HNe) at
          M~20-50M_\odot. The contribution to GCE from super asymptotic
          giant branch (AGB) stars (with M~8-10M_\odot at solar
          metallicity) is negligible, unless hybrid white dwarfs from
          low-mass super-AGB stars explode as so-called Type Iax
          supernovae, or high-mass super-AGB stars explode as
          electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe). Among neutron-capture
          elements, the observed abundances of the second (Ba) and third
          (Pb) peak elements are well reproduced with our updated yields
          of the slow neutron-capture process (s-process) from AGB
          stars. The first peak elements, Sr, Y, and Zr, are
          sufficiently produced by ECSNe together with AGB stars.
          Neutron star mergers can produce rapid neutron-capture process
          (r-process) elements up to Th and U, but the timescales are
          too long to explain observations at low metallicities. The
          observed evolutionary trends, such as for Eu, can well be
          explained if ~3% of 25-50 M_\odot hypernovae are
          magneto-rotational supernovae producing r-process elements.
          Along with the solar neighborhood, we also predict the
          evolutionary trends in the halo, bulge, and thick disk for
          future comparison with galactic archaeology surveys. <br>

              Haotian</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          In 2005, The Epoch Times acquired a secret speech given by
          Defense Minister Chi Haotian to high-level Communist Party
          Cadres sometime before his retirement in 2003. Details given
          in Chi’s speech coincide with previously unpublished defector
          testimony on Sino-Russian military plans.<br>
          <br>
          "...Would the United States allow us to go out to gain new
          living space? First, if the United States is firm in blocking
          us, it is hard for us to do anything significant to Taiwan,
          Vietnam, India, or even Japan, [so] how much more living space
          can we get? Very trivial! Only countries like the United
          States, Canada and Australia have the vast land to serve our
          need for mass colonization.<br>
          <br>
          Therefore, solving the “issue of America” is the key to
          solving all other issues. First, this makes it possible for us
          to have many people migrate there and even establish another
          China under the same leadership of the CCP. America was
          originally discovered by the ancestors of the yellow race, but
          Columbus gave credit to the white race. We the descendants of
          the Chinese nation are entitled to the possession of the land!
          It is said that the residents of the yellow race have a very
          low social status in the United States. We need to liberate
          them. Second, after solving the “issue of America,” the
          western countries of Europe would bow to us, not to mention
          Taiwan, Japan and other small countries. Therefore, solving
          the “issue of America” is the mission assigned to the CCP
          members by history... In the long run, the relationship of
          China and the United States is one of a life-and-death
          struggle...<br>
          <br>
          To resolve the issue of America we must be able to transcend
          conventions and restrictions. In history, when a country
          defeated another country or occupied another country, it could
          not kill all the people in the conquered land because back
          then you could not kill people effectively with sabers or long
          spears, or even with rifles or machine guns. Therefore, it was
          impossible to gain a stretch of land without keeping the
          people on that land. However, if we conquered America in this
          fashion, we would not be able to make many people migrate
          there.<br>
          <br>
          Only by using special means to “clean up” America will we be
          able to lead the Chinese people there. This is the only choice
          left for us. This is not a matter of whether we are willing to
          do it or not. What kind of special means is there available
          for us to “clean up America”? <br>
          <br>
          Conventional weapons such as fighters, canons, missiles and
          battleships won’t do; neither will highly destructive weapons
          such as nuclear weapons. We are not as foolish as to want to
          perish together with America by using nuclear weapons, despite
          the fact that we have been exclaiming that we will have the
          Taiwan issue resolved at whatever cost. Only by using
          non-destructive weapons that can kill many people will we be
          able to reserve America for ourselves. There has been rapid
          development of modern biological technology, and new
          bio-weapons have been invented one after another. Of course,
          we have not been idle, in the past years we have seized the
          opportunity to master weapons of this kind. We are capable of
          achieving our purpose of “cleaning up” America all of a
          sudden...<br>
          <br>
          From a humanitarian perspective, we should issue a warning to
          the American people and persuade them to leave America and
          leave the land they have lived in to the Chinese people. Or at
          least they should leave half of the United States to be
          China’s colony, because America was first discovered by the
          Chinese. But would this work? If this strategy does not work,
          then there is only one choice left to us. That is, use
          decisive means to “clean up” America and reserve America for
          our use in a moment. Our historical experience has proven that
          as long as we make it happen, nobody in the world can do
          anything about us. Furthermore, if the United States as the
          leader is gone, then other enemies have to surrender to us.<br>
          <br>
          Biological weapons are unprecedented in their ruthlessness,
          but if the Americans do not die then the Chinese have to die.
          If the Chinese people are strapped to the present land, a
          total societal collapse is bound to take place. According to
          the computation of the author of Yellow Peril, more than half
          of the Chinese will die, and that figure would be more than
          800 million people! Just after the liberation, our yellow land
          supported nearly 500 million people, while today the official
          figure of the population is more than 1.3 billion. This yellow
          land has reached the limit of its capacity. One day, who knows
          how soon it will come, the great collapse will occur any time
          and more than half the population will have to go.<br>
          <br>
          We must prepare ourselves for two scenarios. If our biological
          weapons succeed in the surprise attack, the Chinese people
          will be able to keep their losses at a minimum in the fight
          against the United States. If, however, the attack fails and
          triggers a nuclear retaliation from the United States, China
          would perhaps suffer a catastrophe in which more than half of
          its population would perish. That is why we need to be ready
          with air defense systems for our big and medium-sized cities.
          Whatever the case may be, we can only move forward fearlessly,
          for the sake of our Party and State and our nation’s future,
          regardless of the hardships we have to face and the sacrifices
          we have to make. The population, even if more than half dies,
          can be reproduced. But if the Party falls, everything is gone,
          and forever gone...<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;In the future, the two rivals, China and the United
          States, will eventually meet each other in a narrow road, and
          our leniency to the Americans will mean cruelty toward the
          Chinese people. Here some people may want to ask me: What
          about the several millions of our compatriots in the United
          States? They may ask: aren’t we against Chinese killing other
          Chinese?<br>
          <br>
          These comrades are too pedantic; they are not pragmatic
          enough. If we had insisted on the principle that the Chinese
          should not kill other Chinese, would we have liberated China?
          As for the several million Chinese living in the United
          States, this is of course a big issue. Therefore, in recent
          years, we have been conducting research on genetic weapons,
          i.e., those weapons that do not kill yellow people. But
          producing a result with this kind of research is extremely
          difficult. <br>
          <br>
          Of the research done on genetic weapons throughout the world,
          Israel is the most advanced. Their genetic weapons are
          designed to target Arabs and protect the Israelis. But even
          they have not reached the stage of actual deployment. We have
          cooperated with Israel on some research. Perhaps we can
          introduce some of the technologies used to protect Israelis
          and remold these technologies to protect the yellow people.
          But their technologies are not mature yet, and it is difficult
          for us to surpass them in a few years. If it has to be five or
          ten years before some breakthrough can be achieved in genetic
          weapons, we cannot afford to wait any longer...<br>
          <br>
          It is indeed brutal to kill one or two hundred million
          Americans. But that is the only path that will secure a
          Chinese century in which the CCP leads the world...<br>

          </b>Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger made loud and
          dangerous statements after being swallowed up by a long
          silence until people almost forgot his existence.<br>
          “The Third World War is on the way, and Iran will be the
          starting point in that war, in which Israel will have to kill
          as many Arabs as possible and occupy half of the Middle East,”
          Kissinger said in an interview with the DailyScape.<br>
          “We have told the US military that we are forced to occupy
          seven countries in the Middle East because of their strategic
          importance, especially because they contain oil and other
          economic resources. There is only one step left, which is to
          strike Iran,” he said.<br>
          “When China and Russia move from their stupidity, the big bang
          and the Great War will have been won, and only one force,
          Israel and America, will win,” he said. “Israel will have to
          fight with all its strength and weapons to kill as many Arabs
          as possible. And the occupation of half of the Middle East. “<br>
          “The drums of war are already ringing in the Middle East, and
          the deaf is the only one who does not hear them,” Kissinger
          said, noting that if things went well, from his point of view,
          Israel would control half of the Middle East.<br>
          Kissinger noted that American and European young people have
          been well trained in the fighting in the last 10 years, and
          when they are ordered to go out to fight the crazy ones, they
          will obey orders and turn them [Muslims] into ashes.<br>
          We haved hired or purchased many local nationals from these
          islamic countries and they are working for our plans as we
          have done heavy investment on them. These are doing well
          beyond our expectations. Due to these traitors we are very
          near to our planned goals.<br>
          Kissinger also stated that “America and Israel have prepared
          coffins for Russia and Iran, and Iran will be the last nail in
          this coffin, after America gave them a chance to recover and a
          false sense of power. Then they will fall forever, so that
          America (Freemasonry) can build a new world community, where
          there will be only one government with superpower. “<br>
          Kissinger confirmed that he had a great dream at the moment
          that his vision of events was realized. For those who do not
          know Henry Kissinger, the former Secretary of State and one of
          the most famous emperors of world rule and the architects of
          the new world order, he was born in 1923 in Germany to a
          Jewish family.<br>

            Abstract<br>
          </b>Recently, some scientists from NASA have claimed that
          there may be a black hole like structure at the centre of the
          earth. We show that the existence of life on the earth may be
          a reason that this black hole like object is a black brane
          that has been formed from biological materials like DNA. Size
          of this DNA black brane is 109 times longer than the size of
          the earth’s core and compacted interior it. By compacting this
          long object, a curved space-time emerges, and some properties
          of black holes emerge. This structure is the main cause of the
          emergence of the large temperature of the core, magnetic field
          around the earth and gravitational field for moving around the
          sun. Also, this structure produces some waves which act like
          topoisomerase in biology and read the information on DNAs.
          However, on the four-dimensional manifold, DNAs are contracted
          at least four times around various axis’s and waves of earth
          couldn’t read their information. While, by adding extra
          dimensions on 4 +n-dimensional manifold, the separation
          distance between particles increases and all of the
          information could be recovered by waves. For this reason, each
          DNA has two parts which one can be seen on the
          four-dimensional universe, and another one has existed in
          extra dimensions, and only it’s e_ects is observed. This dark
          part of DNA called as a dark DNA in an extra dimension. These
          dark DNAs not only exchange information with DNAs but also are
          connected with some of the molecules of water and helps them
          to store information and have memory. Thus, the earth is the
          biggest system of telecommunication which connects DNAs, dark
          DNAs and molecules of water.<b><br>

              stimulation selectively enhances speech category learning

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>Adults struggle to learn non-native speech contrasts even
          after years of exposure. While laboratory-based training
          approaches yield learning, the optimal training conditions for
          maximizing speech learning in adulthood are currently unknown.
          Vagus nerve stimulation has been shown to prime adult
          sensory-perceptual systems towards plasticity in animal
          models. Precise temporal pairing with auditory stimuli can
          enhance auditory cortical representations with a high degree
          of specificity. Here, we examined whether sub-perceptual
          threshold transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS),
          paired with non-native speech sounds, enhances speech category
          learning in adults. Twenty-four native English-speakers were
          trained to identify non-native Mandarin tone categories.
          Across two groups, tVNS was paired with the tone categories
          that were easier- or harder-to-learn. A control group received
          no stimulation but followed an identical thresholding
          procedure as the intervention groups. We found that tVNS
          robustly enhanced speech category learning and retention of
          correct stimulus-response associations, but only when
          stimulation was paired with the easier-to-learn categories.
          This effect emerged rapidly, generalized to new exemplars, and
          was qualitatively different from the normal individual
          variability observed in hundreds of learners who have
          performed in the same task without stimulation.
          Electroencephalography recorded before and after training
          indicated no evidence of tVNS-induced changes in the sensory
          representation of auditory stimuli. These results suggest that
          paired-tVNS induces a temporally precise neuromodulatory
          signal that selectively enhances the perception and memory
          consolidation of perceptually salient categories.<b><br>

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>Quantum time crystals are systems characterized by
          spontaneously emerging periodic order in the time domain1.
          While originally a phase of broken time translation symmetry
          was a mere speculation2, a wide range of time crystals has
          been reported3,4,5. However, the dynamics and interactions
          between such systems have not been investigated
          experimentally. Here we study two adjacent quantum time
          crystals realized by two magnon condensates in superfluid
          3He-B. We observe an exchange of magnons between the time
          crystals leading to opposite-phase oscillations in their
          populations—a signature of the AC Josephson effect6—while the
          defining periodic motion remains phase coherent throughout the
          experiment. Our results demonstrate that time crystals obey
          the general dynamics of quantum mechanics and offer a basis to
          further investigate the fundamental properties of these
          phases, opening pathways for possible applications in
          developing fields, such as quantum information processing.<br>

            Summary<br>
          </b>Aberrant redox signaling underlies the pathophysiology of
          many chronic metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes
          (T2D). Methodologies aimed at rebalancing systemic redox
          homeostasis have had limited success. A noninvasive, sustained
          approach would enable the long-term control of redox signaling
          for the treatment of T2D. We report that static magnetic and
          electric fields (sBE) noninvasively modulate the systemic
          GSH-to-GSSG redox couple to promote a healthier systemic redox
          environment that is reducing. Strikingly, when applied to
          mouse models of T2D, sBE rapidly ameliorates insulin
          resistance and glucose intolerance in as few as 3 days with no
          observed adverse effects. Scavenging paramagnetic byproducts
          of oxygen metabolism with SOD2 in hepatic mitochondria fully
          abolishes these insulin sensitizing effects, demonstrating
          that mitochondrial superoxide mediates induction of these
          therapeutic changes. Our findings introduce a remarkable
          redox-modulating phenomenon that exploits endogenous
          electromagneto-receptive mechanisms for the noninvasive
          treatment of T2D, and potentially other redox-related
          diseases.<br>

          </b>At room temperature, micron-sized sheets of freestanding
          graphene are in constant motion, even in the presence of an

          collecting the displacement current using a nearby small-area
          metal electrode and present an Ito-Langevin model for the
          motion coupled to a circuit containing diodes. Numerical
          simulations show that the system reaches thermal equilibrium
          and the average rates of heat and work provided by stochastic
          thermodynamics tend quickly to zero. Power is dissipated by
          the load resistor, and its time average is exactly equal to
          the power supplied by the thermal bath. The exact power
          formula is similar to Nyquist’s noise power formula, except
          that the rate of change of diode resistance significantly
          boosts the output power, and the movement of the graphene
          shifts the power spectrum to lower frequencies. They have
          calculated the equilibrium average of the power by asymptotic
          and numerical methods. Experiments have proven the theory...<b><br>

            ABSTRACT<br>
          </b>We report the experimental demonstration of a mm-wave
          electron accelerating structure powered by a high-power rf
          source. We demonstrate reliable coupling of an unprecedented
          rf power—up to 575 kW into the mm-wave accelerator structure
          using a quasi-optical setup. This standing wave accelerating
          structure consists of a single-cell copper cavity and a
          Gaussian to TM01 mode converter. The accelerator structure is
          powered by 110 GHz, 10-ns long rf pulses. These pulses are
          chopped from 3 ms pulses from a gyrotron oscillator using a
          laser-driven silicon switch. We show an unprecedented high
          gradient up to 230 MV/m that corresponds to a peak surface
          electric field of more than 520 MV/m. We have achieved these
          results after conditioning the cavity with more than 105
          pulses. We also report preliminary measurements of rf
          breakdown rates, which are important for understanding rf
          breakdown physics in the millimeter-wave regime. These results
          open up many frontiers for applications not only limited to
          the next generation particle accelerators but also x-ray
          generation, probing material dynamics, and nonlinear
          light-matter interactions at mm-wave frequency.<b><br>

            </a><br>
          </b>Diamond Nuclear Voltaic (DNV): NDB is one of the earliest
          adopters and developers of this technology backed up by recent
          publications. Typically, DNV as a device is a combination of a
          semiconductor, metal and ceramic which has two contact
          surfaces to facilitate charge collection. Several single units
          are attached together to create a stack arrangement, which is
          fabricated to create a positive and negative contact surface
          similar to a common battery system. Every layer of the DNV
          stack consists of a high energy output source. This kind of
          arrangement improves the overall efficiency of the system and
          provides a multi layer safety shield for the product.<br>
          <br>
          Rapid conversion from radiation to electricity: All
          radioisotopes are known to produce high amounts of heat. The
          strategic placement of the source between the DNV units
          facilitates inelastic scattering originated due to the
          presence of single crystalline diamond (SCD) in the DNV unit.
          This design prevents self-absorption of heat by the
          radioisotope and enables rapid conversion to usable
          electricity.<br>
          <br>
          Thin film structure: The thin-film profile exhibited by NDB
          allows radiation absorption in the single crystalline diamond
          with minimal self adsorption. Due to its flexible design
          structure, this technology can take any shape and form in
          accordance to the application. This makes NDB’s battery system
          market friendly.<br>
          <br>
          Nuclear recycle process: Utilization of radioactive waste as
          otherwise is a subject not many have looked into. At NDB, we
          aim to&nbsp; reuse the nuclear fuel by reprocessing and
          recycling to enable sustainability and promote a clean energy
          source in a safe and secure environment.<br>
          <b><br>
            Safety<br>
          </b>One of the key innovations of NDB is its highly
          sophisticated safety feature covering the three most important
          aspects of thermal, mechanical and radiation safety. The
          battery system uses several concepts to ensure maximum safety
          of the device:<br>
          <br>
          Diamond encapsulator:&nbsp; The DNV stacks along with the
          source are coated with a layer of poly-crystalline diamond,
          which is known for being the most thermally conductive
          material also has the ability to contain the radiation within
          the device and is the hardest material, twelve times tougher
          than stainless steel. This makes our product extremely tough
          and tamperproof.<br>
          <br>
          Built in thermal vents: The high energy source present in the
          battery system produces heat during operation. This leads to
          thermal conduction in the system. Thermal vents in the system
          help conduct this process with respect to the outer surface of
          the diamond to keep the interiors at an optimum level.<br>
          <br>
          Boron-doped SCD: Trying to utilise every aspect in the system,
          NDB in addition to alpha and beta also incorporates usage of
          neutron radiations by utilising a boron-10 doping. Doping
          helps to convert the extra neutron into alpha ray.<br>
          <br>
          Lock-in System: Using a nuclear power source for a battery
          system brings up the question of nuclear proliferation due to
          production of fissionable isotopes such as Pu- 238 and U-232.
          To tackle this issue, NDB uses an ion implantation mechanism
          called “lock-in system” which prevents usage other than power
          generation. This increases the usability, by meeting consumer
          safety requirements.<br>

              coronavirus? The CDC says it isn’t available.</b><br>
            <b>By Jon Rappoport</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
            The CDC document is titled, “CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus
            (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel.” It is dated
            July 13, 2020.<br>
            <br>
          </b>Buried deep in the document, on page 39, in a section
          titled, “Performance Characteristics,” we have this: “Since no
          quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently
          available, assays [diagnostic tests] designed for detection of
          the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in
          vitro transcribed full length RNA…”<br>
          <br>
          The key phrase there is: “Since no quantified virus isolates
          of the 2019-nCoV are currently available…”<br>
          <br>
          Every object that exists can be quantified, which is to say,
          measured. The use of the term “quantified” in that phrase
          means: the CDC has no measurable amount of the virus, because
          it is unavailable. THE CDC HAS NO VIRUS.<br>
          <br>
          A further tip-off is the use of the word ‘isolates.” This
          means NO ISOLATED VIRUS IS AVAILABLE.<br>
          <br>
          Another way to put it: NO ONE HAS AN ISOLATED SPECIMEN OF THE
          COVID-19 VIRUS.<br>
          <br>
          NO ONE HAS ISOLATED THE COVID-19 VIRUS.<br>
          <br>
          THEREFORE, NO ONE HAS PROVED THAT IT EXISTS.<br>
          <br>
          As if this were not enough of a revelation to shock the world,
          the CDC goes on to say they are presenting a diagnostic PCR
          test to detect the virus-that-hasn’t-been-isolated…and the
          test is looking for RNA which is PRESUMED to come from the
          virus that hasn’t been proved to exist.<br>
          <br>
          And using this test, the CDC and every other public health
          agency in the world are counting COVID cases and deaths…and
          governments have instituted lockdowns and economic devastation
          using those case and death numbers as justification.<br>
          <br>
          If people believe “you have the virus but it is not
          available,” and you have the virus except it is buried within
          other material and hasn’t been extracted and purified and
          isolated, these people believe the moon is made of green
          cheese.<br>
          <br>
          This is like saying. “We have the 20 trillion dollars, they
          are contained somewhere in our myriad accounts, we just don’t
          know where.” If you don’t know where, you don’t know you have
          the money.<br>
          <br>
          “The car keys are somewhere in the house. We just don’t
          where.” Really? If you don’t know where, you don’t know the
          keys are in the house.<br>
          <br>
          “The missing cruise missile is somewhere in the arsenal, we
          just don’t where.” No. If you don’t know where, you don’t know
          the missile is in the arsenal.<br>
          <br>
          “The COVID-19 virus is somewhere in the material we have—we
          just haven’t removed it from that material. But we know what
          it is and we’ve identified it and we know its structure.” NO
          YOU DON’T. YOU ASSUME THAT.<br>
          <br>
          Science is not assumptions.<br>
          <br>
          “But…but…there is a study which says a few researchers in a
          lab isolated the virus…”<br>
          <br>
          They say they did. But in July, the CDC is saying no virus is
          available. I guess that means trucks were not available to
          bring the virus from that lab to the CDC. The trucks were out
          of gas. It was raining. The bridge was washed out. The trucks
          were in the shop. Joe, the driver, couldn’t find his mask, and
          he didn’t want to leave home without it…<br>
          <br>
          Science is not assumptions.<br>
          <br>
          The pandemic is a fraud, down to the root of the poisonous
          tree.<br>

            </b></b>The energy used for regulating building temperatures
          accounts for 14% of the primary energy consumed in the U.S.
          One-quarter of this energy is leaked through ineffcient glass
          windows in cold weather. The development of trans-parent
          composites could potentially provide affordable window
          materials with enhanced energy effciency. Transparent wood as
          a promising material has presented desirable performances in
          thermal and light management. In this work, the performance of
          transparent wood is optimized toward an energy eff-cient
          window material that possesses the following attributes: 1)
          high optical transmittance (≈91%), comparable to that of
          glass; 2) high clarity with low haze (≈15%); 3) high toughness
          (3.03 MJ m−3) that is 3 orders of magnitude higher than
          standard glass (0.003 MJ m−3); 4) low thermal conductivity
          (0.19 W m−1 K−1) that is more than 5 times lower than that of
          glass. Additionally, the transparent wood is a sustainable
          material, with low carbon emissions and scaling capabilities
          due to its compatibility with industry-adopted rotary cutting
          methods. The scalable, high clarity, transparent wood
          demonstrated in current work can potentially be employed as
          energy effcient and sustainable windows for signifcant
          environmental and economic benefts. <b><b><br>

              which doesn't exist anymore, the scenes are so ominous,
              and the flight number is 911. Very creepy. [ @ ~ 9:11 in

                  Light Has Harmful Biological Effects</b><br>
              </div>
              <br>
              According to the American Optometric Association “Blue
              light can cause retinal damage” because “visible light
              passes through the media of the eye to the retina where
              photoreceptors transform it into an electrochemical
              signal. Humans depend on this process for image-formation
              and regulation of daily sleep-wake cycles. Commonly
              encountered light emitted by the sun and personal
              electronic devices contain significant amounts of
              high-energy, short- wavelength blue light. Ultraviolet
              (UV) light contains more energy than blue light, but is
              absorbed by the cornea and crystalline lens, limiting
              retinal exposure.”<br>
              <br>
              “Visible blue light may potentially be harmful to the
              human retina, as it can be absorbed by the retinal pigment
              epithelium (RPE) and certain photoreceptors, generating
              localized oxidative and thermal stress. Laboratory studies
              on rodent and primate models have demonstrated that
              extended time periods of direct retinal exposure to bright
              blue light accelerate rates of RPE and photoreceptor
              death.“...<br>

              In Antoine de Saint Exupéry's tale the Little Prince meets
              a businessman who accumulates stars with the sole purpose
              of being able to buy more stars. The Little Prince is
              perplexed. He owns only a flower, which he waters every
              day. Three volcanoes, which he cleans every week. "It is
              of some use to my volcanoes, and it is of some use to my
              flower, that I own them," he says, "but you are of no use
              to the stars that you own".<br>
              <br>
              There are many businessmen who own knowledge today.
              Consider Elsevier, the largest scholarly publisher, whose
              37% profit margin1 stands in sharp contrast to the rising
              fees, expanding student loan debt and poverty-level wages
              for adjunct faculty. Elsevier owns some of the largest
              databases of academic material, which are licensed at
              prices so scandalously high that even Harvard, the richest
              university of the global north, has complained that it
              cannot afford them any longer. Robert Darnton, the past
              director of Harvard Library, says "We faculty do the
              research, write the papers, referee papers by other
              researchers, serve on editorial boards, all of it for free
              … and then we buy back the results of our labour at
              outrageous prices."2 For all the work supported by public
              money benefiting scholarly publishers, particularly the
              peer review that grounds their legitimacy, journal
              articles are priced such that they prohibit access to
              science to many academics - and all non-academics - across
              the world, and render it a token of privilege.3<br>
              <br>
              Elsevier has recently filed a copyright infringement suit
              in New York against Science Hub and Library Genesis
              claiming millions of dollars in damages.4 This has come as
              a big blow, not just to the administrators of the websites
              but also to thousands of researchers around the world for
              whom these sites are the only viable source of academic
              materials. The social media, mailing lists and IRC
              channels have been filled with their distress messages,
              desperately seeking articles and publications.<br>
              <br>
              Even as the New York District Court was delivering its
              injunction, news came of the entire editorial board of
              highly-esteemed journal Lingua handing in their collective
              resignation, citing as their reason the refusal by
              Elsevier to go open access and give up on the high fees it
              charges to authors and their academic institutions. As we
              write these lines, a petition is doing the rounds
              demanding that Taylor &amp; Francis doesn't shut down
              Ashgate5, a formerly independent humanities publisher that
              it acquired earlier in 2015. It is threatened to go the
              way of other small publishers that are being rolled over
              by the growing monopoly and concentration in the
              publishing market. These are just some of the signs that
              the system is broken. It devalues us, authors, editors and
              readers alike. It parasites on our labor, it thwarts our
              service to the public, it denies us access6.<br>
              <br>
              We have the means and methods to make knowledge accessible
              to everyone, with no economic barrier to access and at a
              much lower cost to society. But closed access’s monopoly
              over academic publishing, its spectacular profits and its
              central role in the allocation of academic prestige trump
              the public interest. Commercial publishers effectively
              impede open access, criminalize us, prosecute our heroes
              and heroines, and destroy our libraries, again and again.
              Before Science Hub and Library Genesis there was
              Library.nu or Gigapedia; before Gigapedia there was
              textz.com; before textz.com there was little; and before
              there was little there was nothing. That's what they want:
              to reduce most of us back to nothing. And they have the
              full support of the courts and law to do exactly that.7<br>
              <br>
              In Elsevier's case against Sci-Hub and Library Genesis,
              the judge said: "simply making copyrighted content
              available for free via a foreign website, disserves the
              public interest"8. Alexandra Elbakyan's original plea put
              the stakes much higher: "If Elsevier manages to shut down
              our projects or force them into the darknet, that will
              demonstrate an important idea: that the public does not
              have the right to knowledge."<br>
              <br>
              We demonstrate daily, and on a massive scale, that the
              system is broken. We share our writing secretly behind the
              backs of our publishers, circumvent paywalls to access
              articles and publications, digitize and upload books to
              libraries. This is the other side of 37% profit margins:
              our knowledge commons grows in the fault lines of a broken
              system. We are all custodians of knowledge, custodians of
              the same infrastructures that we depend on for producing
              knowledge, custodians of our fertile but fragile commons.
              To be a custodian is, de facto, to download, to share, to
              read, to write, to review, to edit, to digitize, to
              archive, to maintain libraries, to make them accessible.
              It is to be of use to, not to make property of, our
              knowledge commons.<br>
              <br>
              More than seven years ago Aaron Swartz, who spared no risk
              in standing up for what we here urge you to stand up for
              too, wrote: "We need to take information, wherever it is
              stored, make our copies and share them with the world. We
              need to take stuff that's out of copyright and add it to
              the archive. We need to buy secret databases and put them
              on the Web. We need to download scientific journals and
              upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for
              Guerilla Open Access. With enough of us, around the world,
              we'll not just send a strong message opposing the
              privatization of knowledge — we'll make it a thing of the
              past. Will you join us?"9<br>
              <br>
              We find ourselves at a decisive moment. This is the time
              to recognize that the very existence of our massive
              knowledge commons is an act of collective civil
              disobedience. It is the time to emerge from hiding and put
              our names behind this act of resistance. You may feel
              isolated, but there are many of us. The anger, desperation
              and fear of losing our library infrastructures, voiced
              across the internet, tell us that. This is the time for us
              custodians, being dogs, humans or cyborgs, with our names,
              nicknames and pseudonyms, to raise our voices.<br>

              Cannabis could be used to help treat potentially deadly
              complications with COVID-19, a growing body of research
              suggests. <br>
              <br>
              Researchers at the University of South Carolina performed
              a trio of studies on mice which found that THC - the
              chemical that gives cannabis its mind-altering effect -
              could help prevent a harmful immune response that causes
              Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). <br>
              <br>
              ARDS is one of the most common complications for patients
              with severe cases of coronavirus. It can be fatal or lead
              to permanent pulmonary scarring.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              The goal of the USC study was to see if THC could block
              the immune response that leads to ARDS developing by
              introducing a toxin into the mice that triggers the
              response.<br>
              <br>
              In dozens of experiments across all three studies, all of
              the mice that were given THC after the toxin survived,
              while those that didn't get the chemical died.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              The researchers cautioned that their work is still far
              from conclusive and stressed that they are not encouraging
              people to use marijuana to self-medicate for COVID-19. ...<br>

              ...treatment with THC led to 100% survival of mice. THC
              treatment significantly suppressed the inflammatory
              cytokines, IFN-γ and TNF-α. Additionally, THC elevated the
              induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and their
              associated cytokines, IL-10 and TGF-β. Moreover, THC
              caused induction of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells
              (MDSCs). THC acted through CB2 receptor as pharmacological
              inhibitor of CB2 receptors blocked the anti-inflammatory
              effects. THC-treated mice showed significant alterations
              in the expression of miRNA (miRs) in the lung-infiltrated
              mononuclear cells (MNCs). Specifically, THC caused
              downregulation of let7a-5p which targeted SOCS1 and
              downregulation of miR-34-5p which caused increased
              expression of FoxP3, NOS1, and CSF1R. Together, these data
              suggested that THC-mediated alterations in miR expression
              in the lungs may play a critical role in the induction of
              immunosuppressive Tregs and MDSCs as well as suppression
              of cytokine storm leading to attenuation of SEB-mediated
              lung injury.<br>

              Scott:<br>
              If media reports are correct, the president is receiving 2
              experimental drugs: the antibody cocktail, Regeneron, and
              the antiviral, Remdesivir.<br>
              Aside from their individual adverse effects…<br>
              THESE DRUGS HAVE NEVER BEEN STUDIED FOR THEIR COMBINED
              EFFECTS ON A PATIENT. AND NOW THAT PATIENT…THE FIRST
              PATIENT RECEIVING THEM…IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
              STATES.<br>
              You know the adverse effects of Remdesivir, Scott. They’re
              more than worrisome. Acute kidney injury, for example. And
              this drug has only emergency authorization, and it’s
              explicitly for patients who are SEVERE COVID cases. Trump
              is not a severe case. What’s going on? Why are the Walter
              Reed doctors piling on?<br>
              The other drug, Regeneron, the antibody cocktail,
              synthesized versions of mouse and human antibodies, is
              still in clinical trials. There is NO authorization for
              its use.<br>
              In past trials of antibody drugs, highly increased
              infection has occurred. Very dangerous.<br>
              And pray these doctors don’t suddenly opt for a
              ventilator. They could do that, if Trump’s condition
              worsens, because of the effects of the DRUGS. They will
              call those effects “serious COVID decline.”<br>
              In a large New York study of COVID patients in Trump’s age
              group, 97 percent of the patients receiving ventilator
              treatment died. Ventilator treatment, as you know,
              involves heavy and prolonged sedation.<br>
              The president is in a very dangerous situation.<br>
              Every damn doctor who has any ethics at all should be
              screaming bloody murder right now. This is not
              supposition. Would you prescribe a patient not one, but
              two highly experimental drugs, each of which has very
              damaging effects? Would you prescribe them TOGETHER? EVER?
              Especially when the patient is not close to being
              seriously ill? Especially when the drugs’ combined effects
              have never been studied?<br>
              WHY ARE THE WALTER REED DOCTORS TREATING TRUMP AS IF HE
              WERE IN DESPERATE STRAITS?<br>
              They’re going after the president as if he’s hanging on to
              life by a thread and they have to throw everything they’ve
              got at him.<br>
              Who is watching over the president’s life? Are these
              doctors trying to kill him?<br>
              <br>
              GET BUSY, SCOTT. NOW.<br>

              know what was going to happen on September18th, only that
              his cycle analysis was pointing to this being a key date
              for change.&nbsp; It’s safe to say that RBG’s death has
              intensified the 2020 Presidential Election.&nbsp;
              President Trump’s pick to replace a pro-abortion judge
              with a pro-life judge, Amy Coney Barrett, marks a huge
              directional change for America. <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;Polny’s simple advice is to, “Get physical gold and
              silver, and hold onto it as a core asset.&nbsp; The trend
              is going up over the next few years.&nbsp; Silver is going
              to blow away gold on a percentage basis.”<br>
              <br>
              Polny sees much death and destruction as the fourth
              horseman of Revelation arrives.&nbsp; He says Jesus will
              protect those who believe in him.&nbsp; All this is what
              must happen before Jesus returns, which is still several
              years away.<br>
              <br>
              Polny also says, “I am a watchman, and I am warning people
              and telling them to get prepared. . . . God looks after
              us, and this is what we do.&nbsp; All that matters is to
              get awake, and that means awake in Christ.&nbsp; For the
              things that are coming upon the earth, if you haven’t
              prepared, it’s not going to go well for you.”<br>

              As we approach the one year anniversary of the novel
              coronavirus outbreak, we find ourselves facing many
              unanswered questions.<br>
              <br>
              We find ourselves worse off in many ways, in comparison to
              when the outbreak just began, as we receive signals from
              public health officials and the media to prepare for
              another lockdown.<br>
              <br>
              It appears we are approaching what could to be a perfect
              storm. The US Presidential Elections, flu season, the
              arrival of the new experimental COVID vaccine and the
              prophesied ‘second wave’ of COVID.<br>
              <br>
              The big news of the week of course, has been President
              Trump and the First Lady have both tested positive for
              COVID. The President has been hospitalized. <br>
              <br>
              President Trump’s doctor, said that Trump’s diagnosis was
              confirmed using the PCR test. Just like virtually every
              other ‘confirmed case’ we hear reported. <br>
              <br>
              But was PCR really developed with the intention of
              diagnosing infectious diseases? Is PCR capable of
              diagnosing infectious diseases? How could a test developed
              almost 40 years ago be used to diagnose a brand new
              disease found less than one year ago?<br>
              <br>
              In this report, we examine this questions in addition to
              reviewing video clips of multiple doctors weighing in on
              the subject including the biochemist Kary Mullis who
              invented PCR and won a Nobel Peace Prize for doing so has
              to say. <br>
              <br>
              Why is understanding the test so important?<br>
              Because it is the driving factor in the fear campaign,
              that is being driven by the corrupt media and then used by
              the government to justify the restrictions imposed on our
              lives.<br>
              <br>
              This is a must see report that may change the perception
              of you, or of someone you may know, regarding the crisis.

              Biblical cycle expert and financial analyst Bo Polny
              predicted, “Do expect immense changes, and I do feel
              September 18th of this year is going to be pretty

              Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose “expert” advice to President
              Trump has resulted in the complete shutdown of the
              greatest economic engine in world history, has known since
              2005 that chloroquine is an effective inhibitor of
              coronaviruses.<br>
              <br>
              How did he know this? Because of research done by the
              National Institutes of Health, of which he is the
              director. In connection with the SARS outbreak – caused by
              a coronavirus dubbed SARS- CoV – the NIH researched
              chloroquine and concluded that it was effective at
              stopping the SARS coronavirus in its tracks. The COVID-19
              bug is likewise a coronavirus, labeled SARS-CoV-2. While
              not exactly the same virus as SARS-CoV-1, it is
              genetically related to it, and shares 79% of its genome,
              as the name SARS-CoV-2 implies. They both use the same
              host cell receptor, which is what viruses use to gain
              entry to the cell and infect the victim...<br>

              Dr. Richard Horowitz is the Medical Director at the Hudson
              Valley Healing Arts Center. Over the years, he has seen
              more than 13,000 Chronic Lyme disease
              patients.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              Recently, he noticed similarities between Lyme and
              COVID-19. Learning to lower the inflammatory response with
              Lyme in the past, he’s tried some of the same techniques
              to help people battling the coronavirus.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              “The scientific literature has shown that there are three
              nutritional supplements, something that is very easy, not
              expensive, and easy to find. They’re called NAC, alpha
              lipoic acid, and glutathione,” said Dr. Horowitz. <br>
              <br>
              With the approach of using glutathione, Dr. Horowitz says
              patients noticed results within one hour. Their shortness
              of breath improved.<br>
              <br>
              “If they would see the success that I had in my patients
              and understand the science. I think they would be
              interested,” stated Dr. Horowitz. <br>
              <br>
              He says his next step is to work with state leaders and
              get a randomized controlled study done.<br>

              </div>
              <br>
              The Groasis Waterboxx plant cocoon is a polypropylene tray
              in the form of a donut. The Waterboxx plant cocoon, or the
              smart bucket "ensures that trees and shrubs can grow in
              dry, hot climates without the help of irrigation methods.<br>
              <br>
              The advantage of the Waterboxx plant cocoon that they have
              no energy to plant trees, expensive irrigation methods
              need to be submitted, 90% less water has compared to
              traditional planting methods, 90% lower cost compared to
              traditional planting methods and regardless the
              environment is guaranteed survival rate of + 90% provided
              one plant according to the instructions.<br>
              <br>
              The Waterboxx plant cocoon can be used ten times. This
              means that with one Waterboxx cocoon plant can be planted
              at least 10 trees over a period of 10 years. The cost per
              tree will then be up to € 2 to € 3.<br>

              The Wuhan Flu has just about run its course. Phase two,
              the starvation phase is coming next and it is a deliberate
              attack up the world. The UN Secretary General said we will
              have famines of Biblical proportions. This is the
              purposeful wiping out of much of the world. The supply
              chain is destroyed and extreme weather has done its job
              over the past few years. <br>

              If the Deep State, does what many of us in the media
              believe they are going to do, they will soon provoke a
              crisis, declare martial law and use food as the ultimate
              weapon to subjugate an unruly population. This article
              provides an assessment of these possibilities. This
              article will examine past history and archival information
              in order to look for a pattern of behavior which suggests
              that the Deep State in this country plans to use food as a
              weapon against the people. This will be followed by an
              analysis of a current state of affairs in order better
              assess the immediacy of any such threat.<br>
              <br>
              <b>The Historical Precedent of Using Food As a Weapon</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              The two most notable examples of dictators using food as a
              weapon in order to destroy the free will of their people,
              comes from the regimes of Stalin and Hitler. Josef Stalin
              engaged in his own Soviet-style Holocaust when, in 1932
              and 1933, an estimated six to 20 million people in the
              Ukraine died from starvation when Stalin implemented his
              prescription of “hope and change” policies in order to
              eliminate the Ukrainian’s desire for becoming their own
              nation-state. Upon assuming power, the Stalinist Communist
              regime rapidly nationalized the food industry and forced
              all of the region’s farms into collectives. This is
              exactly what is happening under the Obama administration
              and the dramatic rise of corporately owned farms.<br>
              <br>
              Stalin’s version of the Holocaust came to fruition in what
              history has dubbed, the “Holodomor,” in which millions
              perished in only a two year period when the Soviet
              government began to exterminate the Ukrainian population
              by taking control of food and food production. And why
              would Stalin do such a thing to his own people? The
              Ukrainians were discussing and publicizing some very
              dangerous ideas about freedom, liberty and the ability to
              act on their desire for political autonomy. Americans
              would be wise to heed this warning as despots hate
              freedom. The parallel between Stalin and collectivist
              farms and American corporately owned farms is very
              disturbing. <br>
              <br>
              Hitler proclaimed that food could be used as a tool “…to
              discipline the masses” and he did not hesitate to use the
              control of food as a type of carrot and stick in which he
              would reward accomplishment and punish failure as well as
              to ferment preferential class distinctions in which his
              armed forces received the largest food ration cards.
              Skilled workers who were engaged in industries critical to
              the building of the German war machine, received food
              ration cards which were slightly less in value. And,
              finally, the prisoners and the Jews received the lowest
              valued Nazi food ration cards. Food ration cards were also
              utilized as incentives to increase industrial production
              and were also increased in value when productive Nazi
              workers would be promoted. Food ration cards were
              diminished in value for the failure to meet Nazi
              production goals. Hitler’s use of what psychologists refer
              to as classical conditioning techniques reduced the will
              of the German population to a pack of Pavlovian dogs who
              were conditioned to be totally dependent upon the
              government for their survival. The presence of 50 million
              Americans on food stamps would certainly make an
              applicable parallel to Hitler’s practices and the
              potential for Harris/Biden, or another future president to
              follow in Hitler’s footsteps with regard to food
              management.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              <b>Americans Could Never Be Starved to Death From
                Starvation: Unfortunately, It’s Happened Before-In
                America!</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              An estimated Seven million people starved to death during
              the Great Depression. And amazingly, these people had food
              preparation skills that are basically a lost art in
              America today (e.g. canning). With a staggering debt
              looming over the country, how vulnerable are Americans to
              starvation if and when an economic collapse takes down our
              economy? It is not a secret that the world is in a
              desperate situation when it comes to overall world hunger.
              The World Bank cites the disturbing fact that there have
              been 51 food riots in 37 countries in recent memory due to
              high food prices and the further escalation of food prices
              has no end in sight. The World Bank further speculates
              that the present state of food prices could lead to
              political instability and this is the kind of stuff that
              wars are made of. And what is the number one cause of
              rising food prices according to the World Bank? It is the
              increasing demand(see attached PDF)&nbsp; for food from a
              growing population inside of China. The future military
              implications should be self-evident. But what about the
              United States? How vulnerable are Americans to the
              possibility of mass starvation?<br>
              <br>
              <b>A Snapshot of America’s Food Vulnerability</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              Almost beyond belief, a full 79 percent of the people that
              use food banks purchase typically buy cheap, unhealthy
              food and still just have enough to feed their
              children.&nbsp; The price of food continues to quickly
              out-pace the paychecks of most middle class families.
              There are&nbsp; 50 million Americans that are dealing with
              food insecurity in various degrees of distress. Just over
              one out of seven Americans rely on obtaining food from
              various banks at one point or another and these food banks
              are beginning to experience record shortages. In a case of
              “defend the nation and starve”, military families are
              feeling even more stress&nbsp; from not being able to
              obtain sufficient quantities of food as 25% of America
              military families require outside assistance in getting
              enough to eat. What does this say about an administration
              which uses our soldiers to defend the nation and then
              kicks them to the curb by denying their VA&nbsp; health
              benefits as the government also starves their families
              because they cannot survive on what we pay our soldiers?
              This is disgraceful!<br>

                  horse' that causes cancer cells to self-destruct, a

              <br>
              The researchers created their 'Trojan horse' nanoparticle
              by coating it with a specific amino acid --
              L-phenylalanine -- that cancer cells rely on, along with
              other similar amino acids, to survive and grow.
              L-phenylalanine is known as an 'essential' amino acid as
              it cannot be made by the body and must be absorbed from
              food, typically from meat and dairy products.<br>
              <br>
              Studies by other research teams have shown that cancer
              tumour growth can be slowed or prevented by 'starving'
              cancer cells of amino acids. Scientists believe that
              depriving cancer cells of amino acids, for example through
              fasting or through special diets lacking in protein, may
              be viable ways to treat cancer.<br>
              <br>
              However, such strict dietary regimes would not be suitable
              for all patients, including those at risk of malnutrition
              or those with cachexia -- a condition arising from chronic
              illness that causes extreme weight and muscle loss.
              Furthermore, compliance with the regimes would be very
              challenging for many patients.<br>
              <br>
              Seeking to exploit the amino acid dependency of cancer
              cells but avoid the challenges of strict dietary regimes,
              the NTU researchers devised a novel alternative approach.<br>
              <br>
              They took a silica nanoparticle designated as 'Generally
              Recognized As Safe' by the US Food and Drug Administration
              and coated it with L-phenylalanine, and found that in lab
              tests with mice it killed cancer cells effectively and
              very specifically, by causing them to self-destruct.<br>
              <br>
              The anti-cancer therapeutic nanoparticle is ultrasmall,
              with a diameter of 30 nanometres, or approximately 30,000
              times smaller than a strand of human hair, and is named
              "Nanoscopic phenylalanine Porous Amino Acid Mimic," or
              Nano-pPAAM,<br>
              <br>
              Their findings, published recently in the scientific
              journal Small, may hold promise for future design of
              nanotherapies, said the research team.<br>
              <br>
              Assistant Professor Dalton Tay from the School of
              Materials Science and Engineering, lead author of the
              study, said: "Against conventional wisdom, our approach
              involved using the nanomaterial as a drug instead as a
              drug-carrier. Here, the cancer-selective and killing
              properties of Nano-pPAAM are intrinsic and do not need to
              be 'activated' by any external stimuli. The amino acid
              L-phenylalanine acts as a 'trojan horse' -- a cloak to
              mask the nanotherapeutic on the inside."<br>
              <br>
              "By removing the drug component, we have effectively
              simplified the nanomedicine formulation and may overcome
              the numerous technological hurdles that are hindering the
              bench-to-bedside translation of drug-based nanomedicine."<br>
              <br>
              <b>Intrinsic anti-cancer therapeutic properties of
                Nano-pPAAM</b><br>
              <br>
              As a proof of concept, the scientists tested the efficacy
              of Nano-pPAAM in the lab and in mice and found that the
              nanoparticle killed about 80 per cent of breast, skin, and
              gastric cancer cells, which is comparable to conventional
              chemotherapeutic drugs like Cisplatin. Tumour growth in
              mice with human triple negative breast cancer cells was
              also significantly reduced compared to control models.<br>
              <br>
              Further investigations showed that the amino acid coating
              of Nano-pPAAM helped the nanoparticle to enter the cancer
              cells through the amino acid transporter cell LAT1. Once
              inside the cancer cells, Nano-pPAAM stimulates excessive
              reactive oxygen species (ROS) production -- a type of
              reactive molecule in the body -- causing cancer cells to
              self-destruct while remaining harmless to the healthy
              cells.<br>
              <br>
              Co-author Associate Professor Tan Nguan Soon from NTU's
              Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine said: "With current
              chemotherapy drug treatment, a common issue faced is that
              recurrent cancer becomes resistant to the drug. Our
              strategy does not involve the use of any pharmacological
              drugs but relies on the nanoparticles' unique properties
              to release catastrophic level of reactive oxygen species
              (ROS) to kill cancer cells."<br>
              <br>
              Providing an independent view, Associate Professor Tan Ern
              Yu, a breast cancer specialist at Tan Tock Seng Hospital
              said, "This novel approach could hold much promise for
              cancer cells that have failed to respond to conventional
              treatment like chemotherapy. Such cancers often have
              evolved mechanisms of resistance to the drugs currently in
              use, rendering them ineffective. However, the cancer cells
              could potentially still be susceptible to the 'Trojan
              horse' approach since it acts through a completely
              different mechanism -- one that the cells will not have
              adapted to."<br>
              <br>
              The scientists are now looking to further refine the
              design and chemistry of the Nano-pPAAM to make it more
              precise in targeting specific cancer types and achieve
              higher therapeutic efficacy.<br>
              <br>
              This includes combining their method with other therapies
              such as immunotherapy which uses the body's immune system
              to fight cancer.<br>

                  Mimicking Porous Nanotherapeutics with Intrinsic

                <b>Zhuoran Wu, et al.</b><br>

              <b>Abstract</b><br>
              Exogenous sources of amino acids are essential nutrients
              to fuel cancer growth. Here, the increased demand for
              amino acid displayed by cancer cells is unconventionally
              exploited as a design principle to replete cancer cells
              with apoptosis inducing nanoscopic porous amino acid
              mimics (Nano‐PAAM). A small library consisting of nine
              essential amino acids nanoconjugates (30 nm) are
              synthesized, and the in vitro anticancer activity is
              evaluated. Among the Nano‐PAAMs, l‐phenylalanine
              functionalized Nano‐PAAM (Nano‐pPAAM) has emerged as a
              novel nanotherapeutics with excellent intrinsic anticancer
              and cancer‐selective properties. The therapeutic efficacy
              of Nano‐pPAAM against a panel of human breast, gastric,
              and skin cancer cells could be ascribed to the specific
              targeting of the overexpressed human large neutral amino
              acid transporter SLC7A5 (LAT‐1) in cancer cells, and its
              intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) inducing
              properties of the nanoporous core. At the mechanistic
              level, it is revealed that Nano‐pPAAM could activate both
              the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways to exert a
              potent “double‐whammy” anticancer effect. The potential
              clinical utility of Nano‐pPAAM is further investigated
              using an MDA‐MB‐231 xenograft in NOD scid gamma mice,
              where an overall suppression of tumor growth by 60% is
              achieved without the aid of any drugs or application of
              external stimuli.<br>

              <div align="center"><b>Open letter from medical doctors
                  and health professionals to all Belgian authorities
                  and all Belgian media.</b><br>
              </div>
              <br>
              We, Belgian doctors and health professionals, wish to
              express our serious concern about the evolution of the
              situation in the recent months surrounding the outbreak of
              the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We call on politicians to be
              independently and critically informed in the
              decision-making process and in the compulsory
              implementation of corona-measures. We ask for an open
              debate, where all experts are represented without any form
              of censorship. After the initial panic surrounding
              covid-19, the objective facts now show a completely
              different picture – there is no medical justification for
              any emergency policy anymore.<br>
              The current crisis management has become totally
              disproportionate and causes more damage than it does any
              good.<br>
              We call for an end to all measures and ask for an
              immediate restoration of our normal democratic governance
              and legal structures and of all our civil liberties.<br>
              <br>
              ‘A cure must not be worse than the problem’ is a thesis
              that is more relevant than ever in the current situation.
              We note, however, that the collateral damage now being
              caused to the population will have a greater impact in the
              short and long term on all sections of the population than
              the number of people now being safeguarded from corona.<br>
              In our opinion, the current corona measures and the strict
              penalties for non-compliance with them are contrary to the
              values formulated by the Belgian Supreme Health Council,
              which, until recently, as the health authority, has always
              ensured quality medicine in our country: “Science –
              Expertise – Quality – Impartiality – Independence –
              Transparency”. 1<br>
              <br>
              We believe that the policy has introduced mandatory
              measures that are not sufficiently scientifically based,
              unilaterally directed, and that there is not enough space
              in the media for an open debate in which different views
              and opinions are heard. In addition, each municipality and
              province now has the authorisation to add its own
              measures, whether well-founded or not.<br>
              <br>
              Moreover, the strict repressive policy on corona strongly
              contrasts with the government’s minimal policy when it
              comes to disease prevention, strengthening our own immune
              system through a healthy lifestyle, optimal care with
              attention for the individual and investment in care
              personnel.2<br>
              <br>
              <b>The concept of health</b><br>
              <br>
              In 1948, the WHO defined health as follows: ‘Health is a
              state of complete physical, mental and social well-being
              and not merely the absence of disease or other physical
              impairment’.3<br>
              <br>
              Health, therefore, is a broad concept that goes beyond the
              physical and also relates to the emotional and social
              well-being of the individual. Belgium also has a duty,
              from the point of view of subscribing to fundamental human
              rights, to include these human rights in its
              decision-making when it comes to measures taken in the
              context of public health. 4<br>
              The current global measures taken to combat SARS-CoV-2
              violate to a large extent this view of health and human
              rights. Measures include compulsory wearing of a mask
              (also in open air and during sporting activities, and in
              some municipalities even when there are no other people in
              the vicinity), physical distancing, social isolation,
              compulsory quarantine for some groups and hygiene
              measures.<br>
              <br>
              <b>The predicted pandemic with millions of deaths</b><br>
              <br>
              At the beginning of the pandemic, the measures were
              understandable and widely supported, even if there were
              differences in implementation in the countries around us.
              The WHO originally predicted a pandemic that would claim
              3.4% victims, in other words millions of deaths, and a
              highly contagious virus for which no treatment or vaccine
              was available.&nbsp; This would put unprecedented pressure
              on the intensive care units (ICUs) of our hospitals.<br>
              <br>
              This led to a global alarm situation, never seen in the
              history of mankind: “flatten the curve” was represented by
              a lockdown that shut down the entire society and economy
              and quarantined healthy people. Social distancing became
              the new normal in anticipation of a rescue vaccine.<br>
              <br>
              <b>The facts about covid-19</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              Gradually, the alarm bell was sounded from many sources:
              the objective facts showed a completely different reality.
              5 6<br>
              <br>
              The course of covid-19 followed the course of a normal
              wave of infection similar to a flu season. As every year,
              we see a mix of flu viruses following the curve: first the
              rhinoviruses, then the influenza A and B viruses, followed
              by the coronaviruses. There is nothing different from what
              we normally see.<br>
              <br>
              The use of the non-specific PCR test, which produces many
              false positives, showed an exponential picture.&nbsp; This
              test was rushed through with an emergency procedure and
              was never seriously self-tested. The creator expressly
              warned that this test was intended for research and not
              for diagnostics.7<br>
              The PCR test works with cycles of amplification of genetic
              material – a piece of genome is amplified each time. Any
              contamination (e.g. other viruses, debris from old virus
              genomes) can possibly result in false positives.8<br>
              <br>
              The test does not measure how many viruses are present in
              the sample. A real viral infection means a massive
              presence of viruses, the so-called virus load. If someone
              tests positive, this does not mean that that person is
              actually clinically infected, is ill or is going to become
              ill. Koch’s postulate was not fulfilled (“The pure agent
              found in a patient with complaints can provoke the same
              complaints in a healthy person”).<br>
              <br>
              Since a positive PCR test does not automatically indicate
              active infection or infectivity, this does not justify the
              social measures taken, which are based solely on these
              tests. 9 10<br>
              <br>
              <b>Lockdown.</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              If we compare the waves of infection in countries with
              strict lockdown policies to countries that did not impose
              lockdowns (Sweden, Iceland …), we see similar
              curves.&nbsp; So there is no link between the imposed
              lockdown and the course of the infection. Lockdown has not
              led to a lower mortality rate.<br>
              <br>
              If we look at the date of application of the imposed
              lockdowns we see that the lockdowns were set after the
              peak was already over and the number of cases decreasing.
              The drop was therefore not the result of the taken
              measures. 11<br>
              As every year, it seems that climatic conditions (weather,
              temperature and humidity) and growing immunity are more
              likely to reduce the wave of infection.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Our immune system</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              For thousands of years, the human body has been exposed
              daily to moisture and droplets containing infectious
              microorganisms (viruses, bacteria and fungi).<br>
              <br>
              The penetration of these microorganisms is prevented by an
              advanced defence mechanism – the immune system. A strong
              immune system relies on normal daily exposure to these
              microbial influences. Overly hygienic measures have a
              detrimental effect on our immunity. 12 13 Only people with
              a weak or faulty immune system should be protected by
              extensive hygiene or social distancing.<br>
              <br>
              Influenza will re-emerge in the autumn (in combination
              with covid-19) and a possible decrease in natural
              resilience may lead to further casualties.<br>
              <br>
              Our immune system consists of two parts: a congenital,
              non-specific immune system and an adaptive immune system.<br>
              <br>
              The non-specific immune system forms a first barrier:
              skin, saliva, gastric juice, intestinal mucus, vibratory
              hair cells, commensal flora, … and prevents the attachment
              of micro-organisms to tissue.<br>
              <br>
              If they do attach, macrophages can cause the
              microorganisms to be encapsulated and destroyed.<br>
              <br>
              The adaptive immune system consists of mucosal immunity
              (IgA antibodies, mainly produced by cells in the
              intestines and lung epithelium), cellular immunity (T-cell
              activation), which can be generated in contact with
              foreign substances or microorganisms, and humoral immunity
              (IgM and IgG antibodies produced by the B cells).<br>
              <br>
              Recent research shows that both systems are highly
              entangled.<br>
              <br>
              It appears that most people already have a congenital or
              general immunity to e.g. influenza and other viruses. This
              is confirmed by the findings on the cruise ship Diamond
              Princess, which was quarantined because of a few
              passengers who died of Covid-19. Most of the passengers
              were elderly and were in an ideal situation of
              transmission on the ship. However, 75% did not appear to
              be infected. So even in this high-risk group, the majority
              are resistant to the virus.<br>
              <br>
              A study in the journal Cell shows that most people
              neutralise the coronavirus by mucosal (IgA) and cellular
              immunity (T-cells), while experiencing few or no symptoms
              14.<br>
              <br>
              Researchers found up to 60% SARS-Cov-2 reactivity with
              CD4+T cells in a non-infected population, suggesting
              cross-reactivity with other cold (corona) viruses.15<br>
              <br>
              Most people therefore already have a congenital or
              cross-immunity because they were already in contact with
              variants of the same virus.<br>
              <br>
              The antibody formation (IgM and IgG) by B-cells only
              occupies a relatively small part of our immune system.
              This may explain why, with an antibody percentage of
              5-10%, there may be a group immunity anyway. The efficacy
              of vaccines is assessed precisely on the basis of whether
              or not we have these antibodies. This is a
              misrepresentation.<br>
              <br>
              Most people who test positive (PCR) have no complaints.
              Their immune system is strong enough. Strengthening
              natural immunity is a much more logical approach.
              Prevention is an important, insufficiently highlighted
              pillar: healthy, full-fledged nutrition, exercise in fresh
              air, without a mask, stress reduction and nourishing
              emotional and social contacts.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Consequences of social isolation on physical and mental
                health</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              Social isolation and economic damage led to an increase in
              depression, anxiety, suicides, intra-family violence and
              child abuse.16<br>
              <br>
              Studies have shown that the more social and emotional
              commitments people have, the more resistant they are to
              viruses. It is much more likely that isolation and
              quarantine have fatal consequences. 17<br>
              <br>
              The isolation measures have also led to physical
              inactivity in many older people due to their being forced
              to stay indoors. However, sufficient exercise has a
              positive effect on cognitive functioning, reducing
              depressive complaints and anxiety and improving physical
              health, energy levels, well-being and, in general, quality
              of life.18<br>
              <br>
              Fear, persistent stress and loneliness induced by social
              distancing have a proven negative influence on
              psychological and general health. 19<br>
              <br>
              A highly contagious virus with millions of deaths without
              any treatment?<br>
              <br>
              Mortality turned out to be many times lower than expected
              and close to that of a normal seasonal flu (0.2%). 20<br>
              <br>
              The number of registered corona deaths therefore still
              seems to be overestimated.<br>
              <br>
              There is a difference between death by corona and death
              with corona. Humans are often carriers of multiple viruses
              and potentially pathogenic bacteria at the same time.
              Taking into account the fact that most people who
              developed serious symptoms suffered from additional
              pathology, one cannot simply conclude that the
              corona-infection was the cause of death. This was mostly
              not taken into account in the statistics.<br>
              <br>
              The most vulnerable groups can be clearly identified. The
              vast majority of deceased patients were 80 years of age or
              older. The majority (70%) of the deceased, younger than 70
              years, had an underlying disorder, such as cardiovascular
              suffering, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease or
              obesity. The vast majority of infected persons (&gt;98%)
              did not or hardly became ill or recovered spontaneously.<br>
              <br>
              Meanwhile, there is an affordable, safe and efficient
              therapy available for those who do show severe symptoms of
              disease in the form of HCQ (hydroxychloroquine), zinc and
              azithromycin. Rapidly applied this therapy leads to
              recovery and often prevents hospitalisation. Hardly anyone
              has to die now.<br>
              <br>
              This effective therapy has been confirmed by the clinical
              experience of colleagues in the field with impressive
              results. This contrasts sharply with the theoretical
              criticism (insufficient substantiation by double-blind
              studies) which in some countries (e.g. the Netherlands)
              has even led to a ban on this therapy. A meta-analysis in
              The Lancet, which could not demonstrate an effect of HCQ,
              was withdrawn. The primary data sources used proved to be
              unreliable and 2 out of 3 authors were in conflict of
              interest. However, most of the guidelines based on this
              study remained unchanged … 48 49<br>
              <br>
              We have serious questions about this state of affairs.<br>
              <br>
              In the US, a group of doctors in the field, who see
              patients on a daily basis, united in “America’s Frontline
              Doctors” and gave a press conference which has been
              watched millions of times.21 51<br>
              French Prof Didier Raoult of the Institut d’Infectiologie
              de Marseille (IHU) also presented this promising
              combination therapy as early as April. Dutch GP Rob Elens,
              who cured many patients in his practice with HCQ and zinc,
              called on colleagues in a petition for freedom of
              therapy.22<br>
              <br>
              The definitive evidence comes from the epidemiological
              follow-up in Switzerland: mortality rates compared with
              and without this therapy.23<br>
              <br>
              From the distressing media images of ARDS (acute
              respiratory distress syndrome) where people were
              suffocating and given artificial respiration in agony, we
              now know that this was caused by an exaggerated immune
              response with intravascular coagulation in the pulmonary
              blood vessels. The administration of blood thinners and
              dexamethasone and the avoidance of artificial ventilation,
              which was found to cause additional damage to lung tissue,
              means that this dreaded complication, too, is virtually
              not fatal anymore. 47<br>
              <br>
              It is therefore not a killer virus, but a well-treatable
              condition.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Propagation</b><br>
              <br>
              Spreading occurs by drip infection (only for patients who
              cough or sneeze) and aerosols in closed, unventilated
              rooms. Contamination is therefore not possible in the open
              air. Contact tracing and epidemiological studies show that
              healthy people (or positively tested asymptomatic
              carriers) are virtually unable to transmit the virus.
              Healthy people therefore do not put each other at risk. 24
              25<br>
              Transfer via objects (e.g. money, shopping or shopping
              trolleys) has not been scientifically proven.26 27 28<br>
              <br>
              All this seriously calls into question the whole policy of
              social distancing and compulsory mouth masks for healthy
              people – there is no scientific basis for this.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Masks</b><br>
              <br>
              Oral masks belong in contexts where contacts with proven
              at-risk groups or people with upper respiratory complaints
              take place, and in a medical context/hospital-retirement
              home setting. They reduce the risk of droplet infection by
              sneezing or coughing. Oral masks in healthy individuals
              are ineffective against the spread of viral infections. 29
              30 31<br>
              <br>
              Wearing a mask is not without side effects. 32 33 Oxygen
              deficiency (headache, nausea, fatigue, loss of
              concentration) occurs fairly quickly, an effect similar to
              altitude sickness. Every day we now see patients
              complaining of headaches, sinus problems, respiratory
              problems and hyperventilation due to wearing masks. In
              addition, the accumulated CO2 leads to a toxic
              acidification of the organism which affects our immunity.
              Some experts even warn of an increased transmission of the
              virus in case of inappropriate use of the mask.34<br>
              <br>
              Our Labour Code (Codex 6) refers to a CO2 content
              (ventilation in workplaces) of 900 ppm, maximum 1200 ppm
              in special circumstances. After wearing a mask for one
              minute, this toxic limit is considerably exceeded to
              values that are three to four times higher than these
              maximum values. Anyone who wears a mask is therefore in an
              extreme poorly ventilated room. 35<br>
              <br>
              Inappropriate use of masks without a comprehensive medical
              cardio-pulmonary test file is therefore not recommended by
              recognised safety specialists for workers.<br>
              Hospitals have a sterile environment in their operating
              rooms where staff wear masks and there is precise
              regulation of humidity / temperature with appropriately
              monitored oxygen flow to compensate for this, thus meeting
              strict safety standards. 36<br>
              <br>
              <b>A second corona wave?</b><br>
              <br>
              A second wave is now being discussed in Belgium, with a
              further tightening of the measures as a result. However,
              closer examination of Sciensano’s figures37 shows that,
              although there has been an increase in the number of
              infections since mid-July, there was no increase in
              hospital admissions or deaths at that time. It is
              therefore not a second wave of corona, but a so-called
              “case chemistry” due to an increased number of tests. 50<br>
              <br>
              The number of hospital admissions or deaths showed a
              shortlasting minimal increase in recent weeks, but in
              interpreting it, we must take into account the recent
              heatwave. In addition, the vast majority of the victims
              are still in the population group &gt;75 years.<br>
              <br>
              This indicates that the proportion of the measures taken
              in relation to the working population and young people is
              disproportionate to the intended objectives.<br>
              <br>
              The vast majority of the positively tested “infected”
              persons are in the age group of the active population,
              which does not develop any or merely limited symptoms, due
              to a well-functioning immune system.<br>
              So nothing has changed – the peak is over.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Strengthening a prevention policy</b><br>
              <br>
              The corona measures form a striking contrast to the
              minimal policy pursued by the government until now, when
              it comes to well-founded measures with proven health
              benefits such as the sugar tax, the ban on (e-)cigarettes
              and making healthy food, exercise and social support
              networks financially attractive and widely accessible. It
              is a missed opportunity for a better prevention policy
              that could have brought about a change in mentality in all
              sections of the population with clear results in terms of
              public health. At present, only 3% of the health care
              budget goes to prevention. 2<br>
              <br>
              <b>The Hippocratic Oath</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              As a doctor, we took the Hippocratic Oath:<br>
              <br>
              “I will above all care for my patients, promote their
              health and alleviate their suffering”.<br>
              “I will inform my patients correctly.”<br>
              “Even under pressure, I will not use my medical knowledge
              for practices that are against humanity.”<br>
              <br>
              The current measures force us to act against this oath.
              Other health professionals have a similar code.<br>
              <br>
              The ‘primum non nocere’, which every doctor and health
              professional assumes, is also undermined by the current
              measures and by the prospect of the possible introduction
              of a generalised vaccine, which is not subject to
              extensive prior testing.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Vaccine</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              Survey studies on influenza vaccinations show that in 10
              years we have only succeeded three times in developing a
              vaccine with an efficiency rate of more than 50%.
              Vaccinating our elderly appears to be inefficient. Over 75
              years of age, the efficacy is almost non-existent.38<br>
              <br>
              Due to the continuous natural mutation of viruses, as we
              also see every year in the case of the influenza virus, a
              vaccine is at most a temporary solution, which requires
              new vaccines each time afterwards. An untested vaccine,
              which is implemented by emergency procedure and for which
              the manufacturers have already obtained legal immunity
              from possible harm, raises serious questions. 39 40 We do
              not wish to use our patients as guinea pigs.<br>
              <br>
              On a global scale, 700 000 cases of damage or death are
              expected as a result of the vaccine.41<br>
              <br>
              If 95% of people experience Covid-19 virtually
              symptom-free, the risk of exposure to an untested vaccine
              is irresponsible.<br>
              <br>
              The role of the media and the official communication plan<br>
              <br>
              Over the past few months, newspaper, radio and TV makers
              seemed to stand almost uncritically behind the panel of
              experts and the government, there, where it is precisely
              the press that should be critical and prevent one-sided
              governmental communication. This has led to a public
              communication in our news media, that was more like
              propaganda than objective reporting.<br>
              <br>
              In our opinion, it is the task of journalism to bring news
              as objectively and neutrally as possible, aimed at finding
              the truth and critically controlling power, with
              dissenting experts also being given a forum in which to
              express themselves.<br>
              <br>
              This view is supported by the journalistic codes of
              ethics.42<br>
              <br>
              The official story that a lockdown was necessary, that
              this was the only possible solution, and that everyone
              stood behind this lockdown, made it difficult for people
              with a different view, as well as experts, to express a
              different opinion.<br>
              <br>
              Alternative opinions were ignored or ridiculed. We have
              not seen open debates in the media, where different views
              could be expressed.<br>
              <br>
              We were also surprised by the many videos and articles by
              many scientific experts and authorities, which were and
              are still being removed from social media. We feel that
              this does not fit in with a free, democratic
              constitutional state, all the more so as it leads to
              tunnel vision. This policy also has a paralysing effect
              and feeds fear and concern in society. In this context, we
              reject the intention of censorship of dissidents in the
              European Union! 43<br>
              <br>
              The way in which Covid-19 has been portrayed by
              politicians and the media has not done the situation any
              good either. War terms were popular and warlike language
              was not lacking. There has often been mention of a ‘war’
              with an ‘invisible enemy’ who has to be ‘defeated’. The
              use in the media of phrases such as ‘care heroes in the
              front line’ and ‘corona victims’ has further fuelled fear,
              as has the idea that we are globally dealing with a
              ‘killer virus’.<br>
              <br>
              The relentless bombardment with figures, that were
              unleashed on the population day after day, hour after
              hour, without interpreting those figures, without
              comparing them to flu deaths in other years, without
              comparing them to deaths from other causes, has induced a
              real psychosis of fear in the population. This is not
              information, this is manipulation.<br>
              <br>
              We deplore the role of the WHO in this, which has called
              for the infodemic (i.e. all divergent opinions from the
              official discourse, including by experts with different
              views) to be silenced by an unprecedented media
              censorship.43 44<br>
              <br>
              We urgently call on the media to take their
              responsibilities here!<br>

              <b><br>
              </b><b>Emergency law versus Human Rights</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              The general principle of good governance calls for the
              proportionality of government decisions to be weighed up
              in the light of the Higher Legal Standards: any
              interference by government must comply with the
              fundamental rights as protected in the European Convention
              on Human Rights (ECHR). Interference by public authorities
              is only permitted in crisis situations. In other words,
              discretionary decisions must be proportionate to an
              absolute necessity.<br>
              <br>
              The measures currently taken concern interference in the
              exercise of, among other things, the right to respect of
              private and family life, freedom of thought, conscience
              and religion, freedom of expression and freedom of
              assembly and association, the right to education, etc.,
              and must therefore comply with fundamental rights as
              protected by the European Convention on Human Rights
              (ECHR).<br>
              <br>
              For example, in accordance with Article 8(2) of the ECHR,
              interference with the right to private and family life is
              permissible only if the measures are necessary in the
              interests of national security, public safety, the
              economic well-being of the country, the protection of
              public order and the prevention of criminal offences, the
              protection of health or the protection of the rights and
              freedoms of others, the regulatory text on which the
              interference is based must be sufficiently clear,
              foreseeable and proportionate to the objectives pursued.45<br>
              <br>
              The predicted pandemic of millions of deaths seemed to
              respond to these crisis conditions, leading to the
              establishment of an emergency government. Now that the
              objective facts show something completely different, the
              condition of inability to act otherwise (no time to
              evaluate thoroughly if there is an emergency) is no longer
              in place. Covid-19 is not a killervirus, but a well
              treatable condition with a mortality rate comparable to
              the seasonal flu. In other words, there is no longer an
              insurmountable obstacle to public health.<br>
              <br>
              There is no state of emergency.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Immense damage caused by the current policies</b><br>
              <br>
              An open discussion on corona measures means that, in
              addition to the years of life gained by corona patients,
              we must also take into account other factors affecting the
              health of the entire population. These include damage in
              the psychosocial domain (increase in depression, anxiety,
              suicides, intra-family violence and child abuse)16 and
              economic damage.<br>
              <br>
              If we take this collateral damage into account, the
              current policy is out of all proportion, the proverbial
              use of a sledgehammer to crack a nut.<br>
              <br>
              We find it shocking that the government is invoking health
              as a reason for the emergency law.<br>
              <br>
              As doctors and health professionals, in the face of a
              virus which, in terms of its harmfulness, mortality and
              transmissibility, approaches the seasonal influenza, we
              can only reject these extremely disproportionate measures.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We therefore demand an immediate end to
              all measures.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are questioning the legitimacy of
              the current advisory experts, who meet behind closed
              doors.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following on from ACU 2020 46
              https://acu2020.org/nederlandse-versie/ we call for an
              in-depth examination of the role of the WHO and the
              possible influence of conflicts of interest in this
              organisation. It was also at the heart of the fight
              against the “infodemic”, i.e. the systematic censorship of
              all dissenting opinions in the media. This is unacceptable
              for a democratic state governed by the rule of law.43<br>
              <br>
              <b>Distribution of this letter</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              We would like to make a public appeal to our professional
              associations and fellow carers to give their opinion on
              the current measures.<br>
              <br>
              We draw attention to and call for an open discussion in
              which carers can and dare to speak out.<br>
              <br>
              With this open letter, we send out the signal that
              progress on the same footing does more harm than good, and
              call on politicians to inform themselves independently and
              critically about the available evidence – including that
              from experts with different views, as long as it is based
              on sound science – when rolling out a policy, with the aim
              of promoting optimum health.<br>
              <br>
              With concern, hope and in a personal capacity.<br>

              Felix E. Feist and released by RKO Radio Pictures. The
              film is very loosely based on the 1928 novel of the same
              name by S. Fowler Wright, with the setting changed from
              England to the United States. It follows a small group of
              survivors after a series of unexplained natural disasters
              erupt around the world and destroy human civilization,
              including a massive tsunami which inundates New York

              A "Climate Lockdown," to extend into perpetuity, reveals
              the true nature of #COVID1984: normalization of the police
              state, "climate tracing" and now "climate lockdown" as
              technocrats shove society towards their post-human future.
              Their hand is forced as the Global Warming narrative
              breaks down and the Modern Grand Solar Minimum goes
              mainstream. In their panic, they are seizing for total
              control -- we are at a demarcation point:&nbsp; we either
              fight now, or forever lose the opportunity. Christian
              breaks it down on this Ice Age Farmer broadcast.<br>
