                  Dr. Roger Hodkinson is the former Chairman of the
                  Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons committee in
                  Ottawa, he was once CEO of a large private medical
                  laboratory in Edmonton, Alberta, and for the past 20
                  years has held the position as Chairman of a Medical
                  Biotechnology company based in North Carolina
                  currently tasked with selling a COVID-19 test. He is a
                  medical specialist in pathology, which includes
                  virology, who trained at Cambridge University in the
                  UK — he is perfectly positioned to speak on this
                  topic.<br>
                  <br>
                  In a recent Edmonton City Council Community and Public
                  Services Committee meeting (the audio from which is
                  currently gaining traction on YouTube), Dr. Hodkinson
                  says: “The bottom line is there is utterly unfounded
                  public hysteria driven by the media and politicians.
                  It’s outrageous. This is the greatest hoax ever
                  perpetrated on an unsuspecting public.<br>
                  <br>
                  “[COVID-19] is nothing more than a bad flu season.
                  This is not Ebola. It’s not SARS. It’s politics
                  playing medicine, and that’s a very dangerous game.”<br>
                  <br>
                  Hodkinson goes on to stress that no action of any kind
                  is needed, other than what happened during last year’s
                  flu season: “If we felt ill, we stayed home, we took
                  chicken noodle soup, we didn’t visit granny, we
                  decided when we would return to work; we didn’t need
                  anyone to tell us.”<br>
                  <br>
                  “Masks are utterly useless”<br>
                  <br>
                  “There is no evidence base for their effectiveness
                  whatsoever.<br>
                  <br>
                  “[Masks] are simply virtue signalling.<br>
                  <br>
                  “Seeing these people walking around like lemmings
                  obeying, without any knowledge base, to put the mask
                  on their face.”<br>
                  <br>
                  “Social Distancing is also Useless”<br>
                  <br>
                  “COVID is spread by aerosols, which travel 30
                  meters-or-so before landing.”<br>
                  <br>
                  “Closures of Schools and Businesses have had such
                  Terrible consequences”<br>
                  <br>
                  “Everywhere should be open tomorrow, as was stated in
                  the Great Barrington Declaration (linked below).<br>
                  <br>
                  “Positive Test Results DO NOT mean a clinical
                  Infection”<br>
                  <br>
                  “All testing should stop, unless you’re presenting to
                  hospital with some respiratory problem … it’s driving
                  public hysteria, and all testing should stop.<br>
                  <br>
                  “All that should be done is to protect the vulnerable.<br>
                  <br>
                  “And I would remind you all that using the provinces
                  [Alberta’s] own statistics, the risk of death under 65
                  is 1 in 300,000. You’ve got to get a grip on this. The
                  scale of the response … with no evidence for it, is
                  utterly ridiculous.<br>
                  <br>
                  “Suicides, business closures, [cancelled] funerals,
                  weddings, etc., etc. — it’s simply outrageous, it’s
                  just another bad flu, and [people] have got to get
                  their minds around that.”<br>
                  <br>
                  Hodkison concludes with some advice for policy makers
                  in Alberta: “Let people make their own decisions. You
                  should be totally out of the business of medicine.
                  You’re being led down the garden path by the chief
                  medical officer of health in this province. I’m
                  absolutely outraged that this has reached this level.
                  It should all stop tomorrow. Thank you very much.”<br>

                  he has been interned in a psychiatric hospital against
                  his will. Jean Bernard Fourtillan professor of
                  pharmacology and toxicology speaks out about the
                  origin of SARS CoV virus. He is a hero among the
                  heroes.<br>
                  Fourtillan exposing the SARS-COV- 2 conspiracy. They
                  faked it so that they could roll out the genocidal
                  vaccine. This is why they locked him up.<br>
                  I would add that it looks to me as if the purpose of
                  the vaccine is to make sure that the Covid-19
                  biological weapon goes viral everywhere. So far, all
                  this talk of asymptomatic carriers has been bollocks,
                  but once ignorant, dangerous people willingly take the
                  vaccine, they will become real asymptomatic carriers
                  and god help the rest of us who wouldn't touch the
                  vaccine with a bloody barge pole! In my view, these
                  dangerous vaccine-takers should be isolated on some
                  godforsaken island reserved for the monumentally
                  stupid and kept well away from the rest of us so they

                  </b>Exclusive interview with Jovan Hutton Pulitzer
                  about his ability to digitally examine millions of
                  ballots to scientifically prove if ballots are
                  authentic or fake. He says we need to access the
                  physical and digital ballots and within seconds can
                  determine authenticity. His technology and approach
                  have nothing to do with accessing the actual Dominion
                  or other vendor machines.<br>
                  <br>
                  ...When I started looking at ballots… I realized that
                  everybody was speaking geek…It’s a real simple fact to
                  prove that there was massive fraud in this election...<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can take the physical ballot,
                  the image scan of the ballot in the machine, the CVR
                  file in the machine, and I can even take a shredded
                  bag of ballots and do what we do.&nbsp; I want
                  everybody to understand these physical ballots from
                  the election, when they go into the machine, it
                  basically makes a duplicate copy.&nbsp; That’s your
                  property as an American citizen.&nbsp; We own it for
                  22 months after the election.&nbsp; And so when these

                  realized it was all technical smoke and mirrors, to
                  fool judges, to fool lawyers, to say oh we can’t

                  </b>A company that provides voting systems in 28
                  states uses an Internet technology firm that was
                  hacked.<br>
                  Dominion Voting Systems uses SolarWinds software,
                  according to a Dominion web page.<br>
                  SolarWinds does not list Dominion on its partial
                  customer listing but says its products and services
                  are used by more than 300,000 customers around the
                  world, including all five branches of the U.S.
                  military and more than 425 of the U.S. Fortune 500.<br>
                  The situation with SolarWinds software enabled hackers
                  to gain access to the U.S. Commerce Department and,
                  reportedly, the Treasury Department.<br>
                  SolarWinds Orion products are currently being
                  exploited by malicious actors, the Department of
                  Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure
                  Agency (CISA) said. The tactic lets an attacker gain
                  access to network traffic management systems.<br>
                  The only known mitigation measure currently available
                  is to disconnect affected devices, according to the
                  agency.<br>
                  SolarWinds recommended customers upgrade their Orion
                  platform to a recent version. If customers aren’t able
                  to upgrade immediately, they were urged to disable
                  Internet access for the platform and limit ports and
                  connections to only what is necessary. A patch is
                  expected on Tuesday...<br>

                  <b>Abstract<br>
                  </b>We performed a retrospective analysis spanning ten
                  years of pediatric practice focused on patients with
                  variable vaccination born into a practice, presenting
                  a unique opportunity to study the effects of variable
                  vaccination on outcomes. The average total incidence
                  of billed office visits per outcome related to the
                  outcomes were compared across groups (Relative
                  Incidence of Office Visit (RIOV)). RIOV is shown to be
                  more powerful than odds ratio of diagnoses. Full
                  cohort, cumulative incidence analyses, matched for
                  days of care, and matched for family history analyses
                  were conducted across quantiles of vaccine uptake.
                  Increased office visits related to many diagnoses were
                  robust to days-of-care-matched analyses, family
                  history, gender block, age block, and false discovery
                  risk. Many outcomes had high RIOV odds ratios after
                  matching for days-of-care (e.g., anemia (6.334),
                  asthma (3.496), allergic rhinitis (6.479), and
                  sinusitis (3.529), all significant under the Z-test).
                  Developmental disorders were determined to be
                  difficult to study due to extremely low prevalence in
                  the practice, potentially attributable to high rates
                  of vaccine cessation upon adverse events and family
                  history of autoimmunity. Remarkably, zero of the 561
                  unvaccinated patients in the study had attention
                  deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) compared to
                  0.063% of the (partially and fully) vaccinated. The
                  implications of these results for the net public
                  health effects of whole-population vaccination and
                  with respect for informed consent on human health are
                  compelling. Our results give agency to calls for
                  research conducted by individuals who are independent
                  of any funding sources related to the vaccine
                  industry. While the low rates of developmental
                  disorders prevented sufficiently powered hypothesis
                  testing, it is notable that the overall rate of autism
                  spectrum disorder (0.84%) in the cohort is half that
                  of the US national rate (1.69%). The practice-wide
                  rate of ADHD was roughly half of the national rate.
                  The data indicate that unvaccinated children in the
                  practice are not unhealthier than the vaccinated and
                  indeed the overall results may indicate that the
                  unvaccinated pediatric patients in this practice are
                  healthier overall than the vaccinated. <br>

                  </b>The doctors concur that Pfizer’s vaccine studies
                  should be halted until a credible study design can be
                  presented, one that doesn’t falsify data endpoints and
                  one that addresses a host of serious safety concerns.
                  The doctors warn that Pfizer is conflating
                  non-specific symptoms of illness with COVID-19
                  diagnoses for the control arm while using inaccurate,
                  high cycle PCR tests for a diagnosis. The doctors warn
                  that the vaccine’s efficacy is being contorted because
                  the study design fails to properly diagnose cases of
                  COVID-19 and fails to confirm infection using the
                  Sanger sequencing method. They conclude that risk of
                  disease and potential vaccine benefit cannot be
                  measured or determined with accuracy. They demand a
                  halt to all human experimentation with these mRNA
                  injections.<br>

                    Abstract<br>
                  </b>As an increasing number of wireless devices are
                  introduced to our daily lives, long-term
                  environmentally stable conductive fabrics that can
                  shield against electromagnetic radiation are
                  increasingly desired. Herein, conventional cotton and
                  linen fabrics were dip-coated in additive-free,
                  aqueous Ti3C2Tx MXene dyes, which consist of only
                  two-dimensional Ti3C2Tx flakes dispersed in water, to
                  fabricate highly conductive fabrics for
                  electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding. Ti3C2Tx
                  loading and electrical conductivity of the fabrics
                  increased with the number of dip-coating cycles. After
                  only 4 dip-coating cycles, EMI shielding effectiveness
                  (SE) of Ti3C2Tx-coated (&lt;15 wt.%) cotton and linen
                  fabrics reached ∼40 dB over the X-band range. After 24
                  dip-coating cycles, the total EMI SE was increased to
                  ∼80 dB in Ti3C2Tx-coated cotton (54 wt.%) and linen
                  (48 wt.%) fabrics, which is higher than commercial
                  metal-based conductive fabrics tested in this study.
                  The average EMI SE performance of Ti3C2Tx-coated
                  cotton and linen fabrics only decreased by ∼8% and
                  ∼13%, respectively, after storage under ambient
                  conditions for two years. This work suggests an
                  attractive alternative to current metal-based
                  conductive dyes and provides valuable insights into
                  development of environmentally stable wearable EMI
                  shielding materials.<br>

                  IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT<br>
                  I am sorry to announce that at the end of December
                  2020 (about 3 weeks from now) my wife, Jackie and I
                  will be shutting down our Free Energy Website and
                  periodic Newsletter service.&nbsp; Our company, Clear
                  Tech, Inc., which has brought you these services free
                  of charge for 20 years, has been running on an
                  increasingly tight budget recently.&nbsp; The changes
                  in the economy due to the Covid-19 pandemic have made
                  this situation even more difficult.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather
                  than run the company into debt, we have decided to
                  shut down those aspects of the business that are no
                  longer profitable...<br>

                  Miami, Fla, April 4, 1939 (UP)<br>
                  Reprinted in the “Citizen Advertiser” of Auburn, New
                  York.<br>
                  <br>
                  “W. F. Skinner proudly displays his latest invention,
                  a device that multiplies power in a startling fashion.<br>
                  <br>
                  Skinner has great hopes for the principle he embodied
                  in his device, which he calls “a gravity power
                  machine”. He said, for example, he believes the
                  machine’s principle could be carried to a point where
                  a one-horsepower motor would provide electricity for a
                  community of 2,500 people at a total cost of only $5 a
                  month.<br>
                  <br>
                  “Almost any engineer will tell you that what this
                  machine does is impossible” said Skinner, and then
                  proceeded to demonstrate in his workshop here.<br>
                  <br>
                  His working model of the “gravity power machine” was
                  run by a one-eighth horsepower motor. The device, in
                  turn, operated a heavy-duty, 12-foot lathe, a six-foot
                  drill press and a hack saw from the same shaft at the
                  same time.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Normal Power Cited</b><br>
                  “Almost any engineer will tell you that to run even
                  that heavy duty lathe and produce the quarter-inch
                  shavings from a steel bar like it does would take a
                  two-horsepower motor” Skinner said.<br>
                  <br>
                  The “gravity power machine” consists of a steel
                  framework containing four shafts controlled by
                  eccentrics. On each shaft is an off-balance weight
                  which Skinner said was “about the secret of the whole
                  thing”.<br>
                  <br>
                  He explained that the shafts, turning in the
                  eccentrics, moved the weights in a circular motion at
                  60 revolutions per minute. Because the weights are
                  off-balance, he said, they are always “falling”,
                  producing the multiplication of power.<br>
                  <br>
                  The “falling”, Skinner said, is more correctly a
                  following of the weights to new centers of gravity
                  caused by the changing positions of the shafts. The
                  weights do not actually fall. The one-eighth
                  horsepower electric motor, Skinner said, was used only
                  for power to turn the eccentrics and the “gravity
                  power machine” provided the power, in turn, to operate
                  the shop.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>1200 Per Cent Step Up</b><br>
                  Skinner estimated the “gravity power machine” would
                  increase the horsepower of a motor about 1200 per cent
                  (12 times). A one horsepower motor, he believed, with
                  a perfected “gravity power machine” to multiple its
                  output, could be made to drive a generator large
                  enough to produce electricity for 3,500 persons. And
                  the operating cost would be only about $5 a month, he
                  estimated. [This suggests that higher gains than “12
                  times” are possible.]<br>
                  <br>
                  The machine Skinner exhibited was the fifth he has
                  built in the 14 years he has been “working up the
                  idea”.<br>
                  <br>
                  A number of engineers have inspected his invention, he
                  said. One of them was A. P. Michaels, a Jackson, Fla.,
                  consulting engineer, who gave Skinner a letter
                  describing the machine as “a practical device and will
                  have a definite field where it is necessary to use
                  power to drive equipment. It should result in a very
                  large saving of power needed”.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>One Engineer Silent</b><br>
                  George C. Estill, electrical engineer and retired
                  president of the Florida Power and Light Company here
                  was another who examined the device but he said his
                  check was not complete enough to allow him to form a
                  conclusion.<br>
                  <br>
                  Skinner turned to inventing after the collapse of the
                  Florida real estate boom of 1926. He recently
                  perfected a device for recharging dry cell batteries.
                  He collects royalties from several children’s toys and
                  special types of furniture he has invented.<br>
                  <br>
                  Skinner said some skeptics were inclined to wonder
                  whether his “gravity power machine” was obtaining
                  power from some other source than the one-eighth
                  horsepower motor because the shop was electrically
                  operated. To make the demonstration more convincing,
                  he obtained a one-fifth horsepower gasoline motor
                  manufactured to run model airplanes, which he said he
                  would install to produce the power for the shop.”<br>

                  <br>
                  ...Certainly, one of Walter’s most important
                  inventions was his discovery of the “Monothermal”
                  junction, which simply produced electricity when warm.
                  Unlike all other thermodynamic systems that require
                  some heat to move from a warm side to a cool side,
                  like in the “Seebeck Effect,” the Lovell Monothermal
                  device does NOT need a “cool side” to operate. All you
                  have to do is warm it up, and electricity comes out!
                  The prototype shown here operated a table-top fan
                  continuously for over 10 years in a constant “room
                  temperature” environment.<br>
                  <br>
                  The Lovell Monothermal device is the ultimate,
                  solid-state, ambient energy converter. A block of
                  these units, filling a volume of less than 4 cubic
                  feet, and sitting at 80°F (27°C), could power your
                  home without maintenance for 20 years. These devices
                  are much easier to manufacture than “solar cells” and
                  will be less expensive, when mass-produced. They also
                  have the added advantage of producing electricity both
                  day and night!...<br>

                  The Monothermal is a multi-layer laminate that
                  generates electrical current in the presence of
                  ambient heat.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>ABSTRACT</b><b><br>
                  </b><b>SCIENTIFIC</b><br>
                  The Monothermal produces electrical current without
                  utilizing existing methods that require heat
                  differential (any method that converts temperature
                  differences into electrical energy -- Seebeck Effect,
                  Thomson Effect, etc.) and without requiring a chemical
                  reaction (i.e. a redox reaction in batteries).<br>
                  <br>
                  The invention can be said to be similar to
                  photoelectric cells (solar panels) that motivate
                  electrons by exploiting photons (light), except that
                  the Monothermal motivates electrons via infrared
                  radiation -- and any molecular activity that produces
                  heat -- without a non-differential heated environment.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>PLAIN ENGLISH</b><br>
                  The Monothermal laminate creates electrical energy
                  from ambient heat. Since everything emits some heat
                  and there is really no such thing as "cold", the
                  Monothermal . . . creates energy simply while existing
                  in its environment.<br>

                  A device for generating electrical current in the
                  presence of ambient heat includes an intermediate
                  layer (1) having a predetermined electronegativity
                  value interposed between a first outer layer (2) and a
                  second outer layer (3), in which the first outer layer
                  (2) has an electronegative value less than the
                  intermediate layer (1), and the second outer layer (3)
                  has an electronegative value less than the first outer
                  layer (2). The intermediate layer (1) includes a first
                  binder combination and a second binder combination.
                  The first binder combination contains a polymeric
                  binder and a first electronegative material. The
                  second binder combination contains a polymeric binder
                  and a second electronegative material. The first and
                  second binder combinations have a predetermined
                  electronegative value that is greater than said first
                  and second outer layers. A method of making and a
                  method of activating the device for the generation of
                  electricity are also disclosed.<br>

                            Torah Code Revealing Civil War</b></font><br>
                      </div>
                      <br>
                      <font size="+1">Rabbi Yekutiel Fish, a Torah
                        scholar with a Hebrew-language blog called Sod
                        HaChashmal (the secret of the ‘electricity’),
                        used special software to find hidden clues in
                        equidistant letters in the Torah. </font><br>
                      <br>
                      <font size="+1">“I presented this Torah code to
                        other experts and they all agreed they have
                        never seen one like this for clarity in all of
                        the codes they saw before,” Rabbi Fish said in
                        his Hebrew language video. “It contains a
                        chilling and unmistakable message.”</font><br>
                      <br>
                      <font size="+1">The rabbi made a graph with each
                        horizontal line containing 1480 letters. The
                        rabbi later explained that the number 1480 came
                        from the name of the pandemic which has shaped
                        current events. The gematria (Hebrew numerology)
                        of the words Covid 19 (קוביד תשע עשרה) is 1467,
                        plus the number of letters in its name (12)
                        equals 1479, plus one (the unified aspect of
                        God, the power behind the pandemic) equals 1480.</font><br>
                      <br>
                      <font size="+1">Rabbi Fish began with the last
                        letter in the word ‘riv’ (ריב, argument) in
                        Exodus 17:7. Going forward in skips of 1480
                        letters revealed the series בהתשפא, which means
                        ‘in the year 5781’, the current year according
                        to the Hebrew calendar. The rabbi noted that
                        adjacent to the clue indicating this year was
                        another code spelled out in letters placed 1480
                        spaces apart, שבט (the Hebrew month Shevat).</font><br>
                      <br>
                      <font size="+1">It is important to note that the
                        month of Shevat begins this year on January 14,
                        six days before the new president is expected to
                        be inaugurated.</font><br>
                      <br>
                      <font size="+1">Continuing in the same line with
                        the same equidistance of 1480 letters, code
                        spelled out אבער רוב החי (I will burn most of
                        the living). </font><br>

                      <font size="+1">The location of this catastrophic
                        event is revealed in the same graph: ח”ול

                        לארץ (outside of Israel). Rabbi Fish emphasized
                        that this revelation was consistent with the
                        description of the pre-Messianic Battle of Gog
                        and Magog as described by the Prophet Zechariah:</font><br>

                        survive.That third I will put into the fire, And
                        I will smelt them as one smelts silver And test
                        them as one tests gold. They will invoke Me by
                        name, And I will respond to them. I will
                        declare, “You are My people,” And they will
                        declare, “Hashem is our God!” Zechariah 13:8-9</font><br>

                        for the Jews of the US: ללכת לישראל (go to
                        Israel). Slightly further in the graph, this
                        message is repeated with the single word שוב

                        with the same spacing of 1480 letters are the

                      </b><br>
                      <font size="+1">In the same verse (Exodus 32:27),
                        spelled in gaps of four letters, is the word
                        ‘Iran’. The rabbi explained to Israel365 News
                        that the issue of how to relate to Iran appears
                        to be a single issue dividing Democratic
                        candidate Joe Biden from President Trump, but
                        its implications go deep and have far-reaching
                        implications.</font><br>
                      <br>
                      <font size="+1">“Associating with Iran means being
                        under the influence of China, socialism, and
                        oppression, and opposing the peace that seems to
                        be sweeping across the globe,” Rabbi Fish said.
                        “It is a hared of Israel which is essentially a
                        hatred of the Torah and Hashem (God, literally
                        ‘the name’).”</font><br>
                      <br>
                      <font size="+1">“These issues are what really

                        <b>Golden Calf: US Based in War of Brothers</b></font><b><br>
                      </b><br>
                      <font size="+1">“This code is found embedded in
                        the section of the Torah describing the civil
                        war that followed the Sin of the Golden Calf,”
                        Rabbi Fish said. “This code comes to warn of a
                        civil war in the US very much like that; a war
                        between those who serve God against those who
                        worship foreign gods, which is liberalism
                        today.”</font><br>
                      <br>
                      <font size="+1">“The United States began with a
                        civil war, what we call in Hebrew, a ‘war of
                        brothers’,” Rabbi Fish told Israel365 News. “The
                        war against the British was essentially a civil
                        war fought between brothers. The Civil War
                        between the North and South was a war of
                        brothers, in some cases quite literally. The
                        United States’ biggest challenge is to be
                        united. Just like the Bible describes
                        difficulties between brothers, the US has this
                        challenge and that is their greatest tikkun
                        (fixing).”</font><br>
                      <br>
                      <font size="+1">“If they do not learn to be
                        together as brothers, this will mark the end of
                        Edom, the end of Esau, and the beginning of the
                        War of Gog and Magog,” Rabbi Fish said. “For the
                        Jews in the US, they must come to Israel. Their
                        time in exile is over.”</font><br>

                        this as Jonah arriving at the shores of Nineveh.
                        Like Nineveh, the Christians, who are the
                        spiritual descendants of Edom, must repent.”</font><br>

                        has led to unprecedented social and economic
                        consequences. The risk of morbidity and
                        mortality due to COVID-19 increases dramatically
                        in the presence of coexisting medical
                        conditions, while the underlying mechanisms
                        remain unclear. Furthermore, there are no
                        approved therapies for COVID-19. This study aims
                        to identify SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, disease
                        manifestations, and COVID-19 therapies using
                        network medicine methodologies along with
                        clinical and multi-omics observations. We
                        incorporate SARS-CoV-2 virus–host
                        protein–protein interactions, transcriptomics,
                        and proteomics into the human interactome.
                        Network proximity measurement revealed
                        underlying pathogenesis for broad
                        COVID-19-associated disease manifestations.

                        elevated in absorptive enterocytes from the
                        inflamed ileal tissues of Crohn disease patients
                        compared to uninflamed tissues, revealing shared
                        pathobiology between COVID-19 and inflammatory
                        bowel disease. Integrative analyses of
                        metabolomics and transcriptomics (bulk and
                        single-cell) data from asthma patients indicate
                        that COVID-19 shares an intermediate
                        inflammatory molecular profile with asthma
                        (including IRAK3 and ADRB2). To prioritize
                        potential treatments, we combined network-based
                        prediction and a propensity score (PS) matching
                        observational study of 26,779 individuals from a
                        COVID-19 registry. We identified that melatonin
                        usage (odds ratio [OR] = 0.72, 95% CI 0.56–0.91)
                        is significantly associated with a 28% reduced
                        likelihood of a positive laboratory test result
                        for SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by reverse
                        transcription–polymerase chain reaction assay.
                        Using a PS matching user active comparator
                        design, we determined that melatonin usage was
                        associated with a reduced likelihood of
                        SARS-CoV-2 positive test result compared to use
                        of angiotensin II receptor blockers (OR = 0.70,
                        95% CI 0.54–0.92) or angiotensin-converting
                        enzyme inhibitors (OR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.52–0.90).
                        Importantly, melatonin usage (OR = 0.48, 95% CI
                        0.31–0.75) is associated with a 52% reduced
                        likelihood of a positive laboratory test result
                        for SARS-CoV-2 in African Americans after
                        adjusting for age, sex, race, smoking history,
                        and various disease comorbidities using PS
                        matching. In summary, this study presents an
                        integrative network medicine platform for
                        predicting disease manifestations associated
                        with COVID-19 and identifying melatonin for
                        potential prevention and treatment of COVID-19.</font><br>

                  interviews with military personnel who have had
                  experience with the controversial anthrax vaccine.<br>
                  The film claims that over 35,000 soldiers have died
                  from the anthrax vaccine, according to a “RAC-GWVI
                  Government Report” published in 2008.<br>
                  Compare that to how many soldiers have died in combat
                  in both Iraq and Afghanistan, which is 6753 at the
                  time of the filming.<br>
                  The film starts out with a dramatized recreating of
                  Lance Corporal Jared Schwartz, who refused to receive
                  the anthrax vaccine.<br>
                  He had to face a military tribunal without legal
                  counsel, and read a prepared statement.<br>
                  That statement can be found online, such as at the
                  GulfWarVets.com website.<br>
                  The film also mentions how pharmaceutical companies
                  have legal immunity from any injuries or deaths
                  resulting from vaccines, and that the civilian
                  population only has recourse to sue the federal
                  government in a special Vaccine Court.<br>
                  However, military personnel are prohibited from suing
                  in this court, which is part of the National Vaccine
                  Compensation Program.<b><br>

                      the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor know that
                      President Franklin Roosevelt had provoked a
                      Japanese attack to justify America’s entry into
                      World War II. Most Americans were against joining
                      the war, but the attack on Pearl Harbor provided
                      the excuse needed to declare war. The best book on
                      this topic is “Day of Deceit” by former World War
                      II Navy officer Robert Stinnett. The topics he
                      covers are controversial because most people
                      refuse to accept that Roosevelt and top military
                      leaders in Washington DC failed to inform the
                      commanders in Hawaii that a Japanese fleet was
                      coming to attack. <br>

                      be resumed in some cases without observers
                      present. His calculations were based on historical
                      data, most prevalently voting patterns in the 2016
                      election, and concluded that it is essentially

                      States—Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and

                      </font></b><font color="#000000">The knowledge of
                      biotechnology increases the risk of using
                      biochemical weapons for mass destruction. Prions
                      are unprecedented infectious pathogens that cause
                      a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases by a
                      novel mechanism. They are transmissible particles
                      that are devoid of nucleic acid. Due to their
                      singular characteristics, Prions emerge as
                      potential danger since they can be used in the
                      development of such weapons. Prions cause fatal
                      infectious diseases, and to date there is no
                      therapeutic or prophylactic approach against these
                      diseases. Furthermore, Prions are resistant to
                      food-preparation treatments such as high heat and
                      can find their way from the digestive system into
                      the nervous system; recombinant Prions are
                      infectious either bound to soil particles or in
                      aerosols. Therefore, lethal Prions can be
                      developed by malicious researchers who could use
                      it to attack political enemies since such weapons
                      cause diseases that could be above suspicion... <br>

              This document presents considerations from the perspective
              of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention
              (CDC) for implementing the shielding approach in
              humanitarian settings as outlined in guidance documents
              focused on camps, displaced populations and low-resource
              settings...<br>
              <br>
              <b>What is the Shielding Approach1?</b><br>
              The shielding approach aims to reduce the number of severe
              COVID-19 cases by limiting contact between individuals at
              higher risk of developing severe disease (“high-risk”) and
              the general population (“low-risk”). High-risk individuals
              would be temporarily relocated to safe or “green zones”
              established at the household, neighborhood, camp/sector or
              community level depending on the context and setting.1,2
              They would have minimal contact with family members and
              other low-risk residents...<br>

                  Paper That Established Global PCR Driven Lockdown</b><br>
                <b>by Celia Farber</b><br>
              </div>
              <br>
              War has broken out in the scientific literature that
              strikes at the existential core of Covid-19 and its
              proposed causative virus.<br>
              <br>
              At the heart of the controversy lies the fact that the
              creators of the most commonly used test, the RT-PCR,
              published instructions for how to test for SARS-CoV-2
              “without having virus material available,” in their own
              words, relying instead on the Chinese scientists’ genetic
              sequence published on the internet.<br>
              <br>
              The paper “Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
              by real-time PCR” was published 24 hours after it was
              submitted to Eurosurveillance, clearly evading peer
              review. Its lead authors were Christian Drosten and Victor
              Corman, which is how it took on the title&nbsp;
              “Corman-Drosten paper.” It provided the “recipe,” or work
              flow for the Covid-19 diagnostic test, quickly applied all
              over the world, after it was accepted as the standard of
              testing by the WHO.<br>
              <br>
              German scientist Christian Drosten was also a
              co-discoverer of the SARS-associated coronavirus, and
              developed a test for it in 2003. Drosten, who heads the
              Charite Institute of Virology in Berlin, and a team of
              fellow scientists in Europe and Hong Kong, moved very
              quickly, as soon as cases of the illness were being
              reported out of Wuhan in December of 2019. They submitted
              the paper on Jan. 21, it was published in Eurosurveillance
              on Jan. 23,* and was immediately accepted as the standard
              of testing internationally, by the WHO, which began
              sending test kits to affected regions. (Fact check: was it
              24 hours? Corbett says yes.)<br>
              <br>
              In the harrowing months that followed, amid lockdowns,
              economic collapse, school closures and widespread panic,
              few were aware of the immense problems with the paper,
              which tragically offered a testing method that would yield
              between 80 and 97 percent false positive results, due to a
              non existent gold standard which would be the virus
              itself.<br>
              <br>
              It all came to a head on Nov. 30, when the Corman-Drosten
              foundation paper was challenged by 22 international
              scientists who wrote a letter demanding the paper’s
              retraction, along with an extensive critique citing 10
              errors in the paper it deemed “fatal.”<br>
              <br>
              Titled “External peer review of the RTPCR test to detect
              SARS-Cov-2 Reveals 10 Major Flaws At The Molecular and
              Methodological Level: Consequences For False-Positive
              Results,” the paper’s lead author is Dr. Pieter Borger, an
              expert on the molecular biology of gene expression.
              Several other esteemed names are associated with the paper
              including Dr. Michael Yeadon, former VP of Pfizer and
              outspoken critic of much of the so-called science beneath
              the WHO’s global lockdown, masking, and school shut-down
              measures.<br>
              <br>
              I reached one of the authors, Dr. Kevin Corbett, at his
              home in London. He spoke simply&nbsp; and with controlled
              apoplexy. He confirmed and cast additional light on the
              shocking fact that the paper was written in the absence of
              a viral isolate, among many other problems.<br>
              <br>
              “Every scientific rationale for the development of that
              test has been totally destroyed by this paper. It’s like
              Hiroshima/Nagasaki to the Covid test,” he said. “When
              Drosten developed the test, China hadn’t given them a
              viral isolate. They developed the test from a sequence in
              a gene bank. Do you see? China gave them a genetic
              sequence with no corresponding viral isolate. They had a
              code, but no body for the code. No viral morphology.”<br>
              <br>
              I asked him to define “viral morphology” for the
              layperson.<br>
              <br>
              “In the fish market,” he said, “it’s like giving you a few
              bones and saying that’s your fish. It could be any fish.
              Not even a skeleton. Here’s a few fragments of bones.
              That’s your fish. Listen, the Corman/Drosten paper,
              there’s nothing from a patient in it. It’s all from gene
              banks. and the bits of the virus sequence that weren’t
              there they made up. They synthetically created them to
              fill in the blanks. That’s what genetics is; it’s a code.
              So its ABBBCCDDD and you’re missing some what you think is
              EEE so you put it in. It’s all synthetic. You just
              manufacture the bits that are missing. This is the end
              result of the geneticization of virology. This is
              basically a computer virus.“<br>
              <br>
              In an interview posted on his Twitter feed, Dr. Pieter
              Borger said,”The virus wasn’t in Europe and the paper was
              already finished.”&nbsp; He said these facts “should have
              been on television long ago. I explained it on LinkedIn,
              but you get banned if you do. Regarding PCR he said, “You
              are not detecting a virus.”<br>
              <br>
              “Once I heard a good comparison,” he continued. “If you go
              to a junkyard and you find a wheel or a hubcap from a
              Mercedes, and a steering wheel of a Mercedes, can you
              infer that you are in a Mercedes garage at that moment? If
              you only see those two parts? No, you can’t. You don’t
              know anything about it . . . you only know you have a
              steering wheel, you can find those things everywhere. In
              every junkyard you can find them.” He describes the RT PCT
              tests as having “no relevance for the diagnosis
              whatsoever.”<br>
              <br>
              German lawyer Reiner Fuellmich who is central to a growing
              group of lawyers, scientists, politicians, and even secret
              pharmaceutical whistleblowers, said in an interview, “We
              believe that in order to make this house of cards
              collapse, we have to attack the PCR test. The fact is,
              there are no asymptomatic infections.”<br>
              <br>
              This seemingly radical claim was bolstered by a paper out
              of Wuhan of all places, published by Nature.com, which
              found no “viable virus” in PCR positive cases.<br>
              <br>
              “The screening of the 9,865,404 participants without a
              history of COVID-19 found no newly confirmed COVID-19
              cases, and identified 300 asymptomatic positive cases with
              a detection rate of 0.303 (95 % CI 0.270–0.339)/10,000. …
              A total of 1174 close contacts of the asymptomatic
              positive cases were traced, and they all tested negative
              for the COVID-19. … Of the 34,424 participants with a
              history of COVID-19, 107 tested positive again, giving a
              repositive rate of 0.310% (95% CI 0.423–0.574%.) Virus
              cultures were negative for all asymptomatic positive and
              repositive cases, indicating no “viable virus” in positive
              cases detected in this study.”<br>
              Dr. Kevin Corbett, Ph.D./Photo: Twitter<br>
              <br>
              Dr. Corbett, a Ph.D., and retired RN elaborated: “There
              are 10 fatal errors in this Drosten test paper. Public
              Health England is a co-author on it. All the public health
              authorities across the EU have co-authored this paper. But
              here is the bottom line: There was no viral isolate to
              validate what they were doing. The PCR products of the
              amplification didn’t correspond to any viral isolate at
              that time. I call it ‘donut ring science.’ There is
              nothing at the center of it. It’s all about code,
              genetics, nothing to do with reality, or the actual
              person, the patient.”<br>
              <br>
              I read him some of the critiques from the other side, that
              say it’s been isolated “all over the world.”<br>
              <br>
              “Yes, there have since papers saying they’ve produced
              viral isolates. But there are no controls for them. The
              CDC produced a paper in July, I think it was, where they
              said: ‘Here’s the viral isolate.’ Do you know what they
              did? They swabbed one person. One person, who’d been to
              China and had cold symptoms. One person. And they assumed
              he had it to begin with. So it’s all full of holes, the
              whole thing.”<br>
              <br>
              One of their 10 challenges is the stunning fact that
              EuroSurveillance published the paper 24 hours after it was
              submitted back in January. “Twenty-four hours,” Dr.
              Corbett said incredulously. “That never happens. It takes
              months to get a review done. They turned this around in 24
              hours. It was waved through, it was not peer-reviewed.
              There’s no standard operational procedure for this test.
              There’s major and minor concerns about this paper and we
              go through it all here. it should be retracted. If they
              retract it, it means the whole thing falls to bits. The
              whole edifice collapses. It’s a house of cards built on
              sand and we’ve just moved the sand.”...<br>

                2020, is leading an international effort to hold

                testing to engineer the appearance of a dangerous

                equivalent to the risk of dying in a car accident</i><i><br>

                been capitalized upon to incite fear in order to benefit

                Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, but
                also the World Health Organization, the United Nations
                and the World Economic Forum</i><i><br>
              </i><br>
              Reiner Fuellmich,1 who has been a consumer protection
              trial lawyer in California and Germany2 for 26 years, is a
              founding member of the German Corona Extra-Parliamentary
              Inquiry Committee (Außerparlamentarischer Corona
              Untersuchungsausschuss,3 or ACU),4,5 launched July 10,
              2020.<br>
              <br>
              Fuellmich is leading the committee's corona crisis tort
              case — an international class-action lawsuit that will be
              filed against those responsible for using fraudulent
              testing to engineer the appearance of a dangerous pandemic
              in order to implement economically devastating lockdowns
              around the world.<br>
              <br>
              He estimates more than 50 other countries will be
              following suit. In the video above, Patrick Bet-David
              interviews Fuellmich about how and why the group was
              formed and the status of this work.<br>
              <br>
              <b>The Backstory</b><b><br>
              </b>Early on, as Fuellmich started hearing concerns from
              family and friends in Germany about a new respiratory
              virus, one particular name kept popping up: professor
              Christian Drosten, Ph.D., a German virologist.<br>
              <br>
              As head of the Institute of Virology at the University of
              Bonn Medical Centre, Drosten is best known for developing
              the first diagnostic test for SARS in 2003. He also
              developed a diagnostic test for the swine flu,6 and in
              2009 helped drum up panic with doomsday prophesies about
              H1N1.<br>
              <br>
              When COVID-19 initially emerged in early 2020, Drosten
              kept saying there was no cause for concern. Then,
              seemingly overnight, he changed his tune, "as though
              someone had given him a signal." All of a sudden, Drosten
              was saying that this virus was extremely dangerous and
              that drastic measures to contain it had to be implemented.<br>
              <br>
              Based on whistleblower testimony, the German government
              relied on the opinion of Drosten alone when deciding on
              their pandemic response, which included the lockdown of
              healthy citizens and the suspension of constitutional
              rights for an indefinite period of time.<br>
              <br>
              Interestingly, Fuellmich's team recently discovered that
              Drosten's Ph.D. dissertation is a fraud. It was only
              created this year when people began investigating his
              background.<br>
              <br>
              Aside from Drosten, other individuals who have prominent
              roles include Lothar H. Wieler, the head of the German
              equivalent of the Centers for Disease Control and
              Prevention, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World
              Health Organization and Neil Ferguson of the Imperial
              College of London.<br>
              <br>
              Unsure of what was going on, Fuellmich contacted an old
              friend, Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg, a former member of the German
              Congress and the Council of Europe. Wodarg urged him to
              investigate and suggested some names of experts to look
              into, such as professor John Ioannidis at Stanford
              University and professor and Nobel Prize winner Michael
              Levitt.<br>
              <br>
              The more he investigated the facts available, the more
              Fuellmich realized COVID-19 was being grossly oversold.
              Eventually, he started making inquiries to see if there
              were any other lawyers out there raising questions about
              the legality of the pandemic and the global response to
              it.<br>
              <br>
              He discovered that Beate Bahner, an attorney specializing
              in medical law, had in fact spoken out, arguing that
              Germany's quarantine measures were unconstitutional. She
              was arrested and held in a psychiatric ward for a number
              of days. Needless to say, that wasn't an encouraging
              start.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Separation of Power Has Been Breached</b><b><br>
              </b>Disturbingly, while the governments of many nations
              have the same separation of power as the U.S., where you
              have separate legislative, judiciary and executive
              branches, we are now finding that this separation has been
              breached and nearly destroyed in most places.<br>
              <br>
              Rather than being run by the legislators that we voted
              into power (and who have the legal power to make law),
              we're being ruled by the executive branch, such as our
              local governors, who are creating rules and regulations
              without having the legal and constitutional power to do
              so.<br>
              <br>
              They may issue emergency orders for a few days, but really
              that's the extent of their legal power. After that, the
              legislature must be brought in. Yet here we are, several
              months into the pandemic, and local governors and mayors
              all over the world are still issuing long-term mandatory
              mask and social distancing orders, many of which call for
              the arrest of those who don't follow the rules.<br>
              <br>
              We now have plenty of data showing its lethality is on par
              with the common flu and that the absolute risk of death is
              equivalent to the risk of dying in a car accident.<br>
              <br>
              As noted by Fuellmich, the judiciary branch must step in,
              and now, finally, they are starting to do so. In Austria,
              the constitutional court issued an order November 12,
              2020, not only clarifying the separation of powers and
              stressing that the legislative branch must be involved,
              but also that there must be a comprehensive discussion
              where both sides are heard. There are other scientists
              besides those anointed by the government, and their
              opinions must be considered as well.<br>
              Suing the World Over Faux Pandemic<br>
              <br>
              As noted by Bet-David, there are several important
              questions that must be answered:<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What caused the pandemic?<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who started it?<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who needs to be held accountable?<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In what way must they be held
              accountable?<br>
              <br>
              Fuellmich agrees, saying that answering these questions is
              the reason for why ACU was formed. Governments appear
              unwilling to investigate the answers to these questions,
              and that's why he and three other attorneys decided to
              take on the task of preparing class-action lawsuits. The
              primary questions the ACU seeks to answer are:<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How dangerous is the virus, really?<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How trustworthy is the PCR test; what
              does a positive test really mean?<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How much damage do the anti-COVID
              measures inflict to the economy and the health and
              well-being of the population?<br>
              <br>
              <b>What Do We Now Know?</b><br>
              The last question is easily answered, Fuellmich says.
              Evidence shows pandemic measures have caused tremendous
              harm, killing more people than the virus itself by
              restricting routine medical care to people with acute and
              chronic health conditions that have nothing to do with
              COVID-19.<br>
              <br>
              As for the danger of SARS-CoV-2, we now have plenty of
              data showing its lethality is on par with the common
              flu7,8,9,10,11 and that the absolute risk of death is
              equivalent to the risk of dying in a car accident.12,13 It
              may be different in terms of symptoms and complications,
              but the actual lethality is about the same.<br>
              <br>
              According to Fuellmich, even the WHO has now admitted that
              the mortality of COVID-19 is on par with seasonal
              influenza. In October 2020, the WHO also reversed its
              stance on lockdowns, stating they no longer recommend
              using lockdowns as a primary control method.14<br>
              <br>
              Several experts have also stressed that there is no excess
              mortality,15,16 meaning we've had an average number of
              deaths during the pandemic as would normally die anyway.
              And, if there's no excess mortality, how can there be a
              lethal pandemic? It doesn't add up.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Fraudulent Testing Is Driving Pandemic Narrative</b><br>
              Of the three questions, the second one is perhaps the most
              important, as mass testing is driving the narrative that
              we're in a lethal pandemic. As explained by Fuellmich,
              reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
              tests have several weaknesses that appear to be taken
              advantage of to create needless fear.<br>
              <br>
              The fact is, the PCR test is not designed to be used as a
              diagnostic tool as it cannot distinguish between inactive
              viruses and "live" or reproductive ones.17 This is a
              crucial point, since inactive and reproductive viruses are
              not interchangeable in terms of infectivity. If you have a
              nonreproductive virus in your body, you will not get sick
              and you cannot spread it to others. <br>
              <br>
              Secondly, many if not most laboratories amplify the RNA
              collected far too many times, which results in healthy
              people testing "positive." The video above explains how
              the PCR test works and how we are interpreting results
              incorrectly.<br>
              <br>
              In summary, the PCR swab collects RNA from your nasal
              cavity. This RNA is then reverse transcribed into DNA.
              However, they must be amplified to become discernible.
              Each round of amplification is called a cycle, and the
              number of amplification cycles used by any given test or
              lab is called a cycle threshold.<br>
              <br>
              When you go above 30 cycles, even insignificant sequences
              of viral DNA end up being magnified to the point that the
              test reads positive even if your viral load is extremely
              low or the virus is inactive and poses no threat to you or
              anyone else.<br>
              <br>
              According to Fuellmich, the consensus is that anything
              over 35 cycles is scientifically indefensible. Yet
              Drosten's test and tests recommended by the World Health
              Organization are set to 45 cycles.18,19,20<br>
              <br>
              When labs use these excessive cycle thresholds, you end up
              with a far higher number of positive tests than you would
              otherwise. At present, and going back a number of months
              now, what we're really dealing with is a "casedemic,"21,22
              meaning an epidemic of false positives.<br>
              <br>
              Remember, in medical terminology, when used accurately, a
              "case" refers to someone who has symptoms of a disease. By
              erroneously reporting positive tests as "cases," the
              pandemic appears magnitudes worse than it actually is. For
              this reason, Fuellmich and his team are primarily focused
              on the PCR test issue.<br>
              <br>
              They've taken testimony from a number of well-respected
              immunologists from around the world, all of whom agree
              that the PCR test is incapable of telling us anything
              about the transmission of COVID-19.<br>
              <br>
              <b>The Panic Paper</b><br>
              According to Fuellmich, the sole reason the PCR test is
              used, and used in an incorrect way, is to create enough
              fear that no one will question the pandemic measures being
              put into place and simply do as they're told. He goes on
              to review the so-called "Panic Paper,"23,24 written by the
              German Department of the Interior.<br>
              <br>
              This classified paper, which was leaked to the press,
              reveals there was an intentional plan at the level of the
              German government to drive people into a panic.<br>
              <br>
              One of the strategies laid out in the paper was to guilt
              children into compliance, to make them feel responsible
              "for the tortured death of their parents and grandparents
              if they do not follow the anti-corona regulations."
              According to Fuellmich, what we have is a staged PCR test
              pandemic. It's not a lethal virus pandemic, "and I can
              prove this in court," he says.<br>
              What's the End Game?<br>
              <br>
              As noted by Fuellmich, more and more people around the
              world are now starting to wake up to the fact that the
              restrictions put into place under the guise of protecting
              public health are not going away anytime soon. They're
              part of a much larger, long-term plan, and the end goal is
              to usher in a new way of life, devoid of our previous
              freedoms.<br>
              <br>
              The judicial branch is "the last anchor of democracy,"
              Fuellmich says. He brings up an important point. The WHO,
              the World Economic Forum and the United Nations are all
              private corporations, yet they wield tremendous power over
              the governments of the world.<br>
              <br>
              The World Economic Forum, founded by Klaus Schwab, is
              incredibly influential and lobbies politicians around the
              globe. Together, private corporations and politicians have
              in some instances usurped power from the government and
              are acting above the law of the land.<br>
              <br>
              Big Tech plays an important part in this usurpation of
              power. The most important human right around the world is
              the right to free speech. It's foundational for any
              democracy. Yet the tech giants have all banded together to
              censor certain segments of the global population.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have to take back the power from
              them and put it back where it belongs, with the
              government, and we have to take a really close look at who
              is in government and who became too close to these
              corporations," Fuellmich says.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Key Players</b><br>
              While the full picture is still being put together,
              Fuellmich and his team have some ideas of who the key
              players are, at least in Germany. They include the
              Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of Germany, Drosten,
              Wieler (the head of the German equivalent of the CDC),
              Ghebreyesus (head of the WHO), the Bill &amp; Melinda
              Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust.<br>
              <br>
              These individuals have repeatedly met over the years,
              including in May 2019, at which time they discussed plans
              for a coming pandemic. During this meeting, Drosten
              explained how his PCR test would be used to identify
              infections — "A blatant lie, as we now know it," Fuellmich
              says.<br>
              <br>
              These were the same individuals who in 2020 rolled out the
              narrative for the COVID-19 pandemic and pushed for the
              global implementation of PCR testing, mask wearing, social
              distancing and the shut-down of economies around the
              world.<br>
              <br>
              According to Fuellmich, Germany is at the center of this
              global fraud, and three of the key criminals in this case
              appear to be Drosten, Wieler and Ghebreyesus — and the
              organizations behind them.<br>
              <br>
              That said, he also admits there must be others behind
              these public marionettes that are pulling the strings.
              Fuellmich believes that through pretrial discovery, these
              shadowy figures will eventually come to light.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Battle Plan</b><br>
              As mentioned earlier, we must now push the judicial branch
              of our government to step in. Fuellmich explains:<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have the power [to ask] courts of
              law to step in, but we have to show in a court of law that
              this is not a corona pandemic but rather a staged PCR
              pandemic, which was made up — invented — for completely
              different purposes, for these corporations.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not know exactly who is
              responsible, but we see that some of the corporations that
              are now censoring us are in part responsible; we know some
              people — such as Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab or Blackrock —
              were investing their money into pharmaceutical and
              technical companies. Also, the mainstream media, they
              [have been] brought into line and are not going to report
              on the other side of the story.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to bring out this story, we
              have to have a court of law that will take a look at the
              evidence that is there … And that's what we're doing right
              now. We're doing this both in Germany and in the United
              States … The U.S. and Canada are so important in this
              because they are the two countries that have
              class-actions."<br>
              <br>
              At present, class-action lawsuits are being prepared in
              the U.S. and Canada. Lawsuits are also being prepared in
              Germany. Germany does not permit class-actions so, there,
              the process is being done a bit differently. ACU is also
              working on the creation of legal guidelines and data
              caches that attorneys around the world will be able to use
              to file their own lawsuits.<br>
              <br>
              As for the average person, Fuellmich urges everyone to,
              first of all, don't give up, and secondly, ask lots of
              questions. Continue asking questions because the more
              questions are asked, the more answers will come to light.
              Continue to counter the censorship by asking questions.
              Once court hearings begin, the information will start to
              spread more quickly.<br>
              <br>
              To learn more, all ACU meetings are live-streamed and
              available on the Committee's YouTube channel25 (at least
              for now). Fuellmich can be contacted via
              www.fuellmich.com, and the Corona Inquiry Committee via
              corona-ausschuss.de. Information in multiple languages

                  honest election?</b><b><br>
                </b><b>By Publius Huldah</b><b><br>
                </b></div>
              <br>
              A disaster of monumental proportions is likely to be ahead
              for our Country if we don’t take emergency action to get
              at least a reasonably honest election. Not only the
              President’s seat, but also the entire US House, the Houses
              in the State Legislatures, one/third of the seats in the
              US Senate, and a proportional number of seats in the State
              Senates, are all at stake in the upcoming election.<br>
              <br>
              We are faced with irrefutable proof that the Marxists
              intend to steal the election. And they will not content
              themselves with stealing only the President’s seat – they
              seek to steal every seat on the ballots.<br>
              <br>
              So we need to face up to the problem and take immediate
              action.<br>
              <br>
              1. What does Congress have constitutional authority to do?<br>
              The President and Vice President are supposed to be
              elected using the procedures set forth in Article II, §1,
              cl. 2 and the 12th Amendment to our US Constitution. But
              we have ignored those provisions for a great many years;
              and it’s too late to obey them for the upcoming election
              of President and Vice President.<br>
              But Congress still has constitutional authority to invoke
              Article II, §1, cl. 4, which invests in Congress the power
              to determine the time of chusing the Presidential Electors
              and the Day on which they vote. That date is currently set
              for November 3, 2020.<br>
              Pursuant to Article I, §4, cl. 1, Congress may make laws
              determining the “Times, Places and Manner” of holding the
              federal elections to Congress.<br>
              Since we know that Trump ballots have been tossed into
              dumpsters, and election offices have been flooded with
              fake Biden ballots; the best course of action would be for
              Congress to make a law which reschedules the November 3
              election to a later date; and cancels everything which has
              been done so far respecting the election (at least since
              the primaries).<br>
              Congress could then exercise its constitutional authority
              to establish common sense procedures respecting the “Time,
              Place and Manner” of voting in the upcoming elections. For
              example, Congress could pass a law providing that:<br>
              · Every registered voter who wants to vote must physically
              appear at his officially designated place of voting and
              produce proof of identity.<br>
              · Election Day should be one day – not weeks and months
              before &amp; after the date set for the election.<br>
              · Absentee voting should be restricted to those who are
              out of the Country or out of State due to military
              service, service in the diplomatic corps, missionaries
              stationed overseas, businessmen stationed overseas, etc.<br>
              We used to do it this way.<br>
              But the Marxists came in with their hard luck stories
              about how these requirements were harsh, unfair,
              discriminatory, and so forth; and so our side [as usual]
              caved in and went along with the demands which stripped us
              of the ability to have even reasonably honest elections.<br>
              However, because Marxists now control the House, Congress
              lacks the ability to act as suggested above.<br>
              <br>
              2. What does the US Supreme Court have constitutional
              authority to do?<br>
              Article I, §4, cl. 1 provides that the power to set the
              “Times, Places and Manner” of voting in federal elections
              is delegated exclusively to the Legislative Branches of
              the State &amp; Federal governments [LINK]. Accordingly,
              and consistent with the Principle of “Separation of
              Powers” and the “political question” doctrine [LINK], the
              Judicial Branches of State and federal government have no
              lawful authority to substitute their views on these issues
              for those of the Legislative Branches.<br>
              Even so, with respect to the upcoming elections, lawless
              federal and state judges have been usurping power by
              substituting their views respecting the “Times, Places and
              Manner” of voting, for the views of State Legislatures.
              Some judges are ruling that because of COVID-19, voters
              shouldn’t be required to go to the polls – everyone must
              be allowed to vote by mail; and the time for counting
              ballots must be extended.<br>
              Obviously, the Supreme Court has no constitutional
              authority to substitute their views respecting the “Times,
              Places and Manner” of voting for those of the legislative
              bodies. Instead, the Supreme Court’s Duty is to issue
              orders and judgments which adhere to what the Constitution
              says.<br>
              So the Supreme Court should overturn the usurpatious
              orders of state and federal judges who attempted to usurp
              power over this issue. They should remind The People of
              our Country that only the State Legislatures and Congress
              may address these issues – that judges must keep their
              hands off. The power isn’t given to the Judicial Branches.<br>
              But a recent case out of South Carolina indicates that the
              most we will get from the Supreme Court is an unprincipled
              “cut the baby in half” compromise.<br>
              South Carolina law provides that a witness must sign an
              absentee ballot for the ballot to be valid. The Marxists
              (or their dupes) objected to this requirement and sued.
              Using COVID-19 as the excuse, the federal judge disagreed
              [!] with the statutory requirement for a witness, and said
              the State couldn’t enforce it. South Carolina election
              officials applied to the US Supreme Court for a stay of
              the lower Court’s order. 1<br>
              On October 5, 2020, in Andino v. Middleton [LINK], the
              Supreme Court stayed the Order, except to the extent that
              any ballots cast before they granted the Stay and received
              within two days of their Order may not be rejected.<br>
              So the Supreme Court’s Order is nothing for us to
              celebrate. The Supreme Court is allowing several days’
              worth of unlawful ballots to be treated as valid; and thus
              are rewarding the trial judge’s usurpation of powers
              [which were granted to the South Carolina Legislature], by
              allowing these unlawful ballots to be counted.<br>
              But our good Justices, Thomas and Alito, and Gorsuch as
              well, would have granted the Stay in full and disqualified
              all the unlawful absentee ballots.<br>
              Justice Kavanaugh’s concurring opinion suggests that, like
              the majority, he doesn’t understand that the Judicial
              Branch has no constitutional authority to alter State
              election laws re the “Times, Places and Manner” of holding
              elections:&nbsp; he pointed out that the actions of the
              lower Court violated Supreme Court precedent [!] that (1)
              an unelected federal judge ordinarily shouldn’t make
              public health decisions which overrule State Legislatures,
              and (2) federal courts ordinarily shouldn’t alter state
              election rules in the period close to an election. Yikes!<br>
              So while the Supreme Court might “give” us some relief
              from the massive cheating, it seems unlikely that they
              will provide a principled defense of our Constitution.<br>
              <br>
              3. What must State Governments do?<br>
              State governments may be the only way salvage, at least to
              some extent, the upcoming election. Since the Judicial
              Branches of the State and federal governments have no
              constitutional authority to change the decisions of the
              Legislative Branches respecting the “Times, Places and
              Manner” of federal elections; State Governments should
              instruct the Election Officials for their State that they
              must obey &amp; enforce the election laws passed by their
              State legislature and not the usurpatious orders of
              judges. Judges have no constitutional authority to change
              what the State Legislatures do on this issue!<br>
              Election officials should also be shown that judges have
              no power to enforce their orders &amp; judgments – that
              they depend on the Executive Branches of the federal or
              State governments to enforce them. We are doomed if
              Americans remain unable to grasp this simple concept.<br>
              <br>
              Endnote: 1 The better course of action would have been for
              South Carolina to nullify the lawless opinion of the
              federal judge by refusing to enforce it. Remember! Federal
              judges have no army – they can’t enforce their Orders.
              They must depend on the Executive Branch of the federal
              gov’t to enforce them. Who thinks President Trump would
              send in the National Guard to force South Carolina
              election officials to allow cheating in the upcoming
              election? If those officials had been familiar with what
              Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 78 (6th para),
              they would have known this.<br>

              Torsion fields are generated by spin and/or by angular
              momentum; any object or particle that spins produces
              torsion waves and possesses its own unique torsion field.

              <b>Abstract</b><br>
              Developing reliable, quantitative conduit models that
              capture the physical processes governing eruptions is
              hindered by our inability to observe conduit flow
              directly. The closest we get to direct evidence is
              testimony imprinted on individual crystals or bubbles in
              the conduit and preserved by quenching during the
              eruption. For example, small crystal aggregates in
              products of the 1959 eruption of Kīlauea Iki, Hawaii
              contain overgrown olivines separated by large,
              hydrodynamically unfavorable angles. The common occurrence
              of these aggregates calls for a flow mechanism that
              creates this crystal misorientation. Here, we show that
              the observed aggregates are the result of exposure to a
              steady wave field in the conduit through a customized,
              process-based model at the scale of individual crystals.
              We use this model to infer quantitative attributes of the
              flow at the time of aggregate formation; notably, the
              formation of misoriented aggregates is only reproduced in
              bidirectional, not unidirectional, conduit flow.<br>

              </div>
              <br>
              December 3, 2020 (Inside the Vatican) — “O God, you are
              awesome from your sanctuary; the God of Israel gives
              strength and power to his people.” —Psalm 68:35<br>
              <br>
              On November 19, 2020, the founder of the World Economic
              Forum, Klaus Schwab, declared that “Covid is an
              opportunity for a global reset.”<br>
              <br>
              In reality, Schwab was slavishly repeating what Jacques
              Attali said in the French weekly L’Express on May 3, 2009
              [so, 11 years ago]: “History teaches us that humanity
              evolves significantly only when it is really afraid: then
              it initially develops defense mechanisms; sometimes
              intolerable (scapegoats and totalitarianisms); sometimes
              useless (distractions); sometimes effective (therapies,
              which, if necessary, may depart from all previous moral
              principles). Then, once the crisis is over, fear
              transforms these mechanisms to make them compatible with
              individual freedom and inscribe them as policies of a
              healthy democracy.”<br>
              <br>
              Back then it was the swine flu which, according to the
              media, was expected to cause millions of deaths and for
              which nations bought millions of doses of vaccines never
              used, because they proved useless, from “Big Pharma.”
              Useless for all — except for those who sold them, making
              huge profits.<br>
              <br>
              One might wonder why a flu virus that according to recent
              WHO data has a mortality (0.13%) slightly higher than that
              of a normal seasonal flu syndrome (0.10%) could have led
              to the declaration of the pandemic and to a series of
              practically identical countermeasures in almost all
              European nations and the American continent.<br>
              <br>
              One might also wonder why Covid-19 treatments are
              generally discredited, minimized or prohibited, while the
              vaccine is considered the most effective solution.<br>
              <br>
              And it needs to be explained how it is possible to create
              a vaccine, since — according to the statements of the US
              CDC (United States Centers for Disease Control and
              Prevention) — the virus has not yet been isolated.<br>
              <br>
              What antigen may be used, if the virus SARS-CoV-2 cannot
              be isolated and replicated?<br>
              <br>
              And what reliability can the virus tests have, since the
              tests are calibrated to detect only on the generic
              “Coronavirus” in general?<br>
              <br>
              And if on October 19 the Spallanzani Hospital in Rome
              announced the develop of a test that distinguishes between
              normal flu and Covid-19, may we know what so far have
              patients who undergo the new test been found positive for?<br>
              <br>
              Perhaps this lack of clarity is why some members of the
              Moderna and Pfizer boards of directors have sold part of
              their company shares.<br>
              <br>
              So let’s go back to the questions that many posed to
              themselves months ago, and to the never-contradicted
              contents of my two Open Letters to President Trump: a
              world plan appears in its disconcerting reality. The
              architects of the plan, creating an unjustified social
              alarm about an alleged pandemic — that today we see is no
              more serious than a normal flu, as confirmed by official
              data from all over the world — has been used to create a
              tremendous global social and economic crisis and so to
              legitimize the drastic reduction of the basic rights of
              the population. It is what its authors themselves call the
              Great Reset: the global reset of the economy, of society
              and of masses of people.<br>
              <br>
              In this project, the Covid virus plays a fundamental role,
              as an alibi that justifies — in the face of the “totem” of
              a science that has prostituted itself to the interests of
              an elite after having abdicated its mission to save human
              lives — the deprivation of freedom, the interference of
              governments in the private life of its citizens, the
              establishment of a pseudo-health regime in which, against
              all objective scientific evidence, the number of diners,
              the distance between people, the possibility of buying,
              selling, breathing and even praying, is decided from
              above.<br>
              <br>
              Someone, in the deafening silence of the Catholic
              Hierarchy, has imposed the closure of churches or the
              limitation of religious celebrations, considering the
              House of God as a cinema or a museum, but at the same time
              declaring abortion clinics “essential services.”<br>
              <br>
              These are the paradoxes of a misguided power, managed by
              people corrupt in the soul and sold out to Satan, a power
              which, after obsessively repeating the mantras of
              “democracy” and “power belongs to the people” is now
              forced to impose a dictatorship on the people themselves,
              in the name of the achievement of objectives aimed at
              protecting the political and financial interests of the
              elite.<br>
              <br>
              The rich are getting richer and richer, while the middle
              classes that constitute the social fabric and the very
              soul of nations is being cut down.<br>
              <br>
              The French Revolution wiped out the Western aristocracy.<br>
              <br>
              The Industrial Revolution obliterated the peasants and
              spread the proletarianization which led to the disaster of
              Socialism and Communism.<br>
              <br>
              The Revolution of ’68 demolished the family and the
              school.<br>
              <br>
              This Great Reset, desired by the globalist elite,
              represents the final revolution with which to create a
              shapeless and anonymous mass of slaves connected to the
              internet, confined to the house, threatened by an endless
              series of pandemics designed by those who already have the
              miraculous vaccine ready.<br>
              <br>
              Precisely in these days, with the harmony of a plan that
              seems orchestrated in every detail under a single
              leadership, the imposition of a vaccine is being theorized
              by many parties, even before the vaccine’s actual
              effectiveness is fully known, and even before the
              vaccine’s possible side-effects may be fully ascertained.<br>
              <br>
              This obligation to receive a vaccine is projected by many
              to occur alongside the issuance by a “health passport,” so
              that those who have such a passport may move without
              limitations, while those who refuse a vaccine would not be
              able to use means of transport, attend restaurants and
              visit public places, schools and offices.<br>
              <br>
              That this represents an intolerable violation of the
              individual’s freedoms does not seem to be a problem:
              law-makers do not hesitate to sack parliaments to impose
              their tyrannical norms, knowing that their power exists as
              long as they obey the Great Reset agenda, endorsed by the
              international institutions such as the European Union and
              the UN.<br>
              <br>
              Faced with such a massive and coordinated deployment of
              forces we remain astonished, bewildered by the impudence
              of those who are telling us, in essence, that we must
              silently accept the dictatorship of a faceless power
              group, because that is how the group has decided.<br>
              <br>
              We are disconcerted by the enslavement of the world Left —
              and of the Democrats in the United States — to this
              agenda, which knows no limits, no restraints on its
              execution, to the point of organizing an electoral coup of
              such magnitude and gravity as to be horrified.<br>
              <br>
              The manual fraud of duplicate ballots, the votes of
              deceased people, citizens who discover they have voted a
              thousand times and employees who tamper with the results
              by obscuring the windows of the polling stations with
              cardboard panels, is accompanied by the use of a
              vote-counting apparatus which is proving not only to be
              open to fraudulent use, but even to have been designed at
              the software level to allow the shifting of votes from one
              candidate to another, based on a complex algorithm.<br>
              <br>
              We discover that the people behind this macroscopic fraud
              are always the same, always of the same political party,
              always subservient to the same ideology. People corrupt in
              intellect and will, because they made themselves the
              slaves of a ruthless tyrant, after refusing to obey a
              good, just and merciful Lord.<br>
              <br>
              Thus, as these have accepted the slavery of sin and
              rebellion against God, today they would like to drag the
              whole of humanity into an abyss of death and despair: it
              is the miserable revenge of Satan, who, not being able to
              defeat the One who cast him into hell, tries to drag with
              him as many souls as possible, in an attempt to frustrate
              the work of Redemption.<br>
              <br>
              We, believers in Christ Our Only Lord, have no reason to
              fear, even against all human reason: we know that, reborn
              in Baptism, we are no longer servants but children of God,
              and that by preserving the friendship of our Lord with
              Grace we can trust in Him, in His provident help, in His
              powerful protection.<br>
              <br>
              Ultimately, this is true freedom: the freedom of the
              children of God, who obey His law not out of fear but out
              of love, not out of compulsion but because in adhering to
              the divine will they will find their own perfect
              fulfillment and their complete realization.<br>
              <br>
              For every soul is created for the greater glory of God,
              for eternal bliss as a reward of fidelity to the Savior.<br>
              <br>
              Don’t let our hearts be troubled!<br>
              <br>
              The maneuvers of those who work in darkness are coming to
              light, showing themselves in all their horror and
              revealing their perverse and infernal matrix.<br>
              <br>
              Lies, deceptions, violence, death: this is the harsh
              reality of evil before which people of good will can only
              be horrified.<br>
              <br>
              If Our Lord deigns to listen to the prayers of His
              children, this castle of lies and fraud will collapse
              miserably, and its architects will have to go back into
              hiding to escape the rigors of justice and the execration
              of peoples.<br>
              <br>
              These are decisive hours: we continue to pray, to recite
              the Holy Rosary, to nourish ourselves with the Most Holy
              Eucharist, to do penance.<br>
              <br>
              The choral voice that rises up to the throne of the divine
              Majesty will not remain unheard.<br>
              <br>
              Let us not be discouraged, because it is in the moment of
              trial that the Lord gives us the opportunity to show our
              trust in Him and to see the greatness of His mercy.<br>
              <br>
              “Whatsoever you ask in my name, I will do, so that the
              Father may be glorified in the Son” (Jn 14, 13). Our Lord
              told us clearly: anything.<br>
              <br>
              We therefore ask the Father, in the name of the Son our
              Lord and Redeemer, through the intercession of His most
              holy Mother our powerful mediator, to show His glory, to
              grant the exaltation of Holy Church, peace and prosperity
              to the Christian peoples, the conversion of sinners, the
              defeat of His enemies.<br>
              <br>
              “God arises, and his enemies will be scattered, and those
              who hate him will flee before him” (Psalm 68:1).<br>

              ...People are either pissed off, scared, or both. A few
              suggested Trump Campaign should have seen this coming.
              That they should have equipped GOP poll people with hidden
              camera’s, hired building surveillance, etc. Most felt GOP
              should have known, and worked months ago to have
              Supervisors in the rotten cities, not just poll watchers.
              Not one person felt the Trump campaign was handling this
              well. Election corruption has been known for years so
              “Trump should have had an organized and immediate
              response, like a tactical team of law enforcement and IT
              specialists, all swooping in just like they did to Roger
              Stone”. One guy said “most everything we hear about just
              comes from a citizen who figured out a piece of the fraud.
              Where the hell is Trumps election SWAT team? Another said
              “The lawsuits are just broadcasting to the Dems and
              Dominion what evidence they need to hide or fabricate.”<br>

              </div>
              <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
              </b>With increased life expectancy age-associated
              cognitive decline becomes a growing concern, even in the
              absence of recognizable neurodegenerative disease. The
              integrated stress response (ISR) is activated during aging
              and contributes to age-related brain phenotypes. We
              demonstrate that treatment with the drug-like
              small-molecule ISR inhibitor ISRIB reverses ISR activation
              in the brain, as indicated by decreased levels of
              activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and
              phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor
              eIF2. Furthermore, ISRIB treatment reverses spatial memory
              deficits and ameliorates working memory in old mice. At
              the cellular level in the hippocampus, ISR inhibition i)
              rescues intrinsic neuronal electrophysiological
              properties, ii) restores spine density and iii) reduces
              immune profiles, specifically interferon and T
              cell-mediated responses. Thus, pharmacological
              interference with the ISR emerges as a promising
              intervention strategy for combating age-related cognitive
              decline in otherwise healthy individuals.<br>

                  Fearmongering and Ignorance</b><br>
                <b>By Jeff Harris</b><br>
              </div>
              <br>
              Ever since the alleged pandemic erupted this past March
              the mainstream media has spewed a non-stop stream of
              misinformation that appears to be laser focused on
              generating maximum fear among the citizenry. But the facts
              and the science simply don’t support the grave picture
              painted of a deadly virus sweeping the land.<br>
              Yes we do have a pandemic, but it’ a pandemic of ginned up
              pseudo-science masquerading as unbiased fact. Here are
              nine facts backed up with data, in many cases from the CDC
              itself that paints a very different picture from the fear
              and dread being relentlessly drummed into the brains of
              unsuspecting citizens.<br>
              <br>
              <b>1) The PCR test is practically useless</b><b><br>
              </b>According to an article in the New York Times August
              29th 2020 testing for the Covid-19 virus using the popular
              PCR method results in up to 90% of those tested showing
              positive results that are grossly misleading.<br>
              Officials in Massachusetts, New York and Nevada compiled
              testing data that revealed the PCR test can NOT determine
              the amount of virus in a sample. (viral load) The amount
              of virus in up to 90% of positive results turned out to be
              so miniscule that the patient was asymptomatic and posed
              no threat to others. So the positive Covid-19 tests are
              virtually meaningless.<br>
              <br>
              <b>2) A positive test is NOT a CASE</b><b><br>
              </b>For some reason every positive Covid-19 test is
              immediately designated a CASE. As we saw in #1 above up to
              90% of positive Covid-19 tests result in miniscule amounts
              of virus that do not sicken the subject. Historically only
              patients who demonstrated actual symptoms of an illness
              were considered a case. Publishing positive test results
              as “CASES” is grossly misleading and needlessly alarming.<br>
              <br>
              <b>3) The Centers for Disease Control dramatically lowered
                the Covid-19 Death Count </b><b><br>
              </b>On August 30th the CDC released new data that showed
              only 6% of the deaths previously attributed to Covid-19
              were due exclusively to the virus. The vast majority, 94%,
              may have had exposure to Covid-19 but also had preexisting
              illnesses like heart disease, obesity, hypertension,
              cancer and various respiratory illnesses. While they died
              with Covid-19 they did NOT die exclusively from Covid-19.<br>
              <br>
              <b>4) CDC reports Covid-19 Survival Rate over 99% </b><b><br>
              </b>The “Second Wave”: Politics Influences the “Science”
              of COVID-19. Flawed Data, Flawed Models<br>
              The CDC updated their “Current Best Estimate” for Covid-19
              survival on September 10th showing that over 99% of people
              exposed to the virus survived. Another way to say this is
              that less than 1% of the exposures are potentially life
              threatening. According to the CDC the vast majority of
              deaths attributed to Covid-19 were concentrated in the
              population over age 70, close to normal life expectancy.<br>
              <br>
              <b>5) CDC reveals 85% of Positive Covid cases wore face
                masks Always or Often </b><b><br>
              </b>In September of 2020 the CDC released the results of a
              study conducted in July where they discovered that 85% of
              the positive Covid test subjects reported wearing a cloth
              face mask always or often for two weeks prior to testing
              positive. The majority, 71% of the test subjects reported
              always wearing a cloth face mask and 14% reported often
              wearing a cloth face mask. The only rational conclusion
              from this study is that cloth face masks offer little if
              any protection from Covid-19 infection.<br>
              <br>
              <b>6) There are inexpensive, proven therapies for Covid-19</b><b><br>
              </b>Harvey Risch, MD, PhD heads the Yale University School
              of Epidemiology. He authored “The Key to Defeating
              Covid-19 Already Exists. We Need to Start Using It”which
              was published in Newsweek Magazine July 23rd, 2020. Dr.
              Risch documents the proven effectiveness of treating
              patients diagnosed with Covid-19 using a combination of
              Hydroxychloroquine, an antibiotic like azithromycin and
              the nutritional supplement zinc. Medical Doctors across
              the globe have reported very positive results using this
              protocol particularly for early stage Covid patients.<br>
              <br>
              <b>7) The US Death Rate is NOT spiking</b><b><br>
              </b>If Covid-19 was the lethal killer it’s made out to be
              one would reasonably expect to see a significant spike in
              the number of deaths reported. But that hasn’t happened.
              According to the CDC as of early May 2020 the total number
              of deaths in the US was 944,251 from January 1 – April
              30th. This is actually slightly lower than the number of
              deaths during the same period in 2017 when 946,067 total
              deaths were reported.<br>
              <br>
              <b>8) Most Covid-19 Deaths Occur at the End of a normal
                Lifespan</b><b><br>
              </b>According to the CDC as of 2017 US males can expect a
              normal lifespan of 76.1 years and females 81.1 years. A
              little over 80% of the suspected Covid-19 deaths have
              occurred in people over age 65. According to a June 28th
              New York Post article almost half of all Covid suspected
              deaths have occurred in Nursing Homes which predominately
              house people with preexisting health conditions and close
              to or past their normal life expectancy.<br>
              <br>
              <b>9) CDC Data Shows Minimal Covid Risk to Children and
                Young Adults</b><b><br>
              </b>The CDC reported in their September 10th update that
              it’s estimated Infection Mortality Rate (IFR) for children
              age 0-19 was so low that 99.97% of those infected with the
              virus survived. For 20-49 year-olds the survival rate was
              almost as good at 99.98%. Even those 70 years-old and
              older had a survival rate of 94.6%. To put this in
              perspective the CDC data suggest that a child or young
              adult up to age 19 has a greater chance of death from some
              type of accident than they do from Covid-19.<br>
              Taken together it should be obvious that Covid-19 is
              pretty similar to typical flu viruses that sicken some
              people annually. The vast majority are able to
              successfully fight off the virus with their body’s natural
              immune system. Common sense precautions should be taken,
              particularly by those over age 65 that suffer from
              preexisting medical conditions.<br>
              The gross over reaction by government leaders to this
              illness is causing much more distress, physical, emotional
              and financial, than the virus ever could on its own. The
              bottom line is there is NO pandemic, just a typical flu
              season that has been wildly blown out of proportion by
              24/7 media propaganda and enabled by the masses paralyzed
              by irrational fear.<br>
              State and local governments in particular have ignored the
              rights of the people and have instituted outrageous
              attacks on freedom and liberty that was bought and paid
              for by the blood and sacrifice of our forefathers.<br>
              Slowly the people are recognizing the great fraud
              perpetrated on them by bureaucrats and elected officials
              who have sworn to uphold rights and freedoms as spelled
              out in the US Constitution. The time has come to hold
              these criminals accountable by utilizing the legal system
              to bring them to justice.<br>
              Either we act now to preserve freedom and liberty for our
              children and future generations yet unborn, or we meekly
              submit to tyrants who crave more power and control. I will
              not comply!<br>

              "Technical progress in the open-source self replicating
              rapid prototyper (RepRap) community has enabled a
              distributed form of additive manufacturing to expand
              rapidly using polymer-based materials. However, the lack
              of an open-source metal alternative and the high capital
              costs and slow throughput of proprietary commercialized
              metal 3-D printers has severely restricted their
              deployment. The applications of commercialized metal 3-D
              printers are limited to only rapid prototyping and
              expensive finished products. This severely restricts the
              access of the technology for small and medium enterprises,
              the developing world and for use in laboratories. This
              paper reports on the development of a &lt;$2000
              open-source metal 3-D printer. The metal 3-D printer is
              controlled with an open-source micro-controller and is a
              combination of a low-cost commercial gas-metal arc welder
              and a derivative of the Rostock, a deltabot RepRap. The
              bill of materials, electrical and mechanical design
              schematics, and basic construction and operating
              procedures are provided. A preliminary technical analysis
              of the properties of the 3-D printer and the resultant
              steel products are performed. The results of printing
              customized functional metal parts are discussed and
              conclusions are drawn about the potential for the

              <br>
              ...Insects, which comprise two thirds of all terrestrial
              species, have been dying off at alarming rates, with
              disastrous impacts on food chains and habitats,
              researchers say....<br>
              <br>
              To demonstrate the rapid decline, a lab technician holds
              up two bottles: one from 1994 contains 1,400 grammes of
              trapped insects, the newest one just 300 grammes...<br>
              <br>
              In February, they published the first synthesis of 73
              studies on entomological fauna around the world over the
              past 40 years, listing places from Costa Rica to southern
              France.<br>
              <br>
              They calculated that over 40 percent of insect species are
              threatened with extinction, and each year about one
              percent is added to the list.<br>
              <br>
              This is equivalent, they noted, to "the most massive
              extinction episode" since the dinosaurs disappeared.<br>
              <br>
              The main drivers appeared to be habitat loss and land
              conversion to intensive agriculture and urbanisation,
              followed by pollution, mainly from pesticides and
              fertilisers, invasive species and climate change.<br>
              <br>
              "The conclusion is clear," they wrote. "Unless we change
              our ways of producing food, insects as a whole will go
              down the path of extinction in a few decades." <br>

                  discover how to spot ‘winning’ sperm in breakthrough
                  for non-hormonal male contraceptives </b><br>
              </div>
              <br>
              &nbsp;Researchers have discovered how to spot a winner
              among the millions of sperm racing to fertilize an egg –
              and it’s all down to minute characteristics that literally
              make the difference between life and death.<br>
              <br>
              In their recently published report, the team of scientists
              at Yale University reveal that they’ve identified the key
              molecular characteristics that distinguish the eventual
              winners from the millions of losers in the seminal sprint.<br>
              <br>
              Sperm tails are lined with pores that absorb calcium and
              help propel the microscopic swimmers through the female
              reproductive tract. Each pore is divided in four, and
              these subunits – named and numbered CatSper 1 through 4 –
              combine to control the mobility and navigation of the
              sperm. <br>
              <br>
              The Yale scientists, led by Jean-Ju Chung, describe the
              subunits as the sperm’s racing stripes, with one in
              particular found to be critical in deciding which sperm
              achieves the final goal of fertilization.<br>
              <br>
              The team used 3D molecular imaging and artificial neural
              network modeling to visually track and quantify sperm as
              they travelled through the reproductive tracts of female
              mice shortly&nbsp; after mating.<br>
              <br>
              They found that CatSper1 yielded a clear competitive
              advantage – sperm that lost function in this subunit
              became immobile and were left in the oviduct dust, so to
              speak. <br>
              <br>
              However, this wasn’t the only means by which they could
              spot a winner. Champion sperm are apparently more
              streamlined, having shed a kind of cap known as an
              acrosome, affording them another leg-up on the
              competition. <br>
              <br>
              Research such as this may lead to breakthroughs in the
              fields of new treatments for infertility or, conversely,
              male birth control. For example, blocking the CatSper
              channel could lead to the development of non-hormonal
              contraceptives with few if any side effects for both men
              and women. <br>
              <br>
              “Better understanding how the fittest sperm cells are
              selected and how those left are eliminated after
              fertilization in the female reproductive tract can improve
              current strategies for assisted reproduction,” Chung said.<br>

              That was one of the more extraordinary interviews we have
              done here at UnHerd.<br>
              Professor Johan Giesecke, one of the world’s most senior
              epidemiologists, advisor to the Swedish Government (he
              hired Anders Tegnell who is currently directing Swedish
              strategy), the first Chief Scientist of the European
              Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and an advisor
              to the director general of the WHO, lays out with
              typically Swedish bluntness why he thinks:<br>
              <br>
              - UK policy on lockdown and other European countries are
              not evidence-based<br>
              - The correct policy is to protect the old and the frail
              only<br>
              - This will eventually lead to herd immunity as a
              “by-product”<br>
              - The initial UK response, before the “180 degree U-turn”,
              was better<br>
              - The Imperial College paper was “not very good” and he
              has never seen an unpublished paper have so much policy
              impact<br>
              - The paper was very much too pessimistic<br>
              - Any such models are a dubious basis for public policy
              anyway<br>
              - The flattening of the curve is due to the most
              vulnerable dying first as much as the lockdown<br>
              - The results will eventually be similar for all countries<br>
              - Covid-19 is a “mild disease” and similar to the flu, and
              it was the novelty of the disease that scared people.<br>
              - The actual fatality rate of Covid-19 is the region of
              0.1%<br>
              - At least 50% of the population of both the UK and Sweden
              will be shown to have already had the disease when mass
              antibody testing becomes available<br>

              ...The researchers, from North Carolina State University,
              carried out lab studies and computer simulations to
              examine how the so-called main protease (Mpro) in the
              coronavirus reacted to the plant compounds.<br>
              “Mpro in SARS-CoV-2 is required for the virus to replicate
              and assemble itself. If we can inhibit or deactivate this
              protease, the virus will die,” the study’s corresponding
              author, DeYu Xie, explained.<br>
              The investigations discovered that the chemical compounds
              found in the foods and drinks fill up a ‘pocket’ in the
              Mpro, rendering it useless, effectively stopping the virus
              from replicating.<br>
              “Green tea has five tested chemical compounds that bind to
              different sites in the pocket on Mpro, essentially
              overwhelming it to inhibit its function,” Xie said.<br>
              “Muscadine grapes contain these inhibitory chemicals in
              their skins and seeds. Plants use these compounds to
              protect themselves, so it is not surprising that plant
              leaves and skins contain these beneficial compounds.”.. <br>

              (+)-catechin (CA), (–)-epicatechin (EC), (+)-gallocatechin
              (GC), (–)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (+)-catechin-3-O-gallate
              (CAG), (–)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate (ECG),
              (–)-gallocatechin-3-O-gallate (GCG),
              (–)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG), procyanidin A2
              (PA2), and procyanidin B2 (PB2), were selected for docking
              simulation. The resulting data predicted that all 12
              metabolites could bind to Mpro. The affinity scores of PA2
              and PB2 were predicted to be −9.2, followed by ECG, GCG,
              EGCG, and CAG, −8.3 to −8.7, and then six flavan-3-ol
              aglycones, −7.0 to −7.7. Docking characterization
              predicted that these compounds bound to three or four
              subsites (S1, S1′, S2, and S4) in the binding pocket of
              Mpro via different spatial ways and various formation of
              one to four hydrogen bonds. In vitro analysis with 10
              available compounds showed that CAG, ECG, GCG, EGCG, and
              PB2 inhibited the Mpro activity with an IC50 value, 2.98 ±
              0.21, 5.21 ± 0.5, 6.38 ± 0.5, 7.51 ± 0.21, and 75.3 ± 1.29
              μM, respectively, while CA, EC, EGC, GC, and PA2 did not
              have inhibitory activities. To further substantiate the
              inhibitory activities, extracts prepared from green tea
              (GT), two muscadine grapes (MG), cacao, and dark chocolate
              (DC), which are rich in CAG, ECG, GAG, EGCG, or/and PB2,
              were used for inhibitory assay. The resulting data showed
              that GT, two MG, cacao, and DC extracts inhibited the Mpro
              activity with an IC50 value, 2.84 ± 0.25, 29.54 ± 0.41,
              29.93 ± 0.83, 153.3 ± 47.3, and 256.39 ± 66.3 μg/ml,
              respectively. These findings indicate that on the one
              hand, the structural features of flavan-3-ols are closely
              associated with the affinity scores; on the other hand,
              the galloylation and oligomeric types of flavan-3-ols are
              critical in creating the inhibitory activity against the
              Mpro activity.<br>

              </div>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Researchers found a connection between
              the intake of iron and seed oils high in omega-6
              polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with diabetic
              peripheral neuropathy (DPN) in people with Type 2 diabetes<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both high dietary iron intake and an
              elevated iron/PUFA ratio were associated with DPN<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the study evaluated PUFA intake
              of omega-6 and omega-3 together, it was the ratio of
              iron/omega-6 that showed a significant association with
              DPN<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One way to help stop the oxidative
              damage caused by iron intake in the presence of too many
              omega-6s is to take carnosine or its primary precursor,
              beta-alanine<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many chronic diseases appear to be the
              result of a catastrophic cascade of health declines
              triggered by the long-term consumption of omega-6 seed
              oils<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To protect your health, it is vital
              that you reduce your intake of industrially processed seed
              oils as much as you can, which includes virtually all
              processed foods and fast foods that contain them...<br>
              <br>
              So, only purchase trusted and tested brands and once you
              have them put the oil in the fridge. The linoleic acid
              will remain liquid. Simply pour that oil in the trash and
              your olive or avocado oil will be healthier.,,<br>

              Cut to the facts about coronavirus in Corona, False
              Alarm?, the runaway German bestseller. In June 2020,
              Corona, False Alarm? exploded into the German market,
              selling 200,000 copies and 75,000 e-books in six weeks. No
              other topic dominates our attention as much as coronavirus
              and COVID-19, the infectious disease it triggers. There's
              been a global deluge of contradictory opinions, fake news,
              and politically controlled information. Differing views on
              the dangers posed by the pandemic have led to deep
              division and confusion, within governments, society, and
              even among friends and family. In Corona, False Alarm?,
              award-winning researchers Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi and Dr.
              Karina Reiss give clarity to these confusing and stressful
              times. They offer analysis of whether radical protective
              measures-including lockdown, social distancing, and
              mandatory masking-have been justified, and what the
              ramifications have been for society, the economy, and
              public health. Dr. Bhakdi and Dr. Reiss provide dates,
              facts, and background information, including: How Covid-19
              compares with previous coronaviruses and the flu virus
              What infection numbers and the death rate really tell us
              The challenges around lockdown: Were the protective
              measures justified? Mandatory mask-wearing: Does the
              science support it? Does the race for vaccine development
              make sense? What are the chances of success? Will the
              vaccine be safe? Will people accept it? Corona, False
              Alarm? provides you with sound information and
              substantiated facts-and encourages you to form your own
              opinion on the corona crisis. <br>

                  microscope that can see through an intact skull</b><br>
              </div>
              <br>
              Non-invasive microscopic techniques such as optical
              coherence microscopy and two-photon microscopy are
              commonly used for in vivo imaging of living tissues. When
              light passes through turbid materials such as biological
              tissues, two types of light are generated: ballistic
              photons and multiply scattered photons. The ballistic
              photons travel straight through the object without
              experiencing any deflection and hence is used to
              reconstruct the object image. On the other hand, the
              multiply scattered photons are generated via random
              deflections as the light passes through the material and
              show up as speckle noise in the reconstructed image. As
              the light propagates through increasing distances, the
              ratio between multiply scattered and ballistic photons
              increases drastically, thereby obscuring the image
              information. In addition to the noise generated by the
              multiply scattered light, optical aberration of ballistic
              light also causes contrast reduction and image blur during
              the image reconstruction process...<br>
              Recently, a research team led by Prof. CHOI Wonshik at the
              Center for Molecular Spectroscopy and Dynamics within the
              Institute of Basic Science (IBS) in Seoul, South Korea
              made a major breakthrough in deep-tissue optical imaging.
              They developed a novel optical microscope that can image
              through an intact mouse skull and acquire a microscopic
              map of neural networks in the brain tissues without losing
              spatial resolution.<br>
              This new microscope is termed as a reflection matrix
              microscope, and it combines the powers of both hardware
              and computational adaptive optics (AO), which is a
              technology originally developed for ground-based astronomy
              to correct optical aberrations. While conventional
              confocal microscope measures reflection signal only at the
              focal point of illumination and discard all out of focus
              light, the reflection matrix microscope records all the
              scattered photons at positions other than the focal point.
              The scattered photons are then computationally corrected
              using a novel AO algorithm called closed-loop accumulation
              of single scattering (CLASS), which the team developed
              back in 2017. The algorithm exploits all scattered light
              to selectively extract ballistic light and correct severe
              optical aberration. Compared to the most conventional AO
              microscopy systems, which require bright point-like
              reflectors or fluorescent objects as guide stars similarly
              to the use of AO in astronomy, the reflection matrix
              microscope works without any fluorescent labeling and
              without depending on the target’s structures. In addition,
              the number of aberration modes that can be corrected is
              more than 10 times greater than that of the conventional
              AO systems...<br>

              Peruvian Doctors for the Truth have issued a short video,
              explaining the enormous risks of the three different types
              of vaccines currently on the market in Peru, two of them
              are genetically engineered in one way or another and will
              affect the human DNA. Humans would become “transhumans”,
              like genetically modified corn, soja, cotton – and more.<br>
              The breaking part of this news is that there is yet
              another medication, called IVERMECTIN, that has been
              FDA-approved and already successfully applied in Southern
              Peru, in Argentina and elsewhere. See this.<br>
              Ivermectin, a medication known for over 60 years, has been
              applied successfully for many infectious diseases –
              including river-blindness, throughout Africa. It was
              highly recommended by WHO, at a time when WHO still had a
              human touch.<br>
              The third vaccine would be recreating a weaker version of
              the virus in your body. The more traditional type of
              vaccine. But none of them has been seriously tested.<br>
              The trans-genetic ones have not even been animal-tested.
              And the few voluntary tests that were carried out in
              particular with the Moderna vaccine have left disastrous
              results. While none of the 40 robust volunteers died, all
              of them had serious side effects, serious health problems
              and had to be hospitalized – and the long-term
              consequences are not known. How they turn around now,
              Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca, claiming up to
              95% efficiency. What a joke!!! Never tested – and lying to
              the people, so they will buy into the fraud.<br>
              The long-term consequences of any of these vaccines are
              not known, will not be known for a long time. And nobody
              can sue any of the pharma companies, they are “immune”
              under the 1986 Supreme Court ratified National Childhood
              Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) (42 U.S.C. §§ 300aa- 1 to
              300aa-34).<br>
              Pharma companies can never be sued for any damage their
              vaccines cause.<br>
              One of the long-term effects of covid-19 vaccines, may be
              reduced virility for men and infertility for women. This
              fits the Bill Gates, Rockefeller et al eugenics agenda
              (Bill Gates TedTalk in 2010 – “Innovating to Zero”).
              Provides an early flavor of what the Gates and Co. clan
              have in mind for humanity.<br>
              With support of WHO, Bill Gates initiated in 2010 and 2014
              in Kenya a tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccination program:<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1993, WHO announced a “birth-control
              vaccine” for “family planning”. Published research shows
              that by 1976 WHO researchers had conjugated tetanus toxoid
              (TT) with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) producing a
              “birth-control” vaccine. Conjugating TT with hCG causes
              pregnancy hormones to be attacked by the immune system.
              Expected results are abortions in females already pregnant
              and/or infertility in recipients not yet impregnated.
              Repeated inoculations prolong infertility. Currently WHO
              researchers are working on more potent anti-fertility
              vaccines using recombinant DNA. WHO publications show a
              long-range purpose to reduce population growth in unstable
              “less developed countries”. By November 1993 Catholic
              publications appeared saying an abortifacient vaccine was
              being used as a tetanus prophylactic. In November 2014,
              the Catholic Church asserted that such a program was
              underway in Kenya. Three independent Nairobi accredited
              biochemistry laboratories tested samples from vials of the
              WHO tetanus vaccine being used in March 2014 and found hCG
              where none should be present. In October 2014, 6
              additional vials were obtained by Catholic doctors and
              were tested in 6 accredited laboratories. Again, hCG was
              found in half the samples. Subsequently, Nairobi’s AgriQ
              Quest laboratory, in two sets of analyses, again found hCG
              in the same vaccine vials that tested positive earlier but
              found no hCG in 52 samples alleged by the WHO to be vials
              of the vaccine used in the Kenya campaign 40 with the same
              identifying batch numbers as the vials that tested
              positive for hCG. Given that hCG was found in at least
              half the WHO vaccine samples known by the doctors involved
              in administering the vaccines to have been used in Kenya,
              our opinion is that the Kenya “anti-tetanus” campaign was
              reasonably called into question by the Kenya Catholic
              Doctors Association as a front for population growth
              reduction.<br>
              The Kenyan Government sued WHO – which is immune for
              lawsuits, but had to officially apologize.<br>
              Since Bill Gates and his Foundation are behind this
              obsessive vaxxer craze, and they are supported by the very
              institution – a UN organization- imagine!!! – WHO – for
              which Bill Gates is one of the biggest single funders, it
              is not unlikely that Covid vaccines may contain similar
              sterilization components – the effect of which may not be
              seen immediately – but only over time, and especially, the
              weakened virility and fertility may be passed on
              genetically to future generations.<br>
              Back to the three vaccines the medical doctor of Peru’s
              Doctors for the Truth mentions. The vaccine based on
              replication of a weaker virus version – has not been
              tested either. The Tuberculosis vaccine – a similar type –
              was tested for 17 years before it was applied large-scale.
              The next-in-line for SARS was tested during 5 ½ years.<br>
              We are talking about enormous risks – and with the fear –
              the extreme fear instilled in people – it is likely that
              there will be long lines when the vaccines become
              available – and people think after being inoculated with
              one of them, they will be home free and life will go back
              to “normal”.<br>
              It will not. Be aware. Life will not go back to normal.<br>
              Only our fierce resistance may eventually bring a return
              to something similar to what we once knew as normal. But
              it will be a new “normal” made by the people, for the
              people; and NOT by an ultra-rich elite – of which the 193
              UN member governments and their respective parliaments
              were coopted as being part – bought, coerced, bribed. Not
              a “new normal”, as proposed by the World Economic Forum
              (WEF) – The Great Reset (Klaus Schwab – July 2020), or the
              IMF, The Great Transformation.<br>
              This is just the beginning. If you let yourself be
              inoculated by these treacherous politicians – like Boris
              Johnson – who orders vaccination to start next week, i.e.
              in the week beginning on 7 December 2020 – with a vaccine
              that has not been tested, you may be in for nefarious
              surprises.<br>
              People, victims of the British warp-speed vaccination
              program, have no idea what is being jabbed into their
              bodies. This man, PM of the UK – is inhuman. The harm he
              may inflict on the British population is criminal. BoJo,
              one who serves a higher order, but for nothing does he
              serve the people of the country that he had been chosen to
              serve, the people who pay his salary. If so far, the
              vaccination is not forced or compulsory, it is
              nevertheless heavily encouraged with fear propaganda.<br>
              The solution? – First, No Fear; second: Civil
              disobedience. Boycott he vaccination program, demand being
              treated by alternatives, like Ivermectin – and there are
              many others – many of which are banned by governments.
              They were forced to ban them, by the very higher “orders”
              that are in bed with the pharma industry, for profit greed
              – trillions of dollars – to be made by the vaccine
              campains.<br>
              Say no to vaccination en masse, and count on herd immunity
              which is the logical next phase – and no vaccine is
              needed. Do not get bogged-down in fear.<br>
              Stand up for your rights. Fear is killing your
              self-esteem.<br>
              Your civil and human rights cannot, I repeat, CANNOT, be
              obliterated as the reigning 193 UN member governments are
              intent of doing. See also The Secret Agenda of the World
              Bank and the IMF.<br>
              Unfortunately, there is hardly a government left that is
              not coopted, coerced or bought by these so-called higher
              and darker forces, these forces that might very much be
              related to what people like Joe Biden and Barak Obama
              refer to when they warn repeatedly – like a ritual – We
              are facing a Very Dark Winter.<br>
              No constitution in the world gives them the right to
              eviscerate your civil and human rights. Do not follow the
              mainstream media – look for alternative information – and
              when you see that such information suddenly disappears
              from the internet, from youtube, or is being
              “fact-checked”, you know that you are on the right track.<br>
              There has never in recent history been a time of more
              censoring of more “fake news” planted by the very
              mainstream media.<br>
              Be aware.<br>
              Be self-assured.<br>
              Do not give in to Fear.<br>

                  Scientists Have Learned How to Combat Harmful Fungi,
                  While Sparing Beneficial Ones</b><br>
              </div>
              <br>
              Scientists from Tomsk Polytechnic University (TPU),
              together with foreign colleagues, have developed a method
              for the selective treatment of fungal infections.<br>
              <br>
              The researchers have found that silver nanoparticles
              present in the developed drugs effectively battle
              pathogenic types of fungi, without affecting the useful
              varieties, in contrast to traditional anti-fungal agents.
              The results of the study have been published in the
              journal Colloid and Interface Science Communications.<br>
              <br>
              Researchers from TPU, together with partners from
              Novosibirsk (SPC Vector-Vita) and from the National
              Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), have been
              developing and testing medical and veterinary silver
              nanoparticles-based drugs for many years now. The
              effectiveness of such medications has been proven in
              relation to the treatment of more than 20 infectious
              diseases among humans, animals, and plants. The new
              development opens up the possibility of using silver
              nanoparticles to combat pathogenic fungal infections.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Small silver particles, which are just
              35 ± 15 nanometers (nm) in size, are distributed in a
              water environment to form a colloidal silver solution.<br>
              <br>
              This solution is unstable: silver particles collide with
              each other and precipitate. To prevent nanoparticle
              collusion, scientists add a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)
              polymer to the solution, also known as polyvidone or
              povidone. Experts believe that this makes the obtaining of
              effective nanosilver medicine possible.<br>
              <br>
              Scientists note that there are currently lot of different
              colloidal silver drugs produced in the world, but not all
              of them are effective enough in fighting infections or,
              more importantly, safe when it comes to toxicity.<br>
              <br>
              According to researchers, the uniqueness of these
              developments is due to their high anti-infectious activity
              and non-toxicity when applied in therapeutic doses –
              something that has been proven in a number of studies
              published in leading international papers.<br>
              <br>
              “Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), with a concentration of 25
              μg/ml, were able to inhibit 90% of the growth of Candida
              Tropicalis cells (pathogen for candidiasis). Remarkably
              enough, 50% of the cell population of Saccharomyces
              Boulardii (a useful probiotic) remained viable, which
              could facilitate further reproduction of cells. This means
              that, unlike traditional antifungal drugs, silver
              nanoparticles destroy pathogenic fungi, but have a
              relatively weak effect on beneficial ones," Aleksey
              Pestryakov, professor from the TPU Research School of
              Chemistry and Applied Biomedical Sciences, told Sputnik.<br>
              <br>
              Russian Scientists Create Sophisticated Material to Treat
              Bone Fractures<br>
              After comparing the activity of silver nanoparticles with
              common antifungal agents, scientists have concluded that
              traditional drugs are either not very effective against
              both types of fungal species, or kill beneficial types
              along with pathogenic ones.<br>
              <br>
              Since diseases caused by fungi are common not only among
              humans but also prevalent among animals and plants, the
              results of the development can be used to treat fungal
              diseases in medicine, veterinary medicine, and
              agriculture, according to scientists. The research group
              is currently optimising the conditions for the use of
              developed drugs, including dosage, method of
              administration, and non-toxicity. The researchers will
              then conduct official testing, certification, and push for
              the commercialisation of the medications.<br>

              <b>Abstract</b><br>
              In this study, the antifungal activity of AgNPs was tested
              against C. tropicalis (pathogen fungi) and S. boulardii
              (probiotic). The effectiveness of the AgNPs was assessed
              by comparing their antifungal activity with a triazole
              antifungal drug fluconazole and amphotericin B. The AgNPs
              have a polygonal-like shape (average size of 35 ± 15 nm)
              with 1.2% wt. of metallic silver stabilized with 18.8% wt.
              of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in 80% wt. of distilled
              water. The results revealed that 35 μg/mL of fluconazole
              inhibits 55–60% of both fungal cell growth. As for
              amphotericin B, 5 μg/mL is sufficient to inhibit more than
              95% of both fungal cells. For AgNPs, 25 μg/mL was needed
              to inhibit 90% of the C. tropicalis cell growth, but
              remarkably, 50% of the S. boulardii cell population
              remains viable, which can potentiate cell reproduction.
              Our results could initiate the development of AgNPs
              possessing selective specificity against pathogenic fungal
              species.<br>

                  <b>Abstract</b><br>
                  Supplying global energy demand with CO2-free
                  technologies is becoming feasible thanks to the rising
                  affordability of renewable resources. Hydrogen is a
                  promising vector in the decarbonization of energy
                  systems, but more efficient and scalable synthesis is
                  required to enable its widespread deployment. Here we
                  report contactless H2 production via water
                  electrolysis mediated by the microwave-triggered redox
                  activation of solid-state ionic materials at low
                  temperatures (&lt;250 °C). Water was reduced via
                  reaction with non-equilibrium gadolinium-doped CeO2
                  that was previously in situ electrochemically
                  deoxygenated by the sole application of microwaves.
                  The microwave-driven reduction was identified by an
                  instantaneous electrical conductivity rise and O2
                  release. This process was cyclable, whereas H2 yield
                  and energy efficiency were material- and
                  power-dependent. Deoxygenation of low-energy molecules
                  (H2O or CO2) led to the formation of energy carriers
                  and enabled CH4 production when integrated with a
                  Sabatier reactor. This method could be extended to
                  other reactions such as intensified hydrocarbons
                  synthesis or oxidation.<br>

                  A nasal antiviral created by researchers at Columbia
                  University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons
                  blocked transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets,
                  suggesting the nasal spray also may prevent infection
                  in people exposed to the new coronavirus.<br>
                  <br>
                  The compound in the spray—a lipopeptide developed by
                  Anne Moscona, MD, and Matteo Porotto, PhD, professors
                  in the Department of Pediatrics and directors of the
                  Center for Host-Pathogen Interaction—is designed to
                  prevent the new coronavirus from entering host cells.<br>
                  <br>
                  The antiviral lipopeptide is inexpensive to produce,
                  has a long shelf life, and does not require
                  refrigeration. These features make it stand out from
                  other antiviral approaches under development,
                  including monoclonal antibodies. The new nasal
                  lipopeptide could be ideal for halting the spread of
                  COVID in the United States and globally; the
                  transportable and stable compound could be especially
                  key in rural, low-income, and hard-to-reach

                  model of the human lung first appeared in the journal
                  mBio on October 20, 2020. In this human lung model,
                  the compound was able to extinguish an initial
                  infection, prevent spread of the virus within the
                  lung, and was not at all toxic to the airway cells....<br>

                  <b>Abstract</b><br>
                  Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires reducing
                  viral transmission. SARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated
                  by membrane fusion between the viral and host cell
                  membranes, mediated by the viral spike protein. We
                  have designed a dimeric lipopeptide fusion inhibitor
                  that blocks this critical first step of infection for
                  emerging coronaviruses and document that it completely
                  prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection in ferrets. Daily
                  intranasal administration to ferrets completely
                  prevented SARS-CoV-2 direct-contact transmission
                  during 24-hour co-housing with infected animals, under
                  stringent conditions that resulted in infection of
                  100% of untreated animals. These lipopeptides are
                  highly stable and non-toxic and thus readily translate
                  into a safe and effective intranasal prophylactic
                  approach to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2.<br>

                  Reduced food intake, known as dietary restriction,
                  leads to a longer lifespan in many animals and can
                  improve health in humans. However, the molecular
                  mechanisms underlying the positive effects of dietary
                  restriction are still unclear. Researchers from the
                  Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing have now
                  found one possible explanation in fruit flies: they
                  identified a protein named Sestrin that mediates the
                  beneficial effects of dietary restriction. By
                  increasing the amount of Sestrin in flies, researchers
                  were able to extend their lifespan and at the same
                  time these flies were protected against the
                  lifespan-shortening effects of a protein-rich diet.
                  The researchers could further show that Sestrin plays
                  a key role in stem cells in the fly gut thereby
                  improving the health of the fly.<br>

                  The health benefits of dietary restriction have long
                  been known. Recently, it has become clear that
                  restriction of certain food components, especially
                  proteins and their individual building blocks, the
                  amino acids, is more important for the organism's
                  response to dietary restriction than general calorie
                  reduction. On the molecular level, one particular
                  well-known signalling pathway, named TOR pathway, is
                  important for longevity.<br>

                  </b>Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro says that he
                  will not take a coronavirus vaccine.&nbsp; (Neither
                  should you)<br>
                  <br>
                  During a press briefing broadcast live over multiple
                  social media platforms, Bolsonaro said that he has
                  already decided to refuse a future coronavirus
                  vaccine.<br>
                  <br>
                  “I’m telling you, I’m not going to take it. It’s my
                  right,” he said.<br>
                  <br>
                  The right-wing leader has repeatedly stated that
                  Brazilians will not be required to be vaccinated once
                  a Chinese coronavirus vaccine becomes widely
                  available. Bolsonaro reiterated this at a press
                  briefing, saying that Brazil’s Congress was unlikely
                  to require Brazilians to take a future coronavirus
                  vaccine.<br>
                  <br>
                  “The [Brazilian] president also expressed skepticism
                  about the effectiveness of the use of masks during the
                  live broadcast, implying that there was little
                  conclusive evidence of its success in curbing the
                  transmission of the virus,” according to South
                  American news site Infobae.<br>
                  <br>
                  Bolsonaro has tested positive for the Chinese
                  coronavirus at least two times. After contracting the
                  virus for the first time on July 7, Bolsonaro said he
                  initially suffered from a low-grade fever and mild
                  symptoms. Announcing his positive diagnosis at a press
                  conference held outside on the grounds of Brazil’s
                  presidential palace, Bolsonaro stepped back and
                  removed his mask to demonstrate to the public that he
                  was “absolutely fine” despite the mild symptoms.<br>
                  <br>
                  He subsequently entered a period of semi-isolation for
                  nearly 20 days while recovering from the virus. During
                  this period, the leader continued to venture out on
                  the grounds of the presidential palace to greet his
                  supporters. A proponent of the anti-malarial drug
                  hydroxychloroquine as an anti-coronavirus therapy,
                  Bolsonaro said he received the drug as part of his own
                  treatment. The president announced via Twitter on July
                  25 that he had tested negative for coronavirus.<br>
                  <br>
                  “I’m healed from Covid. I have antibodies, no
                  problems. In my particular case, I first thank God,
                  and secondly, the medication prescribed by the
                  presidential doctor: hydroxychloroquine,” Bolsonaro
                  said on July 30.<br>
                  <br>
                  “The following day, I was already OK. If it was a
                  coincidence or not, I don’t know. But it works,” the
                  leader added.<br>
                  <br>
                  ALTERS HUMAN DNA<br>
                  <br>
                  There are real issues surrounding the so-called
                  COVID-19 Vaccines.&nbsp; They are NOT "vaccines" in
                  any traditional sense.<br>
                  <br>
                  In the past, to create a vaccine, scientists isolated
                  in a laboratory, the pathogen which causes
                  illness.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once isolated, scientists take
                  the DNA "guts" out of the virus, and replace those
                  "guts" with harmless yeast guts.&nbsp; In other words,
                  they "recombine" the virus with harmless yeast
                  guts.&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  So the outside of the virus looks like the pathogen
                  making people sick, but the guts are harmless
                  yeast.&nbsp; This is called a "recombinant" vaccine
                  because they recombined the outer virus envelope with
                  harmless yeast DNA guts.<br>
                  <br>
                  They reproduce this new harmless "virus" and inject
                  the harmless recombinant virus into humans.<br>
                  <br>
                  When our body sees the outside of this "invader" it
                  begins its immune response and we develop immunity to
                  what the original virus LOOKED LIKE on its
                  outside.&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  THAT is how old vaccines worked.<br>
                  <br>
                  This new COVID-19 vaccine is nothing like the
                  old.&nbsp;&nbsp; This new vaccine contains "messenger
                  RNA"&nbsp; Ribo-nucleic-acid; a base level of
                  Deoxy-ribonucleic-acid (DNA).&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  It "programs" the human into whom it is injected so
                  that human's DNA triggers a response to what would be
                  COVID-19.<br>
                  <br>
                  The trouble is, scientists don't know exactly what
                  ELSE this RNA might "program" once is is let loose
                  inside a human!<br>
                  <br>
                  It might start re-programming OTHER aspects of human
                  DNA.&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  In a horrifying possibility, once unleashed, these
                  "messenger RNA" particles could turn someone from
                  human into . . . . not human!<br>
                  <br>
                  There's no way to tell.<br>
                  <br>
                  Worse, there's no way to UN DO what this messenger RNA
                  does.&nbsp; The changes are permanent and cannot be
                  undone.<br>
                  <br>
                  From a scientific stand point, there could be deadly
                  results from this messenger RNA if it causes changes
                  to a human that make it impossible for the person to
                  live.<br>
                  <br>
                  Almost 100% of the people who agreed to accept this
                  vaccine in clinical trials, have had very strong
                  adverse reactions to it.&nbsp; Some have DIED!<br>
                  <br>
                  ALL of the animal testing of this vaccine had to be
                  stopped because ALL the animals DIED.<br>
                  <br>
                  Instead of taking this as a red flag warning,
                  authorities merely "waived" the requirement for animal
                  testing and went straight to human testing!!!!!!!<br>
                  <br>
                  As stated earlier, almost 100% of those who received
                  the vaccine in trials, suffered VERY STRONG adverse
                  reactions.<br>
                  <br>
                  That's the scientific aspect, but there's another
                  aspect: From a RELIGIOUS stand point, it could alter a
                  person so they are no longer recognizable as "human"
                  by God.<br>
                  <br>
                  The book of Revelations warns about this, and does so
                  SPECIFICALLY in Revelation 18:23 --<br>
                  <br>
                  And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all
                  in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the
                  bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy
                  merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy
                  sorceries were all nations deceived.<br>
                  <br>
                  We all know the Bible was translated from Hebrew /
                  Aramaic into Greek, first.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is the
                  origin of sorcery in Greek language: Pharmakeia
                  (Pharmaceuticals!) (Link)<br>
                  <br>
                  So Brazil President Balsonaro has multiple reasons for
                  him NOT TAKING the vaccine.&nbsp; Now, you have those
                  same reasons.<br>
                  <br>
                  Do not be deceived by Pharmaceutical companies into
                  taking a vaccine that alters your DNA.&nbsp; The
                  changes it causes will be irreversible and could cost
                  you literally everything.<br>
