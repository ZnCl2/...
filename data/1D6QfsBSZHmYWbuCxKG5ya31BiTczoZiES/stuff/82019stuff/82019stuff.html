                    paper by Harvard scientists Wake Smith and Gernot
                    Wagner titled “Stratospheric Aerosol Injection
                    Tactics and Costs in the First Fifteen Years of
                    Deployment” is a collation of all the public
                    research on Geoengineering and prescribes a program
                    using high altitude aircraft to disperse chemicals
                    in the stratosphere to reflect sunlight and curb
                    global warming. Going into all the details that
                    would constitute a Geoengineering program. This
                    paper gives a rare insight into how such a thing
                    would operate, how much it would cost and how many
                    planes would be needed. Lending clues to those that
                    want to estimate the size and scope of any possible
                    ongoing Geoengineering that may be occurring over

                    color="#330033">We review the capabilities and costs
                    of various lofting methods intended to deliver
                    sulfates into the lower stratosphere. We lay out a
                    future solar geoengineering deployment scenario of
                    halving the increase in anthropogenic radiative
                    forcing beginning 15 years hence, by deploying
                    material to altitudes as high as ~20 km. After
                    surveying an exhaustive list of potential deployment
                    techniques, we settle upon an aircraft-based
                    delivery system. Unlike the one prior comprehensive
                    study on the topic (McClellan et al 2012 Environ.
                    Res. Lett. 7 034019), we conclude that no existing
                    aircraft design—even with extensive
                    modifications—can reasonably fulfill this mission.
                    However, we also conclude that developing a new,
                    purpose-built high-altitude tanker with substantial
                    payload capabilities would neither be
                    technologically difficult nor prohibitively
                    expensive. We calculate early-year costs of ~$1500
                    ton-1 of material deployed, resulting in average
                    costs of ~$2.25 billion yr-1 over the first 15 years
                    of deployment. We further calculate the number of
                    flights at ~4000 in year one, linearly increasing by
                    ~4000 yr-1. We conclude by arguing that, while
                    cheap, such an aircraft-based program would unlikely
                    be a secret, given the need for thousands of flights
                    annually by airliner-sized aircraft operating from
                    an international array of bases.<br>

                    play a role in the widest range of ailments, are the
                    bacteria that cause gum disease. This is the most
                    widespread disease of ageing - in fact, "the most
                    prevalent disease of mankind", says Maurizio Tonetti
                    at the University of Hong Kong. In the US, 42 per
                    cent of those aged 30 or above have gum disease, but
                    that rises to 60 per cent in those 65 and older. It
                    has been measured at 88 per cent in Germany...<br>
                    <br>
                    Your mouth hosts more than 1000 species of bacteria,
                    in a stable community where potential bad actors are
                    kept in check by peaceful bacteria around them.
                    Elsewhere in the body, including on the skin or the
                    lining of the gut, communities of bacteria live on a
                    continuous sheet of cells, where the outermost layer
                    is constantly shed, getting rid of invasive
                    bacteria. But your teeth can't cast off a layer like
                    that, says Tonetti. There, the bacteria live on a
                    hard surface, which pierces through the protective
                    outer sheet of cells...<br>
                    <br>
                    P. gingivalis may have a hand in it. It actually
                    perpetuates inflammation by producing molecules that
                    block some inflammatory processes, but not all of
                    them, says Caroline Genco of Tufts University in
                    Massachusetts. The resulting weakened inflammation
                    never quite destroys the bacteria, but keeps trying,
                    killing your own cells in the process. The debris is
                    a feast for P. gingivalis, which, unlike most
                    bacteria, needs to eat protein.<br>
                    <br>
                    The destruction also liberates the iron that
                    bacteria need and which the body therefore normally
                    keeps locked up. "These bacteria manipulate their
                    interaction with the host immune response to enhance
                    their own survival," says George Hajishengallis at
                    the University of Pennsylvania.<br>

                    Eventually, the infected tooth falls out - but long
                    before that P. gingivalis escapes into the
                    bloodstream. There your immune system makes
                    antibodies against it, which usually defend us from
                    germs. But P. gingivalis antibodies seem to be more
                    a mark of its passing than protection. People with
                    these antibodies are actually more likely to die in
                    the next decade than those with none, and more
                    likely to get rheumatoid arthritis or have a heart
                    attack orstroke.<br>
                    <br>
                    This could be because, once in the blood, P.
                    gingivalis changes its surface proteins so it can
                    hide inside white blood cells of the immune system,
                    says Genco. It also enters cells lining arteries. It
                    remains dormant in these locations, occasionally
                    waking to invade a new cell, but otherwise remaining
                    hidden from antibiotics and immune defences.
                    However, even hunkered down within our cells, P.
                    gingivalis continues to activate or block different
                    immune signals, even changing a blood cell's gene
                    expression to make it migrate to other sites of
                    inflammation, where the bacteria can hop out and
                    feast again.<br>
                    <br>
                    One explanation for why gum disease makes you more
                    likely to get conditions like diabetes and
                    Alzheimer's disease is that it adds to your general
                    "inflammatory load". But P. gingivalis may act more
                    directly too: the bacteria have been detected in
                    inflamed tissue in the brain, aorta, heart, liver,
                    spleen, kidneys, joints and pancreas in mice and, in
                    many cases, humans.<br>
                    <br>

                    If the bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis is partly
                    to blame for a wide range of inflammatory diseases
                    such as Alzheimer's and heart disease, why not just
                    kill it? Unfortunately, it is brilliant at dodging
                    our defences: lurking inside cells where antibodies
                    can't reach it, and often lying dormant, making it
                    invisible to antibiotics, which mostly attack
                    bacteria as they divide.<br>
                    <br>
                    We could vaccinate against P. gingivalis, but
                    vaccines work by inducing antibodies. People with
                    gum disease already make antibodies against the
                    bacteria, but these seem to do little to stop it.<br>
                    <br>
                    It may be better to have the antibodies early and
                    stop P. gingivalis invading our mouths when we are
                    young. Eric Reynolds at the University of Melbourne
                    is running a clinical trial of a vaccine that
                    targets gingipains, the protein-digesting enzymes
                    that P. gingivalis makes. Caroline Genco of Tufts
                    University in Massachusetts is also working on an
                    anti-gingipain vaccine. "The key is to prevent it
                    ever colonising," she says.<br>
                    <br>
                    The trouble is, many of us already host the
                    bacteria. Routine gum abrasion, through eating or
                    brushing your teeth, can release the microbes into
                    your bloodstream, even if you don't have gum
                    disease. There it can spread throughout the body and
                    promote inflammation.<br>
                    <br>
                    In studies by the company Cortexyme, antibiotics
                    killed P. gingivalis in mice, but it rapidly became
                    resistant. To limit resistance, instead of trying to
                    kill the bacteria, it may be better to block its
                    ability to cause disease. Cortexyme has a drug that
                    does this by blocking gingipains. In mice, it
                    reversed Alzheimer's-like brain damage without
                    driving resistance in P. gingivalis, and in a small
                    trial in humans it improved inflammation and some
                    measures of cognition. A large trial is now under
                    way.<br>
                    <br>
                    But as all these diseases involve inflammation, why
                    not just block that? If we did, it could leave you
                    open to the germs that this immune response does
                    fight off or block other vital things that immune
                    signals do. That's why some companies are working on
                    drugs to block only specific inflammatory signals.
                    But tampering with our complex immune systems
                    without doing damage - as P. gingivalis shows - will
                    be a significant challenge...<br>
                    <br>
                    Then, in January, teams at eight universities and
                    the San Francisco company Cortexyme found a
                    protein-digesting enzyme called gingipain, produced
                    only by P. gingivalis, in 99 per cent of brain
                    samples from people who died with Alzheimer's, at
                    levels corresponding to the severity of the
                    condition. They also found the bacteria in spinal
                    fluid. Giving mice the bacteria caused symptoms of
                    Alzheimer's, and blocking gingipains reversed the
                    damage. <br>
                    <br>
                    Moreover, half of the brain samples from people
                    without Alzheimer's also had gingipain and amyloid,
                    but at lower levels. That is as you would expect if
                    P. gingivalis causes Alzheimer's, because damage can
                    accumulate for 20 years before symptoms start.
                    People who develop symptoms may be those who
                    accumulate enough gingipain damage during their
                    lifetimes, says Casey Lynch at Cortexyme...<br>

                    Dental decay is one of the most prevalent chronic
                    diseases worldwide. A variety of factors, including
                    microbial, genetic, immunological, behavioral and
                    environmental, interact to contribute to dental
                    caries onset and development. Previous studies
                    focused on the microbial basis for dental caries
                    have identified species associated with both dental
                    health and disease. The purpose of the current study
                    was to improve our knowledge of the microbial
                    species involved in dental caries and health by
                    performing a comprehensive 16S rDNA profiling of the
                    dental plaque microbiome of both caries-free and
                    caries-active subjects. Analysis of over 50,000
                    nearly full-length 16S rDNA clones allowed the
                    identification of 1,372 operational taxonomic units
                    (OTUs) in the dental plaque microbiome.
                    Approximately half of the OTUs were common to both
                    caries-free and caries-active microbiomes and
                    present at similar abundance. The majority of
                    differences in OTU’s reflected very low abundance
                    phylotypes. This survey allowed us to define the
                    population structure of the dental plaque microbiome
                    and to identify the microbial signatures associated
                    with dental health and disease. The deep profiling
                    of dental plaque allowed the identification of 87
                    phylotypes that are over-represented in either
                    caries-free or caries-active subjects. Among these
                    signatures, those associated with dental health
                    outnumbered those associated with dental caries by
                    nearly two-fold. A comparison of this data to other
                    published studies indicate significant heterogeneity
                    in study outcomes and suggest that novel approaches
                    may be required to further define the signatures of
                    dental caries onset and progression...<br>
                    Population Structure of the Dental Plaque Microbiota<br>
                    <br>
                    The 1,372 OTUs observed corresponded to 205 named
                    species and 44 genus level assignments (Figure S1).
                    We observed two dominant species present in the
                    dental plaque samples profiled here, S. mitis
                    (25.5%) and S. sanguinis, (9.1%). There were 14
                    additional species present at abundance levels
                    greater than 1% in the combined data. These
                    included: Veillonella parvula (7.5%), Streptococcus
                    oralis (6.1%), Neiserria subflava (3.0%), Gemella
                    haemolysans (2.8%), Granulicatella elegans (2.6%),
                    Streptococcus gordonii (2.6%), Abiotrophia defectiva
                    (2.5%), S. cristatus (1.9%), C. gracilis (1.8%), C.
                    showae (1.4%), S. infantis (1.3%), S. constellatus
                    (1.3%), S. mutans (1.2%) and C. concisus (1.1%).
                    This composition is consistent with data generated
                    as part of the HMP consortium surveys [34]–[36].
                    Collectively, these 16 species comprise
                    approximately 71% of the bacterial biomass of the
                    dental plaque biofilms surveyed here. The
                    biochemical flux occurring in dental biofilms is
                    strongly influenced by the metabolic activities of
                    these species. We examined an additional 129 OTUs
                    representing moderately abundant OTUs (0.1–1%) and
                    found that it reflected a similarly high
                    representation of Streptococcus spp. and included a
                    disproportionately large number of Proteobacteria,
                    namely Neisseria spp. and Campylobacter spp. We
                    observed &#8764;400 OTUs that we classify as low abundance
                    phylotypes (0.01–0.1%). The remaining &#8764;800 OTUs
                    observed represent very low abundance phylotypes,
                    present at &lt;0.01% of the total microbiome. ..<br>

                    In recent years, the world has finally begun to take
                    notice of the drastically declining bee populations,
                    and people are starting to understand the impact
                    that this could have on the ecosystem. <br>

                    The father-son duo behind the "Flow Hive" took

                    The idea behind their invention was to replicate a
                    real beehive and harvest honey without causing any
                    harm or posing any risk to the bees or their home.<br>
                    <br>
                    Cedar Anderson is a third-generation beekeeper from
                    Nimbin, Australia, and has been tinkering with
                    beehives and the associated technology since he was
                    a young child.<br>
                    <br>
                    Cedar was inspired to create a harm free beehive
                    after his brother was stung during the honey
                    extraction process.<br>
                    <br>
                    Eventually, once Cedar had a working prototype, he
                    put a video online showing the prototype and
                    explaining his idea, hoping to raise $70,000 for a
                    tool that was needed for the factory.<br>
                    <br>
                    However, much to the family's surprise, the
                    IndieGoGo campaign raised over $2 million dollars in
                    one day, and would go on to be the most successful
                    campaign in the website's history, raising over $12
                    million in total.<br>
                    <br>
                    In just a single day, the Anderson's lives were
                    changed forever, and they were left with the
                    monumental task of shipping out 24,000 orders to
                    over 130 countries.<br>
                    <br>
                    However, instead of just retiring and enjoying their
                    riches, the Andersons have donated their profits
                    towards a network of pollination projects that are
                    working to protect wild habitats.<br>
                    <br>
                    "We're proud to have donated 100% of profits from
                    the sale of our Flow Pollinator House to nine local
                    grassroots pollinator projects in Australia and the
                    United States that are at work protecting wild
                    habitats all around the world.<br>
                    <br>
                    Pollinators need large areas of habitat to flourish
                    - the more we can do to protect and conserve native
                    habitats, the more opportunities these tiny
                    environmental champions will have to do their
                    important work," Cedar said.<br>
                    <br>

                    to skim past the earth in 10 years, according to

                    <br>

                    across, and will come within 19,000 miles of the
                    earth's surface. It’s one of the largest asteroids
                    to ever pass so close to the earth and a collision
                    with it could be "devastating for all life on

                Stunning imagery of cosmological wonders show us the

                where they come from,” he said, adding, “It’s better if
                someone stays in their own country and works there.”<br>
                <br>
                The Cardinal asserted that African governments who allow
                such high emigration rates need to examine their
                consciences as to why this is being allowed to happen.<br>
                <br>
                Arinze’s rhetoric is similar to that of Cardinal Robert
                Sarah, who is also black.<br>
                <br>
                Last month, Sarah warned that western civilization is
                living through its “mortal hour” because the masses are
                anaesthetized by “vulgar entertainments” and the elites
                “care for nothing but increasing the luxury of their
                daily lives.”<br>
                <br>
                Cardinal Sarah also previously cautioned that the “west
                will disappear” as a result of mass migration, adding
                that “Islam will invade the world” and “completely
                change culture, anthropology, and moral vision.”<br>

                </div>
                <b><br>
                </b>On August 9, a committee overseeing a clinical trial
                of four experimental therapeutics for Ebola determined
                that two relatively new antibody-based treatments were
                so effective that they would become the new standard of
                care. When these two treatments were administered within
                a day of infection, survival rates were around 90
                percent. As the first Ebola trial to confirm a medical
                success, it’s a hopeful development. The Ebola virus,
                which hijacks the immune system and causes massive
                hemorrhaging, currently proves fatal for nearly 70
                percent of patients.<br>

                “From now on, we will no longer say that Ebola is
                incurable,” Jean-Jacques Muyembe, a longtime Ebola
                researcher who now directs the D.R.C.’s National
                Institute of Biomedical Research, said in a conference

                <b>Abstract<br>
                </b>The same gene is expressed in the functional
                individuals by metacentric chromosome, and in
                dysfunctional individuals via acrocentric chromosome.
                Metacentric chromosome differs from the acrocentric
                chromosome by its shape with the specific Wave Optics in
                the liquid crystal media. Metacentric chromosome is
                analogous to a well-centered and focused eye crystal,
                while acrocentric chromosome is analogous to a myopic or
                farsighted eye. Chromosome is a lens with refraction
                code for focusing genetic information. Thus, precision
                medicine is possible only via mastering Wave Optics in
                chromosomes (© Irene Caesar, Ph.D.). Any violation of
                Wave Optics in chromosomes causes sterility and genetic
                collapse via transgenic contamination. Universe is 93%
                energy, and 7% particles, as concentrated energy,
                including cells and molecules. This energy exists in
                nonlocal unique Wave Crystals (Bioholograms), which are
                the crystalline structures made by waves. All processes
                in genome, including RNA interference, RNA transcription
                and translation, DNA replication, etc., can be explained
                via biochemistry only for 7%. 93% of genomic processes
                can be explained only in terms of Bioholography with its
                wave superposition, with its destructive or constructive
                wave interference, wave reflection, scalar wave
                diffraction grating, and refraction towards Zero Center
                of Wave Crystal according to Geometrical Optics. Thus,
                precision medicine is possible only via mastering
                Bioholography. Any disregard for Bioholography causes
                degeneration and extinction of species. Implication of
                the Holographic Principle states that if the Universe is
                entirely in its every Matrix Point, then, every Matrix
                Point is not simply different from any other Matrix
                Point, but is unique. Thus, every Wave Matrix is both
                nonlocal and unique. If we have two copies of the same
                Wave Matrix, we can transmit information remotely and
                instantaneously between these two copies. Thus,
                precision medicine is possible only via mastering
                Biological Quantum Nonlocality, and remote management of
                Biosystems. Wave Genome LLC produces revolutionary
                chips, of electret nature, that are free of the limit in
                battery power, and limit in the size of conventional
                chips. These chips have their crystalline structure
                coded by laser on nanolevel, and used as tokens for the
                remote management of biosystems. I will introduce the
                protocol of creating the holographic signal which is
                capable of recording and transmitting the holographic
                information both locally and remotely.<br>

                <br>
                “Jewish Privilege today finds its primary expression in
                terms like “hate speech” and “anti-Semitism,” which have
                become weapons wielded to destroy people. The term “hate
                speech” is a creation of the Anti-Defamation League.
                Like the analogous term “anti-Semitism,” hate speech is
                any utterance Jews at organizations like the ADL find
                offensive.”<br>
                “Sixty years ago, Jewish activists like Leo Pfeffer
                claimed with a straight face that Jews favored free
                speech, and, indeed, they did then: they were in the
                forefront of undermining anti-obscenity and
                anti-abortion laws. Once the moral code was destroyed,
                social anarchy followed. A new code was imposed.
                Previously known as political correctness, it is now
                known by its opposite, namely, hate speech.”<br>

                building blocks? Start with the highest quality building
                blocks, right?<br>
                <br>
                Wrong -- at least when working with "flakes" of graphene
                oxide (GO).<br>
                <br>
                A new study from Northwestern University researchers
                shows that better GO "paper" can be made by mixing
                strong, solid GO flakes with weak, porous GO flakes. The
                finding will aid the production of higher quality GO
                materials, and it sheds light on a general problem in
                materials engineering: how to build a nano-scale
                material into a macroscopic material without losing its
                desirable properties...<br>
                <br>
                When a solution of GO flakes is poured onto a filter and
                the water removed, a thin "paper" is formed, usually a
                few inches in diameter with a thickness less than or
                equal to 40 micrometers. Intermolecular forces hold the
                flakes together, nothing more.<br>

                  Strength from weakness<br>
                  <br>
                </b>Scientists can make strong GO in single layers but
                layering the flakes into a paper form doesn't work too
                well. While testing the effect of holes on the strength
                of GO flakes, Huang and his collaborators discovered a
                solution.<br>
                <br>
                Using a mixture of ammonia and hydrogen peroxide, the
                researchers chemically "etched" holes in the GO flakes.
                Flakes left soaking for one to three hours were
                drastically weaker than un-etched flakes. After five
                hours of soaking, flakes became so weak they couldn't be
                measured.<br>
                <br>
                Then, the team found something surprising: Paper made
                from the weakened flakes was stronger than expected. At
                the single layer level, one-hour-etched porous flakes,
                for example, were 70 percent weaker than solid flakes,
                but paper made from those flakes was only 10 percent
                weaker than paper made from solid flakes.<br>
                <br>
                Things got even more interesting when the team mixed
                solid and porous flakes together, Huang said. Instead of
                weakening the paper made solely from solid flakes, the
                addition of 10 or 25 percent of the weakest flakes
                strengthened it by about 95 and 70 percent,
                respectively...<br>

                </b>Graphene oxide (GO) sheets have been used as a model
                system to study how the mechanical properties of
                two-dimensional building blocks scale to their bulk
                form, such as paper-like, lamellar-structured thin
                films. Here, we report that the modulus of multilayer GO
                films can be significantly enhanced if some of the
                sheets are drastically weakened by introducing in-plane
                porosity. Nanometer-sized pores are introduced in GO
                sheets by chemical etching. Membrane-deflection
                measurements at the single-layer level show that the
                sheets are drastically weakened as the in-plane porosity
                increases. However, the mechanical properties of the
                corresponding multilayer films are much less sensitive
                to porosity. Surprisingly, the co-assembly of pristine
                and etched GO sheets yields even stiffer films than
                those made from pristine sheets alone. This is
                attributed to the more compliant nature of the soft
                porous sheets, which act as a binder to improve
                interlayer packing and load transfer in the multilayer
                films.<br>

                Methods for reshaping graphene oxide sheet-containing
                structures using water are provided. Graphene oxide
                sheet-containing structures can be reshaped by applying
                a force to a graphene oxide sheet-containing structure,
                wherein the force changes the initial shape of the
                structure to a new shape. While the force is still
                acting on the graphene oxide sheet-containing structure,
                liquid water is applied to the structure to dissipate
                stress induced by the force and the structure is then
                dried. When the force is removed, the graphene oxide
                sheet-containing structure remains fixed in the new
                shape.<br>

                </div>
                <br>
                &nbsp;A previously unknown sensory organ that detects
                dangerous environmental stimuli may be responsible for
                certain types of pain, according to scientists who
                discovered the organ lurking beneath the skin’s top
                layer.<br>
                <br>
                The meshlike organ senses pressure, pricking, and other
                mechanical discomfort caused by environmental factors,
                scientists at Sweden’s Karolinska Institutet have found.
                Made up of a network of specialized glial cells called
                Schwann cells, which are found near nerves and were not
                previously known to be involved in pain sensation, the
                structure lurks just beneath the skin’s surface,
                extending filament-like protrusions into its outermost
                layer. The researchers published their discovery in
                Science on Thursday, giving the structure the
                less-than-glamorous name of nociceptive glio-neural
                complex (NGNC).<br>
                <br>
                The NGNC forms a unique, intricately-connected network
                with nearby nerve cells all over the body, leading the
                researchers to argue that it should be officially
                designated an organ. Certainly it upends prior models of
                pain sensation which pinpointed its origins in
                nociceptive fibers – individual “naked” nerve endings
                which terminate in the skin. While both systems transmit
                pain in the form of electrical impulses back to the
                brain, the similarities end there.<br>
                <br>
                “Our study shows that sensitivity to pain does not occur
                only in the skin’s nerve [fibers], but also in this
                recently discovered pain-sensitive organ,” study author
                Patrik Ernfors said in a press release accompanying the
                study.<br>
                <br>
                Researchers used gene editing to deactivate the
                specialized Schwann cells in mice, observing that they
                became much less sensitive to mechanical pain, while
                their reaction to extreme heat and cold remained the
                same. And while they acknowledge that the organ’s
                presence in humans hasn’t been confirmed through
                experimentation yet, mice and humans have all other
                sensory systems in common, so it’s a relatively safe bet
                we have the same glial networks lurking beneath our
                skin, causing us to cry out in pain when we stub our
                toes.<br>
                <br>
                The researchers next hope to study the exact mechanism
                by which the cells are activated by pain, down to the
                activation of proteins in response to mechanical
                stimulation. They see their discovery as bringing hope
                for the treatment of chronic pain, a debilitating
                condition that remains poorly understood.<br>
                <br>
                The NGNC wouldn’t be the first new organ to turn up in
                the human body in recent years. Another
                previously-unknown structure called the interstitium was
                discovered last year after long going unnoticed because
                in dead tissue – the kind usually examined under a
                microscope – it collapses to near-invisibility. We don’t
                know our bodies as well as we think.<br>

                    Scientists 'Discover New Organ'</b><br>

                The interstitium, the shock-absorbing tissue underneath
                the skin, gut and blood vessels, has been identified as
                an organ for the first time according to a new study.<br>
                <br>
                Researchers think the layers of the body previously
                believed to be dense, connective tissues are in fact
                interconnected compartments filled with fluid. According
                to the team co-led by New York University's (NYU) School
                of Medicine, the interstitium is an organ in its own
                right and one of the largest in the body. If the
                research, published in the journal Scientific Reports,
                is widely accepted, the interstitium could be regarded
                as the body's 80th organ.<br>
                <br>
                Supported by a mesh of strong and flexible connective
                tissue proteins, the interstitium protects the organs,
                muscles and vessels that keep our bodies alive by
                absorbing bumps and shocks.<br>
                <br>
                The scientists behind the research hope that the
                discovery will help determine why cancer that affects
                this area of the body becomes more likely to
                metastasize. It could be because the fluid in the
                interstitium drains into the lymphatic system, which
                plays a vital role in the immune system...<br>
                <br>
                According to the team, the spaces that make up the
                interstitium were missed because scientists have relied
                on fixed tissue on microscope slides to study the human
                anatomy. The process of preparing tissue for examination
                involves draining away fluid and dyeing it, causing the
                meshwork to flatten like a pancake...<br>

                </b>My first question would be: what is a 16-year old
                autistic school drop-out who has done nothing of note in
                her life other regurgitate climate propaganda doing on
                the cover of a men’s magazine?<br>
                <br>
                Call me naive but I thought the point of men’s magazines
                was to write about stuff that men might find
                interesting: dodging snipers’ bullets in war zones;
                free-diving with great white sharks; playing Scrabble
                with the Medellin cartel; where to track down the
                coolest leather jacket under £1,000; strafing a remote
                baboon colony in a Mig-25 Foxbat; the quest for the
                world’s purest MDMA.<br>
                <br>
                Sure, girls have a place in this universe: as decoration
                and objects of lust. But spooky Greta with her pigtails
                and thousand-yard stare of disapproval is not only far
                too young to qualify for that status but far too earnest
                and grim.<br>
                <br>
                And boring. What kind of man would be remotely
                interested in buying a mag whose main feature entailed a
                finger-wagging lecture (one we’ve all heard a gazillion
                times before) about how, like, totally endangered the
                planet is and how totally it’s all our fault and how
                we’ve got to abandon all the things we hold dear — meat;
                air travel; fast cars; designer threads — in order to
                stop all the baby polar bears melting?<br>
                <br>
                A lecture, furthermore, from a child who hasn’t finished
                her schooling, whose frontal lobes haven’t formed, who
                has no sense of humour, whose every utterance is the
                second-hand opinion of alarmist grown-ups whose doomsday
                claims she is completely unequipped to assess?<br>
                <br>
                No kind of man that I know of, that’s for sure. Unless
                you count tofu-eating, milquetoast, pantywaist, beta,
                snowflake, self-flagellating, Mom’s-basement-dwelling,
                environmental science graduates as men.<br>
                <br>
                Which I’m not sure I do — and&nbsp; they probably
                wouldn’t identify as men, anyway, so I don’t think I’m
                being judgemental here. I’d hate to be judgemental
                because that would be wrong.<br>
                <br>
                But my second and more important question would be: why
                are so many adults who really should know better by dint
                of their age and experience hurrying to prostrate
                themselves before this pigtailed school drop out as if
                she were the new Messiah?<br>
                <br>
                It’s not merely weird. It’s a form of mass hysteria —
                with potentially hugely dangerous consequences for the
                planet because, bizarre though it may seem, lots of
                adults in positions of power and influence seem
                determined to use St Greta of Thunberg’s vacuous
                sloganeering as justification for dismantling Western

                </b>The concept of Predictive linguistics, that is, that
                one may be able to develop algorithms to process data
                retreived from the internet in quantity such that
                prescient wording might be revealed thus yeilding a
                description of the developing future, was born out of
                the first years of the internet being released into
                humanity's grasp. Predictive linguisitics grew from the
                exposure of any and all of us on the internet in those
                early, heady, days, to completely unrestricted human
                expression. There were no rules. It was real 'free
                speech'. The totally uncontrolled, even reactive nature
                of human conversation during those years brought out the

                trying to constantly correct my algorithms for the
                change in the nature of public discourse, and then
                finally, in these last 4 years with the rise of the
                social media censorship, a finality to the working
                practice of predictive linguistics.<br>
                <br>
                With my gradual understanding of the nature of the
                change of language in the public domain within which my
                software was operating and the constraints i was working
                under, i also came to the awareness that the 'future
                impressions' or 'psychic prescience' that i had been
                able to locate for those brief years by software mining
                of language, are still there, now locked, within our
                collective human psyche. The primary effect of the
                imposed censorship, both by the PC culture, and the
                corporate social media owners, will, in my opinion,
                result in all the effects of 'stifling' as we have seen
                in past cultural cul-de-sacs, which is to say,
                increasingly aberrant behavior, both in individuals, and
                collective humanity.<br>
                <br>
                Coincident with my realization that language was being
                squeezed into a narrow constrained box that was forcing
                out the predictive leaks within normal speech, i reached
                several fulcrum points within my life such that i am at
                peace with the situation. It was a good run while it
                lasted. i learned much from both the discovery, and its
                application, and defense over the years. It is not my
                intent to attempt to ressurect the fight against the
                current trends. Free speech will return, and with it, at
                some point, the ability to once again, mine language
                effectively for the psychic leaks that dribble out of
                all of us.<br>
                <br>
                My contented state now is also shaped by having pursued
                this work since 1993. Twenty-six years is enough. Now
                onto the new work that universe will provide. Thank you
                for your support over these past decades in the
                exploration of predictive linguisitics. Even the critics
                of the idea (not so many these days) were helpful in its
                progress.<br>

                  Summary<br>
                </b>Cancer cell plasticity facilitates the development
                of therapy resistance and malignant progression.
                De-differentiation processes, such as an
                epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), are known to
                enhance cellular plasticity. Here, we demonstrate that
                cancer cell plasticity can be exploited therapeutically
                by forcing the trans-differentiation of EMT-derived
                breast cancer cells into post-mitotic and functional
                adipocytes. Delineation of the molecular pathways
                underlying such trans-differentiation has motivated a
                combination therapy with MEK inhibitors and the
                anti-diabetic drug Rosiglitazone in various mouse models
                of murine and human breast cancer in vivo. This
                combination therapy provokes the conversion of invasive
                and disseminating cancer cells into post-mitotic
                adipocytes leading to the repression of primary tumor
                invasion and metastasis formation.<b><br>

                <b><br>
                </b>...Until now we thought that the sperm were pretty
                much identical, except for the DNA that they carry. <br>
                <br>
                But while studying the differences between X and Y sperm
                in mice, the Hiroshima University team found that there
                were around 500 genes active in X sperm that aren't in
                Y.<br>
                <br>
                That's not super important by itself, but 18 of those
                genes code for proteins that stick out on the surface of
                the cell. They homed in on two particular receptors –
                called Toll-like receptors 7 and 8 on the surface of X
                sperm.<br>
                <br>
                Using a chemical called resiquimod to bind to the
                receptors and slow the swimming of the X sperm, they
                were then able to separate the Y and X sperm with
                surprising accuracy.<br>
                <br>
                When the researchers used resiquimod, and then used the
                fastest swimmers to fertilise some mice, the litters
                ended up being 90 percent male; when the slowest
                swimmers were used, the mouse babies were 81 percent

                <b>Abstract<br>
                </b>In most mammals, the male to female sex ratio of
                offspring is about 50% because half of the sperm contain
                either the Y chromosome or X chromosome. In mice, the Y
                chromosome encodes fewer than 700 genes, whereas the X
                chromosome encodes over 3,000 genes. Although overall
                gene expression is lower in sperm than in somatic cells,
                transcription is activated selectively in round
                spermatids. By regulating the expression of specific
                genes, we hypothesized that the X chromosome might exert
                functional differences in sperm that are usually masked
                during fertilization. In this study, we found that
                Toll-like receptors 7/8 (TLR7/8) coding the X chromosome
                were expressed by approximately 50% of the round
                spermatids in testis and in approximately 50% of the
                epididymal sperm. Especially, TLR7 was localized to the
                tail, and TLR8 was localized to the midpiece. Ligand
                activation of TLR7/8 selectively suppressed the mobility
                of the X chromosome–bearing sperm (X-sperm) but not the
                Y-sperm without altering sperm viability or acrosome
                formation. The difference in sperm motility allowed for
                the separation of Y-sperm from X-sperm. Following in
                vitro fertilization using the ligand-selected
                high-mobility sperm, 90% of the embryos were XY male.
                Likewise, 83% of the pups obtained following embryo
                transfer were XY males. Conversely, the
                TLR7/8-activated, slow mobility sperm produced embryos
                and pups that were 81% XX females. Therefore, the
                functional differences between Y-sperm and X-sperm
                motility were revealed and related to different gene
                expression patterns, specifically TLR7/8 on X-sperm.<b><br>

                CJ Hopkins doesn’t say it, but he shows that within all
                of the Western countries in which the white core
                populations are experiencing fierce attack from
                anti-white ideologues in the media and governments that
                rule them, there is unity of voice from the media that
                “Trump is a White Supremacist who inspires
                Terrorism.”&nbsp;
                https://off-guardian.org/2019/08/08/the-war-on-white-supremacist-terror/
                <br>
                <br>
                This unity of voice is suspicious as there are many
                different possible explanations of the El Paso shooting.
                The unity of voice is so uniform—in some cases identical
                phrasing—and so repetitive that it certainly looks like
                an orchestration against Trump and raises suspicions
                that the shooting itself was an orchestration.<br>
                <br>
                The question naturally arises, to achieve such an
                uniformity of response from the Western world, who
                organized it?&nbsp; How was the explanation that blames
                Trump ready at hand all over the US, UK, Europe, Canada
                and Australia, the minute the shooting occurred? Does it
                remind you of the BBC announcing the collapse of World
                Trade Center Building 7 a half hour before it occurred?<br>
                <br>
                Anytime an explanation is ready at hand the minute an
                event occurs, the natural question is who had advance
                information? If there is advance information, where did
                it come from? Why did not authorities with their
                advanced information prevent the attack?Why after
                “Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction,” “Iranian
                nukes,” “Russian invasions,” “Assad’s use of chemical
                weapons,” etc., do media organizations continue to
                provide unexamined explanations? Why did the media
                suppress the shooter’s manifesto?&nbsp; Because it did
                not support the story line and attack on Trump?<br>
                <br>
                As the presstitutes speak with one voice, little wonder
                that some of the few and diminishing number of Americans
                still capable of thought conclude that the El Paso
                shooting was an orchestrated event designed to discredit
                Trump and to abolish the 2nd Amendment.&nbsp; We have
                long known about CIA mind control programs.&nbsp; Many
                experts believe that Sirhan Sirhan, the alleged assassin
                of Robert Kennedy, was a product of the CIA’s mind
                control program.<br>
                <br>
                As the US government has lied to us about so much for so
                long about so many big events, we have no alternative
                but to question everything. But the presstitutes never
                do.&nbsp; Russiagate was a politically motivated hoax,
                but the presstitutes had one voice proclaiming the truth
                of a hoax.The American people have been misled by the
                media and gone along with Washington’s destruction of
                entire countries, such as Iraq and Libya, with millions
                of people killed, maimed, widowed, orphaned, and
                displaced, based on Washington’s lies and fabricated
                “evidence.”&nbsp; If we cannot believe the reasons that
                the government takes us to war, how can we believe
                anything we hear from media and politicians?<br>
                <br>
                The media and Democratic Party’s response to the El Paso
                tragedy make the facts irrelevant. The controlled
                explanation wraps people up in emotions over guns and
                Trump’s wall.&nbsp; The dead in El Paso are portrayed as
                Trump’s fault for being a White Supremacist and
                enforcing US law, which specifies border controls.&nbsp;
                Only White Supremacists kill people and build walls,
                unless they are Israelis, but we are not permitted to
                say anything about that.<br>
                <br>
                By law the US has borders that the law demands be
                enforced. If immigrants can simply walk across the
                border, why can’t they fly into the country or come by
                ships?&nbsp; What is the point of passport
                control?&nbsp; Indeed, what’s the point of
                passports?&nbsp; The concept of citizenship simply
                disappears. <br>
                <br>
                US borders have always been enforced.&nbsp; Badly no
                doubt, but enforced.&nbsp; Trump is simply trying to do
                a better job of enforcing the law than has been done in
                the past. <br>
                <br>
                If the US would simply stop overthrowing reformist
                governments in Latin America, the resources of those
                countries would be taken out of foreign hands and be put
                to work for the local people, which is what Venezuela is
                doing much to the chagrin of American oil
                companies.&nbsp; The last time Honduras elected a
                reformer, America’s first black
                president—Obama—overthrew him.&nbsp; Brazil’s Workers
                Party was destroyed with the US-orchestrated
                imprisonment of its leader, Lula da Silva, and removal
                from office of his successor. In their place Washington
                has installed a corrupt agent of the Americans.&nbsp;
                Oppression is applied to the supporters among the people
                of reformist politicians to ensure that voting ceases to
                put reformers in power.&nbsp; As General Smedley Butler
                said, “I was the enforcer in Latin America for the New
                York Banks and the United Fruit Company.” Perhaps it is
                poetic justice that the peoples whose resources are
                carted off to America decide to go with the
                resources.&nbsp; <br>
                <br>
                If the Democrats want open borders, why don’t they draft
                legislation and fight for its passage?&nbsp; Why blame
                Trump for enforcing the laws on the books?<br>
                <br>
                The El Paso shooting has been turned not only into an
                attack on President Trump but also into an attack on
                white people.&nbsp; Suddenly the “Muslim terrorist
                threat” has disappeared.&nbsp; Its replacement is the
                domestic terrorist threat of “white supremacy.” The
                attack on whites is indiscriminate. The attack on Trump
                extends to all of the Americans who elected him—“Trump
                deplorables”—in Hillary’s words.&nbsp; All whites become
                “racists” and are covered in guilt. <br>
                <br>
                The anti-white propaganda is effective. Actress Rosanna
                Arquette said that her white skin makes her
                ashamed.&nbsp; The success in teaching emotionally and
                mentally weak white people to feel guilt is to make it
                easier for those who wish to displace them to run over
                them.&nbsp; And most definitely, the core white
                populations of the Western world are being
                overrun.&nbsp; <br>
                <br>
                As white populations have become too brainwashed and
                loaded with guilt to defend themselves, perhaps the
                Social Darwinists were correct after all.&nbsp; The fit
                survive, and white people are no longer among the fit.<br>
                <br>
                CNN former host Reza Aslan, now a professor at the
                University of California, tweeted: “The President is a
                white nationalist terror leader. His supporters—ALL OF
                THEM—are by definition white nationalist terror
                supporters.&nbsp; The MAGA hat is a KKK hood.&nbsp; And
                this evil, racist scourge must be eradicated from
                society.”<br>
                <br>
                How can it be that Trump wanting to enforce US law
                inspires a person to shoot Hispanics, but Aslan’s call
                to eradicate all Trump supporters doesn’t inspire a
                person to attack Trump supporters? Why wasn’t Aslan
                disciplined by the University of California for his hate
                speech?&nbsp; Why wasn’t he blocked by Twitter?&nbsp; <br>
                <br>
                How can NBC Universal’s film, “The Hunt,” produced by
                Jason Blum, a Jew, depict liberal elites hunting and
                killing “Trump deplorables” for sport and escape the
                charge of hate speech and encouraging deadly violence
                against half of the US population?&nbsp;
                http://www.yourdestinationnow.com/2019/08/nbc-universal-were-not-canceling.html&nbsp;













                <br>
                <br>
                NBC Universal refuses to stop release of the hate movie.<br>
                <br>
                If wanting to build a wall to keep out illegal
                immigrants encourages Americans to shoot Hispanics, how
                much violence is encouraged by a movie in which Trump
                supporters are hunted and shot? There is scant complaint
                about Israel’s wall that keeps Palestinians out of their
                own country. Try to imagine someone making a film about
                hunting Jews for sport and calling it a satire.<br>
                <br>
                Clearly in the Western media and US Democratic Party it
                is open season on all white people.&nbsp; The most
                intense hatred is expressed against them—even calls for
                their extermination—and it doesn’t qualify as hate
                speech or encouraging violence.<br>
                <br>
                The hatred and demonization of white people in America
                is no different from the propaganda against Jews in the
                Third Reich.&nbsp; Yet not a single member of the
                Democratic Party or American print, TV, and NPR radio
                protests.<br>
                <br>
                That fact tells us all we need to know.&nbsp; If white
                people don’t get organized and defend themselves there
                is likely to be a white holocaust.<br>

                converted seismic waves,a pervasive seismically
                anomalous layer above the transition zone beneath the
                western US. The layer, characterized by an average shear
                wave speed reduction of1.6%, spans over an area
                of~1.8×106km2with thicknesses varying between 25 to 70
                km. The location of the layer correlates with the
                present location of a segment of the Farallon plate.
                This spatial correlation and the sharp seismic signal
                atop of the layer indicate that the layer is caused by
                compositional heterogeneity. Analysis of the seismic
                signature reveals that the compositional heterogeneity
                can beascribed to a small volume of partial melt

                </font></b><font color="#000000">Dark matter, which
                researchers believe make up about 80% of the universe's
                mass, is one of the most elusive mysteries in modern
                physics. What exactly it is and how it came to be is a
                mystery, but a new Johns Hopkins University study now
                suggests that dark matter may have existed before the
                Big Bang.<br>
                <br>
                The study, published August 7 in Physical Review
                Letters, presents a new idea of how dark matter was born
                and how to identify it with astronomical observations.<br>
                <br>
                "The study revealed a new connection between particle
                physics and astronomy. If dark matter consists of new
                particles that were born before the Big Bang, they
                affect the way galaxies are distributed in the sky in a
                unique way. This connection may be used to reveal their
                identity and make conclusions about the times before the
                Big Bang too," says Tommi Tenkanen, a postdoctoral
                fellow in Physics and Astronomy at the Johns Hopkins
                University and the study's author.<br>
                <br>
                While not much is known about its origins, astronomers
                have shown that dark matter plays a crucial role in the
                formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Though not
                directly observable, scientists know dark matter exists
                by its gravitation effects on how visible matter moves
                and is distributed in space.<br>
                <br>
                For a long time, researchers believed that dark matter
                must be a leftover substance from the Big Bang.
                Researchers have long sought this kind of dark matter,
                but so far all experimental searches have been
                unsuccessful.<br>
                <br>
                "If dark matter were truly a remnant of the Big Bang,
                then in many cases researchers should have seen a direct
                signal of dark matter in different particle physics
                experiments already," says Tenkanen.<br>
                <br>
                Using a new, simple mathematical framework, the study
                shows that dark matter may have been produced before the
                Big Bang during an era known as the cosmic inflation
                when space was expanding very rapidly. The rapid
                expansion is believed to lead to copious production of
                certain types of particles called scalars. So far, only
                one scalar particle has been discovered, the famous
                Higgs boson.<br>
                <br>
                "We do not know what dark matter is, but if it has
                anything to do with any scalar particles, it may be
                older than the Big Bang. With the proposed mathematical
                scenario, we don't have to assume new types of
                interactions between visible and dark matter beyond
                gravity, which we already know is there," explains
                Tenkanen.<br>
                <br>
                While the idea that dark matter existed before the Big
                Bang is not new, other theorists have not been able to
                come up with calculations that support the idea. The new
                study shows that researchers have always overlooked the
                simplest possible mathematical scenario for dark
                matter's origins, he says.<br>
                <br>
                The new study also suggests a way to test the origin of
                dark matter by observing the signatures dark matter
                leaves on the distribution of matter in the universe.<br>
                <br>
                "While this type of dark matter is too elusive to be
                found in particle experiments, it can reveal its
                presence in astronomical observations. We will soon
                learn more about the origin of dark matter when the
                Euclid satellite is launched in 2022. It's going to be
                very exciting to see what it will reveal about dark
                matter and if its findings can be used to peek into the
                times before the Big Bang."<br>

                offer exciting prospects in terms of their properties
                and functions. However, the ambient aqueous synthesis of
                atomically-thin, 2D metallic nanomaterials represents a
                significant challenge. Herein, freestanding and
                atomically-thin gold nanosheets with a thickness of only
                0.47 nm (two atomic layers thick) are synthesized via a
                one-step aqueous approach at 20 °C, using methyl orange
                as a confining agent. Owing to the high
                surface-area-to-volume ratio, abundance of unsaturated
                atoms exposed on the surface and large interfacial areas
                arising from their ultrathin 2D nature, the as-prepared
                Au nanosheets demonstrate excellent catalysis
                performance in the model reaction of 4-nitrophenol
                reduction, and remarkable peroxidase-mimicking activity,
                which enables a highly sensitive colorimetric sensing of
                H2O2 with a detection limit of 0.11 × 10-6 m. This work
                represents the first fabrication of freestanding 2D gold
                with a sub-nanometer thickness, opens up an innovative
                pathway toward atomically-thin metal nanomaterials that
                can serve as model systems for inspiring fundamental
                advances in materials science, and holds potential
                across a wide region of applications...<br>
                <br>
                In this communication, we report a facile synthetic
                strategy based on the use of methyl orange (MO) to
                prepare atomically-thin gold nanosheets (termed gold
                nanoseaweed, because of its morphology, color, and
                aqueous growth). The obtained gold nanoseaweeds (AuNSWs)
                exhibit high efficiency as heterogeneous nanocatalysts
                and peroxidase-mimicking nanoenzymes.<br>
                <br>
                For the synthesis of Au nanoseaweed, aqueous solutions
                of HAuCl4 and Na3C6H5O7 (sodium citrate, SC) were
                sequentially added into an aqueous solution of MO (0.21
                × 10-3 m) at 20 °C. The resultant solution was kept
                undisturbed at this temperature for 12 h (see Figure 1a
                and the Supporting Information). The reaction products
                were collected by centrifugation, and then washed
                several times with Milli-Q water until the supernatant
                was colorless. The centrifuged pellet was readily
                re-dispersed in Milli-Q water for further
                characterization...<br>
                <br>
                Therefore, we propose that the production of AuNSWs
                includes the following steps: 1) The affinity between Au
                (III) and aromatic rings36, 37 leads the gold precursor
                HAuCl4 to be associated with MO molecules, and
                subsequently reduced by SC to generate primary Au
                nucleus; 2) Growth of primary nucleus into Au nanoflakes
                of small lateral size, as confined by MO molecules; 3)
                Selective oriented attachment of small Au nanoflakes
                onto the side facets to minimize their high surface
                energy.38, 39 The resultant larger-sized nanoflakes
                would serve as new nuclei for further 2D attachment of
                freshly-produced Au nanoflakes (or Au atoms), following
                a diffusion-limited aggregation pathway, gradually
                evolving into AuNSWs with the observed fractal
                dimension. An in-depth comprehension of the formation
                mechanism, in particular the role of MO, deserves
                further investigation. Nevertheless, sub-nanometer thick

                &nbsp;UK molecular biologists claim to have pinpointed
                the gene responsible for tooth regeneration in mice,
                paving the way for immense breakthroughs in the field of
                human regenerative medicine.<br>
                <br>
                The team of researchers, led by Dr Bing Hu from the
                University of Plymouth’s Peninsula Dental School,
                studied the genes and signaling molecules responsible
                for the regeneration of teeth in mice and think they may
                have cracked how to regrow teeth entirely in the
                “natural way.” <br>
                <br>
                Teeth are comprised of dead enamel combined with living
                parts like dentin, pulp, and nerve tissue. <br>
                <br>
                Stem cells can be developed into specialized
                regenerative cell types, including teeth cells, and the
                team believe they have pinpointed a specific gene,
                called DLK1, which enhances stem cell activation and
                tissue regeneration. <br>
                <br>
                These particular cells contribute to the formation of
                tooth dentin which makes up the majority of a tooth’s
                body. <br>
                <br>
                Success in animals doesn’t necessarily mean we’ll be
                regrowing damaged teeth any time soon, as the regulatory
                approval process could take years, but it is a
                highly-promising development in the field of
                regenerative medicine, says Dr Hu.<br>
                <br>
                “So far, these are all laboratory experiments, and we
                will have to do a lot of work before we can apply
                similar methods to treat a person. On the other hand, we
                can already say that this is a big breakthrough in
                regenerative medicine, which will radically change the
                life of patients in the near future the future,” Hu
                added.<br>
                <br>
                When fully developed and realized, such stem cell
                treatments could one day provide a novel solution to
                tooth repair, trauma treatment, and tackling tooth
                decay.<br>

                  The science behind the discovery</font></b><font
                color="#000000"><br>
                Dr Hu and his team discovered a new population of
                mesenchymal stem cells (the stem cells that make up
                skeletal tissue such as muscle and bone) in a
                continuously growing mouse incisor model. They showed
                that these cells contribute to the formation of tooth
                dentin, the hard tissue that covers the main body of a
                tooth.<br>
                <br>
                Importantly, the work showed that when these stem cells
                are activated, they then send signals back to the mother
                cells of the tissue to control the number of cells
                produced, through a molecular gene called Dlk1. This
                paper is the first to show that Dlk1 is vital for this
                process to work.<br>
                <br>
                In the same report, the researchers also proved that
                Dlk1 can enhance stem cell activation and tissue
                regeneration in a tooth wound healing model. This
                mechanism could provide a novel solution for tooth
                reparation, dealing with problems such as tooth decay
                and crumbling (known as caries) and trauma treatment.<br>
                <br>
                Further studies need to take place to validate the
                findings for clinical applications, in order to
                ascertain the appropriate treatment duration and dose,
                but these early steps in an animal model are exciting,
                as Dr Hu explains.<br>
              </font><b><font color="#000000"><br>
                  What the authors say<br>
                </font></b><font color="#000000">Dr Hu, who is also part
                of the University's Institute of Translational and
                Stratified Medicine (ITSMed), said: "Stem cells are so
                important, as, in the future, they could be used by
                laboratories to regenerate tissues that have been
                damaged or lost due to disease -- so it's vital to
                understand how they work.<br>
                <br>
                "By uncovering both the new stem cells that make the
                main body of a tooth and establishing their vital use of
                Dlk1 in regenerating the tissue, we have taken major
                steps in understanding stem cell regeneration.<br>
                <br>
                "The work has taken place in lab models at this stage,
                and further work needs to be done before we can bring
                them in to human use. But it's a really big breakthrough
                in regenerative medicine that could have huge
                implications for patients in future."<br>
                <br>
                Professor Christopher Tredwin, Head of Peninsula Dental
                School and co-author of the paper, said: "We are highly
                excited by the recent progresses in Dr Bing Hu's group.
                This new work, together with a recent high-impact paper
                published in The EMBO Journal (doi:
                10.15252/embj.201899845), which is about another type of
                stem cells in the tooth: epithelial stem cells, puts
                Plymouth at the front of the world's dental and
                craniofacial stem cell research and regenerative
                medicine. We expect those researchers will soon provide
                dental patients better time and cost-effective solutions

                receive inductive cues from the surrounding
                microenvironment and cells. Limited molecular evidence
                has connected tissue-specific mesenchymal stem cells
                (MSCs) with mesenchymal transit amplifying cells
                (MTACs). Using mouse incisor as the model, we discover a
                population of MSCs neibouring to the MTACs and
                epithelial SCs. With Notch signaling as the key
                regulator, we disclose molecular proof and lineage
                tracing evidence showing the distinct MSCs contribute to
                incisor MTACs and the other mesenchymal cell lineages.
                MTACs can feedback and regulate the homeostasis and
                activation of CL-MSCs through Delta-like 1 homolog
                (Dlk1), which balances MSCs-MTACs number and the lineage
                differentiation. Dlk1’s function on SCs priming and
                self-renewal depends on its biological forms and its
                gene expression is under dynamic epigenetic control. Our
                findings can be validated in clinical samples and
                applied to accelerate tooth wound healing, providing an
                intriguing insight of how to direct SCs towards tissue
                regeneration.<br>

            Weapon&nbsp; <br>
            The Layered Frequencies of Death&nbsp; and the Final Touch
            of Being 5-G'ed to DEATH<br>
            <br>
            Obviously, we are not told the TRUTH about the real
            intention of the massive increase of deadly military
            frequencies into our environment - an invisible silent
            weapon to KILL. We are sold a LIE that we will get faster
            downloads, better security, enable smart city growth, and
            how this advanced tech is good for us. <br>
            Good for business - yes the controllers business of massive
            population reductions.<br>
            <br>
            The rise in temperature is not at all surprising with the
            massive increase in Densification of frequencies increased
            by 5G mimo and micro sites. Keep in mind the foundation of
            the smart city is built upon the 5G deployment. AI is the
            brains of smart cities.<br>
            <br>
            The Controllers are building smart cities, which are gas
            chambers, with the excitation of the air which will be so
            noxious we can't breath - called air pollution.<br>
            <br>
            The Densification of deadly frequencies will cremate our
            bodies. Disposing of the corpses with the cremation
            frequencies causes dustification = cremation.<br>
            <br>
            No need for cattle trucks, barbed wire fencing, burials or
            guards. The final solution plans that they used once before
            made it difficult to dispose of the bodies on such a scale,
            and that proved problematic. <br>
            <br>
            The Climate Action Plans are the plans of Genocide that have
            "already" been adopted in YOUR communities, everywhere. We
            have been warning of these plans for a very long time. <br>
            <br>
            The Climate Action Plans specify massive reduction of
            resources - including people,<br>
            and all else that is living.<br>
            <br>
            Our survival has been determined by someone else! This is
            certainly NOT what we ever imagined would be the outcome for
            humanity and all living things..<br>
            <br>

            <div align="center"><b>"In the future, this electricity-free
                tech could help cool buildings in metropolitan areas." </b><br>
            </div>
            &nbsp;<br>
            Engineers have designed a new system that can help cool
            buildings in crowded metropolitan areas without consuming
            electricity, an important innovation at a time when cities
            are working to adapt to climate change.<br>
            <br>
            The system consists of a special material -- an inexpensive
            polymer/aluminum film -- that's installed inside a box at
            the bottom of a specially designed solar "shelter." The film
            helps to keep its surroundings cool by absorbing heat from
            the air inside the box and transmitting that energy through
            the Earth's atmosphere into outer space. The shelter serves
            a dual purpose, helping to block incoming sunlight, while
            also beaming thermal radiation emitted from the film into
            the sky.<br>
            <br>
            "The polymer stays cool as it dissipates heat through
            thermal radiation, and can then cool down the environment,"
            says co-first author Lyu Zhou, a PhD candidate in electrical
            engineering in the University at Buffalo School of
            Engineering and Applied Sciences. "This is called radiative
            or passive cooling, and it's very interesting because it
            does not consume electricity -- it won't need a battery or
            other electricity source to realize cooling."<br>
            <br>
            "One of the innovations of our system is the ability to
            purposefully direct thermal emissions toward the sky," says
            lead researcher Qiaoqiang Gan, PhD, UB associate professor
            of electrical engineering. "Normally, thermal emissions
            travel in all directions. We have found a way to beam the
            emissions in a narrow direction. This enables the system to
            be more effective in urban environments, where there are
            tall buildings on all sides. We use low-cost, commercially
            available materials, and find that they perform very well."<br>
            <br>
            Taken together, the shelter-and-box system the engineers
            designed measures about 18 inches tall (45.72 centimeters),
            10 inches wide and 10 inches long (25.4 centimeters). To
            cool a building, numerous units of the system would need to
            be installed to cover a roof.<br>
            <br>
            The research will be published on Aug. 5 in Nature
            Sustainability. The study was an international collaboration
            between Gan's group at UB, Boon Ooi's group at King Abdullah
            University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi
            Arabia, and Zongfu Yu's group at the University of
            Wisconsin-Madison. Along with Zhou, co-first authors are
            Haomin Song, PhD, UB assistant professor of research in
            electrical engineering, and Jianwei Liang at KAUST. The
            study was funded in part by the National Science Foundation.<br>

            <b>A system that works during the day and in crowded
              environments</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            The new passive cooling system addresses an important
            problem in the field: How radiative cooling can work during
            the day and in crowded urban areas.<br>
            <br>
            "During the night, radiative cooling is easy because we
            don't have solar input, so thermal emissions just go out and
            we realize radiative cooling easily," Song says. "But
            daytime cooling is a challenge because the sun is shining.
            In this situation, you need to find strategies to prevent
            rooftops from heating up. You also need to find emissive
            materials that don't absorb solar energy. Our system address
            these challenges."<br>
            <br>
            When placed outside during the day, the heat-emanating film
            and solar shelter helped reduce the temperature of a small,
            enclosed space by a maximum of about 6 degrees Celsius (11
            degrees Fahrenheit). At night, that figure rose to about 11
            degrees Celsius (about 20 degrees Fahrenheit).<br>
            <br>
            <b>How innovative architecture can drive radiative cooling</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            The new radiative cooling system incorporates a number of
            optically interesting design features.<br>
            <br>
            One of the central components is the polymer/metal film,
            which is made from a sheet of aluminum coated with a clear
            polymer called polydimethylsiloxane. The aluminum reflects
            sunlight, while the polymer absorbs and dissipates heat from
            the surrounding air. Engineers placed the material at the
            bottom of a foam box and erected a solar "shelter" atop the
            box, using a solar energy-absorbing material to construct
            four outward-slanting walls, along with an inverted square
            cone within those walls.<br>
            <br>
            This architecture serves a dual purpose: First, it helps to
            sponge up sunlight. Second, the shape of the walls and cone
            direct heat emitted by the film toward the sky.<br>
            <br>
            "If you look at the headlight of your car, it has a certain
            structure that allows it to direct the light in a certain
            direction," Gan says. "We follow this kind of a design. The
            structure of our beam-shaping system increases our access to
            the sky. The ability to direct the emissions improves the
            performance of the system in crowded areas."<br>

            If you love drinking sugary drinks, you should definitely
            read this. The artificial sweetener that's used to add
            flavour to the diet drinks and sugar-free products isn't
            safe for consumption.<br>
            <br>
            According to a study in Archives of Public Health by the
            University of Sussex, the reassurance that was given in 2013
            stating that aspartame is safe for consumption by the
            European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) consists of
            considerable flaws. <br>
            <br>
            The new study has revealed that EFSA completely disregarded
            the results of every single one of the 73 studies (out of
            154)&nbsp; that said aspartame consumption is harmful,
            stating it was unreliable. <br>
            <br>
            Since 1974, aspartame (or Nutrasweet as it is commonly
            known) which is seen in sugar-free products like sodas, gums
            etc,&nbsp; is known to cause damage to brain, lung and liver
            cancer, brain lesions and neuroendocrine disorders...<br>

            turbulent heat exchange, a method of heat transport widely
            used in heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)
            systems...<br>
            <br>
            In 2015, Sun had the idea to use an organic component known
            as hydrofluoroether or HFE to speed the cycling of heat
            inside this kind of exchanger. HFE is sometimes used as the
            sole fluid in heat exchangers, but Sun suspected that it
            might have more interesting properties as an additive in
            water-based systems. Working with the study’s co-first
            author Ziqi Wang, Mathai and Sun experimented with adding
            small amounts of HFE and, after three years of work, were
            able to maximize its effectiveness in speeding heat
            exchange. The team showed that concentrations of around 1%
            HFE created dramatic heat flux enhancements up to 500%...<br>

            Turbulence is known for its ability to vigorously mix fluid
            and transport heat. Despite over a century of research for
            enhancing heat transport, few have exceeded the inherent
            limits posed by turbulent-mixing. Here we have
            conceptualized a kind of “active particle” turbulence, which
            far exceeds the limits of classical thermal turbulence. By
            adding a minute concentration (?v?~?1%) of a heavy liquid
            (hydrofluoroether) to a water-based turbulent convection
            system, a remarkably efficient biphasic dynamics is born,
            which supersedes turbulent heat transport by up to 500%. The
            system operates on a self-sustained dynamically equilibrated
            cycle of a “catalyst-like” species, and exploits several
            heat-carrier agents including pseudo-turbulence, latent heat
            and bidirectional wake capture. We find that the heat
            transfer enhancement is dominated by the kinematics of the
            active elements and their induced-agitation. The present
            finding opens the door towards the establishment of tunable,
            ultra-high efficiency heat transfer/mixing systems.<br>

            A Magnitude 6.3 earthquake has struck in the Pacific Ocean
            just off the coast of Fukushima, Japan.&nbsp; The strong
            quake shook the already damaged Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear
            Disaster Site, where three reactors melted-down and exploded
            in March 2011.<br>
            <br>
            Significant additional damage has reportedly taken place at
            Reactor building #2 which remains off-limits to humans
            because radiation levels inside that building as so high,
            they would kill a human after only a few minutes exposure.<br>

            ...Darwin’s bark spider, however, takes tensile strength an
            entirely new level. Its dragline silk – the type that forms
            the energy-absorbing primary spokes of the orb-web – is
            twice as strong as that of any other silk thus far tested,
            and an astonishing 10 times stronger than Kevlar.<br>
            <br>
            This property was long ago noticed by researchers in the
            field of biomechanical design, but the exact biological
            processes that result in the super-strong fibre remained a
            mystery.<br>
            <br>
            Now, however, scientists led by Jessica Garb from the
            University of Massachusetts Lowell in the US might have
            found the answer. In a paper published in the journal
            Communications Biology, they report that the silk is the
            result of “a suite of novel traits from the level of genes
            to spinning physiology to silk biomechanics”.<br>
            <br>
            When Garb and colleagues analysed the structure of bark
            spider dragline silk they made an unexpected discovery. All
            orb spiders produce silk containing two distinct sets of
            repetitive proteins, called spindroins, known as MaSp1 and
            MaSp2. The number of repeats, and the ratio between the two
            types, govern the properties of the various types of silk
            each spider produces.<br>
            <br>
            The dragline silk of Darwin’s bark spider, however, contains
            a third spindroin, which the researchers dubbed MaSp4a. This
            protein set lacks some of the components of the other two,
            but is unusually rich in a type of amino acid called
            proline, which is associated with elasticity.<br>
            <br>
            This, the researchers suggest, “may in part explain the
            greater extensibility and toughness” of the fibre...<br>

            <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
            </b>Darwin’s bark spider (Caerostris darwini) produces giant
            orb webs from dragline silk that can be twice as tough as
            other silks, making it the toughest biological material.
            This extreme toughness comes from increased extensibility
            relative to other draglines. We show C. darwini
            dragline-producing major ampullate (MA) glands highly
            express a novel silk gene transcript (MaSp4) encoding a
            protein that diverges markedly from closely related proteins
            and contains abundant proline, known to confer silk
            extensibility, in a unique GPGPQ amino acid motif. This
            suggests C. darwini evolved distinct proteins that may have
            increased its dragline’s toughness, enabling giant webs.
            Caerostris darwini’s MA spinning ducts also appear unusually
            long, potentially facilitating alignment of silk proteins
            into extremely tough fibers. Thus, a suite of novel traits
            from the level of genes to spinning physiology to silk
            biomechanics are associated with the unique ecology of
            Darwin’s bark spider, presenting innovative designs for
            engineering biomaterials.<br>

            </div>
            <br>
            Findings have huge implications for cancer and age-related
            health conditions<br>
            <br>
            New research from the USC Viterbi School of Engineering
            could be key to our understanding of how the aging process
            works. The findings potentially pave the way for better
            cancer treatments and revolutionary new drugs that could
            vastly improve human health in the twilight years.<br>
            <br>
            The work, from Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering
            and Materials Science Nick Graham and his team in
            collaboration with Scott Fraser, Provost Professor of
            Biological Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, and Pin
            Wang, Zohrab A. Kaprielian Fellow in Engineering, was
            recently published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry.<br>
            <br>
            "To drink from the fountain of youth, you have to figure out
            where the fountain of youth is, and understand what the
            fountain of youth is doing," Graham said. "We're doing the
            opposite; we're trying to study the reasons cells age, so
            that we might be able to design treatments for better
            aging."<br>
            <br>
            <b>What causes cells to age?</b><br>
            To achieve this, lead author Alireza Delfarah, a graduate
            student in the Graham lab, focused on senescence, a natural
            process in which cells permanently stop creating new cells.
            This process is one of the key causes of age-related
            decline, manifesting in diseases such as arthritis,
            osteoporosis and heart disease.<br>
            <br>
            "Senescent cells are effectively the opposite of stem cells,
            which have an unlimited potential for self-renewal or
            division," Delfarah said. "Senescent cells can never divide
            again. It's an irreversible state of cell cycle arrest."<br>
            <br>
            The research team discovered that the aging, senescent cells
            stopped producing a class of chemicals called nucleotides,
            which are the building blocks of DNA. When they took young
            cells and forced them to stop producing nucleotides, they
            became senescent, or aged.<br>
            <br>
            "This means that the production of nucleotides is essential
            to keep cells young," Delfarah said. "It also means that if
            we could prevent cells from losing nucleotide synthesis, the
            cells might age more slowly."<br>
            <br>
            Graham's team examined young cells that were proliferating
            robustly and fed them molecules labeled with stable isotopes
            of carbon, in order to trace how the nutrients consumed by a
            cell were processed into different biochemical pathways.<br>
            <br>
            Scott Fraser and his lab worked with the research team to
            develop 3D imagery of the results. The images unexpectedly
            revealed that senescent cells often have two nuclei, and
            that they do not synthesize DNA.<br>
            <br>
            Before now, senescence has primarily been studied in cells
            known as fibroblasts, the most common cells that comprised
            the connective tissue in animals. Graham's team is instead
            focusing on how senescence occurs in epithelial cells, the
            cells that line the surfaces of the organs and structures in
            the body and the type of cells in which most cancers arise.<br>
            <br>
            Graham said that senescence is most widely known as the
            body's protective barrier against cancer: When cells sustain
            damage that could be at risk of developing into cancer, they
            enter into senescence and stop proliferating so that the
            cancer does not develop and spread.<br>
            <br>
            "Sometimes people talk about senescence as a double-edged
            sword, that it protects against cancer, and that's a good
            thing," Graham said. "But then it also promotes aging and
            diseases like diabetes, cardiac dysfunction or
            atherosclerosis and general tissue dysfunction," he said.<br>
            <br>
            Graham said the goal was not to completely prevent
            senescence, because that might unleash cancer cells.<br>
            <br>
            "But then on the other hand, we would like to find a way to
            remove senescent cells to promote healthy aging and better
            function," he said.<br>
            <br>
            Graham said that the team's research has applications in the
            emerging field of senolytics, the development of drugs that
            may be able to eliminate aging cells. He said that human
            clinical trials are still in early stages, but studies with
            mice have shown that by eliminating senescent cells, mice
            age better, with a more productive life span.<br>
            <br>
            "They can take a mouse that's aging and diminishing in
            function, treat it with senolytic drugs to eliminate the
            senescent cells, and the mouse is rejuvenated. If anything,
            it's these senolytic drugs that are the fountain of youth,"
            Graham said.<br>
            <br>
            He added that in order for successful senolytic drugs to be
            designed, it was important to identify what is unique about
            senescent cells, so that drugs won't affect the normal,
            non-senescent cells.<br>
            <br>
            "That's where we're coming in -- studying senescent cell
            metabolism and trying to figure out how the senescent cells
            are unique, so that you could design targeted therapeutics
            around these metabolic pathways," Graham said.<br>

            <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
            </b>There is substantial interest in growing crops in closed
            controlled environments, yet the energy requirements are
            high. Energy is required to produce light, but also to
            remove the heat generated when producing light. The goal of
            the current work examines a possible approach to decrease
            the energy requirement. The effect of pulsed light
            treatments was examined by monitoring seedling traits during
            early photomorphogenic development. Daily light integral
            remained unchanged between treatments, but the frequency of
            the pulses was varied. Developmental traits (such as
            inhibition of hypocotyl elongation rate) were most
            conspicuous during a normal photoperiod, as in twelve hours
            light, twelve hours darkness. Consistent with historical
            reports, when treatments were delivered in shorter durations
            (e.g. 1?h on/off) photomorphogenic development was hindered
            with the same daily light integral. However, at even shorter
            light intervals (e.g. seconds) seedlings developed as if
            they were provided full 12?h treatments. Extension of the
            dark period following a 5?s pulse was tested to determine
            the effect on seedling traits. The results showed that the
            dark period could be extended to at least 10?s without
            affecting seedling development, and extension to 20?s only
            had slight effects on seedling traits. The mechanism of the
            phenomenon was examined in Arabidopsisthaliana photosensory
            mutants, and showed substantial contributions from the phyA
            and cry1 pathways. The results suggest that pulsed light
            with extended dark periods can decrease energy input by at
            least 30% to &gt;50% without affecting visible seedling
            traits. These pilot experiments in seedlings demonstrate
            that implementation of short-interval, pulsed-light
            strategies may lower energy requirements for growing crops
            in artificially illuminated environments.<br>

            conditions in the tantalum disulfide crystal, they generated
            an unusually dense amorphous electronic substance with short
            laser beams, in which, due to interaction, electrons become
            jammed. The discovery is fundamentally important as it opens
            up a new field, and its understanding is a new major
            challenge for today's quantum physics. The research was
            carried out entirely on a special low-temperature microscope
            with four peaks at the Jožef Stefan Institute, which is
            unique in the world. On July 15, 2019, the prestigious
            science magazine Nature Materials reported the discovery.<br>

            <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
            </b>Distinct many-body states may be created under
            non-equilibrium conditions through different ordering paths,
            even when their constituents are subjected to the same
            fundamental interactions. The phase-transition mechanism to
            such states remains poorly understood. Here, we show that
            controlled optical or electromagnetic perturbations can lead
            to an amorphous metastable state of strongly correlated
            electrons in a quasi-two-dimensional dichalcogenide.
            Scanning tunnelling microscopy reveals a hyperuniform
            pattern of localized charges, whereas multitip surface
            nanoscale conductivity measurements and tunnelling
            spectroscopy show an electronically gapless conducting state
            that is different from conventional Coulomb glasses and
            many-body localized systems. The state is stable up to room
            temperature and shows no signs of either local charge order
            or phase separation. The mechanism for its formation is
            attributed to a dynamical localization of electrons through
            mutual interactions. Theoretical calculations confirm the
            correlations between localized charges to be crucial for the
            state’s unusual stability.<br>

                separate salt from water</b><br>
              <b>by Nick Lavars</b><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            Current approaches to water desalination are tremendously
            expensive and energy-intensive, so the search is very much
            on for new technologies that can get the job done more
            efficiently. Scientists in Melbourne have put forward one
            rather promising solution, developing a new kind of system
            that heats up and purifies water using only the power of the
            Sun.<br>
            <br>
            The device was developed by scientists at Australia's Monash
            University, who say that water treatment accounts for around
            three percent of the world's energy supply. Like other
            researchers around the globe, they have turned to sunlight
            to try and lighten the load, this time directing it toward
            what is known as a solar steam generator.<br>
            <br>
            In simple terms, these devices concentrate sunlight onto a
            body of water, heating it up and causing it to evaporate.
            The resulting steam can then be used to drive turbines that
            produce electricity in concentrated solar power plants,
            perhaps sterilize medical equipment cheaply for the
            developing world, or simply to separate salt from water.<br>
            <br>
            But one problem with the lattermost application is that the
            salt tends to gather on the surface of the material, which
            makes it difficult to produce pure water. The Monash
            University researchers worked around this problem with an
            intricately designed solar steam generator that prevents the
            salt from spoiling the broth.<br>
            <br>
            It consists of a disc crafted from super-hydrophilic filter
            paper, a material that attracts water, which is coated with
            a layer of carbon nanotubes that convert sunlight into heat.
            Water is fed into the center of the disc via a simple cotton
            thread, where the heat turns it into steam that builds up on
            the disc while pushing the salt to the edge.<br>
            <br>
            In this way, the device removes almost 100 percent of salt
            from the water, a level that leader of the team Professor
            Xiwang Zhang assures us is "high enough for practical
            applications." The salts that accumulate at the edges,
            meanwhile, can also be harvested for use.<br>
            <br>
            Zhang and his team tested out the device using salty water
            from a bay in South Australia, and found that it absorbed 94
            percent of the light across the solar spectrum. It worked
            whether wet or dry, with light exposure heating up the
            device from 25 to 50° C (77 to 122° F) when dry and from
            17.5 to 30° C (63.5 to 86° F) when wet, within just one
            minute.<br>
            <br>
            "This device can produce six to eight liters (1.6 to 2.1
            gal) of clean water per square meter (of surface area) per
            day," Zhang tells New Atlas. "We are working to further
            improve the water production rate."<br>
            <br>
            Zhang and his colleagues hope that with further work, the
            device could be put to use providing clean water to remote
            communities that are currently without access. But its value
            mightn't end there. The technology could be used in other
            areas where more efficient water purification methods might
            come in handy, such as mining and wastewater treatment.<br>
            <br>
            We hope this research can be the starting point for further
            research in energy-passive ways of providing clean and safe
            water to millions of people, illuminating environmental
            impact of waste and recovering resource from waste," says
            Zhang.<br>
            <br>
            The research was published in the journal Energy &amp;
            Environmental Science, while the video below shows the
            device in use.<br>

                crystallisation from water evaporation for continuous

            <b>Abstract</b><br>
            As a low-cost green technology, solar steam generation using
            nanostructured photothermal materials has been drawing
            increasing attention in various applications, e.g. seawater
            desalination, and zero liquid discharge of industrial
            wastewater. However, the crystallisation of salts on the
            surface of photothermal materials during steam generation
            leads to a gradual decline in the water evaporation rate.
            Herein, this challenge was overcome by a novel design
            involving controlled water transport, edge-preferential
            crystallisation and gravity-assisted salt harvesting. The
            crystallisation sites of the salt were spatially isolated
            from the water evaporation surface, achieving continuous
            steam generation and salt harvesting in over 600 hours of
            non-stop operation. The study provides new insights into the
            design of solar steam generators and advances their
            applications in sustainable seawater desalination and
            wastewater management.<br>

            Del Bigtree, producer of the film VAXXED, and host of the
            weekly show HighWire, interviewed Jorge Araujo, a scientist
            who worked for the pharmaceutical company Merck as a lead
            supervisor on vaccine sterile quality.<br>
            <br>
            Araujo’s wife is a nurse, and they didn’t even question the
            science behind vaccines until they were expecting their
            first child, when Araujo’s wife began asking him questions
            about vaccines.<br>
            <br>
            Araujo relates that as he began to ask questions about
            vaccine efficacy and safety, the answers were not there. His
            research showed him that the robust science and quality
            controls present in regular drug manufacturing did not seem
            to be present with vaccine manufacturing.<br>
            <br>
            So he and his wife decided not to vaccinate their children,
            and today they are all “super healthy.”...<br>

                the First-Ever Permanently Magnetic Liquid</b><br>
              <b>By Yasemin Saplakoglu</b><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            or the first time, scientists have created a permanently
            magnetic liquid. These liquid droplets can morph into
            various shapes and be externally manipulated to move around,
            according to a new study.<br>
            <br>
            We typically imagine magnets as being solid, said senior
            author Thomas Russell, a distinguished professor of polymer
            science and engineering at the University of Massachusetts
            Amherst. But now we know that "we can make magnets that are
            liquid and they could conform to different shapes — and the
            shapes are really up to you."<br>
            <br>
            The liquid droplets can change shape from a sphere to a
            cylinder to a pancake, he told Live Science. "We can [even]
            make it look like a sea urchin if we wanted." [<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;Russell and his team created these liquid magnets by
            accident while experimenting with 3D printing liquids at the
            Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (where Russell is also
            a visiting faculty scientist). The goal was to create
            materials that are solid but have characteristics of liquids
            for various energy applications.<br>
            <br>
            One day, postdoctoral student and lead author Xubo Liu
            noticed 3D-printed material, made from magnetized particles
            called iron-oxides, spinning around in unison on a magnetic
            stir plate. So when the team realized the entire construct,
            not just the particles, had become magnetic, they decided to
            investigate further.<br>
            <br>
            Using a technique to 3D-print liquids, the scientists
            created millimeter-size droplets from water, oil and
            iron-oxides. The liquid droplets keep their shape because
            some of the iron-oxide particles bind with surfactants —
            substances that reduce the surface tension of a liquid. The
            surfactants create a film around the liquid water, with some
            iron-oxide particles creating part of the filmy barrier, and
            the rest of the particles enclosed inside, Russell said.<br>
            <br>
            The team then placed the millimeter-size droplets near a
            magnetic coil to magnetize them. But when they took the
            magnetic coil away, the droplets demonstrated an unseen
            behavior in liquids — they remained magnetized. (Magnetic
            liquids called ferrofluids do exist, but these liquids are
            only magnetized when in the presence of a magnetic field.)<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;When those droplets approached a magnetic field, the
            tiny iron-oxide particles all aligned in the same direction.
            And once they removed the magnetic field, the iron-oxide
            particles bound to the surfactant in the film were so
            jam-packed that they couldn't move and so remained aligned.
            But those free-floating inside the droplet also remained
            aligned.<br>
            <br>
            The scientists don't fully understand how these particles
            hold onto the field, Russell said. Once they figure that
            out, there are many potential applications. For example,
            Russell imagines printing a cylinder with a non-magnetic
            middle and two magnetic caps. "The two ends would come
            together like a horseshoe magnet," and be used as a mini
            "grabber," he said.<br>
            <br>
            In an even more bizarre application, imagine a mini liquid
            person — a smaller-scale version of the liquid T-1000 from
            the second "Terminator" movie — Russell said. Now imagine
            that parts of this mini liquid man are magnetized and parts
            aren't. An external magnetic field could then force the
            little person to move its limbs like a marionette.<br>
            <br>
            For me, it sort of represents a sort of new state of
            magnetic materials," Russell said. The findings were
            published on July 19 in the journal Science.<br>

            Ferromagnetic materials show a permanent magnetic dipole,
            whereas superparamagnetic ones only show magnetic properties
            under an applied field. Some materials, like ferrofluids,
            show liquid-like behavior but do not retain their
            magnetization in the absence of an applied field. Liu et al.
            show remnant magnetization of otherwise superparamagnetic
            magnetite nanoparticles at an oil-water interface of
            emulsion droplets (see the Perspective by Dreyfus). The
            permanent magnetization could be controlled by coupling and
            uncoupling the magnetization of individual nanoparticles,
            making it possible to “write and erase” shapes of the
            droplets or to elongate them into cylinders.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Abstract</b><br>
            Solid ferromagnetic materials are rigid in shape and cannot
            be reconfigured. Ferrofluids, although reconfigurable, are
            paramagnetic at room temperature and lose their
            magnetization when the applied magnetic field is removed.
            Here, we show a reversible paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic
            transformation of ferrofluid droplets by the jamming of a
            monolayer of magnetic nanoparticles assembled at the
            water-oil interface. These ferromagnetic liquid droplets
            exhibit a finite coercivity and remanent magnetization. They
            can be easily reconfigured into different shapes while
            preserving the magnetic properties of solid ferromagnets
            with classic north-south dipole interactions. Their
            translational and rotational motions can be actuated
            remotely and precisely by an external magnetic field,
            inspiring studies on active matter, energy-dissipative
            assemblies, and programmable liquid constructs.<br>

            This special Independent Institute event was held on May 2,
            2019, in San Francisco. Why has the idea of individual
            sovereignty been granted such primacy of place in free
            Western societies? Why were the men who formulated the
            Declaration of Independence willing to declare:&nbsp; “We
            hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are
            created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with
            certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life,
            Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness," and, further, to
            insist "That to secure these rights, Governments are
            instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the
            consent of the governed."<br>
            <br>
            Why, as well, are ideas of individual sovereignty, which
            have proved so successful in guaranteeing freedom and
            prosperity in the West and, increasingly, around the world,
            under attack, by those on the left and the right who offer
            collective identity as an alternative?<br>

            ...Prior to the March 2011 Fukushima disaster, ozone
            depletion was negligible over the northern hemisphere. Then
            within a month of the TEPCO meltdowns, the Arctic Ozone Hole
            rapidily expanded between April and June to swell larger
            than the existing one over the Antarctic. This sudden
            widening of the northern ozone hole shocked the 60
            meteorologists then measuring ozone over the Arctic region,
            but their scientific findings were censored by a NASA
            official, under the influence of Energy Secretary Stephen
            Chu, a pro-nuclear zealot in the Obama administration. His
            henchwoman at NASA blamed "unusual cold weather" in a
            ridiculous stretch of logic, whereas my early-on examination
            of the Japanese meteorologists' findings showed otherwise,
            of radioactivity in heat columns out of the destroyed

                company that's being sued over dumping 'forever
                chemicals' warns the toxins 'stay in your blood and
                don't leave'</b><br>

            &nbsp;The chemical class known as PFAS became popular in the
            US around the 1940s when manufacturing companies realized
            they resist heat, grease, stains, and water.<br>
            Today, PFAS are considered toxic and have been linked to
            cancer, liver damage, thyroid disease, and developmental
            issues.<br>
            At a congressional hearing on July 24, a former scientist at
            DuPont Industries — a manufacturing company that dumped PFAS
            into the environment for decades, starting in the 1950s —
            said the chemicals can be found in almost every American's
            blood.<br>
            In his written statement, he also called for PFAS to be
            banned. <br>
