              That Works at Night</b><br>
            <b>By Andy Fell</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          What if solar cells worked at night? That’s no joke, according
          to Jeremy Munday, professor in the Department of Electrical
          and Computer Engineering at UC Davis. In fact, a specially
          designed photovoltaic cell could generate up to 50 watts of
          power per square meter under ideal conditions at night, about
          a quarter of what a conventional solar panel can generate in
          daytime, according to a concept paper by Munday and graduate
          student Tristan Deppe. The article was published in, and
          featured on the cover of, the January 2020 issue of ACS
          Photonics. <br>
          <br>
          Munday, who recently joined UC Davis from the University of
          Maryland, is developing prototypes of these nighttime solar
          cells that can generate small amounts of power. The
          researchers hope to improve the power output and efficiency of
          the devices. <br>
          <br>
          Munday said that the process is similar to the way a normal
          solar cell works, but in reverse. An object that is hot
          compared to its surroundings will radiate heat as infrared
          light. A conventional solar cell is cool compared to the sun,
          so it absorbs light. <br>
          <br>
          Space is really, really cold, so if you have a warm object and
          point it at the sky, it will radiate heat toward it. People
          have been using this phenomenon for nighttime cooling for
          hundreds of years. In the last five years, Munday said, there
          has been a lot of interest in devices that can do this during
          the daytime (by filtering out sunlight or pointing away from
          the sun). <br>
          Generating power by radiating heat<br>
          <br>
          There’s another kind of device called a thermoradiative cell
          that generates power by radiating heat to its surroundings.
          Researchers have explored using them to capture waste heat
          from engines. <br>
          <br>
          “We were thinking, what if we took one of these devices and
          put it in a warm area and pointed it at the sky,” Munday said.
          <br>
          <br>
          This thermoradiative cell pointed at the night sky would emit
          infrared light because it is warmer than outer space. <br>
          <br>
          “A regular solar cell generates power by absorbing sunlight,
          which causes a voltage to appear across the device and for
          current to flow. In these new devices, light is instead
          emitted and the current and voltage go in the opposite
          direction, but you still generate power,” Munday said. “You
          have to use different materials, but the physics is the same.”
          <br>
          <br>
          The device would work during the day as well, if you took
          steps to either block direct sunlight or pointed it away from
          the sun. Because this new type of solar cell could potentially
          operate around the clock, it is an intriguing option to
          balance the power grid over the day-night cycle.<br>

            Abstract<br>
          </b>Photovoltaics possess significant potential due to the
          abundance of solar power incident on earth; however, they can
          only generate electricity during daylight hours. In order to
          produce electrical power after the sun has set, we consider an
          alternative photovoltaic concept that uses the earth as a heat
          source and the night sky as a heat sink, resulting in a
          “nighttime photovoltaic cell” that employs thermoradiative
          photovoltaics and concepts from the advancing field of
          radiative cooling. In this Perspective, we discuss the
          principles of thermoradiative photovoltaics, the theoretical
          limits of applying this concept to coupling with deep space,
          the potential of advanced radiative cooling techniques to
          enhance their performance, and a discussion of the practical
          limits, scalability, and integrability of this nighttime
          photovoltaic concept.<br>

              is the Treatment of Choice for 2019-nCov Pneumonia</b><br>

          <b><br>
          </b>The 2019-nCov (coronavirus) epidemic originated in Wuhan,
          China and is now spreading to many other continents and
          countries, causing a public fear. Worst of all, there is no
          vaccine or specific antiviral drugs for 2019-nCov available.
          This adds to the public fear and gloomy outlook. A quick,
          rapidly deployable and accessible, effective and also safe
          treatment is urgently needed to not only save those patients,
          to curtail the spread of the epidemic, but also very important
          in the psychological assurance to people worldwide, and to the
          Chinese in particular. Acute organ failure, especially
          pulmonary failure (acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS)
          is the key mechanism for 2019-nCov's fatality. Significantly
          increased oxidative stress due to the rapid release of free
          radicals and cytokines etc. is the hallmark of ARDS which
          leads to cellular injury, organ failure and death. Early use
          of large dose antioxidants, especially vitamin C (VC),
          therefore, plays a key role in the management of these
          patients. We call upon all those in the leadership, and those
          providing direct assistance patients, to bravely and rapidly
          apply large dose intravenous vitamin C (IVC) to help those
          patients and to stop this epidemic. ...<br>

          </b>In 2019, a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infecting Humans
          has emerged in Wuhan, China. Its genome has been sequenced and
          the genomic information promptly released. Despite a high
          similarity with the genome sequence of SARS-CoV and SARS-like
          CoVs, we identified a peculiar furin-like cleavage site in the
          Spike protein of the 2019-nCoV, lacking in the other SARS-like
          CoVs. In this article, we discuss the possible functional
          consequences of this cleavage site in the viral cycle,
          pathogenicity and its potential implication in the development
          of antivirals...<br>

          </b>Researchers at BRI have noticed a number of problems
          related to the current theory of precession. While VLBI, laser
          ranging and other related technologies do a good job at
          determining the earth’s orientation, the sun’s movement
          through space has not been coordinated with these findings
          resulting in unintentional bias of precession inputs. In
          examining the phenomenon of the precession of the equinox
          (which was the original impetus for the development of
          lunisolar precession theory) we have found that a moving solar
          system model is a simpler way to reproduce the same observable
          without any of the problems associated with current precession
          theory. Indeed, elliptical orbit equations have been found to
          be a better predictor of precession rates than Newcomb’s
          formula, showing far greater accuracy over the last hundred
          years. Moreover, a moving solar system model appears to solve
          a number of solar system formation theory problems including
          the sun’s lack of angular momentum. For these reasons, BRI has
          concluded our sun is most likely part of a long cycle binary
          system.<br>
          <br>
          A binary system is two stars gravitationally bound orbiting a
          common center of mass. The stars can be of the same or
          differing sizes and orbits can be as short as a few days or as
          long as thousands of years. The short ones are easy to detect,
          the long ones difficult, some probably impossible to detect
          because of the very long observation period required.<br>
          <br>
          While there is no obvious visible companion star to our Sun,
          there could be a dark binary, such as a brown dwarf or
          possibly a relatively small black hole, either of which might
          be very difficult to detect, without accurate and lengthy
          analysis.<br>
          <br>
          There is also the possibility that our sun might be in a
          binary or complex gravitational relationship with one of
          several nearby “visible” stars. This scenario may require
          thinking beyond standard Newtonian dynamics to embrace MOND or
          MOG or some similar theory (that suggests that the constant of
          G might be stronger between stellar objects than between
          planetary objects within the solar system). There could be
          many types of unknown and unidentified masses that might cause
          our solar system to curve through space, including the local
          stellar cluster and even the galactic center to some small
          degree, each producing some small effect within the total
          precession observable. Consequently, at this point our work is
          primarily focused on understanding the precession observable
          and its nuances as the likely signature of our solar system’s
          angular velocity around some common center of mass. We believe
          that this approach of analyzing the precession observable (the
          sun’s motion relative to the fixed stars as seen from earth)
          will provide valuable and helpful data regarding the sun’s
          most likely stellar companion (if one exists).<br>
          <br>
          In summary, beyond direct detection – one way to determine if
          we are in a binary or multiple star system is to see if the
          Sun is curving through space. To us on Earth that means we
          should experience a gradual “changing orientation to inertial
          space.” Such a phenomenon is observed as the precession of the
          equinox...<br>

              treating coronavirus patient with natural oxygen therapy</b><br>
            <b>By Ethan Huff</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          In a breakthrough for eradicating the Wuhan coronavirus
          (CoVid-19), South Korean officials have successfully treated a
          patient using all-natural oxygen therapy.<br>
          <br>
          Unlike our own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
          (CDC), which only advocates for pharmaceuticals and vaccines,
          Korea’s CDC effectively cured, dare we use that word, a
          patient by delivering oxygen through a face mask, according to
          the local news service Newsis.<br>
          <br>
          Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of Korea’s CDC, announced that only
          one of South Korea’s 21 remaining Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19)
          patients is still in critical condition, while the rest have
          been released.<br>
          <br>
          As for the oxygen therapy, Jeong explained that it effectively
          saturates a patient’s body with oxygen by delivering high
          doses of it. And as we’ve reported in the past, diseases of
          all kinds hate oxygen and simply can’t survive in its
          presence.<br>
          <br>
          With this successful treatment, South Korea is confident that
          there are no additional “critically ill” patients within its
          border, despite earlier concerns that the virus might ravage
          high-risk patients...<br>

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>Animals fed a Western-style diet (WS-diet) demonstrate
          rapid impairments in hippocampal function and poorer
          appetitive control. We examined if this also occurs in humans.
          One-hundred and ten healthy lean adults were randomized to
          either a one-week WS-diet intervention or a habitual-diet
          control group. Measures of hippocampal-dependent learning and
          memory (HDLM) and of appetitive control were obtained pre- and
          post-intervention. HDLM was retested at three-week follow-up.
          Relative to controls, HDLM performance declined in the WS-diet
          group (d = 0.43), but was not different at follow-up.
          Appetitive control also declined in the WS-diet group (d =
          0.47) and this was strongly correlated with HDLM decline (d =
          1.01). These findings demonstrate that a WS-diet can rapidly
          impair appetitive control in humans—an effect that could
          promote overeating in consumers of a WS-diet. The study also
          suggests a functional role for the hippocampus in appetitive
          control and provides new evidence for the adverse
          neurocognitive effects of a WS-diet.<br>

            &nbsp;Introduction<br>
          </b>In animals, an extensive literature suggests that even
          brief exposure to a Western-style diet (WS-diet), rich in
          saturated fat and added sugar, results in selective impairment
          on tests of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory (HDLM,
          e.g. [1–6]). Emerging evidence in humans suggests a similar

          <b><br>
          </b>Scientists in the US have developed a device they say uses
          a natural protein to create electricity from moisture in the
          air.<br>
          <br>
          Writing in the journal Nature, electrical engineer Jun Yao and
          microbiologist Derek Lovley, from the University of
          Massachusetts Amherst, introduce the Air-gen (or air-powered
          generator), which Lovley describes as “the most amazing and
          exciting application of protein nanowires yet”.<br>
          <br>
          Air-Gen has electrically conductive protein nanowires produced
          by the microbe Geobacter, which Lovley discovered in the
          Potomac River three decades ago and has been working with ever
          since, in particular investigating its potential for “green
          electronics”.<br>
          <br>
          The Air-gen connects electrodes to the protein nanowires in
          such a way that electrical current is generated from the water
          vapour naturally present in the atmosphere.<br>
          <br>
          It requires only a thin film of protein nanowires less than 10
          microns thick. The bottom of the film rests on an electrode,
          while a smaller electrode that covers only part of the
          nanowire film sits on top...<br>

          </b>...Recently, two new exciting molecules have been
          discovered in a marijuana plant. They are variations on the
          familiar CBD and THC molecules; they have been named
          cannabidiphorol (CBDP) and &#916;9-tetrahydrocannabiphorol
          (THCP).&nbsp; THCP appears to be thirty times more effective
          than THC at stimulating the brain’s type one cannabinoid
          receptor, CB1. This receptor is responsible for producing the
          euphoria, or the high, associated with marijuana. This means
          that THCP is thirty times more potent than THC. Therefore,
          although the level of THCP in the marijuana is quite low, its
          ability to stimulate CB1 receptors and produce euphoria is
          quite powerful.<br>
          <br>
          THCP was discovered in one particular variety of marijuana,
          the Italian FM2 variety. The authors of the study suggested
          that it is reasonable to predict that other cannabis varieties
          may contain even higher levels of THCP. Variations in the
          level of THCP in different marijuana variants might explain
          why people report such varying levels of psychotropic effects
          with different plants. The authors of this study expressed
          excitement that their discovery of such an extremely potent
          THC-like cannabinoid may shed light on several pharmacological
          effects not ascribable solely to THC. This makes sense given
          that the overall experience of marijuana is due to the
          aggregate effects of all of the molecules in the plant....<b><br>

          </b>&nbsp;A British woman has been found guilty of harassing a
          transgender woman online and hit with a £1,000 fine and
          two-year conditional discharge. The abuse consisted of
          offensive tweeting, deliberate misgendering and name-calling.<br>
          <br>
          In a verdict announced by St Albans Magistrates’ Court on
          Thursday, 39-year-old Katherine Scottow was convicted of using
          a public communications network – Twitter – to continuously
          cause “needless anxiety,” annoyance and inconvenience to
          Stephanie Hayden, 48.<br>
          <br>
          The harassment continued from September 2018 to May 2019, and
          included deliberate “misgendering” of Hayden and repeatedly
          referring to the transgender woman by male pronouns, as well
          as name-calling, including Scottow referring to Hayden as a
          “pig in a wig.”...<b><br>

                Directly Onto Wounds</b><br>
              <i>Scientists have created a handheld printer that patches
                up damaged skin.</i><i><br>

            <br>
            Every day science is making medical discoveries that can
            change our lives. And now scientists have created a handheld
            skin printer that patches up damaged skin due to injuries
            such as extreme burns.<br>
            <br>
            Spanish scientists from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid
            (UC3M), Center for Energy, Environmental and Technological
            Research (CIEMAT) created a large bioprinter that prints
            human skin in 2017.<br>
            <br>
            Then In 2018, Canadian scientists advanced the research and
            revealed a handheld device that “prints” sheets of
            artificial skin directly onto the wounds of burn victims.<br>
            <br>
            “The analogy is a duct tape dispenser,” researcher Axel
            Günther told Smithsonian Magazine at the time, “where
            instead of a roll of tape you have a microdevice that
            squishes out a piece of tissue tape.”<br>
            <br>
            The Canadian scientists recently published the hopeful
            results of their latest trial of the handheld device in the
            journal Biofabrication. Doctors currently have several
            possibilities for treating severe burns including collagen
            scaffolds, in vitro skin substitutes, and skin grafts.<br>
            <br>
            The most commonly used method is skin grafts which involves
            removing damaged tissue and replacing it with healthy skin
            from another part of the body. But grafts aren’t always a
            viable option.<br>
            <br>
            “[I]n cases where a patient has extensive full-thickness
            burns—which destroy both the upper and lower layers of the
            skin—there is not always sufficient healthy skin left to
            use,” Günther explained in a press release.<br>
            <br>
            Alternative burn treatments such as collagen scaffolds and
            in vitro skin substitutes, each have their own downsides,
            Günther also said.<br>
            <br>
            These are the reasons given for why the team created a
            device that eliminates the need for skin grafts altogether
            by depositing strips of a special bio-ink directly onto a
            wound. The bio-ink contains healing proteins and mesenchymal
            stromal cells which aid the body’s immune system and
            stimulates new cell growth, according to the researchers.<br>
            <br>
            For the trial, scientists tested the skin printing device on
            full-thickness burns on pigs and they were very impressed
            with the results.<br>
            <br>
            “We found the device successfully deposited the ‘skin
            sheets’ onto the wounds uniformly, safely and reliably, and
            the sheets stayed in place with only very minimal movement,”
            Marc Jeschke said in the press release.<br>
            <br>
            “Most significantly, our results showed that the
            [mesenchymal stromal cell]-treated wounds healed extremely
            well,” he continued, “with a reduction in inflammation,
            scarring, and contraction compared with both the untreated
            wounds and those treated with a collagen scaffold.”<br>
            <br>
            In 2016, researchers at Harvard University made the first
            3-D-printed heart-on-a-chip with integrated sensing. And in
            2019 that research was advanced when Israeli scientists
            created the first 3D-printed heart using human tissue and
            vessels. They engineered the heart from the tissue of
            patients and created a bio-ink, Telegraph reported.<br>
            <br>
            This new skin can also be used in the research and testing
            of cosmetics, chemicals, and pharmaceutical products that go
            on and into the human body.<br>
            <br>
            Skin “can be transplanted into patients or used in business
            settings to test chemical products, cosmetics or
            pharmaceutical products in quantities and with timetables
            and prices that are compatible with these uses,” Professor
            José Luis Jorcano head of the Mixed Unit CIEMAT/UC3M in
            Biomedical Engineering said previously.<br>
            <br>
            On the other hand, some may argue that this is a giant leap
            towards “transhumanism<br>

            <b><br>
            </b>A research team led by scientists from the City
            University of Hong Kong (CityU) has recently developed a
            droplet-based electricity generator (DEG) with a
            field-effect transistor (FET)-like structure that allows for
            high energy conversion efficiency and instantaneous power
            density thousands of times that of its counterparts without
            FET technology. This would help to advance scientific
            research of water energy generation and tackle the energy
            crisis. <br>
            <br>
            The research was led together by Professor Wang Zuankai from
            CityU's Department of Mechanical Engineering, Professor Zeng
            Xiao Cheng from University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and
            Professor Wang Zhong Lin, founding director and chief
            scientist from Beijing Institute of Nanoenergy and
            Nanosystems of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Their findings
            were published in Nature in a study titled "A droplet-based
            electricity generator with high instantaneous power
            density."<br>
            <b><br>
              Efficiency of electrical energy conversion greatly
              improved<br>
              <br>
            </b>About 70% of the Earth's surface is covered by water.
            Yet low-frequency kinetic energy contained in waves, tides,
            and even raindrops are not efficiently converted into
            electrical energy due to limitations in current technology.
            For example, a conventional droplet energy generator based
            on the triboelectric effect can generate electricity induced
            by contact electrification and electrostatic induction when
            a droplet hits a surface. However, the amount of charges
            generated on the surface is limited by the interfacial
            effect, and as a result, the energy conversion efficiency is
            quite low.<br>
            <br>
            In order to improve the conversion efficiency, the research
            team has spent two years developing the DEG. Its
            instantaneous power density can reach up to 50.1 W/m2,
            thousands times higher than other similar devices without
            the use of FET-like design. And the energy conversion
            efficiency is markedly higher.<br>
            <br>
            Professor Wang from CityU pointed out that there are two
            crucial factors for the invention. First, the team found
            that the continuous droplets impinging on PTFE, an electret
            material with a quasi-permanent electric charge, provides a
            new route for the accumulation and storage of high-density
            surface charges. They found that when water droplets
            continuously hit the surface of PTFE, the surface charges
            generated will accumulate and gradually reach a saturation.
            This new discovery helped to overcome the bottleneck of low
            charge density encountered in previous work.<br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            <b>Unique field-effect transistor-like structure<br>
              <br>
            </b>Another key feature of their design is a unique set of
            structures similar to a FET, the basic building block of
            modern electronic devices. The device consists of an
            aluminum electrode and an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode
            with a film of PTFE deposited on it. The PTFE/ITO electrode
            is responsible for the charge generation, storage and
            induction. When a falling water droplet hits and spreads on
            the PTFE/ITO surface, it naturally "bridges" the aluminum
            electrode and the PTFE/ITO electrode, translating the
            original system into a closed-loop electric circuit.<br>
            <br>
            With this special design, a high density of surface charges
            can be accumulated on the PTFE through continuous droplet
            impinging. Meanwhile, when the spreading water connects the
            two electrodes, all the stored charges on the PTFE can be
            fully released for the generation of electric current. As a
            result, both the instantaneous power density and energy
            conversion efficiency are much higher.<br>
            <br>
            "Our research shows that a drop of 100 microliters of water
            released from a height of 15 cm can generate a voltage of
            over 140V. And the power generated can light up 100 small
            LED light bulbs," said Professor Wang.<br>
            <br>
            He added that the increase in instantaneous power density
            does not result from additional energy, but from the
            conversion of kinetic energy of water itself. "The kinetic
            energy entailed in falling water is due to gravity and can
            be regarded as free and renewable. It should be better
            utilized."<br>
            <br>
            Their research also shows that the reduction in relative
            humidity does not affect the efficiency of power generation.
            Also, both rainwater and seawater can be used to generate
            electricity.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Facilitates the sustainability of the world<br>
              <br>
            </b>Professor Wang hoped that the outcome of this research
            would help to harvest water energy to respond to the global
            problem of renewable energy shortage. "Generating power from
            raindrops instead of oil and nuclear energy can facilitate
            the sustainable development of the world," he added.<br>
            <br>
            He believed that in the long run, the new design could be
            applied and installed on different surfaces, where liquid in
            contact with solid, to fully utilize the low-frequency
            kinetic energy in water. This can range from the hull

            <b>Abstract<br>
            </b>Extensive efforts have been made to harvest energy from
            water in the form of raindrops1,2,3,4,5,6, river and ocean
            waves7,8, tides9 and others10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. However,
            achieving a high density of electrical power generation is
            challenging. Traditional hydraulic power generation mainly
            uses electromagnetic generators that are heavy, bulky, and
            become inefficient with low water supply. An alternative,
            the water-droplet/solid-based triboelectric nanogenerator,
            has so far generated peak power densities of less than one
            watt per square metre, owing to the limitations imposed by
            interfacial effects—as seen in characterizations of the
            charge generation and transfer that occur at
            solid–liquid1,2,3,4 or liquid–liquid5,18 interfaces. Here we
            develop a device to harvest energy from impinging water
            droplets by using an architecture that comprises a
            polytetrafluoroethylene film on an indium tin oxide
            substrate plus an aluminium electrode. We show that
            spreading of an impinged water droplet on the device bridges
            the originally disconnected components into a closed-loop
            electrical system, transforming the conventional interfacial
            effect into a bulk effect, and so enhancing the
            instantaneous power density by several orders of magnitude
            over equivalent devices that are limited by interfacial
            effects.<br>

                won’t sink</b><br>
            </div>
            <b><br>
            </b>University of Rochester researchers, inspired by diving
            bell spiders and rafts of fire ants, have created a metallic
            structure that is so water repellent, it refuses to sink—no
            matter how often it is forced into water or how much it is
            damaged or punctured.<br>
            <br>
            Could this lead to an unsinkable ship? A wearable flotation
            device that will still float after being punctured?
            Electronic monitoring devices that can survive in long term
            in the ocean?<br>
            <br>
            All of the above, says Chunlei Guo, professor of optics and
            physics, whose lab describes the structure in ACS Applied
            Materials and Interfaces.<br>
            <br>
            The structure uses a groundbreaking technique the lab
            developed for using femtosecond bursts of lasers to “etch”
            the surfaces of metals with intricate micro- and nanoscale
            patterns that trap air and make the surfaces
            superhydrophobic, or water repellent.<br>
            <br>
            The researchers found, however, that after being immersed in
            water for long periods of time, the surfaces may start to
            lose their hydrophobic properties.<br>
            <br>
            Enter the spiders and fire ants, which can survive long
            periods under or on the surface of water. How? By trapping
            air in an enclosed area. Argyroneta aquatic spiders, for
            example, create an underwater dome-shaped web—a so-called
            diving bell— that they fill with air carried from the
            surface between their super-hydrophobic legs and abdomens.
            Similarly, fire ants can form a raft by trapping air among
            their superhydrophobic bodies.<br>
            <br>
            “That was a very interesting inspiration,” Guo says. As the
            researchers note in the paper: “The key insight is that
            multifaceted superhydrophobic (SH) surfaces can trap a large
            air volume, which points towards the possibility of using SH
            surfaces to create buoyant devices.”<br>
            <br>
            Guo’s lab created a structure in which the treated surfaces
            on two parallel aluminum plates face inward, not outward, so
            they are enclosed and free from external wear and abrasion.
            The surfaces are separated by just the right distance to
            trap and hold enough air to keep the structure floating—in
            essence creating a waterproof compartment. The
            superhydrophobic surfaces will keep water from entering the
            compartment even when the structure is forced to submerge in
            water.<br>
            <br>
            Even after being forced to submerge for two months, the
            structures immediately bounced back to the surface after the
            load was released, Guo says. The structures also retained
            this ability even after being punctured multiple times,
            because air remains trapped in remaining parts of the
            compartment or adjoining structures.<br>
            <br>
            Though the team used aluminum for this project, the “etching
            process “could be used for literally any metals, or other
            materials,” Guo says.<br>
            <br>
            When the Guo lab first demonstrated the etching technique,
            it took an hour to pattern a one-inch-by-one-inch area of
            surface. Now, by using lasers seven times as powerful, and
            faster scanning, the lab has speeded up the process, making
            it more feasible for scaling up for commercial applications.<br>

                nuclear power plants worth of energy, thanks to a new

            <b><br>
            </b>Green energy advocates may soon be turning blue. A new
            membrane could unlock the potential of “blue energy,” which
            uses chemical differences between fresh- and saltwater to
            generate electricity. If researchers can scale up the
            postage stamp–size membrane in an affordable fashion, it
            could provide carbon-free power to millions of people in
            coastal nations where freshwater rivers meet the sea.<br>
            <br>
            “It’s impressive,” says Hyung Gyu Park, a mechanical
            engineer at Pohang University of Science and Technology in
            South Korea who wasn’t involved with the work. “Our field
            has waited for this success for many years.”<br>
            <br>
            Blue energy’s promise stems from its scale: Rivers dump some
            37,000 cubic kilometers of freshwater into the oceans every
            year. This intersection between fresh- and saltwater creates
            the potential to generate lots of electricity—2.6 terawatts,
            according to one recent estimate, roughly the amount that
            can be generated by 2000 nuclear power plants.<br>
            <br>
            There are several ways to generate power from that mixing.
            And a couple of blue energy power plants have been built.
            But their high cost has prevented widespread adoption. All
            blue energy approaches rely on the fact that salts are
            composed of ions, or chemicals that harbor a positive or
            negative charge. In solids, the positive and negative
            charges attract one another, binding the ions together.
            (Table salt, for example, is a compound made from positively
            charged sodium ions bound to negatively charged chloride
            ions.) In water, these ions detach and can move
            independently.<br>
            <br>
            By pumping the positive ions—like sodium or potassium—to the
            other side of a semipermeable membrane, researchers can
            create two pools of water: one with a positive charge, and
            one with a negative charge. If they then dunk electrodes in
            the pools and connect them with a wire, electrons will flow
            from the negatively charged to the positively charged side,
            generating electricity.<br>
            <br>
            In 2013, French researchers made just such a membrane. They
            used a ceramic film of silicon nitride—commonly used in
            industry for electronics, cutting tools, and other
            uses—pierced by a single pore lined with a boron nitride
            nanotube (BNNT), a material being investigated for use in
            high-strength composites, among other things. Because BNNTs
            are highly negatively charged, the French team suspected
            they would prevent negatively charged ions in water from
            passing through the membrane (because similar electric
            charges repel one another). Their hunch was right. They
            found that when a membrane with a single BNNT was placed
            between fresh- and saltwater, the positive ions zipped from
            the salty side to the fresh side, but the negatively charged
            ions were mostly blocked.<br>
            <br>
            The charge imbalance between the two sides was so strong
            that the researchers estimated a single square meter of the
            membrane—packed with millions of pores per square
            centimeter—could generate about 30 megawatt hours per year.
            That’s enough to power three homes.<br>
            <br>
            But creating even postage stamp–size films has proved
            impossible, because no one has figured out how to make all
            of the long, thin BNNTs line up perpendicular to the
            membrane. Until now.<br>
            <br>
            At the semiannual meeting of the Materials Research Society
            here yesterday, Semih Cetindag, a Ph.D. student in the lab
            of mechanical engineer Jerry Wei-Jen Shan at Rutgers
            University in Piscataway, New Jersey, reported that their
            team has now cracked the code. The nanotubes were easy.
            Cetindag says the lab just buys them from a chemical supply
            company. The scientists then add these to a polymer
            precursor that’s spread into a 6.5-micrometer-thick film. To
            orient the randomly aligned tubes, the researchers wanted to
            use a magnetic field. The problem: BNNTs aren’t magnetic.<br>
            <br>
            So Cetindag painted the negatively charged tubes with a
            positively charged coating; the molecules that made it up
            were too large to fit inside the BNNTs and thus left their
            channels open. Cetindag then added negatively charged
            magnetic iron oxide particles to the mix, which affixed to
            the positively charged coatings.<br>
            <br>
            That gave the Rutgers team the lever it was looking for.
            When the researchers applied a magnetic field, they could
            maneuver the tubes so that most aligned across the polymer
            film. They then applied ultraviolet light to cure the
            polymer, locking everything in place. Finally, the team used
            a plasma beam to etch away some of the material on the top
            and bottom surfaces of the membrane, ensuring the tubes were
            open to either side. The final membrane contained some 10
            million BNNTs per cubic centimeter.<br>
            <br>
            When the researchers placed their membrane in a small vessel
            separating salt- and freshwater, it produced four times more
            power per area than the previous French team’s BNNT
            experiment. That power boost, Shan says, is likely because
            the BNNTs they used are narrower, and thus do a better job
            of excluding negatively charged chloride ions.<br>
            <br>
            And they suspect they can do even better. “We’re not
            exploiting the full potential of the membranes,” Cetindag
            says. That’s because only 2% of the BNNTS were actually open
            on both sides of the membrane after the plasma treatment.
            Now, the researchers are trying to increase number of open
            pores in their films—which could one day give a long-sought
            boost to advocates of blue energy.<br>

              Summary<br>
            </b>Inspired by microstructures of polar bear hair, herein,
            we describe a simple solution-based strategy to fabricate a
            macroscopic-scale and lightweight carbon tube aerogel with
            super-elasticity and excellent thermal insulation. The
            microstructure-derived thermal conductivity and
            super-elasticity are strongly dependent on the shell
            thickness of the interconnected tubes, as well as the
            aperture of the aerogel. Remarkably, the optimized aerogel
            can maintain structural integrity after more than one
            million compress-release cycles at 30% strain and 10,000
            cycles at 90% strain. Moreover, this biomimetic aerogel
            offers a fast and accurate dynamic piezoresistive response
            to broad bandwidth frequency forces. Particularly, the
            super-elasticity is further confirmed by its fastest
            rebounding speed of 1,434 mm s &#8722;1 among the traditional
            elastic materials measured by a standard falling steel ball.
            Furthermore, the optimized minimum thermal conductivity is
            as low as 23 mW m &#8722;1 K &#8722;1 which performs better than the
            thermal conductivity of dry air.<br>

            <b> Abstract<br>
            </b>Animals living in the extremely cold environment, such
            as polar bears, have shown amazing capability to keep warm,
            benefiting from their hollow hairs. Mimicking such a
            strategy in synthetic fibers would stimulate smart textiles
            for efficient personal thermal management, which plays an
            important role in preventing heat loss and improving
            efficiency in house warming energy consumption. Here, a
            “freeze&#8208;spinning” technique is used to realize continuous
            and large&#8208;scale fabrication of fibers with aligned porous
            structure, mimicking polar bear hairs, which is difficult to
            achieve by other methods. A textile woven with such
            biomimetic fibers shows an excellent thermal insulation
            property as well as good breathability and wearability. In
            addition to passively insulating heat loss, the textile can
            also function as a wearable heater, when doped with
            electroheating materials such as carbon nanotubes, to induce
            fast thermal response and uniform electroheating while
            maintaining its soft and porous nature for comfortable
            wearing.<br>

            <b> Abstract<br>
            </b>Many biological surfaces in both the plant and animal
            kingdom possess unusual structural features at the micro-
            and nanometre-scale that control their interaction with
            water and hence wettability1,2,3,4,5. An intriguing example
            is provided by desert beetles, which use micrometre-sized
            patterns of hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions on their
            backs to capture water from humid air6. As anyone who has
            admired spider webs adorned with dew drops will appreciate,
            spider silk is also capable of efficiently collecting water
            from air. Here we show that the water-collecting ability of
            the capture silk of the cribellate spider Uloborus
            walckenaerius is the result of a unique fibre structure that
            forms after wetting, with the ‘wet-rebuilt’ fibres
            characterized by periodic spindle-knots made of random
            nanofibrils and separated by joints made of aligned
            nanofibrils. These structural features result in a surface
            energy gradient between the spindle-knots and the joints and
            also in a difference in Laplace pressure, with both factors
            acting together to achieve continuous condensation and
            directional collection of water drops around spindle-knots.
            Submillimetre-sized liquid drops have been driven by surface
            energy gradients7,8,9 or a difference in Laplace pressure10,
            but until now neither force on its own has been used to
            overcome the larger hysteresis effects that make the
            movement of micrometre-sized drops more difficult. By
            tapping into both driving forces, spider silk achieves this
            task. Inspired by this finding, we designed artificial
            fibres that mimic the structural features of silk and
            exhibit its directional water-collecting ability.<br>

            <b> Abstract<br>
            </b>A surface having a spatial gradient in its surface free
            energy was capable of causing drops of water placed on it to
            move uphill. This motion was the result of an imbalance in
            the forces due to surface tension acting on the liquid-solid
            contact line on the two opposite sides ("uphill" or
            "downhill") of the drop. The required gradient in surface
            free energy was generated on the surface of a polished
            silicon wafer by exposing it to the diffusing front of a
            vapor of decyltrichlorosilane, Cl3Si(CH2)9CH3. The resulting
            surface displayed a gradient of hydrophobicity (with the
            contact angle of water changing from 97° to 25°) over a
            distance of 1 centimeter. When the wafer was tilted from the
            horizontal plane by 15°, with the hydrophobic end lower than
            the hydrophilic, and a drop of water (1 to 2 microliters)
            was placed at the hydrophobic end, the drop moved toward the
            hydrophilic end with an average velocity of &#8764;1 to 2
            millimeters per second. In order for the drop to move, the
            hysteresis in contact angle on the surface had to be low
            (&#8804;10°).<br>

                  rural energy needs</b></b><br>
            </div>
            <b><b> <br>
              </b></b>&nbsp;The holy grail of renewable energy research
            may lie in the cooking pot, according to scientists.<br>
            <br>
            The search for a cheap source of electricity for remote,
            off-grid communities, has led to batteries that work on
            freshly boiled potatoes.<br>
            <br>
            One slice of potato can generate 20 hours of light, and
            several slices could provide enough energy to power simple
            medical equipment and even a low-power computer, said a
            research team from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,
            Israel.<br>
            <br>
            "The technology is ready to go," co-researcher Haim
            Rabinowitch told SciDev.Net. "It should take an interested
            body only a short while, and very little investment, to make
            this available to communities in need."<br>
            <br>
            The team, which described its work in the Journal of
            Renewable and Sustainable Energy earlier this month (7
            June), said its work hinges on a recent discovery that the
            electrical flow from potatoes — long known to be natural
            electrolytes — can be enhanced tenfold when their cell
            membranes are deliberately ruptured by boiling.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;To demonstrate, the researchers created a series of
            batteries out of slices of boiled Desiree potatoes about the
            size of a standard mobile phone, though they say the type
            and size of potato slice do not determine its power.<br>
            <br>
            The device had the same basic components as conventional
            batteries, consisting of two electrodes separated by an
            electrolyte (the potato). Each battery powered a small light
            for 20 hours, after which a new slice could be inserted.<br>
            <br>
            Potato batteries are estimated to generate energy at a cost
            of approximately US$9 per kilowatt hour (kW/h), which
            compares favourably with the best performing 1.5 volt (AA)
            alkaline cells — or D cells — which generate energy at
            US$50/kWh. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;Banana and strawberry batteries could also be used,
            said Rabinowitch, but their softer tissues would weaken the
            structure of the battery and the sugars could attract
            insects.<br>
            <br>
            "Potatoes were chosen because of their availability all over
            including the tropics and sub-tropics," he said. They are
            the world's fourth most abundant food crop."<br>
            <br>
            Teo Sanchez, energy technology and policy advisor at
            Practical Action, a charity which promotes technology for
            development, said: "With half the world's population having
            no access to modern energy, this research is a valuable
            contribution to one of the biggest challenges in the world".<br>
            <br>
            But he is concerned about the limited amount of power that
            individual batteries can generate and the possible
            implications of diverting a food crop into energy
            production.<br>

                Device—Enabling Nuclear Fusion Ignition</b><br>
              <b>Salvatore Cezar Pais</b><br>
            </div>
            <b>Abstract<br>
            </b>The plasma compression fusion device (PCFD) generates
            the energy gain by plasma compression-induced nuclear
            fusion. This concept has the capability of maximizing the
            product of plasma pressure and energy confinement time to
            maximize the energy gain, and thus give rise to fusion
            ignition conditions. The preferred embodiment of this
            original concept uses a hollow cross-duct configuration of
            circular cross section in which the concentrated magnetic
            energy flux from two pairs of opposing curved-headed
            counter-spinning conical structures (possibly made from an
            alloy of tungsten with high capacitance) whose outer
            surfaces are electrically charged compresses a gaseous
            mixture of fusion fuel into a plasma, heated to extreme
            temperatures and pressures. The generated high-intensity
            electromagnetic (EM) radiation heats the plasma and the
            produced magnetic fields confine it in between the
            counter-spinning conical structures, named the dynamic
            fusors (four of them-smoothly curved apex sections opposing
            each other in pairs). The dynamic fusors can be assemblies
            of electrified grids and toroidal magnetic coils, arranged
            within a conical structure whose outer surface is
            electrically charged. The cross-duct inner surface
            surrounding the plasma core region is also electrically
            charged and vibrated in an accelerated mode to minimize the
            flux of plasma particles (including neutrals) from impacting
            the PCFD surfaces and initiating a plasma quench. The fusion
            fuel (preferably deuterium gas) is introduced into the
            plasma core through the counterspinning conical structures,
            namely, injected through orifices in the dynamic fusor
            heads. There is envisioned another even more compact version
            of this concept, which uses accelerated vibration in a
            linear-duct configuration (using two counterspinning dynamic
            fusors only) and would best be suited for fusion power
            generation on aircraft, or main battle tanks. The concept
            uses controlled motion of electrically charged matter
            through accelerated vibration and/or accelerated spin
            subjected to smooth, yet rapid acceleration transients, to
            generate extremely high-energy/high-intensity EM radiation
            (fields of high-energy photons) which not only confines the
            plasma but also greatly compresses itso as to produce a high
            power density plasma burn, leading to ignition. The PCFD
            concept can produce power in the gigawatt to terawatt range
            (and higher) with input power in the kilowatt to megawatt
            range and can possibly lead to ignition (selfsustained)
            plasma burn. Several important practical engineering and
            operational issues with operating a device such as the PCFD
            are discussed.<br>

            </div>
            <b> </b><br>
            Thanks to Andreas Moraitis, barty, and others for finding an
            article published by the German Focus magazine about the
            current state of play in the world of fusion energy (it
            discusses both cold and hot versions).<br>
            <br>
            In the area of CF/LENR, the author, Michael Odenwald,
            mentions Andrea Rossi and the E-Cat, but also introduces a
            German company called PURRATIO AG which has apparently
            developed (or is developing) a reactor made of palladium (a
            hollow tube, a few inches long) which is designed to absorb
            hydrogen. The reaction occurs when an electrical charge is
            passed through the reactor.<br>
            <br>
            There’s a document on the PURRATIO website which describes
            the reaction. It announces this technology as “The most
            revolutionary, most meaningful and most innovative
            technology – the „COLD FUSION“”, and explains:<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The experimental procedure is carried out
            by means of an especially developed prototype on laboratory
            scale.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The neutron signal is reproducible and a
            doubtless proof of a neutron generating nuclear process in
            the described experiment.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A generation of the detector signal by
            perturbing influences of electronic origin can absolutely be
            ruled out.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The crucial physical parameters for the
            realization of the fusion effect are known. By appropriate
            changing of these parameters the fusion effect can be
            amplified up to the generation of excess heat or the
            generation of an explosion effect.<br>
            <br>
            It’s interesting to discover a brand new player in the cold
            fusion field — this is a company that I have never heard
            mentioned before. A brief perusal of their website shows
            that they have been around for quite a long time working in
            the field of nanotechnology, and it seems that branching out
            into the world of cold fusion is a relatively recent
            development. Here’s another player to keep an eye on!<br>

            The invention relates to a method for producing thermal
            energy, wherein light, initial material is introduced into a
            plasma arc which is located between a cathode and an anode
            and which is adapted to fusion processes by supplying
            electric energy into the plasma state. A metal cathode,
            which allows particles which are produced in the plasma to
            be diffused, is used and allows a fusion process to take
            place in the metal grid. The invention has a high degree of
            efficiency in corresponding systems such that said method
            can be used anywhere where fossils and/or renewable and/or
            chemical fuel can be used, as to use the thermal energy
            directly or by conversion.<br>

            <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
            </b>Traditional origami structures can be continuously
            deformed back to a flat sheet of paper, while traditional
            kirigami requires glue or seams in order to maintain its
            rigidity. In the former, nontrivial geometry can be created
            through overfolding paper, while in the latter, the paper
            topology is modified. Here we propose a hybrid approach that
            relies on overlapped flaps that create in-plane compression
            resulting in the formation of polyhedra composed of freely
            supported plates. Not only are these structures
            self-locking, but they have colossal load-to-weight ratios
            of order 104.<br>

                drug-resistant superbugs</b><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            Researchers have used liquid metals to develop new
            bacteria-destroying technology that could be the answer to
            the deadly problem of antibiotic resistance.<br>
            <br>
            The technology uses nano-sized particles of magnetic liquid
            metal to shred bacteria and bacterial biofilm – the
            protective “house” that bacteria thrive in – without harming
            good cells.<br>
            <br>
            Published in ACS Nano, the research led by RMIT University
            offers a groundbreaking new direction in the search for
            better bacteria-fighting technologies.<br>
            <br>
            Antibiotic resistance is a major global health threat,
            causing at least 700,000 deaths a year. Without action, the
            death toll could rise to 10 million people a year by 2050,
            overtaking cancer as a cause of death.<br>
            <br>
            The biggest issues are the spread of dangerous,
            drug-resistant superbugs and the growth of bacterial biofilm
            infections, which can no longer be treated with existing
            antibiotics.<br>
            <br>
            Dr Aaron Elbourne said antibiotics had revolutionised health
            since they were discovered 90 years ago but were losing
            effectiveness due to misuse.<br>
            <br>
            “We’re heading to a post-antibiotic future, where common
            bacterial infections, minor injuries and routine surgeries
            could once again become deadly,” Elbourne, a Postdoctoral
            Fellow in the Nanobiotechnology Laboratory at RMIT, said.<br>
            <br>
            “It’s not enough to reduce antibiotic use, we need to
            completely rethink how we fight bacterial infections.<br>
            <br>
            “Bacteria are incredibly adaptable and over time they
            develop defences to the chemicals used in antibiotics, but
            they have no way of dealing with a physical attack.<br>
            <br>
            “Our method uses precision-engineered liquid metals to
            physically rip bacteria to shreds and<br>
            <br>
            smash through the biofilm where bacteria live and multiply.<br>
            <br>
            “With further development, we hope this technology could be
            the way to help make antibiotic resistance history.” <br>
            Let’s get physical: New way to kill bacteria<br>
            <br>
            The RMIT team behind the technology is the only group in the
            world investigating the antibacterial potential of magnetic
            liquid metal nanoparticles.<br>
            <br>
            When exposed to a low-intensity magnetic field, these
            nano-sized droplets change shape and develop sharp edges<br>
            <br>
            When the droplets are placed in contact with a bacterial
            biofilm, their movements and nano-sharp edges break down the
            biofilm and physically rupture the bacterial cells.<br>
            <br>
            In the new study, the team tested the effectiveness of the
            technology against two types of bacterial biofilms
            (Gram-positive and Gram-negative).<br>
            <br>
            After 90 minutes of exposure to the liquid metal
            nanoparticles, both biofilms were destroyed and 99% of the
            bacteria were dead. Importantly, laboratory tests showed the
            bacteria-destroying droplets did not affect human cells.<br>
            <br>
            Postdoctoral Fellow Dr Vi Khanh Truong said the versatile
            technology could one day be used in a range of ways to treat
            infections.<br>
            <br>
            “It could be used as a spray coating for implants, to make
            them powerfully antibacterial and reduce the high rates of
            infection for procedures like hip and knee replacements,”
            said Truong, currently at North Carolina State University on
            a Fulbright Scholarship to further the research.<br>
            <br>
            “There’s also potential to develop this into an injectable
            treatment that could be used at the site of infection.”<br>
            <br>
            The next stage for the research - testing the effectiveness
            of the technology in pre-clinical animal trials - is already
            underway, with the team hoping to move to clinical human
            trials in coming years.<br>
            <br>
            Led by Truong, Elbourne and Dr James Chapman, the
            multi-disciplinary team is also planning to expand the
            technology beyond antibacterial treatment, exploring how it
            could be used to:<br>
            treat fungal infections - the next superbugs<br>
            break through cholesterol plaques and battle heart problems<br>
            stop tumours by being injected directly into cancer cells.<br>

                Treatment via Magnetic Activation</b><br>

            <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
            </b>Antibiotic resistance has made the treatment of
            biofilm-related infections challenging. As such, the quest
            for next-generation antimicrobial technologies must focus on
            targeted therapies to which pathogenic bacteria cannot
            develop resistance. Stimuli-responsive therapies represent
            an alternative technological focus due to their capability
            of delivering targeted treatment. This study provides a
            proof-of-concept investigation into the use of
            magneto-responsive gallium-based liquid metal (LM) droplets
            as antibacterial materials, which can physically damage,
            disintegrate, and kill pathogens within a mature biofilm.
            Once exposed to a low-intensity rotating magnetic field, the
            LM droplets become physically actuated and transform their
            shape, developing sharp edges. When placed in contact with a
            bacterial biofilm, the movement of the particles resulting
            from the magnetic field, coupled with the presence of
            nanosharp edges, physically ruptures the bacterial cells and
            the dense biofilm matrix is broken down. The antibacterial
            efficacy of the magnetically activated LM particles was
            assessed against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative
            bacterial biofilms. After 90 min over 99% of both bacterial
            species became nonviable, and the destruction of the
            biofilms was observed. These results will impact the design
            of next-generation, LM-based biofilm treatments.<br>

            <br>
            That banana peel, turned into graphene, can help facilitate
            a massive reduction of the environmental impact of concrete
            and other building materials. While you're at it, toss in
            those plastic empties.<br>
            <br>
            A new process introduced by the Rice University lab of
            chemist James Tour can turn bulk quantities of just about
            any carbon source into valuable graphene flakes. The process
            is quick and cheap; Tour said the "flash graphene" technique
            can convert a ton of coal, food waste or plastic into
            graphene for a fraction of the cost used by other bulk
            graphene-producing methods.<br>
            <br>
            "This is a big deal," Tour said. "The world throws out 30%
            to 40% of all food, because it goes bad, and plastic waste
            is of worldwide concern. We've already proven that any solid
            carbon-based matter, including mixed plastic waste and
            rubber tires, can be turned into graphene."<br>
            <br>
            As reported in Nature, flash graphene is made in 10
            milliseconds by heating carbon-containing materials to 3,000
            Kelvin (about 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit). The source material
            can be nearly anything with carbon content. Food waste,
            plastic waste, petroleum coke, coal, wood clippings and
            biochar are prime candidates, Tour said. "With the present
            commercial price of graphene being $67,000 to $200,000 per
            ton, the prospects for this process look superb," he said.<br>
            <br>
            Tour said a concentration of as little as 0.1% of flash
            graphene in the cement used to bind concrete could lessen
            its massive environmental impact by a third. Production of
            cement reportedly emits as much as 8% of human-made carbon
            dioxide every year.<br>
            <br>
            "By strengthening concrete with graphene, we could use less
            concrete for building, and it would cost less to manufacture
            and less to transport," he said. "Essentially, we're
            trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane
            that waste food would have emitted in landfills. We are
            converting those carbons into graphene and adding that
            graphene to concrete, thereby lowering the amount of carbon
            dioxide generated in concrete manufacture. It's a win-win
            environmental scenario using graphene."<br>
            <br>
            "Turning trash to treasure is key to the circular economy,"
            said co-corresponding author Rouzbeh Shahsavari, an adjunct
            assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering
            and of materials science and nanoengineering at Rice and
            president of C-Crete Technologies. "Here, graphene acts both
            as a 2D template and a reinforcing agent that controls
            cement hydration and subsequent strength development."<br>
            <br>
            In the past, Tour said, "graphene has been too expensive to
            use in these applications. The flash process will greatly
            lessen the price while it helps us better manage waste."<br>
            <br>
            "With our method, that carbon becomes fixed," he said. "It
            will not enter the air again."<br>
            <br>
            The process aligns nicely with Rice's recently announced
            Carbon Hub initiative to create a zero-emissions future that
            repurposes hydrocarbons from oil and gas to generate
            hydrogen gas and solid carbon with zero emission of carbon
            dioxide. The flash graphene process can convert that solid
            carbon into graphene for concrete, asphalt, buildings, cars,
            clothing and more, Tour said.<br>
            <br>
            Flash Joule heating for bulk graphene, developed in the Tour
            lab by Rice graduate student and lead author Duy Luong,
            improves upon techniques like exfoliation from graphite and
            chemical vapor deposition on a metal foil that require much
            more effort and cost to produce just a little graphene.<br>
            <br>
            Even better, the process produces "turbostratic" graphene,
            with misaligned layers that are easy to separate. "A-B
            stacked graphene from other processes, like exfoliation of
            graphite, is very hard to pull apart," Tour said. "The
            layers adhere strongly together.<br>
            <br>
            But turbostratic graphene is much easier to work with
            because the adhesion between layers is much lower. They just
            come apart in solution or upon blending in composites.<br>
            <br>
            "That's important, because now we can get each of these
            single-atomic layers to interact with a host composite," he
            said.<br>
            <br>
            The lab noted that used coffee grounds transformed into
            pristine single-layer sheets of graphene.<br>
            <br>
            Bulk composites of graphene with plastic, metals, plywood,
            concrete and other building materials would be a major
            market for flash graphene, according to the researchers, who
            are already testing graphene-enhanced concrete and plastic.<br>
            <br>
            The flash process happens in a custom-designed reactor that
            heats material quickly and emits all noncarbon elements as
            gas. "When this process is industrialized, elements like
            oxygen and nitrogen that exit the flash reactor can all be
            trapped as small molecules because they have value," Tour
            said.<br>
            <br>
            He said the flash process produces very little excess heat,
            channeling almost all of its energy into the target. "You
            can put your finger right on the container a few seconds
            afterwards," Tour said. "And keep in mind this is almost
            three times hotter than the chemical vapor deposition
            furnaces we formerly used to make graphene, but in the flash
            process the heat is concentrated in the carbon material and
            none in a surrounding reactor.<br>
            <br>
            "All the excess energy comes out as light, in a very bright
            flash, and because there aren't any solvents, it's a super
            clean process," he said.<br>
            <br>
            Luong did not expect to find graphene when he fired up the
            first small-scale device to find new phases of material,
            beginning with a sample of carbon black. "This started when
            I took a look at a Science paper talking about flash Joule
            heating to make phase-changing nanoparticles of metals," he
            said. But Luong quickly realized the process produced
            nothing but high-quality graphene.<br>
            <br>
            Atom-level simulations by Rice researcher and co-author
            Ksenia Bets confirmed that temperature is key to the
            material's rapid formation. "We essentially speed up the
            slow geological process by which carbon evolves into its
            ground state, graphite," she said. "Greatly accelerated by a
            heat spike, it is also stopped at the right instant, at the
            graphene stage.<br>
            <br>
            "It is amazing how state-of-the-art computer simulations,
            notoriously slow for observing such kinetics, reveal the
            details of high temperature-modulated atomic movements and
            transformation," Bets said.<br>
            <br>
            Tour hopes to produce a kilogram (2.2 pounds) a day of flash
            graphene within two years, starting with a project recently
            funded by the Department of Energy to convert U.S.-sourced
            coal. "This could provide an outlet for coal in large scale
            by converting it inexpensively into a much-higher-value
            building material," he said.<br>

            Researchers find a new set of geometric motifs that can
            create self-locking, lightweight, durable structures out of
            soft materials. The kirigami-inspired designs can support
            14,000 times their weight and, because they don't require
            adhesives or fasteners, can easily be flattened and
            re-folded. <br>

            </b>Traditional origami structures can be continuously
            deformed back to a flat sheet of paper, while traditional
            kirigami requires glue or seams in order to maintain its
            rigidity. In the former, nontrivial geometry can be created
            through overfolding paper, while in the latter, the paper
            topology is modified. Here we propose a hybrid approach that
            relies on overlapped flaps that create in-plane compression
            resulting in the formation of polyhedra composed of freely
            supported plates. Not only are these structures
            self-locking, but they have colossal load-to-weight ratios
            of order 104.<br>

                drug-resistant superbugs</b><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            Researchers have used liquid metals to develop new
            bacteria-destroying technology that could be the answer to
            the deadly problem of antibiotic resistance.<br>
            <br>
            The technology uses nano-sized particles of magnetic liquid
            metal to shred bacteria and bacterial biofilm – the
            protective “house” that bacteria thrive in – without harming
            good cells.<br>
            <br>
            Published in ACS Nano, the research led by RMIT University
            offers a groundbreaking new direction in the search for
            better bacteria-fighting technologies.<br>
            <br>
            Antibiotic resistance is a major global health threat,
            causing at least 700,000 deaths a year. Without action, the
            death toll could rise to 10 million people a year by 2050,
            overtaking cancer as a cause of death.<br>
            <br>
            The biggest issues are the spread of dangerous,
            drug-resistant superbugs and the growth of bacterial biofilm
            infections, which can no longer be treated with existing
            antibiotics.<br>
            <br>
            Dr Aaron Elbourne said antibiotics had revolutionised health
            since they were discovered 90 years ago but were losing
            effectiveness due to misuse.<br>
            <br>
            “We’re heading to a post-antibiotic future, where common
            bacterial infections, minor injuries and routine surgeries
            could once again become deadly,” Elbourne, a Postdoctoral
            Fellow in the Nanobiotechnology Laboratory at RMIT, said.<br>
            <br>
            “It’s not enough to reduce antibiotic use, we need to
            completely rethink how we fight bacterial infections.<br>
            <br>
            “Bacteria are incredibly adaptable and over time they
            develop defences to the chemicals used in antibiotics, but
            they have no way of dealing with a physical attack.<br>
            <br>
            “Our method uses precision-engineered liquid metals to
            physically rip bacteria to shreds and<br>
            <br>
            smash through the biofilm where bacteria live and multiply.<br>
            <br>
            “With further development, we hope this technology could be
            the way to help make antibiotic resistance history.” <br>
            Let’s get physical: New way to kill bacteria<br>
            <br>
            The RMIT team behind the technology is the only group in the
            world investigating the antibacterial potential of magnetic
            liquid metal nanoparticles.<br>
            <br>
            When exposed to a low-intensity magnetic field, these
            nano-sized droplets change shape and develop sharp edges<br>
            <br>
            When the droplets are placed in contact with a bacterial
            biofilm, their movements and nano-sharp edges break down the
            biofilm and physically rupture the bacterial cells.<br>
            <br>
            In the new study, the team tested the effectiveness of the
            technology against two types of bacterial biofilms
            (Gram-positive and Gram-negative).<br>
            <br>
            After 90 minutes of exposure to the liquid metal
            nanoparticles, both biofilms were destroyed and 99% of the
            bacteria were dead. Importantly, laboratory tests showed the
            bacteria-destroying droplets did not affect human cells.<br>
            <br>
            Postdoctoral Fellow Dr Vi Khanh Truong said the versatile
            technology could one day be used in a range of ways to treat
            infections.<br>
            <br>
            “It could be used as a spray coating for implants, to make
            them powerfully antibacterial and reduce the high rates of
            infection for procedures like hip and knee replacements,”
            said Truong, currently at North Carolina State University on
            a Fulbright Scholarship to further the research.<br>
            <br>
            “There’s also potential to develop this into an injectable
            treatment that could be used at the site of infection.”<br>
            <br>
            The next stage for the research - testing the effectiveness
            of the technology in pre-clinical animal trials - is already
            underway, with the team hoping to move to clinical human
            trials in coming years.<br>
            <br>
            Led by Truong, Elbourne and Dr James Chapman, the
            multi-disciplinary team is also planning to expand the
            technology beyond antibacterial treatment, exploring how it
            could be used to:<br>
            <br>
            treat fungal infections - the next superbugs<br>
            break through cholesterol plaques and battle heart problems<br>
            stop tumours by being injected directly into cancer cells.<br>

                Treatment via Magnetic Activation</b><br>

            <b>Abstract</b></b><br>
          Antibiotic resistance has made the treatment of
          biofilm-related infections challenging. As such, the quest for
          next-generation antimicrobial technologies must focus on
          targeted therapies to which pathogenic bacteria cannot develop
          resistance. Stimuli-responsive therapies represent an
          alternative technological focus due to their capability of
          delivering targeted treatment. This study provides a
          proof-of-concept investigation into the use of
          magneto-responsive gallium-based liquid metal (LM) droplets as
          antibacterial materials, which can physically damage,
          disintegrate, and kill pathogens within a mature biofilm. Once
          exposed to a low-intensity rotating magnetic field, the LM
          droplets become physically actuated and transform their shape,
          developing sharp edges. When placed in contact with a
          bacterial biofilm, the movement of the particles resulting
          from the magnetic field, coupled with the presence of
          nanosharp edges, physically ruptures the bacterial cells and
          the dense biofilm matrix is broken down. The antibacterial
          efficacy of the magnetically activated LM particles was
          assessed against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative
          bacterial biofilms. After 90 min over 99% of both bacterial
          species became nonviable, and the destruction of the biofilms
          was observed. These results will impact the design of
          next-generation, LM-based biofilm treatments.<br>
