              </font></small></b><small><font color="#000000">All living
              things require nitrogen for survival, but the world
              depends on only two known processes to break nitrogen's
              ultra-strong bonds to allow conversion to a form humans,
              animals and plants can consume. One is a natural,
              bacterial process on which farmers have relied since the
              dawn of agriculture. The other is the century-old
              Haber-Bösch process, which revolutionized fertilizer
              production and spurred unprecedented growth of the global
              food supply.<br>
              <br>
              "We live in a sea of nitrogen, yet our bodies can't access
              it from the air," says Utah State University biochemist
              Lance Seefeldt. "Instead, we get this life-sustaining
              compound from protein in our food."<br>
              <br>
              But now, Seefeldt and colleagues announce a light-driven
              process that could, once again, revolutionize agriculture,
              while reducing the world food supply's dependence on
              fossil fuels and relieving Haber-Bösch's heavy carbon
              footprint. The research team, which includes USU's
              Seefeldt, Derek Harris, Andrew Rasmussen and Nimesh
              Khadka; Katherine A. Brown and Paul W. King of Colorado's
              National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Molly Wilker, Hayden
              Hamby and Gordana Dukovic of the University of Colorado
              and Stephen Keable and John Peters of Montana State
              University, publishes findings in the April 22, 2016 issue
              of the journal Science.<br>
              <br>
              "Our research demonstrates photochemical energy can
              replace adenosine triphosphate, which is typically used to
              convert dinitrogen, the form of nitrogen found in the air,
              to ammonia, a main ingredient of commercially produced
              fertilizers," says Seefeldt, professor in USU's Department
              of Chemistry and Biochemistry and an American Association
              for the Advancement of Science Fellow.<br>
              <br>
              Any way you slice it, he says, nitrogen fixation is an
              energy-intensive process.<br>
              <br>
              "The Haber-Bösch process currently consumes about two
              percent of the world's fossil fuel supply," Seefeldt says.
              "So, the new process, which uses nanomaterials to capture
              light energy, could be a game-changer."<br>
              <br>
              "Using light directly to create a catalyst is much more
              energy efficient, says Brown, NREL research scientist.
              "This new ammonia-producing process is the first example
              of how light energy can be directly coupled to dinitrogen
              reduction, meaning sunlight or artificial light can power
              the reaction."<br>
              <br>
              Energy-efficient production of ammonia holds promise not
              only for food production, but also for development of
              technologies that enable use of environmentally cleaner
              alternative fuels, including improved fuel cells to store
              solar energy.<br>
              <br>
              In addition to its practical applications, the research
              sheds light on fundamental aspects of how bacterial
              enzymes known as nitrogenases function; an area of
              chemistry Seefeldt has studied for nearly two decades.<br>

              enzymes catalyze the biological production of fixed
              nitrogen. Because this is not enough to sustain modern
              agriculture, industrial fertilizers containing ammonia are
              produced via the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process.
              Brown et al. developed a way to use nitrogenase enzymes
              from nitrogen-fixing bacteria to make ammonia in vitro
              without other biological steps or high-energy inputs.
              Light-activated CdS nanorods provided electrons to the
              FeMo nitrogenase enzyme to reduce nitrogen and produce
              ammonia at rates up to 64% of biological nitrogen
              fixation. These nanoparticle-protein complexes show the
              potential for solar-driven ammonia production.<br>

              splitting of dinitrogen (N2) and reduction to ammonia
              (NH3) is a kinetically complex and energetically
              challenging multistep reaction. In the Haber-Bosch
              process, N2 reduction is accomplished at high temperature
              and pressure, whereas N2 fixation by the enzyme
              nitrogenase occurs under ambient conditions using chemical
              energy from adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis. We
              show that cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanocrystals can be used
              to photosensitize the nitrogenase molybdenum-iron (MoFe)
              protein, where light harvesting replaces ATP hydrolysis to
              drive the enzymatic reduction of N2 into NH3. The turnover
              rate was 75 per minute, 63% of the ATP-coupled reaction
              rate for the nitrogenase complex under optimal conditions.
              Inhibitors of nitrogenase (i.e., acetylene, carbon
              monoxide, and dihydrogen) suppressed N2 reduction. The
              CdS:MoFe protein biohybrids provide a photochemical model
              for achieving light-driven N2 reduction to NH3.</font></small><b><small><font

          'Inverse spin Hall effect' works in several organic

      <br>
      By showing that a phenomenon dubbed the 'inverse spin Hall effect'
      works in several organic semiconductors -- including carbon-60
      buckyballs -- physicists changed magnetic 'spin current' into
      electric current. The efficiency of this new power conversion
      method isn't yet known, but it might find use in future electronic
      devices including batteries, solar cells and computers. <br>
      <br>
      By showing that a phenomenon dubbed the "inverse spin Hall effect"
      works in several organic semiconductors -- including carbon-60
      buckyballs -- University of Utah physicists changed magnetic "spin
      current" into electric current. The efficiency of this new power
      conversion method isn't yet known, but it might find use in future
      electronic devices including batteries, solar cells and computers.<br>
      <br>
      "This paper is the first to demonstrate the inverse spin Hall
      effect in a range of organic semiconductors with unprecedented
      sensitivity," although a 2013 study by other researchers
      demonstrated it with less sensitivity in one such material, says
      Christoph Boehme, a senior author of the study published April 18
      in the journal Nature Materials.<br>
      <br>
      "The inverse spin Hall effect is a remarkable phenomenon that
      turns so-called spin current into an electric current. The effect
      is so odd that nobody really knows what this will be used for
      eventually, but many technical applications are conceivable,
      including very odd new power-conversion schemes," says Boehme, a
      physics professor.<br>
      <br>
      His fellow senior author, distinguished professor Z. Valy Vardeny,
      says that by using pulses of microwaves, the inverse spin Hall
      effect and organic semiconductors to convert spin current into
      electricity, this new electromotive force generates electrical
      current in a way different than existing sources.<br>
      <br>
      Coal, gas, hydroelectric, wind and nuclear plants all use dynamos
      to convert mechanical force into magnetic-field changes and then
      electricity. Chemical reactions power modern batteries and solar
      cells convert light to electrical current. Converting spin current
      into electrical current is another method.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists already are developing such devices, such as a
      thermoelectric generator, using traditional inorganic
      semiconductors. Vardeny says organic semiconductors are promising
      because they are cheap, easily processed and environmentally
      friendly. He notes that both organic solar cells and organic LED
      (light-emitting diode) TV displays were developed even though
      silicon solar cells and nonorganic LEDs were widely used.<br>
      <br>
      Vardeny and Boehme stressed that the efficiency at which organic
      semiconductors convert spin current to electric current remains
      unknown, so it is too early to predict the extent to which it
      might one day be used for new power conversion techniques in
      batteries, solar cells, computers, phones and other consumer
      electronics.<br>
      <br>
      "I want to invoke a degree of caution," Boehme says. "This is a
      power conversion effect that is new and mostly unstudied."<br>
      <br>
      Boehme notes that the experiments in the new study converted more
      spin current to electrical current than in the 2013 study, but
      Vardeny cautioned the effect still "would have to be scaled up
      many times to produce voltages equivalent to household batteries."<br>
      <br>
      The new study was funded by the National Science Foundation and
      the University of Utah-NSF Materials Research Science and
      Engineering Center. Study co-authors with Vardeny and Boehme were
      these University of Utah physicists: research assistant professors
      Dali Sun and Hans Malissa, postdoctoral researchers Kipp van
      Schooten and Chuang Zhang, and graduate students Marzieh Kavand
      and Matthew Groesbeck.<br>
      <br>
      <b>From spin current to electric current</b><br>
      <br>
      Just as atomic nuclei and the electrons that orbit them carry
      electrical charges, they also have another inherent property:
      spin, which makes them behave like tiny bar magnets that can point
      north or south.<br>
      <br>
      Electronic devices store and transmit information using the flow
      of electricity in the form of electrons, which are negatively
      charged subatomic particles. The zeroes and ones of computer
      binary code are represented by the absence or presence of
      electrons within silicon or other nonorganic semiconductors.<br>
      <br>
      Spin electronics -- spintronics -- holds promise for faster,
      cheaper computers, better electronics and LEDs for displays, and
      smaller sensors to detect everything from radiation to magnetic
      fields.<br>
      <br>
      The inverse spin Hall effect first was demonstrated in metals in
      2008, and then in nonorganic semiconductors, Vardeny says. In
      2013, researchers elsewhere showed it occurred in an organic
      semiconductor named PEDOT:PSS when it was exposed to continuous
      microwaves that were relatively weak to avoid frying the
      semiconductor.<br>
      <br>
      But Boehme and Vardeny say the electrical current generated in
      that study by the inverse spin Hall effect was small --
      nanovoltages -- and was obscured by microwave heating of the
      sample and other undesired effects.<br>
      <br>
      "We thought, let's build different devices so these spurious
      effects were eliminated or very small compared with the effect we
      wanted to observe," Boehme says.<br>
      <br>
      In the new study, the researchers used short pulses of more
      powerful microwaves to utilize the inverse spin Hall effect and
      convert a spin current to electric current in seven organic
      semiconductors, mostly at room temperature.<br>
      <br>
      One organic semiconductor was PEDOT:PSS -- the same material in
      the 2013 study. The others were three platinum-rich organic
      polymers, two so-called pi-conjugated polymers and the spherical
      carbon-60 molecule named buckminsterfullerene because it looks
      like a pair of geodesic domes popularized by the late architect
      Buckminster Fuller.<br>
      <br>
      The carbon-60 proved surprisingly to be the most efficient
      semiconductor at converting spin waves into electrical current,
      Vardeny says.<br>
      <br>
      <b>How the experiments were performed</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The Utah physicists take multiple steps to convert spin current to
      electrical current. They begin with a small glass slide, about
      2.1-inches long and one-sixth-inch wide. Two electrical contacts
      are attached to one end of the glass slide. Thin, flat copper
      wires run the length of the slide, connecting the contacts at one
      end with a "sandwich" at the other end that includes the glass at
      the bottom, the organic polymer semiconductor being tested in the
      middle and a nickel-iron ferromagnet on top.<br>
      <br>
      This device then is inserted lengthwise into a metal tube about
      1-inch diameter and 3.5 inches long. A nonconducting material
      surrounds the device inside this tube, which then is inserted into
      a table-sized magnet that generates a magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      "We apply a magnetic field and leave it more or less constant,"
      Boehme says. "Then we hook up the two contacts to a voltage meter
      and start measuring the voltage coming out of the device as a
      function of time."<br>
      <br>
      With just the magnetic field, no electrical current was detected.
      But then the Utah physicists bombarded the organic semiconductor
      device with pulses of microwaves -- as powerful as those from a
      home microwave oven but in pulses ranging from only 100 to 5,000
      nanoseconds (the latter equal to one 200,000th of a second).<br>
      <br>
      "All of a sudden we saw a voltage during that pulse," Boehme says.<br>
      <br>
      Vardeny says the microwave pulses generate spin waves in the
      device's magnet, then the waves are converted into spin current in
      the organic semiconductor, and then into an electric current
      detected as a voltage.<br>
      <br>
      Compared with the 2013 study, the use of microwave pulses in the
      Utah experiments meant "our power is much higher but the heating
      is much less and the inverse spin Hall effect is about 100 times
      stronger," Boehme says.<br>
      <br>
      In effect, the pulsed microwaves provide a way to enhance the
      inverse spin Hall effect so it can be used to convert power,
      Vardeny adds.<br>
      <br>
      The new study also showed that the conversion of spin current to
      electric current works in organic semiconductors via "spin-orbit
      coupling" -- the same process found in inorganic conductors and
      semiconductors -- even though the phenomenon in inorganic and
      organic materials works in fundamentally different ways, Boehme
      says.<br>
      <br>
      This coupling is much weaker in organic than in nonorganic
      semiconductors, but "the big achievement we made was to find an
      experimental method sensitive enough to reliably measure these
      very weak effects in organic semiconductors," Boehme says.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Exploration of spin currents in organic semiconductors (OSECs)
      induced by resonant microwave absorption in ferromagnetic
      substrates is appealing for potential spintronics applications.
      Owing to the inherently weak spin–orbit coupling (SOC) of OSECs,
      their inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) response is very subtle;
      limited by the microwave power applicable under continuous-wave
      (cw) excitation. Here we introduce a novel approach for generating
      significant ISHE signals in OSECs using pulsed ferromagnetic
      resonance, where the ISHE is two to three orders of magnitude
      larger compared to cw excitation. This strong ISHE enables us to
      investigate a variety of OSECs ranging from π-conjugated polymers
      with strong SOC that contain intrachain platinum atoms, to weak
      SOC polymers, to C60 films, where the SOC is predominantly caused
      by the curvature of the molecule’s surface. The pulsed-ISHE
      technique offers a robust route for efficient injection and
      detection schemes of spin currents at room temperature, and paves
      the way for spin orbitronics in plastic materials.<br>

      American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months

          FOR 60 DAYS AND THIS HAPPENS TO HIS BRAIN!</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Dr. Mary Newport has a theory that ketone bodies, which the body
      makes when digesting coconut oil, may be an alternative fuel for
      the brain. She believes that coconut oil may offer profound
      benefits in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease. If her theory
      is accurate, it could be one of the greatest natural health
      discoveries in years.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Backstory</b><br>
      <br>
      Dr. Newport has her own personal history with Alzheimer’s. Her
      husband, Steve, suffered from progressive dementia for at least
      five years in his mid-50s, then had an MRI that supported a
      clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. She recounts her story
      in a case study. “Many days, often for several days in a row, he
      was in a fog; couldn’t find a spoon or remember how to get water
      out of the refrigerator… One day I would ask if a certain call
      came that I was expecting and he would say ‘No.’ Two days later he
      would remember the message from so-and-so from a couple of days
      earlier and what they said.”<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Newport noted that her husband had no short-term memory, yet
      the information was still filed somewhere in his brain. She had a
      gut feeling that his diet had something to do with it. He began
      taking medication in hopes that it would help slow the process,
      but he became depressed, lost weight, forgot how to cook, use a
      calculator or even perform simple addition. Steve forgot how to
      perform many common tasks, but would spend all day working in the
      yard or in his garage and remained in good physical condition.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Finding Hope</b><br>
      <br>
      A few studies about the potential use of medium chain
      triglycerides or ketone bodies to not only treat but prevent
      Alzheimer’s disease caught Dr. Newport’s eye. Medium chain
      triglycerides are also regarded as a potential treatment for
      Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, multiple sclerosis,
      drug resistant epilepsy, and diabetes. Dr. Newport explains,
      “Ketone bodies may help the brain recover after a loss of oxygen
      in newborns through adults, may help the heart recover after an
      acute attack, and may shrink cancerous tumors. Children with drug
      resistant epilepsy sometimes respond to an extremely low
      carbohydrate ketogenic diet.”<br>
      <br>
      The body’s cells may be able to use ketone bodies as an
      alternative fuel when glucose is unavailable. Ketone bodies do not
      normally circulate in the body unless it has been starving for a
      few days, or if one is on a very low-carb diet, such as Atkins.
      Dr. Newport explains, “In Alzheimer’s disease, the neurons in
      certain areas of the brain are unable to take in glucose due to
      insulin resistance, and slowly die off… if these cells had access
      to ketone bodies, they could potentially stay alive and continue
      to function.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Results</b><br>
      <br>
      To make a long story short, Dr. Newport started giving a daily
      dose of coconut oil to her husband, Steve. Just 60 days after he
      started taking it, Dr. Newport recalls that Steve was alert and
      happy, talkative and making jokes, and the tremor he’d developed
      was less noticeable. He was able to concentrate on one task
      instead of being easily distracted. Steve receives about 2
      tablespoons of coconut oil twice a day, to make sure that there
      are no periods where ketone bodies aren’t circulating.<br>
      <br>
      After a year of the natural treatment, Dr. Newport says her
      husband is a different person. She notes that he still has
      difficulty finding some words, but he recognized relatives on a
      family trip, participated actively in conversations, and his
      facial expressions were more animated.<br>
      <br>
      She adds, “For now, we are very pleased with where he is at and
      should coconut oil stop or slow down the progress of his disease,
      it will be worth every drop that he takes.”<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      The number of products containing probiotics, viable bacteria with
      proven health benefits, entering the market is increasing.
      Traditionally, probiotics have been associated with gut health,
      and most clinical interest has been focused on their use for
      prevention or treatment of gastrointestinal infections and
      diseases; however, during the last decade several investigators
      have also suggested the use of probiotics for oral health
      purposes. The aim of this review is to examine potential
      mechanisms of probiotic bacteria in the oral cavity and summarize
      observed effects of probiotics with respect to oral health. The
      review focuses on probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria,
      genera that are most used in various probiotic products.<br>

      Cranberry juice contains a chemical that blocks cavity-causing
      bacteria from sticking to teeth. Drinking some unsweetened
      cranberry juice during the day can reduce cavities.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Solar power 24/7 (at least if it
            rains) in breakthrough tech concept </b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      Super-thin graphene and solar panels are both great ideas, but
      combining them produces near-magical results. A group of
      researchers from the Ocean University of China in Qingdao has
      discovered what the wonder material can do for clean energy when
      introduced to water.<br>
      <br>
      For so long the world’s scientists were stumped as to how to
      extract the maximum potential from solar energy, which for obvious
      reasons is not available 24/7. The answer was found in the
      properties inherent in graphene, something scientists are still
      continuing to explore.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers posited that the world can easily extract energy
      using solar panels even when it’s raining, or during night time.
      This capability is achieved via a chemical reaction that happens
      when water drops are introduced to graphene.<br>

      <br>
      But not just any old water will do the trick. It's rain water that
      the researchers are after, because it consists of various other
      chemicals including salts, which can split up into positive and
      negative ions. The graphene sheets in place of ordinary panels
      separate the positively and negatively charged ions, thus
      generating electricity.<br>
      <br>
      To prove that the concept works, the scientists used a cheap thin
      dye-sensitized solar cell, then added a thin layer of graphene on
      top. The resulting sandwich was then placed atop a layer of indium
      tin oxide and plastic. The positively-charged ions then interact
      with the graphene, producing a double layer that contains the
      electrons. Now this top double layer begins to interact with the
      negatively-charged ions in the layer below. The charge difference
      between them is enough to create an electrical current.<br>
      <br>
      Using slightly salty water, the researchers achieved 6.53 percent
      efficiency during conversion from solar to electric power, and
      produced hundreds of microvolts.<br>
      <br>
      At the moment this is all still ‘proof of concept,’ but that’s
      arguably the most important part, as the Ocean University team
      sets out to refine and iron out quirks in the idea. They hope the
      technology will become ubiquitous in future, as well as contribute
      to speeding up policy changes in the sphere of renewable energy.<br>
      <br>
      The team is now analyzing rain water to uncover the variety of
      ions it contains and put them to use. This is not easy as they’re
      normally found in quite low concentrations, but progress is
      certainly being made.<br>
      <br>
      Wonder-material graphene was discovered less than a decade ago,
      and has already found its way into all sorts of everyday
      technologies. It earned wide renown thanks to its uncanny, bendy
      qualities. It’s also not the first time scientists have thought of
      using graphene for improvements in solar power generation – in
      fact, it's not even the first time this year.<br>
      <br>
      Earlier in 2016, British scientists arrived at a graphene-based
      material capable of storing ambient heat and light. This is a big
      leap, as we’ve only known solar panels to be effective in direct
      sunlight. This new concept, however, wants them to be practically
      anywhere and still capture and retain any indirect heat and light
      for future use.<br>

            The CDC’s Lies About Autism and Vaccines</b></big><br>
        <br>
        <b>By </b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Tami Canal </b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      I had the incredible opportunity this weekend to watch what I
      believe will ultimately end up being the most powerful documentary
      of our lifetimes, VAXXED: From Cover-up to Catastrophe.<br>
      <br>
      After seeing this deeply troubling film, I can honestly say that I
      am done.<br>
      <br>
      I am done trying to argue vaccine safety with people who
      vehemently trust information from someone strictly because they
      wear a lab coat. I am done trying to convince people how dangerous
      vaccine additives are and that carcinogens, genetically modified
      antigens and neurotoxins have no business being plunged into the
      muscle tissue of a developing child in the name of immunity from
      diseases that haven’t seen our shorelines since our grandparents
      were children. I am done trying to save those so blinded by Big
      Pharma talking points that they are willing to sacrifice their
      innocent children to the contents of a toxic syringe.<br>
      <br>
      What I am not done doing is voicing loudly the deep corruption
      that exists at the CDC. I am not done doing my part to expose how
      senior scientists have destroyed damaging research that would have
      jeopardized the billion dollar vaccine industry. The callous
      destruction of evidence that has literally destroyed countless
      lives calls into question every single safety assurance made by
      this agency. If the CDC blatantly lied about something as profound
      as an MMR/autism link, what else are they lying about? What other
      research has been destroyed at the expense of our children?<br>
      <br>
      VAXXED: From Cover-Up To Catastrophe focuses on recorded phone
      calls between Dr. Brian Hooker and Dr. William Thompson, a senior
      research scientist at the CDC, which reveal a high-ranking and
      well-respected research team destroyed critical evidence linking
      the MMR vaccine and autism. Dr. Thompson, unaware he is being
      recorded, provides in detail the lengths that were gone to hide
      the damaging research, asserting a secret meeting took place
      between the scientists, a trash can and the shocking findings.<br>
      <br>
      The film provides proof that Dr. Frank DeStephano (who runs the
      Vaccine Safety Division), Dr. Coleene Boyle (Director of the Birth
      Defects &amp; Developmental Disabilities Department), and former
      CDC director, Dr. Julie Gerberding (who is currently the executive
      vice president at pharmaceutical giant Merck) were involved in the
      literal destruction of research that proved an autism/MMR link,
      primarily in black children under the age of 3 who had as much as
      a 236% increase in the chance of developing autism following the
      common childhood vaccine.<br>
      <br>
      I certainly wasn’t able to watch without tears as undeniable proof
      is presented in the film that the CDC has known for over ten years
      that the MMR vaccine was more than just casually linked to the
      development of autism. I couldn’t help but cry for the countless
      lives who have been forever altered by the CDC’s allegiance to the
      pharmaceutical industry, no matter the cost to innocent children
      or their families.<br>
      <br>
      The film provides concrete video evidence of one child in
      particular who was severely damaged by the MMR vaccine. This
      sweet, blonde baby had reached all of his developmental
      milestones, and is documented on film laughing, running, smiling
      and interacting with his parents and sister. And then the MMR
      vaccine was administered. The footage following the vaccine
      portrays an entirely different child. The heartbreaking footage
      shows the toddler, who just days before was walking and even
      running, so confused that he can barely stand. He continues to try
      and stand repeatedly, only to take a couple steps, stumble and
      fall. Before the footage cuts off, you can see him try to walk on
      his head and hands, clearly frustrated and confused.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Andrew Wakefield narrates the film and should be regarded
      globally as a hero in an effort to save our children from the
      murderers running the CDC. Another thing I am done with is
      tolerating any mud-slinging or bashing of Dr. Wakefield. It is
      intolerable what the media and medical industry have done to this
      heroic man. I encourage you to learn the facts of the true story
      involving Dr. Wakefield. VAXXED does an amazing job of showing his
      courage despite the fact that so many have tried to destroy him
      for simply telling the truth. He believes the combination of the
      measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and the age that it is
      administered is what is of concern and actually states in his
      VAXXED interview that he believes the shots should be given
      individually. But as VAXXED documents, the CDC knows allowing
      children to be vaccinated in single doses would destroy the
      billion dollar vaccine program.<br>

      Anyone that wants to argue that Dr. Andrew Wakefield is
      “anti-vaccination” or a “quack” really needs to go do some
      independent research.<br>
      <br>
      The documentary is emotional and extremely well done. A portion of
      the movie focuses on the Hear This Well movement which came to be
      following a mainstream media attempt to overshadow vaccine dangers
      with a television anchorwoman ignorantly stating “Hear this well,
      vaccines do not cause autism.” VAXXED shows just a few of the
      numerous submissions to the Hear This Well campaign and it’s hard
      not to feel a lump in your throat at the emotional testimony of
      the parents of these innocent children who are now serving a life
      sentence with a disease that very likely could have been avoided
      if scientific integrity had been demonstrated.<br>
      <br>
      Regardless of your position on vaccination, the bottom line is
      that corruption exists at the CDC. This is an agency that is
      institutionally conflicted. Senior scientists are complicit and
      directly involved with the destruction of research that has harmed
      hundreds of thousands of lives. Instead of punishment for these
      heinous actions, promotions are doled out and everyone get richer.
      Regardless if you are of of the lucky ones, like myself, whose
      child wasn’t harmed by vaccines, the fact remains that there are
      children who have been harmed or killed. A vaccine injury court
      exists which uses tax payer dollars to compensate the families of
      babies and children who have been killed or damaged by vaccines.
      To remain neutral or even in denial to the fact that vaccines are
      hurting and killing children makes you complicit to the
      potentially civilization-ending epidemic we are facing. Regardless
      if your baby didn’t die following a round of vaccinations doesn’t
      mean that it hasn’t happened or that it won’t continue to happen
      as long as the CDC is allowed to get away with this blatant
      evidence tampering.<br>
      <br>
      The film also points to the fact that CDC
      scientist-turned-whistleblower Dr. Thompson has turned over all of
      this evidence to Congressman Bill Posey of Florida. Posey has had
      the information for over a year while doctors continue to inject
      children with this highly questionable vaccine and trick
      unsuspecting parents that vaccines are the greatest thing to
      modern medicine.<br>
      <br>
      Where is the congressional hearing? Where is the national
      attention to this life-destroying lie that has been told for over
      a decade? Where is the president? Where are the health officials
      demanding answers and accountability?<br>
      <br>
      I cannot express how deeply troubled I feel after seeing VAXXED. I
      don’t know how it is possible to see this film and not feel anger
      at a lie that has been perpetuated so the pharmaceutical industry
      could profit in the billions. I don’t know how someone could see
      this movie and not rethink and question every single assurance of
      safety ever made by their doctors. These are our children, for
      crying out loud! As parents, we are their protectors and it is up
      to us to make the best possible choices for their health. But how
      can we possibly do that when critical information is being kept
      from us?<br>
      <br>
      I encourage you to see this film before considering vaccination.
      It is important to realize that every vaccine-injured child has a
      parent who once trusted in vaccines. The film makes you realize
      that we are all fumbling around in the dark for answers because
      the truth is not what we have been told. VAXXED will have you
      rethinking everything when it comes to the health decisions of our
      most precious humans. Doctors are using the CDC’s research to
      practice medicine, treat patients and educate parents. The sooner
      you realize that everything your doctor has told you originates
      from the morally bankrupt CDC, the closer we will be to saving a
      soon-to-be lost generation.<br>

      The baby powder is usually found in every household, even when
      there is no baby. Most women use the talc-based powder because it
      makes the skin younger looking and soft. If you are one of them,
      you need to stop that. Baby powder, like that one from Johnson and
      Johnson, is increasing the risk by 33% of women of being diagnosed
      with ovarian cancer. The epidemiologist Dr. Daniel Cramer thinks
      that minimum 10,000 women get ovarian cancer because they use this
      baby powder every day.≥.<br>

      <br>
      Similar to dandelions and parsley, when dried out, crushed up
      cilantro absorbs metal from water, particularly lead and nickel.<br>
      <br>
      Both dangerous metals to have present in drinking water, lead and
      nickel are absorbed through cell walls of cilantro in a unique
      display of biosorption. It can be used in tea bags, which are
      placed in a pot of water for three minutes and then removed, or by
      stuffing it in a tube and dripping water through it (similar to a
      Britta filter). The lead researcher of a study taking place
      outside of Mexico City, Douglas Schauer, noted that a “handful of
      cilantro will nearly cleanse a pitcher full of highly contaminated
      water of its lead content.”<br>
      <br>
      This has proved a successful filter in areas around the world
      where the activated carbon filters, like those manufactured by
      Brita, are expensive, particularly in regions of rural farming.
      People can go grab some from the ground when a new filter is
      needed.<br>
      <br>
      More study is being done, including trying to find out if arsenic
      and mercury are absorbed by the herb as well and if there is some
      sort of “synergy” when multiple metals interact with the herb at
      once. <br>

      <div align="center"><b> <big>Rigord of Saint Denis Prophecy</big></b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The French chronicler Rigord of St. Denis lived in the 12th
      century. He wrote a prophetic text in Latin, which was later
      translated and printed by Fritz Baer. The following parts pertain
      to our future:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;"At that time from the sea will rise a very strong wind,
      which will strike terror in the hearts of men, and it will raise
      sand and dust from the surface of the earth, until it will cover
      the trees and the towers... And there will be heard in the air
      quakes and thunder and voices which will strike terror in the
      hearts of men, and all the countries will be covered with sand and
      dust... For that wind will rise from the west corner and reach
      until the west corner, encompassing all the countries of Egypt and
      Ethiopia... and also the lands of Rome. <br>
      <br>
      "After those events of the winds, five miracles will come to pass
      one after another.<br>
      "First, a most wise man will arise from the east, versed in secret
      wisdom, that is, in wisdom which is beyond man. And he will walk
      in justice and will teach the law of truth, and he will cause many
      to return to straight mores from the darkness of ignorance, and
      from unbelief to the way of truth, and he will instruct the
      sinners in the way of righteousness, and he will not pride himself
      with being counted among the prophets. <br>
      <br>
      "Secondly, a man will come forth from Elam and will assemble a
      multitude of great forces (Daniel 11:1), and will wage a great war
      against the nations (Zechariah 14), and he will not live long.<br>
      <br>
      "Thirdly, up will rise another man who will say that he is a
      prophet. He will hold a book in his hand and say that he was sent
      by God and by His prophets. And with his teachings he will cause
      many nations to go astray, and will seduce even more. But that
      which he will prophesy will come upon his own head. And he, too,
      will not live long. <br>
      <br>
      "Fourthly, a comet will be seen in heaven -- a star, that is, with
      a tail or appendage -- and this apparition will signify
      destructions and tumults and hard strifes, and withholding of
      rains, and dryness of the earth, and mighty battles, and the
      flowing of blood upon the earth of the east, and from beyond the
      River Habor it will reach to the very end of the west. And the
      just and the truly righteous will be oppressed and will suffer
      persecutions, and the house of prayer will be destroyed.<br>
      <br>
      "Fifthly, there will be an eclipse of the sun, like the color of
      fire, until the whole body of the sun will be obscured, and at the
      time of the eclipse there will such darkness over the earth as
      there is at midnight on those nights when there is no moonlight,
      in the days of the rains…"<br>

      <div align="center"><b> <big>The Last Prophecy of Peter Deunov (
            1944 )</big></b><big><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      "During the passage of time, the consciousness of man traversed a
      very long period of obscurity. This phase which the Hindus call
      "Kali Yuga", is on the verge of ending. We find ourselves today at
      the frontier between two epochs: that of Kali Yuga and that of the
      New Era that we are entering.<br>
      <br>
      A gradual improvement is already occurring in the thoughts,
      sentiments and acts of humans, but everybody will soon be
      subjugated to divine Fire, that will purify and prepare them in
      regards to the New Era. Thus man will raise himself to a superior
      degree of consciousness, indispensable to his entrance to the New
      Life. That is what one understands by "Ascension".<br>
      <br>
      Some decades will pass before this Fire will come, that will
      transform the world by bringing it a new moral. This immense wave
      comes from cosmic space and will inundate the entire earth. All
      those that attempt to oppose it will be carried off and
      transferred elsewhere.<br>
      <br>
      Although the inhabitants of this planet do not all find themselves
      at the same degree of evolution, the new wave will be felt by each
      one of us. And this transformation will not only touch the Earth,
      but the ensemble of the entire Cosmos.<br>
      <br>
      The best and only thing that man can do now is to turn towards God
      and improve himself consciously, to elevate his vibratory level,
      so as to find himself in harmony with the powerful wave that will
      soon submerge him.<br>
      <br>
      The Fire of which I speak, that accompanies the new conditions
      offered to our planet, will rejuvenate, purify, reconstruct
      everything: the matter will be refined, your hearts will be
      liberated from anguish, troubles, incertitude, and they will
      become luminous; everything will be improved, elevated; the
      thoughts, sentiments and negative acts will be consumed and
      destroyed.<br>
      <br>
      Your present life is a slavery, a heavy prison. Understand your
      situation and liberate yourself from it. I tell you this: exit
      from your prison! It is really sorry to see so much misleading, so
      much suffering, so much incapacity to understand where one's true
      happiness lies.<br>
      <br>
      Everything that is around you will soon collapse and disappear.
      Nothing will be left of this civilization nor its perversity; the
      entire earth will be shaken and no trace will be left of this
      erroneous culture that maintains men under the yoke of ignorance.
      Earthquakes are not only mechanical phenomena, their goal is also
      to awaken the intellect and the heart of humans, so that they
      liberate themselves from their errors and their follies and that
      they understand that they are not the only ones in the universe.<br>
      <br>
      Our solar system is now traversing a region of the Cosmos where a
      constellation that was destroyed left its mark, its dust. This
      crossing of a contaminated space is a source of poisoning, not
      only for the inhabitants of the earth, but for all the inhabitants
      of the other planets of our galaxy. Only the suns are not affected
      by the influence of this hostile environment. This region is
      called "the thirteenth zone"; one also calls it "the zone of
      contradictions". Our planet was enclosed in this region for
      thousands of years, but finally we are approaching the exit of
      this space of darkness and we are on the point of attaining a more
      spiritual region, where more evolved beings live.<br>
      <br>
      The earth is now following an ascending movement and everyone
      should force themselves to harmonize with the currents of the
      ascension. Those who refuse to subjugate themselves to this
      orientation will lose the advantage of good conditions that are
      offered in the future to elevate themselves. They will remain
      behind in evolution and must wait tens of millions of years for
      the coming of a new ascending wave.<br>
      <br>
      The earth, the solar system, the universe, all are being put in a
      new direction under the impulsion of Love. Most of you still
      consider Love as a derisory force, but in reality, it is the
      greatest of all forces! Money and power continue to be venerated
      as if the course of your life depended upon it. In the future, all
      will be subjugated to Love and all will serve it. But it is
      through suffering and difficulties that the consciousness of man
      will be awakened.<br>
      <br>
      The terrible predictions of the prophet Daniel written in the
      bible relate to the epoch that is opening. There will be floods,
      hurricanes, gigantic fires and earthquakes that will sweep away
      everything. Blood will flow in abundance. There will be
      revolutions; terrible explosions will resound in numerous regions
      of the earth. There where there is earth, water will come, and
      there where there is water, earth will come. God is Love; yet we
      are dealing here with a chastisement, a reply by Nature against
      the crimes perpetrated by man since the night of time against his
      Mother; the Earth.<br>
      <br>
      After these sufferings, those that will be saved, the elite, will
      know the Golden Age, harmony and unlimited beauty. Thus keep your
      peace and your faith when the time comes for suffering and terror,
      because it is written that not a hair will fall from the head of
      the just. Don't be discouraged, simply follow your work of
      personal perfection.<br>
      2<br>
      You have no idea of the grandiose future that awaits you. A New
      Earth will soon see day. In a few decades the work will be less
      exacting, and each one will have the time to consecrate spiritual,
      intellectual and artistic activities. The question of rapport
      between man and woman will be finally resolved in harmony; each
      one having the possibility of following their aspirations. The
      relations of couples will be founded on reciprocal respect and
      esteem. Humans will voyage through the different planes of space
      and breakthrough intergalactic space. They will study their
      functioning and will rapidly be able to know the Divine World, to
      fusion with the Head of the Universe.<br>
      <br>
      The New Era is that of the sixth race. Your predestination is to
      prepare yourself for it, to welcome it and to live it. The sixth
      race will build itself around the idea of Fraternity. There will
      be no more conflicts of personal interests; the single aspiration
      of each one will be to conform himself to the Law of Love. The
      sixth race will be that of Love. A new continent will be formed
      for it. It will emerge from the Pacific, so that the Most High can
      finally establish His place on this planet.<br>
      <br>
      The founders of this new civilization, I call them "Brothers of
      Humanity" or also "Children of Love" They will be unshakeable for
      the good and they will represent a new type of men. Men will form
      a family, as a large body, and each people will represent an organ
      in this body. In the new race, Love will manifest in such a
      perfect manner, that today's man can only have a very vague idea.<br>
      <br>
      The earth will remain a terrain favourable to struggle, but the
      forces of darkness will retreat and the earth will be liberated
      from them. Humans seeing that there is no other path will engage
      themselves to the path of the New Life, that of salvation. In
      their senseless pride, some will, to the end hope to continue on
      earth a life that the Divine Order condemns, but each one will
      finish by understanding that the direction of the world doesn't
      belong to them.<br>
      <br>
      A new culture will see the light of day, it will rest on three
      principal foundations: the elevation of woman, the elevation of
      the meek and humble, and the protection of the rights of man.<br>
      <br>
      The light, the good, and justice will triumph; it is just a
      question of time. The religions should be purified. Each contains
      a particle of the Teaching of the Masters of Light, but obscured
      by the incessant supply of human deviation. All the believers will
      have to unite and to put themselves in agreement with one
      principal, that of placing Love as the base of all belief,
      whatever it may be. Love and Fraternity that is the common base!<br>
      <br>
      The earth will soon be swept by extraordinary rapid waves of
      Cosmic Electricity. A few decades from now beings who are bad and
      lead others astray will not be able to support their intensity.
      They will thus be absorbed by Cosmic Fire that will consume the
      bad that they possess. Then they will repent because it is written
      that "each flesh shall glorify God".<br>
      <br>
      Our mother, the earth, will get rid of men that don't accept the
      New Life. She will reject them like damaged fruit. They will soon
      not be able to reincarnate on this planet; criminals included.
      Only those that possess Love in them will remain.<br>
      <br>
      There is not any place on earth that is not dirtied with human or
      animal blood; she must therefore submit to a purification. And it
      is for this that certain continents will be immersed while others
      will surface.<br>
      <br>
      Men do not suspect to what dangers they are menaced by. They
      continue to pursue futile objectives and to seek pleasure. On the
      contrary those of the sixth race will be conscious of the dignity
      of their role and respectful of each one's liberty. They will
      nourish themselves exclusively from products of the vegetal realm.
      Their ideas will have the power to circulate freely as the air and
      light of our days.<br>
      <br>
      The words "If you are not born again." apply to the sixth race.
      Read Chapter 60 of Isaiah it relates to the coming of the sixth
      race the Race of Love.<br>
      <br>
      After the Tribulations, men will cease to sin and will find again
      the path of virtue. The climate of our planet will be moderated
      everywhere and brutal variations will no longer exist. The air
      will once again become pure, the same for water. The parasites
      will disappear. Men will remember their previous incarnations and
      they will feel the pleasure of noticing that they are finally
      liberated from their previous condition.<br>
      <br>
      In the same manner that one gets rid of the parasites and dead
      leaves on the vine, so act the evolved Beings to prepare men to
      serve the God of Love. They give to them good conditions to grow
      and to develop themselves, and to those that want to listen to
      them, they say: "Do not be afraid! Still a little more time and
      everything will be all right; you are on the good path. May he
      that wants to enter in the New Culture study, consciously work and
      prepare."<br>
      <br>
      Thanks to the idea of Fraternity, the earth will become a blessed
      place, and that will not wait. But before, great sufferings will
      be sent to awaken the consciousness. Sins accumulated for
      thousands of years must be redeemed. The ardent wave emanating
      from On High will contribute in liquidating the karma of peoples.<br>
      <br>
      The liberation can no longer be postponed. Humanity must prepare
      itself for great trials that are inescapable and are coming to
      bring an end to egoism.<br>
      <br>
      Under the earth, something extraordinary is preparing itself. A

      A preservative chemical that's routinely added to hot dogs, beef
      jerky, bacon and breakfast sausage is now being deployed by
      government researchers as a fatal bait to poison wild hogs to
      death. Development of the deadly hog poison is being pursued by
      none other than the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the same
      agency that legalizes the same toxic chemical to be used in
      processed meat products approved for human consumption.<br>
      <br>
      The chemical, known as sodium nitrite, is a cancer-causing "color
      fixer" and meat preservative added to processed meat products to
      give them a pink hue that consumers mistake for being "fresh."
      When sodium nitrite combines with the hydrochloric acid (HCl)
      found in stomach acid, it forms cancer-causing nitrosamines. These
      nitrosamines go on to directly promote pancreatic cancer,
      colorectal cancer, leukemia, brain tumors and other cancers
      throughout the body -- facts that I have been warning readers
      about for over a decade. Sodium nitrite is the reason why
      processed meats drastically raise the risks of cancer, heart
      disease and diabetes...<br>
      <br>
      In the feral swine analysis published by the USDA, sodium nitrite
      is already labeled a "vertebrate pesticide" and its toxicological
      effects are described by the USDA as follows:<br>
      <br>
      In brief, [sodium] nitrite causes methemoglobinemia, which results
      in rapid depletion of oxygen to the brain and vital organs. Pigs
      are highly susceptible to this mode of action because they lack
      methemoglobin reductase, the naturally occurring enzyme required
      to reverse the toxicosis. Nitrite causes a rapid death in domestic
      pigs in approximately 1 hour (IMVS 2010) and in feral pigs in 1.5
      hours (Cowled et al. 2008a), with symptoms (detailed above)
      lasting less than 30 minutes (IMVS 2010). Nitrite toxicosis
      through methemoglobinemia has been independently assessed as
      humane (IMVS 2010)..<br>

      The Physical Units Factor Tables organize 50 types of physical
      units by their factors of length, time, mass and charge so that
      the mathematical relationships between physical units are easy to
      see. <br>
      <br>
      The Physical Units Factor Tables encourage anyone who can multiply
      and divide simple fractions to deduce equations in mechanics and
      electromagnetics .<br>
      <br>
      The single-page&nbsp; document is also marginally legible when
      printed in color on a single sheet of letter-size paper, but
      students and teachers with access to computers will likely find
      the electronic version easier on the eyes.<br>
      <br>
      Each move left represents multiplication by length, each move down
      is division by time ( = multiplication by frequency). Similarly,
      moving right represents division by length and each move up
      represents multiplying by time. These factors are the same in all
      tables in the stack, with each lower table having an additional
      factor:<br>
      light blue table = * mass<br>
      green table&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = * 1/charge<br>
      pink table&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = *
      mass/charge<br>
      purple table&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = * mass/charge^2<br>
      <br>
      The names of the unit types are taken from Alan Eliasen's
      wonderful&nbsp; calculator and physically-typed programming
      language, Frink. (Except for the ones whose top line is in
      parentheses; these names aren't listed in Frink, though it can

      <div align="center"><big><b>How bioceramics could help fight gum
            disease</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      Severe gum disease known as periodontitis can lead to tooth loss,
      and treating it remains a challenge. But new approaches involving
      silicon nitride, a ceramic material used in spinal implants, could
      be on the way. The surface of silicon nitride has a lethal effect
      on the bacteria that commonly cause periodontitis. Now scientists,
      reporting in ACS' journal Langmuir, are examining why this
      happens. Their findings could help inform future efforts to treat
      the disease.<br>
      <br>
      About half of American adults have some form of gum disease. It's
      caused by bacteria that infect the tissue around teeth, resulting
      in gum inflammation. If the condition progresses, the bacteria can
      damage the bone that supports the teeth. In addition to tooth
      loss, periodontitis can increase a person's risk of heart attack
      or stroke. Options for treatment include scaling and root planing,
      topical antibiotics and surgery. Giuseppe Pezzotti and colleagues
      wanted to find a new alternative by studying the reactions of
      bacteria to antimicrobial silicon nitride.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers investigated how the ceramic material changes the
      metabolism of Porphyromonas gingivalis -- the bacteria species
      primarily responsible for periodontitis. They found that chemical
      reactions at the surface cause the bacteria's nucleic acids to
      degrade and drastically reduce the amounts of certain proteins and
      fats. While further studies are needed, the results show silicon
      nitride holds promise as a therapeutic aid for treating severe gum
      disease.<br>

      Organisms of Gram-negative phylum bacteroidetes, Porphyromonas
      gingivalis, underwent lysis on polished surfaces of silicon
      nitride (Si3N4) bioceramics. The antibacterial activity of Si3N4
      was mainly the result of chemically driven principles. The lytic
      activity, although not osmotic in nature, was related to the
      peculiar pH-dependent surface chemistry of Si3N4. A buffering
      effect via the formation of ammonium ions (NH4+) (and their
      modifications) was experimentally observed by pH microscopy. Lysis
      was confirmed by conventional fluorescence spectroscopy, and the
      bacteria’s metabolism was traced with the aid of in situ Raman
      microprobe spectroscopy. This latter technique revealed the
      formation of peroxynitrite within the bacterium itself.
      Degradation of the bacteria’s nucleic acid, drastic reduction in
      phenilalanine, and reduction of lipid concentration were observed
      due to short-term exposure (6 days) to Si3N4. Altering the surface
      chemistry of Si3N4 by either chemical etching or thermal oxidation
      influenced peroxynitrite formation and affected bacteria
      metabolism in different ways. Exploiting the peculiar surface
      chemistry of Si3N4 bioceramics could be helpful in counteracting
      Porphyromonas gingivalis in an alkaline pH environment.<br>

            by Decoding the Past</b></big><br>
        <br>
        <i>At Predata, an Internet-scraping algorithm provides a glimpse
          of the future.</i><i><br>
        </i></div>
      <b> </b><br>
      When James Shinn was working for the CIA as a senior East Asia
      expert more than a decade ago, he longed for the tools of a
      weatherman. He wanted to be able to predict that the chance of
      North Korea test-firing a missile within a month was, say, 60
      percent. It remained a fantasy, he says, until now.<br>
      <br>
      Shinn and his 14-person team at Predata have developed software
      that numerically describes political volatility and risk. It
      vacuums up vast quantities of data from online conversations and
      comments, compares them with past patterns, and spits out a
      probability. (A version of Predata’s service is accessible on the
      Bloomberg Professional service.) Shinn likens his product to
      sabermetrics, the statistics-driven baseball strategy popularized
      in Michael Lewis’s Moneyball. “By carefully gathering lots and
      lots of statistics on their past performance from all corners of
      the Internet, we are predicting how a large number of players on a
      team will bat or pitch in the future,” Shinn says, by way of
      analogy.<br>
      <br>
      Predata doesn’t replace human analysts so much as offer them a new
      tool. Without people choosing what to follow, metadata scraping
      has limited use. Moreover, Shinn argues, while risk-analysis
      companies are increasingly offering clients numerical percentages,
      the data are often pulled from the air. “This is a machine-driven,
      carefully calculated risk index,” says Shinn, the company’s
      founder and chief executive officer. “There is no arbitrary
      scoring by a human analyst.”<br>
      <br>
      Each day, Predata monitors about 1,000 Twitter feeds, 10,000
      Wikipedia pages, 50,000 YouTube videos, and several dozen
      newspapers and magazines in some 200 countries. It covers 300
      topics, including news about individual companies, the debate over
      the U.K. leaving the European Union, and interest rate decisions
      by central banks.<br>
      <br>
      Historical data is paramount. For instance, Predata didn’t make a
      statistically useful prediction for the March 22 attacks in
      Brussels, in part because Belgium had experienced few such
      incidents. The software needs at least five previous events to
      find a correlation between digital conversations and an act of
      terrorism, according to Shinn. France, on the other hand, had
      witnessed 13 incidents prior to the Paris attacks on Nov. 13; the
      company says that its model indicated the likelihood of an event
      being at least 61 percent a month in advance. Similarly, on Dec.
      27, Predata says it calculated a 68 percent chance that North
      Korea would engage in some activity regarding weapons of mass
      destruction within 45 days. Almost two weeks later, on Jan. 6, the
      Kim Jong Un regime conducted the nation’s fourth nuclear test.<br>
      <br>
      Shinn, who served as an assistant secretary for East Asia at the
      U.S. Department of Defense after his CIA stint, began developing
      the technology in 2014 while teaching at his alma mater,
      Princeton, and serving on the advisory board of Kensho
      Technologies, an analytics software developer for investment
      management. Kensho’s CEO, Daniel Nadler, and Shinn experimented in
      their free time with a crude prototype that monitored online
      conversations among labor unions in South Africa, thinking the
      data offered a handle on the country’s volatility. They found that
      back-and-forth argumentation in English and Afrikaans on sites as
      public as the Wikipedia pages of the unions spiked before mining
      strikes, after which gold and platinum prices surged.<br>
      <br>
      Shinn recruited one of his students, Andrew Choi, to build a more
      sophisticated algorithm, a part of which used a specification
      devised by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity,
      an organization that leads research into innovative technology
      under the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
      “Predata is now sampling a larger, more complex pattern before and
      after events,” Choi says. “We are characterizing larger patterns
      of behavior by many people on the Internet and then looking for
      the recurrence of these patterns as ‘early warning’ that an event
      of that type is about to recur.”<br>
      <br>
      Choi, now Predata’s chief technology officer, says the company can
      draw direct links from digital conversations to geopolitical
      volatility, and from there to collective actions such as strikes,
      protests, and troop movements. There was a surge of comments
      posted to news articles about Russia and Ukraine before Russia’s
      invasion of Crimea, for example, and a sharp rise in participants
      conversing on the French-language Wikipedia page for Islamic State
      before the Paris attacks. “There is a characteristic way that the
      narrative of a certain event is constructed before and after that
      event has taken place,” he says.<br>
      <br>
      As the activity intensifies, Predata gathers the metadata—such as
      how many people edit a Wikipedia page about a terrorist attack and
      how quickly those edits are disputed—and retroactively matches the
      statistical signals against sets of historical events to predict
      the likelihood of similar events, Shinn says. “The Russians spend
      a lot of time and money molding the narrative about Russian
      intentions and actions, and the guys in Beijing do the same about
      the South China Sea.” The result, he says, is that actors leave
      footprints; their propaganda interests trump their desire for
      operational security.<br>
      <br>
      Governments started using the first computational models in World
      War II to decode German messages and automate the targeting of
      anti-aircraft weapons. In the 1960s, corporations and research
      institutions began commercializing models for a variety of uses,
      from deciding credit risk to predicting the weather. The business
      has evolved into hundreds of companies pursuing three general
      approaches to managing risk and volatility: prioritizing new and
      better sources of data, focusing on better ways to condense data,
      and combining the two to forecast probability. Microsoft
      co-founder Paul Allen invested in Seattle-based BlackSky Global,
      which plans to launch a fleet of 60 satellites next year to scan
      most of the planet as many as 70 times a day. San Francisco-based
      Spaceknow combines the imagery of more than 6,000 industrial
      facilities with algorithms to create an index of China’s factory
      production. Companies such as Banjo, Cytora, and Dataminr monitor
      social media and the Internet to track events as close to real
      time as possible. They specialize in detecting riots or protests
      as soon as they’re reported on the Web, alerting clients to
      developments and making the information easily digestible.<br>
      <br>
      Predata is alone so far in producing an algorithm-generated
      forecasting metric. The company is already broadening its
      findings, applying them to equity indexes, foreign exchange rates,
      commodities, and credit-default-swap spreads, and it says it’s
      found a correlation between the signals it measures and prices of
      various assets. Predata also tracks chatter about YouTube videos
      of central bank governors’ press conferences to predict rate
      decisions.<br>
      <br>
      Kalev Leetaru, a senior fellow at George Washington University,
      started the GDELT Project in 2013, a free, publicly available
      database of all the world's media in print, broadcast and web
      formats in more than 100 languages, stretching back from Jan. 1,
      1979 to present day. GDELT uses more than 40 algorithms to
      translate into English and process metadata from the media into
      tables, allowing individuals and organizations to run customized
      risk analytics. It also provides a real-time timeline measuring
      instability in countries, Leetaru said, adding that GDELT plans to
      roll out a series of prototype templates later this year,
      forecasting risk by location and type of volatile events.<br>
      <br>
      One risk to Predata’s approach is the potential of being gamed by
      a savvy hostile party. Shinn and Choi argue, however, that the
      Internet’s “democratic checks and balances” and abundance of data
      points will keep Predata’s technology relatively safe from
      attempts to fool it. Says Choi, “It’s not even that you are trying
      to talk about a topic in a favorable light. It’s that you are
      talking about that topic at all—that’s a signal.”<br>

      <br>
      Cycle analyst Bo Polny says the time it takes the stock market to
      hit bottom from its prior top is getting shorter. The 2007 top to
      the 2009 bottom in the stock market took a little less than two
      years. The latest top happened in July of 2015, and Polny says
      this top to bottom crash will take half the time of the last
      crash. Polny predicts, “The next bottom will happen between now
      and this coming August. . . . This is going to be Biblically bad .
      . . . You are going to have a day where the Dow might drop 4,000
      points . . . the next turn is going to be a crash low, and that’s
      supposed to come in the next few months. Being long in the market
      is crazy. We keep having lower highs. . . . Being long in the
      market is extremely dangerous.”<br>
      <br>
      Polny closed by pointing out, “The reason for the crash will be
      because gold and silver will be exploding higher. That is going to
      create a huge derivative issue. That, then in turn, triggers the
      collapse and the meltdown of the stock market.”<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      ...In January 1999, an international team led by [ Carl ] Collins
      claimed it had unleashed startling amounts of energy -- far more
      than theoretically expected - - from the hafnium-178 isomer. They
      did so, they reported in the journal Physical Review Letters, by
      bombarding the isotope with X-rays from an ordinary dental X-ray
      machine.<br>
      <br>
      Besides Collins, the article's 13 co-authors included scientists
      at the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory in Albuquerque; Russia's
      Joint Institute for Nuclear Research; and Sandia National
      Laboratories, a nuclear weapons lab in New Mexico. Collins himself
      has a weighty reputation. A decade earlier, the Texas Academy of
      Sciences had named him "Distinguished Texas Scientist" of the year
      for his research on high-energy lasers.<br>
      <br>
      Elsewhere, other scientists tried to replicate Collins' work by
      bombarding the isotope with radiation from large particle
      accelerators, which are far more powerful than the Collins team's
      dental X-ray machine. Results: negative.<br>
      <br>
      One of Collins' original collaborators on the 1999 paper, nuclear
      physicist James Carroll of Youngstown State University, has since
      been unable to replicate the Collins experiment on his own. He
      suspects the energy-unleashing process "is more complex than
      (Collins) originally thought and needs further study," Carroll
      said in an interview.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, scientists from Lawrence Livermore National
      Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory and Argonne National
      Laboratory found "no evidence" of unusual energy emissions from
      hafnium-178 exposed to X-rays at Argonne's hefty Advanced Photon
      Source accelerator, they reported in Physical Review Letters in
      2001.<br>
      <br>
      The hafnium-178 controversy was also investigated by the members
      of "Jason, " which has functioned for decades as a kind of supreme
      advisory council of military science. Mostly distinguished
      physical scientists based at universities and private companies,
      these scholars -- often collectively known as "the Jasons" -- use
      their expertise to critique the Pentagon's more ambitious schemes
      for expensive, futuristic weapons.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CLAIMS CHALLENGED</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Claims that hafnium-178 can unleash intense energy are based on
      experiments that are "poorly characterized and ill-described,"
      Jason member Steve Koonin wrote in 1999, summarizing the group's
      findings in a letter to the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament
      Agency. The claims are "a priori implausible -- extraordinary
      claims demand extraordinary proof," but that's lacking so far,
      added Koonin, a nuclear physicist and provost of the California
      Institute of Technology.<br>
      <br>
      "It is extraordinarily unlikely that there is something here" that
      portends a new generation of futuristic weapons, Koonin said in a
      phone interview. However, he noted that Collins and others have
      reported new results since 1999, and that he'd support a new Jason
      analysis if the Pentagon or Energy Department requested it.<br>
      <br>
      Collins has stuck to his guns. In a number of e-mail responses to
      a Chronicle inquiry, he compared the critics to early 20th century
      naysayers who denied the feasibility of atomic energy.<br>
      <br>
      Collins insists his findings have "been confirmed at about all of
      the world's third-generation (most advanced) synchrotron radiation
      sources, except the DOE facility at Argonne. . . . Naturally, that
      causes controversy, but it is a strength of the scientific method
      that continued study and measurement will resolve the
      controversy."<br>
      <br>
      One reason some critics have been unable to verify his original
      claim, Collins said, is that their instrument was "blind" to one
      of the spectral lines, the so-called 130 line, that he used in
      measuring energy from hafnium- 178. Hence, "they could not
      possibly have seen the results" even "if they had succeeded in
      doing it."<br>
      <br>
      But physicist John Becker of Lawrence Livermore said that to the
      best of his knowledge, no scientist has verified Collins' claim
      except Pat McDaniel, a researcher at Sandia who was one of
      Collins' original collaborators. McDaniel has not published his
      results, Becker said. McDaniel could not be reached for an
      interview.<br>
      <br>
      "I don't think there's any controversy at all: We've done two
      experiments, and we cannot reproduce his (Collins') results,"
      Becker said in an interview. The Becker team has used instruments
      that are "a hundred thousand times more sensitive" than Collins'
      dental X-ray machine, and "in spite of our best efforts, we cannot
      reproduce those results."<br>
      <br>
      The Pentagon isn't discouraged by skeptics' doubts about the
      hafnium-178 isomer. In fact, it's trying to figure out how to mass
      produce the stuff. According to one knowledgeable source who
      insisted on anonymity, a full-scale hafnium-178 facility, if
      approved, "would probably (cost) tens to hundreds of millions of
      dollars."<br>
      <br>
      At one Pentagon Web site, dubbed the Military Critical
      Technologies List, under the section titled "Armaments and
      Energetic Materials," the text explains that hafnium-178's
      reported "extraordinary energy density has the potential to
      revolutionize all aspects of warfare."<br>
      <br>
      Recently, amid their post-Iraq-war anxieties over U.S. military
      and foreign policy, European media have sounded an alarm about
      possible hafnium-178 weapons. New Scientist, a respected popular
      science journal in England, ran a story on Aug. 13 declaring,
      "Gamma-ray Weapons Could Trigger Next Arms Race."<br>
      <br>
      By coincidence, that same day, five members of the HIPP panel and
      10 other experts signed a letter to federal officials citing "the
      numerous objections raised by the (Jasons) and others over any
      projected use of the hafnium isomer. " The letter urged the
      officials to launch an independent scientific review of the
      subject "before proceeding to study (military) applications that
      may not make physical sense." <br>

          ALERTS FOR, AND CENSORS CONSERVATIVE AND ANTI NWO ARTICLES</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>By </b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Jim Kouri</b><br>
        <b>NWV Senior Political News Writer</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Visitors to conservative web sites may encounter problems
      accessing news stories and political commentary regarding the
      Republican Party, conservative issues and pro-Donald Trump
      postings thanks to a major Internet search engine company that
      also controls a top web browser that's successfully competing with
      Microsoft, Firefox, Safari and others.<br>
      <br>
      According to a number of subscribers and readers of the
      conservative Internet publication, NewsWithViews.com, readers are
      being falsely informed by a popular web browser, Google Chrome,
      that "malware" exists on the web site, specifically columns that
      address political and social issues from a conservative or
      libertarian perspective, according to several writers and the
      editor at NWV.<br>
      <br>
      Readers attempting to access NWV content were met by warnings that
      falsely claimed "malware" that was hazardous to personal computers
      existed on the web site. A number of emails were received by the
      NWV editor complaining about the problem and saying they were
      fearful of damaging their desktop or laptop computers by accessing
      news stories and opinion columns.<br>
      <br>
      For example, one of the top columnists, Kelleigh Nelson, who
      frequently writes on political issues had problems with readers
      not being able to access her opinion pieces appearing on NWV.
      Kelleigh is 100% pro Trump.<br>
      <br>
      "A number of my readers [had] emailed me that when they tried to
      access my archived articles, a malware warning would always pop
      up. All of them were using Google Chrome when this happened," said
      Nelson. "I immediately alerted Paul Walter, Senior Editor of
      NewsWithViews.com, and he did a virus check. Nothing showed as
      being malware within any of my archived articles."<br>
      <br>
      Ms. Nelson believes that Google Chrome covertly putting these
      malware warnings on every article they politically disagree with,
      and she believes that NewsWithViews is not the only target. There
      are other websites being targeted, including The Marshall Report,
      and The Conservative Tree House. "If you want the truth in these
      and other articles, then use any other search engine and the
      articles and websites will come up, just not with Google Chrome,"
      said Kelleigh Nelson<br>
      <br>
      Following a lengthy investigation by the NWV editor, Paul Walter,
      it was confirmed that the "malware alerts" were the product of
      only one web browser: Google Chrome. All of the complaints
      regarding "malware alerts" were generated by readers who were
      Chrome browser users. Those readers using the other Internet
      browsers such as Firefox, Safari, Explorer, and other popular
      browsers were not experiencing this suspected form of censorship.<br>
      <br>
      "It appears that Google Chrome is the only browser suspected of
      deceptive political activity that benefits the Democratic Party
      especially in this heated [presidential] election cycle," said
      political consultant and attorney Michael Baker. "In fact, other
      web sites are experiencing similar problems and they all trace
      them to Google Chrome."<br>
      <br>
      Baker said that reputable news and information web sites such as
      Breitbart's series of web pages and the Conservative Base are also
      experiencing the same problems with Google Chrome. "It's a safe
      bet that if it's happening to these top sites, it's probably
      happening to the lesser-known sites with fewer visitors," he said.<br>
      <br>
      When NWV senior editor Paul Walter received complaints from both
      readers and some columnists about the suspected malware hoax, he
      contacted his Internet hosting company on March 10, 2016 located
      in Los Angeles and N.J. for a complete examination of the
      NewsWithViews.com web site and their dedicated server. The company
      reported conducting full scans and exams of NWV and found no
      evidence of there being any type of malware or virus within the
      system. NWV was given a clean-bill-of-health by the hosting
      company and yet, the complaints kept pouring in from all over the
      country about the malwere problem that didn't exist. <br>
      <br>
      Walter said "I'm almost 100% certain that you won't be able to
      find this news article on the Google search engine."<br>
      <br>
      In the case of another web site experiencing the exact same
      problem with malware alerts where there were none, Conservative
      Base which coincidentally, like NWV, supports the candidacy of GOP
      presidential hopeful Donald Trump.<br>
      <br>
      The Conservative Base’s webmaster, Ben Thole, also conducted virus
      scans and the like and also found there were no problems with the
      web site or the server. Thole is an experienced web site designer
      and webmaster who has worked for the Republican Party, celebrities
      and companies that require first-rate Internet coverage.<br>
      <br>
      Besides the Chrome browser, when Internet users are conducting a
      search with Google’s search engine they are warned that the web
      site itself may harm your computer.<br>
      <br>
      This is an actual example of those insidious messages that are
      designed to detour visitors to other web sites: ***<br>
      <br>
      NewsWithViews.com columnist, Ron Ewart, President of the National
      Association of Rural Landowners, when he discovered the activities
      of Google, launched his own action against the media giant.<br>
      <br>
      During a telephone conversation with this reporter, Mr. Ewart
      mentioned his own investigation and a column he will have
      published by NWV that reveals the political ties between the
      Democrat Party and the Google founders, Larry Page and Eric
      Schmidt. He also reports that there are thousands of Google
      employees who are also in cahoots with the Democrats:<br>
      <br>
      “Few Silicon Valley companies have ever embraced a political party
      as passionately as Google has. Its executive chairman, Eric
      Schmidt, has been described as a "kind of guru" to President
      Obama's campaign manager, and Google employees emerged as the No.
      2 donor to the Democratic National Committee in the last
      election,” stated Ewart.<br>
      <br>
      Ewart also mentioned during the telephone interview with this NWV
      reporter that the Google Chrome Malware Alerts suddenly appeared
      on conservative articles right after Donald Trump, during a
      televised rally with 20-thousand cheering supporters, held up an
      article from the NewsWithViews.com website that verified he
      assertion about media bias and the NWV website received an
      astounding 1,000,000 hits in just one day.<br>
      <br>
      Efforts by NWV to contact Google and discuss these serious
      allegations met with negative results. The person who only gave
      the name “Heather” said the Google browser is not involved in
      politics.<br>
      <br>
      However, Ron Ewart wrote a thorough letter to the Google
      executives Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, which he plans to publish
      on NewsWithViews.com.<br>
      <br>
      “I hope conservatives will start to take action,” said Ewart. “The
      whole political system is corrupted and people must awaken and
      take action before ‘malware alerts’ will be the least of their
      problems,” he added.<br>
      <br>
      Besides the covert activities suspected, a new Google Chrome
      “extension” allows users to scrub mentions and photos of Donald
      Trump from their browsing experience. Trump Filter is a Chrome
      extension that searches websites for references to the Republican
      presidential candidate and replaces it with a blank space.<br>
      <br>
      “Eliminate Donald Trump from all your web browsing without leaving
      the Internet,” a description for Trump Filter boasts. “In a
      political atmosphere where ascendance can be manufactured through
      attention, the only way to deflate Trump’s political star is
      through suffocation. Trump can only lose if we turn off the TV.<br>
      <br>
      “Thus, the Trump Filter is presented as part of the antidote for
      this toxic candidacy. This Chrome extension will identify parts of
      a web page likely to contain Donald Trump and erase them from the
      Internet. Share with your friends and eliminate the only currency
      Trump can spend to win: brand recognition,” the description reads.<br>
      <br>
      “I hope folks will take this opportunity to learn more about the
      wide field of candidates out there,” Mr. Spectre told CNN.<br>

      Ferromagnetic properties allow electric current to flow over the
      surface of special films but normally only under very low
      temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      Something of great importance is that this electric current is
      generated spontaneously and without any kind of external magnetic
      field – electric current without magnetism.<br>
      <br>
      Using Cr as an atomic sized magnet and Sb and Te to&nbsp; help
      “glue” their alignment into place, apparently allows this electric
      current to be not only lossless but at room temperature.<br>

      <br>
      Former DARPA Senior Scientist, Dr. Paul Batcho, asserts that cell
      phone towers pose an intentional and immediate lethal threat
      against the general public of the United States…<br>
      <br>
      I would like to bring to your attention an ongoing threat with
      regards to harmful communications transmitting from the cellular
      towers in central Florida, and Tampa St Petersburg. It is not
      clear to me whether it is due to the USCENTCOM in Tampa or it is
      targeting US civilians…<br>
      <br>
      I seem to have stumbled across an advanced technology that I would
      classify as synthetic telepathy. It clearly uses the cellular
      towers to transmit illegal signals. It sounds unbelievable but it
      is actual technology being used on civilians of the US.<br>
      <br>
      My basic research does indicate that such technology can exist and
      dates back to the V2K (P300) mind wave technology of the 1970s.
      This does appear to be a much more advanced version that allows
      open communication of human mind to mind bridges.<br>
      <br>
      Please forward my email to the appropriate DoD security office and
      I would like the issue investigated. Human brains appear to
      transmit and receive at the RF bands around 450MHz and microwave
      transmissions can be highly damaging in turns of induced
      bio-effects...<br>
      <br>
      The technology being used is clearly based on the methods outlined
      in the following patents based on microwave transmission directed
      at human brain frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      The active technology has been in use for approximately 3 1/2
      years, roughly corresponding to the expiry of the 1992 and 1994
      patents funded by DARPA, US Patent # 5,123,844 &amp; US Patent #
      5,289,438.<br>
      <br>
      These systems stimulate the brain with RF frequencies and wave
      forms.This is not CDMA 450MHz:450MHz-470MHz transmissions.<br>
      <br>
      There is unlawful use of the various lethal aspects of the
      technology.&nbsp; The technology is active and civilians are being
      targeted with harmful health effects.<br>
      <br>
      Please investigate the transmission of the various frequency
      signals in the 450 MHz range. The band from 437MHz to 478Mhz with
      peaks at roughly 6 MHz intervals appear to have sizable spectral
      energy components.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Anecdotal and clinical reports have suggested that radio-frequency
      electromagnetic fields (RF EMFs) may serve as a trigger for
      neuropathic pain. However, these reports have been widely
      disregarded, as the epidemiological effects of electromagnetic
      fields have not been systematically proven, and are highly
      controversial. Here, we demonstrate that anthropogenic RF EMFs
      elicit post-neurotomy pain in a tibial neuroma transposition
      model. Behavioral assays indicate a persistent and significant
      pain response to RF EMFs when compared to SHAM surgery groups.
      Laser thermometry revealed a transient skin temperature increase
      during stimulation. Furthermore, immunofluorescence revealed an
      increased expression of temperature sensitive cation channels
      (TRPV4) in the neuroma bulb, suggesting that RF EMF-induced pain
      may be due to cytokine-mediated channel dysregulation and
      hypersensitization, leading to thermal allodynia. Additional
      behavioral assays were performed using an infrared heating lamp in
      place of the RF stimulus. While thermally-induced pain responses
      were observed, the response frequency and progression did not
      recapitulate the RF EMF effects. In vitro calcium imaging
      experiments demonstrated that our RF EMF stimulus is sufficient to
      directly contribute to the depolarization of dissociated sensory
      neurons. Furthermore, the perfusion of inflammatory cytokine TNF-α
      resulted in a significantly higher percentage of active sensory
      neurons during RF EMF stimulation. These results substantiate
      patient reports of RF EMF-pain, in the case of peripheral nerve
      injury, while confirming the public and scientific consensus that
      anthropogenic RF EMFs engender no adverse sensory effects in the
      general population.<br>

      Landmark preclinical study cured lung metastases in 50 percent of
      breast cancers by making nanoparticles inside the tumor<br>
      <br>
      A team of investigators from Houston Methodist Research Institute
      may have transformed the treatment of metastatic triple negative
      breast cancer by creating the first drug to successfully eliminate
      lung metastases in mice. This landmark study appears today in
      Nature Biotechnology (early online edition).<br>
      <br>
      The majority of cancer deaths are due to metastases to the lung
      and liver, yet there is no cure. Existing cancer drugs provide
      limited benefit due to their inability to overcome biological
      barriers in the body and reach the cancer cells in sufficient
      concentrations. Houston Methodist nanotechnology and cancer
      researchers have solved this problem by developing a drug that
      generates nanoparticles inside the lung metastases in mice.<br>
      <br>
      In this study, 50 percent of the mice treated with the drug had no
      trace of metastatic disease after eight months. That’s equivalent
      to about 24 years of long-term survival following metastatic
      disease for humans. <br>
      <br>
      Due to the body’s own defense mechanisms, most cancer drugs are
      absorbed into healthy tissue causing negative side effects, and
      only a fraction of the administered drug actually reaches the
      tumor, making it less effective, said Mauro Ferrari, Ph.D,
      president and CEO of the Houston Methodist Research Institute.
      This new treatment strategy enables sequential passage of the
      biological barriers to transport the killing agent into the heart
      of the cancer. The active drug is only released inside the nucleus
      of the metastatic disease cell, avoiding the multidrug resistance
      mechanism of the cancer cells. This strategy effectively kills the
      tumor and provides significant therapeutic benefit in all mice,
      including long-term survival in half of the animals. <br>
      <br>
      This finding comes 20 years after Ferrari started his work in
      nanomedicine. Ferrari and Haifa Shen, M.D., Ph.D., are co-senior
      authors on the paper, which describes the action of the injectable
      nanoparticle generator (iNPG), and how a complex method of
      transporting a nano-version of a standard chemotherapy drug led to
      never before seen results in mice models with triple negative
      breast cancer that had metastasized to the lungs.<br>
      <br>
      “This may sound like science fiction, like we’ve penetrated and
      destroyed the Death Star, but what we discovered is
      transformational. We invented a method that actually makes the
      nanoparticles inside the cancer and releases the drug particles at
      the site of the cellular nucleus. With this injectable
      nanoparticle generator, we were able to do what standard
      chemotherapy drugs, vaccines, radiation, and other nanoparticles
      have all failed to do,” said Ferrari. <br>
      <br>
      Houston Methodist has developed good manufacturing practices (GMP)
      for this drug and plans to fast-track the research to obtain
      FDA-approval and begin safety and efficacy studies in humans in
      2017.<br>
      <br>
      “I would never want to overpromise to the thousands of cancer
      patients looking for a cure, but the data is astounding,” said
      Ferrari, senior associate dean and professor of medicine, Weill
      Cornell Medicine. “We’re talking about changing the landscape of
      curing metastatic disease, so it’s no longer a death sentence.”<br>
      <br>
      The Houston Methodist team used doxorubicin, a cancer therapeutic
      that has been used for decades but has adverse side effects to the
      heart and is not an effective treatment against metastatic
      disease. In this study, doxorubicin was packaged within the
      injectable nanoparticle generator that is made up of many
      components. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Shen, a senior member of the department of nanomedicine at Houston
      Methodist Research Institute, explains that each component has a
      specific and essential role in the drug delivery process. The
      first component is the nanoporous silicon material that naturally
      degrades in the body. The second component is a polymer made up of
      multiple strands that contain doxorubicin. Once inside the tumor,
      the silicon material degrades, releasing the strands. Due to
      natural thermodynamic forces, these strands curl-up to form
      nanoparticles that are taken up by the cancer cells. Once inside
      the cancer cells, the acidic pH close to the nucleus causes the
      drug to be released from the nanoparticles. Inside the nucleus,
      the active drug acts to kill the cell. <br>
      <br>
      “If this research bears out in humans and we see even a fraction
      of this survival time, we are still talking about dramatically
      extending life for many years. That’s essentially providing a cure
      in a patient population that is now being told there is none,”
      said Ferrari, who holds the Ernest Cockrell Jr. Presidential
      Distinguished Chair and is considered one of the founders of
      nanomedicine and oncophysics (physics of mass transport within a
      cancer lesion). <br>
      <br>
      The Houston Methodist team is hopeful that this new drug could
      help cancer physicians cure lung metastases from other origins,
      and possibly primary lung cancers as well.<br>

            Russian company says it has revolutionized cancer treatment</big></b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><br>
      Russian pharmaceutical group Biocad has introduced a breakthrough
      new cancer drug, with early tests suggesting it is more effective
      in battling the disease than foreign analogues, the company says.<br>
      <br>
      The new drug activates inner powers to fight cancer, the company’s
      press release said. It was created on the base of monoclonal
      antibodies, and blocks interactions between the proteins PD-1 and
      PD-L1, which mask tumor cells as healthy ones. After the
      neutralization of PD-1, the organism starts to recognize cancer
      cells and eliminate them.<br>
      <br>
      “The development of drugs for immunotherapy is an innovational
      approach to curing oncological diseases,” said Roman Ivanov,
      Deputy CEO for Biomedical Studies and Development, according to a
      press release published on Biocad’s website.<br>
      <br>
      “Such drugs have a systematic effect on the whole tumor process,
      destroying not only the tumor itself but also its metastases
      including remote ones,” he added, stressing that unlike
      chemotherapy, such treatment does not damage healthy body tissue.<br>
      <br>
      There are currently only two anti-cancer medicines based on
      monoclonal antibodies – developed by MSD and Bristol-Myers Sqibb –
      but both of them are not available in Russia. Moreover, clinical
      tests revealed that Biocad’s drug is more effective than its
      foreign analogues, the company claimed.<br>
      <br>
      Biocad researchers hope that their drug will allow the survival
      rates of metastatic stage melanoma patients to increase from 10 to
      30-40 percent. They also believe the treatment will be effective
      against lung and renal (kidney) cell cancer.<br>
      <br>
      Preliminary tests were conducted on primates, and were carried out
      all last year, the company’s press release said.<br>
      <br>
      Currently, the new drug is being prepared for clinical tests, with
      cancer patients from all over the world set to take part. Russians
      would be the first to have access to the breakthrough therapy, and
      the treatment should become available in 2018-2019, researchers
      say.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers across the world are searching for effective cancer
      treatment, and have offered various methods of fighting the deadly
      disease. Last May UK scientists said they had created a modified
      herpes-based virus that can kill cancer cells. In January
      Australian researchers said they had successfully tested a drug
      targeting protein that helps cancer cells survive.<br>

      <b> </b><br>
      A "flu trap" that captures viruses could help prevent the spread
      of infection, scientists claim.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers at the University of Manchester have developed a
      fabric coating for masks and air filters that isolates the viral
      particles responsible for influenza.<br>
      <br>
      The technology mimics carbohydrate structures on the surfaces of
      cells lining respiratory airways and the oesophagus, or food pipe.<br>
      <br>
      Paul Hope, director of the biotec company Virustatic that is
      seeking to commercialise the idea, said: "It's a whole new
      preventative approach to disease and if implemented could be
      transformative."<br>
      <br>
      "We're now at the stage where we're looking for strategic partners
      to take this technology forwards in terms of developing new
      products."<br>
      <br>
      The team found a way to anchor sugary glycoproteins first to
      carbon cloth and then cheaper materials such as cotton.<br>
      <br>
      The molecules were able to capture and trap more than 99% of the
      flu viruses that came into contact with them.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Ian Rowles, from the University of Manchester, said: "This has
      been an exciting collaboration with Virustatic, and our research
      does indeed show that this technology can slow the spread of flu
      viruses.<br>
      <br>
      "We hope that eventually we'll be able tackle all pathogens by
      using this technology. So watch this space."<br>
      <br>
      The scientists aim to develop the technology further to capture
      other potentially deadly viruses such as those responsible for
      Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) and Severe Acute
      Respiratory Syndrome (Sars).<br>

      Few creatures spawn more fear than sharks. But these complex fish
      also have provided inspiration for several useful technologies.
      One new idea has captured the interest of the U.S. Navy.<br>
      <br>
      Shark skin has been used by many cultures as sandpaper. It's kept
      shipmates safe in slippery-when-wet conditions. Swimsuits modeled
      on shark skin are said by Speedo to reduce drag by up to 4
      percent.<br>
      <br>
      Now, research by two separate groups could lead to synthetic shark
      skin that would make ships and submarines faster and less
      expensive to operate. <br>

      Shark skin has been used by many cultures as sandpaper. It's kept
      shipmates safe in slippery-when-wet conditions. Swimsuits modeled
      on shark skin are said by Speedo to reduce drag by up to 4

      &nbsp;<br>
      Now, research by two separate groups could lead to synthetic shark
      skin that would make ships and submarines faster and less
      expensive to operate.<br>
      <br>
      If the research pans out, submarines -- already stealthy and
      shark-like -- could become even more so.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The problem</b><br>
      <br>
      The growth of barnacles, mussels, algae and other organisms adds
      to fuel costs for the military and shipping industry, increasing
      drag by up to 15 percent, scientists say. In the industry, it's
      called bio-fouling.<br>
      <br>
      The Navy spends about $600 million each year to power ships and
      submarines. At least $50 million of that cost is directly related
      to bio-fouling, says Navy scientist Stephen McElvany.<br>
      <br>
      Paints laced with deadly biocides curb the problem, but they are
      also toxic to other marine life.<br>
      <br>
      Some fish, and also whales, are fouled by hitchhiking marine life.
      But not sharks. Scientists have figured out that the secret to
      clean sharks is in the complex design of their scales.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Amazing scales</b><br>
      <br>
      Shark scales are made of a hard material called dentin. Basically,
      the scales are tiny teeth. They all point backward, so a shark
      would feel smooth if you dared to stroke it from head to tail, but
      rough if you ran your hand the other way.<br>
      <br>
      Studies have found that the scales act as armor for a shark and
      also create tiny vortices that reduce drag to make them faster.
      The scales also allow sharks to swim silently compared to other
      fish that generate considerable noise when they ply the water.<br>
      <br>
      The design has proved useful to humans in many ways.<br>
      <br>
      Norwegians applied real shark skin to the soles of their boots to
      prevent slippage on wet ship decks. In the 2000 Olympics, swimmers
      began wearing full-body suits modeled on shark skin.<br>
      <br>
      Now, research by two separate groups could lead to synthetic shark
      skin that would make ships and submarines faster and less
      expensive to operate.<br>
      <br>
      If the research pans out, submarines -- already stealthy and
      shark-like -- could become even more so.<br>
      <br>
      <b>What's good for the shark ...</b><br>
      <br>
      Importantly, shark scales flex individually, constantly changing
      and limiting the amount of exposed surface area on which organisms
      can attach, scientists have learned.<br>
      <br>
      Ralph Liedert of the University of Applied Sciences in Bremen,
      Germany has developed a synthetic shark skin of elastic silicone
      that similarly reduces the contact surface, making it harder for
      barnacles to gain a foothold.<br>
      <br>
      While simpler in design than shark scales, the ship skin reduced
      bio-fouling by 67 percent in tests, Liedert will report this week
      at the Society for Experimental Biology's annual meeting in
      Barcelona.<br>
      <br>
      Mussels and barnacles make some of the strongest adhesives known
      (other scientists try to mimic the properties to make better
      household glue). But the glue of a barnacle, Liedert found, can
      only penetrate so far into a rough surface, explaining why the
      scales prevent them from sticking.<br>
      <br>
      With the fake skin applied, a ship moving at 4-5 knots becomes
      self-cleaning, removing most organisms, Liedert found.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Military interest</b><br>
      <br>
      In separate work funded in part by the U.S. Navy, scientists at
      the University of Florida have developed a similar coating, made
      of tiny diamond-shaped scales that flex in and out to impede the
      growth of organisms.<br>
      <br>
      The coating was tested in a lab using a common algae. The algae's
      spores had a very hard time attaching to the surface.<br>
      <br>
      "It normally sticks to everything, but we have reduced spore
      settlement by 85 percent," said Anthony Brennan, a University of
      Florida professor of materials science. "The only place the spores
      land right now is where we have a defect in the pattern."<br>
      <br>
      While the high-tech skins could reduce costs for the shipping
      industry, they could prove a strategic advantage for the military.<br>
      <br>
      McElvany called the finding “exciting" but said there are still
      challenging research hurdles to clear before the technology could
      be deployed.<br>
      <br>
      "If achieved, this improved coating could not only be exempt from
      future environmental constraints and regulations, it would also
      provide increased fuel efficiency and velocity of Navy vessels,"
      McElvany said.<br>

      <i>Whistleblower Reveals Hard Evidence: Keshe foundation Tech
        Being Used to Clean Fukushima Contamination in Japan. Government

      </i><i> </i><br>
      In the latest Keshe Foundation Workshop (March 24.2016) evidence
      is presently by a Fukushima whistleblower/insider that Keshe tech
      has and is being used to clean radioactivity out of Fukushima.
      Keshe stated, two years ago, that he contacted government/industry
      in Japan and offered his tech to help with the clean-up.<br>
      <br>
      Photographs and testimony is given by a Fukushima
      insider/whistleblower that Keshe GANS tech is/was being used …THIS
      VALIDATES KESHE TECH.<br>
      <br>
      Keshe tech is being used to purify the radioactively contaminated
      water in Fukushima.<br>
      <br>
      Keshe told us years ago that his tech was being used, but the
      companies and government in Japan refused to acknowledge or give
      Keshe any credit.<br>
      <br>
      They also fired the person who was the go between Keshe foundation
      and the companies doing the clean up – Tepco and other companies.
      Here is the link to the workshop: <br>

      The whistleblower was shown initial tests of Keshe tech in
      Fukushima and was told not to speak about it… but he is now
      speaking out because of the injustice.<br>
      <br>
      Initially, mice were tested with “CO2 gans” in their daily diet
      (contaminated mice)…THEY ALL RECOVERED, THEY ALL DID NOT DIE. The
      mice were given contaminated water….some with CO2 gans in the
      water, others without it…. the GANS MICE RECOVERED, the mice that
      were not given GANS died. The water was highly contaminated and
      put on the mouse food, absorbed into the food…<br>

      Inventor: BABCOCK PAUL, et al.<br>
      Apparatus and associated methods involve thrust generation by
      interaction of an armature field with a stator field in an
      arrangement with substantially reduced flux coupling from the
      armature to the stator coil. In an illustrative example, solenoid
      coil segments may be arranged as the stator along a path of motion
      for the armature. In some examples, each armature may surround and
      overlap with at least one of the toroidal coil segments.
      Counter-electromotive force may be substantially reduced, for
      example, by stopping current flow in a stator coil while
      overlapped by the armature or while substantial armature flux
      couples to the stator coil. Thrust may be generated, in some
      examples, by interaction of armature and stator coil flux in
      arc-shaped regions external to and between each of the leading and
      trailing edges of the armature and their respective nearby stator
      coils.<br>

      I have also seen wild stories that make no sense...I offered Greb
      $1000US to send me just two of the insect shells.&nbsp; I don't
      even need the name of the bug.&nbsp; We could first verify the
      shells do actually repel, use an electron microscope to determine
      unique geometry (star, triangle, tetrahedron?) and we know it is
      dielectric chitin, we should be able to duplicate the effect in
      sheets....based on claims in Chapter 5 (V) in the book;<br>
      <br>
      "How and why did I come to this discovery? In the summer of 1988,
      as I was examining under a microscope the chitin shells of
      insects, their pinnate (feathery) feelers, and the thinnest
      structure of butterflies' wings, I got interested in an amazingly
      rhythmical microstructure of one large insect detail.<br>
      <br>
      It was an extremely well-ordered composition, as though pressed on
      a complex machine according to special blueprints and
      calculations. As I saw it, the intricate sponginess was clearly
      not necessary either for the durability of the detail, or for its
      decoration. I had never observed anything like this unusual
      micro-ornament either in nature, in technology, or in art.<br>
      <br>
      Because its structure is three-dimensional, so far I have been
      unable to capture it in a drawing, or a photograph. Why does an
      insect need it? Besides, other than in flight, this structure at
      the bottom of the wing case is always hidden from the eye-no one
      would ever see it properly.<br>
      <br>
      Was it perhaps the wave beacon with "my" multiple cavernous
      structures effect? That truly lucky summer there were very many
      insects of this species, and I would capture them at night:
      neither before, nor after was I able to observe these insects.<br>
      <br>
      I put the small, concave chitin plate on the microscope shelf in
      order again to examine under strong magnification its strangely
      star-shaped cells. I again admired this masterpiece of nature, and
      almost purposelessly placed it on top of another, identical plate
      that had the same unusual cells on one of its sides.<br>
      <br>
      But no!-the detail broke loose from my tweezers; for a few seconds
      it hung suspended above the other plate on the microscope shelf,
      turned a few degrees clockwise, slid to the right, turned
      counterclockwise, swung, and only then abruptly fell on the desk.<br>
      <br>
      You can imagine what I felt at that moment... When I came to my
      senses, I tied a few panels with a wire-it wasn't an easy thing to
      do, and I only succeeded when I positioned them vertically. What I
      got was a multi-layered chitin block. I put it on the desk.<br>
      <br>
      Even a relatively large object-such as a paper tack-could not fall
      on it-something pushed it up and aside.<br>
      <br>
      When I attached the tack on top of the "block", I witnessed such
      incredible, impossible things (for example, the tack for a few
      moments was lost from sight) that I realized it was no beacon, but
      something else entirely.<br>
      <br>
      And again I got so excited that all the objects around me became
      foggy and shaky. It was with a huge effort that I managed to pull
      myself together in a couple of hours and continue working.<br>
      <br>
      So, this is how it started. Of course, much still remains to be
      understood, verified, and tested. I will certainly tell my readers
      about the finer details of my machine, about its propulsion
      principles, about distances, heights, speeds, equipment, and all
      the rest-but in my next book."<br>
      <br>
      I wrote him two letters in Russian and sent a thick packet of
      science articles that backed up the idea that there could be
      natural materials which could deflect gravity...as much of it as I
      could I had translated to Russian.<br>
      <br>
      I explained to him my theory that he used something like flat wood
      popsicle sticks on which he glued the concave shells, roughly 10
      per stick all facing up like mini satellite dishes...these
      popsicle sticks were connected with a control rod which could be
      turned to cause them to open up like a japanese fan.<br>
      <br>
      The idea being that gravity is a pushing effect of the aether/zpe
      into matter...and it comes into the earth and all masses in lines
      like magnetic flux lines...the more lines you cross, the more
      reaction you get.<br>
      <br>
      When this japanese fan with all the concave shells are folded
      closed...they only block a few lines...but when you open it up,
      you cover more area, and thus block more lines to give you a
      controlled local gravity repulsion.<br>
      <br>
      I explained to him I thought he mounted 4 of these japanese fan
      'blocks' as he calls them...one at each corner, underneath the
      platform.<br>
      <br>
      The control handles were like motorcycle handgrips, connected to
      the japanese fans...<br>
      <br>
      When you turn the handle on one side (right or left), it opens the
      two japanese fans in front....the other handle opens the two fans
      in back...<br>

      You can open them a little bit to control your height or open all
      four of them all the way to achieve maximum lift with the maximum
      height of 1,000 feet based on his weight and the lifting capacity
      of the number of shells he had.<br>
      <br>
      Once in the air, to move forward, you partially close the two fans
      in front, which will cause the platform to tilt and move
      forward...you can tilt your weight to either side to go left or
      right, like riding a surfboard.<br>
      <br>
      Grebennikov wrote back and said that was exactly how it worked.<br>
      <br>
      So I would like to know where you chanced on the idea there was
      more than one version of his book and that the missing one
      contained full details about the platform.<br>
      <br>
      I have seen a few articles which had far more details which I
      thought came from his papers and magazine articles.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
      have not collected those and I guess I should in order to add to
      what is posted on Keelynet.<br>
      <br>
      Here is it, some 15 years later and we are no further along in
      discovering which insect he was using or understanding the effect
      enough to duplicate it using other methods.&nbsp; So much for the
      genius of humans.<br>
      <br>
      Maybe if we put all the known information on Grebennikovs story
      and whatever correlations or other antigrav and physics info we
      had into an artificial intelligence program, it might be able to
      extrapolate a testable hypothesis or two.<br>
      <br>
      I would like to know where you got the story about there being
      other versions of the book.&nbsp; All I know of is one or two
      magazine articles that had what they claimed was Grebennikov
      explaining how his platform was controlled (which sounded bogus to
      me).&nbsp; I'm not sure I copied the file when I was there.&nbsp;
      Thanks!<br>

      Recently I came across the journal of a farmer who made a pretty
      amazing claim. He said that he could grow more than enough food
      for his 4 beef cattle in just the size of a large bedroom closet.<br>
      <br>
      At first, I didn’t believe it was physically possible, but then I
      saw the pictures and was completely blown away. Not only was he
      growing enough food to support more than 4,000 pounds of cattle,
      he also was producing surplus food for other livestock. His unique
      method has cut his food cost to raise cattle by a staggering 60%
      to 90% once all costs are accounted. He might not say it, but what
      he’s doing could be nothing short of revolutionary.<br>
      <br>
      The whole system he’s built to feed his cattle is much more simple
      than you think. So shockingly simple that most people might be
      able to get most of it up and running after a trip to the hardware
      store.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Vertical farming for beef production</b><br>
      <br>
      The secret is in something called “Vertical farming”. Recently,
      Japan has made headlines stating that they could feed a city of
      millions of people by vertical farming in a retrofitted
      skyscraper. Vertical farming is somewhat similar to aqua-phonic
      farming, however it is much more dense. Literally thousands of
      plants can be contained in a small room simply because you’re
      stacking multiple layers of plants on top of each other.<br>
      <br>
      Each tray may not look like much, but they contain vitamin-rich,
      extremely calorie dense barley sprouts. Barley sprouts contain an
      amazing amount of energy and calories that not only help cattle
      gain weight, but is also said to produce the best tasting beef in
      the world (At least according to Canada).<br>
      <br>
      The barley grows like a weed once it's exposed to the right
      conditions. So much so that it actually deprives the room of co2
      and produces significant amounts of oxygen.<br>

      The barley grows like a weed once it’s exposed to the right

      and produces significant amounts of oxygen. It takes only 6-8 days
      for the seeds to sprout an produce an abundance of nutritional
      value.<br>

      Many interesting side-effects have been noticed with the
      introduction of the vitamin-rich replacement diet.<br>
      <br>
      Interesting story about the Chickens…<br>
      <br>
      They (The people who introduced us to sprouting) have a single
      Americana bird that is about 14 years old and belongs to another
      of their daughters as a pet since she was little. A few months
      after they started feeding just the fodder they started getting
      little green eggs again, after not seeing eggs from that hen for
      the last 5 years or so. Pretty impressive. We have also noticed
      that after being on the fodder for a while, you just about need a
      hatchet to get the shells open, so they are getting plenty of
      calcium too. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      What’s so impressive is that the barley for the animals is being
      grown in a purpose-built shed that’s only 8×8 feet big. Even more
      amazing is that less than half of the shed is being fully utilized
      for growing the barley.<br>
      <br>
      A normal cow’s diet consists either of grass (hay) or corn. A
      normal cow that is fed corn its entire life may require up to
      2,800 pounds of corn before it is butchered. This amount of corn
      will typically require *about* 14,550 square feet of farmland.
      This is extraordinarily high compared to the 4 square feet
      required for the barley sprouting operation. However corn-fed beef
      can’t hold a candle in terms of space required to feed compared to
      grass fed beef which ranges from 1-4 acres per cow (43,650sf to
      174,600sf respectively).<br>
      <br>
      Of course, it still takes normal acreage to grow the barley in the
      first place. However the space is generally quite low due to the
      fact that the sprouts are so dense in nutrition. The results of
      sprouting seem to indicate that you can take raise a cattle on
      LESS than 400 pounds of barley. This compared to 2,500 pounds of
      corn is a pretty amazing difference. The gain is still huge even
      considering the lower bushels-per-acre yield of barley vs corn
      (49.5bu/ac for barley and 150bu/ac for corn).<br>

      Carotenoids are a class of more than 600 naturally occurring
      pigments mostly synthesized by plants. These richly colored
      molecules are the sources of the yellow, orange, and red colors
      found in many fruits and vegetables. A new study from Seoul
      National University in Korea showed that increased level of blood
      carotenoids slow cellular aging.<br>
      <br>
      Carotenoids are neither vitamins nor phytochemicals, but are
      proving to be very important for health. Dietary carotenoids are
      thought to provide health benefits in decreasing the risk of
      disease, particularly certain cancers and eye disease. The
      carotenoids that have been most studied in this regard are
      beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin. In part, the
      beneficial effects of carotenoids are thought to be due to their
      role as antioxidants. beta-Carotene may have added benefits due
      its ability to be converted to vitamin A. Carotenoids benefit our
      skin and reduce cancer risk.<br>
      <br>
      Data from the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination
      Survey (NHANES) indicated that doubling levels of the carotenoids
      alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin were
      associated with 2% longer telomeres, DNA sequences at the end of
      chromosomes that shorten as cells replicate and age.<br>
      <br>
      The findings, published in the European Journal of Nutrition, show
      only correlation and not causation, and therefore some caution
      must be exercised when interpreting the data. Despite this, the
      researchers noted: "[The findings] suggest that carotenoids have a
      protective effect on telomere loss and that a high intake of these
      carotenoids may potentially prevent or delay the aging process and
      age-related diseases."...<br>
      <br>
      The Korean scientists used data from 3660 participants of NHANES
      and found that blood alpha-carotene, beta-carotene (trans+ cis)
      and beta-cryptoxanthin were significantly associated with 1.76%,
      2.22% and 2.02% longer telomeres, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, blood lutein/zeaxanthin and trans-lycopene did
      not show any statistical significance, said the researchers.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, compared to the lowest average levels of
      alpha-carotene, beta-carotene (trans+ cis) and beta-cyptoxanthin,
      the telomere length increased from 5-8% in the highest average
      carotenoid levels.<br>

      </b><b> Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Purpose: Telomere length is a biomarker for aging. It is known
      that oxidative stress can accelerate telomere shortening, whereas
      antioxidants can delay their shortening. Carotenoids as
      antioxidants are favorably associated with health- and
      aging-related diseases caused by oxidative stress, but their
      association with telomere length is less certain. We investigated
      the association between blood carotenoid levels and leukocyte
      telomere length in a representative sample of US adults. Methods:
      We analyzed 3660 participants aged 20 years and older in the
      1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The
      levels of carotenoids-alpha-carotene, beta-carotene (trans + cis),
      beta-cryptoxanthin, combined lutein/zeaxanthin, and
      trans-lycopene-were measured using high-performance liquid
      chromatography. The leukocyte telomere length (T/S ratio) was
      assayed using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method.
      Results: A doubling of blood alpha-carotene, beta-carotene (trans
      + cis), and beta-cryptoxanthin was associated with approximately 2
      % longer telomeres. Compared with the lowest carotenoid quartile
      of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene (trans + cis), and
      beta-cryptoxanthin, telomere length for adults with the highest
      quartiles was significantly increased by 5-8 %. Conclusion: We
      found that increasing levels of blood carotenoid were
      significantly associated with longer leukocyte telomeres in US
      adults. High intake of carotenoid-rich food may play a role in
      protecting telomeres and regulating telomere length.<br>

      A new form of cataract surgery using a patient's stem cells has
      restored vision in babies for the first time, and someday the
      technique may hold promise for millions of older Americans who
      undergo traditional cataract eye surgery every year, say
      scientists who developed the new procedure.<br>
      <br>
      Eye experts across the country who spoke with CBS News are
      alternately excited and cautious about the findings, published
      Wednesday in the journal Nature.<br>
      <br>
      The procedure, developed by researchers at the University of
      California San Diego and China, is less invasive than traditional
      cataract treatment, said the scientists.<br>
      <br>
      Cataracts are most common in older adults. As most people age, an
      opaque film slowly forms over the lens -- the part of the eye that
      helps with focusing on images at various distances. It clouds
      vision and can lead to blindness.<br>
      <br>
      In cataract surgery, which has been around for several decades,
      eye surgeons make an incision in the front of the eye and remove
      the lens from its supporting capsule. Then they replace it with an
      artificial lens.<br>
      <br>
      The new procedure described in Nature involves making a slim
      incision at the side of the lens capsule, removing the entire
      lens, yet preserving the empty capsule bag or "scaffold." A
      certain kind of stem cell, called endogenous stem/progenitor
      cells, when left intact, then begins to repopulate the damaged
      lens and essentially grow a new, healthy lens.<br>
      <br>
      Study author Dr. Kang Zhang, the chief of ophthalmic genetics at
      UC San Diego's Shiley Eye Institute, told CBS News, "Unlike [the]
      current way of cataract surgery, which destroys over half of lens
      stem cells and requires implantation of a plastic intranet ocular
      lens, we devised a new surgery to make a very small opening at the
      side of a cataractous lens bag, remove [the] cataract inside,
      allow the opening to heal, and promote dormant lens stem cells to
      regrow an entirely new lens with vision."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Pioneering surgery tested in babies</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The experimental procedure was done in 12 infants who were born
      with a congenital cataract condition.<br>
      <br>
      By using a less invasive procedure, Zhang and his colleagues
      report that they were able to leave the lens epithelial stem
      cells, also called LECs, intact. These LECs regenerated the eye's
      lens in the children, eliminating the need for implants. The same
      technique was also successfully performed in animals.<br>
      <br>
      In little ones with congenital cataracts, eye surgeons need to
      intervene early so that light can get to the brain and allow for
      normal, healthy growth, said Suraj Bhat, associate professor of
      ophthalmology and director of the Vision Molecular Biology
      Laboratory at the UCLA Stein Eye Institute. Bhat was not involved
      in the new research, but said it's "extremely exciting" because it
      offers an alternative to "an extraordinarily invasive" procedure.<br>
      <br>
      "In early childhood cataracts are very bad. We need light to enter
      into the eyes at a young age to get proper brain function,
      otherwise, information does not get transferred to the developing
      brain," said Bhat.<br>
      <br>
      Traditional surgery can cause opacity in the line of a child's
      vision and, because the eye is still growing, it is difficult to
      provide good vision with eye glasses, explained Julie T. Daniels,
      from University College London Institute of Ophthalmology, in an
      accompanying commentary in Nature.<br>
      <br>
      Many children also later go on to suffer from glaucoma.<br>
      <br>
      Daniels wrote that to correctly refract light onto the retina at
      the back of the eye, the cornea and lens must remain transparent
      throughout life. Current treatments for the cornea and lens
      involve donor transplants or artificial implants, but the
      procedures can be risky. She said the new procedure, which coaxes
      stem cells to regenerate normal tissue in the body, offers
      promise.<br>
      <br>
      "The study's stem cell engineering has led to the regeneration of
      transparent lens tissue in children, showing that the concept
      offers a potential therapeutic approach," Daniels wrote.<br>
      <br>
      She noted a second study in Nature that used transplant tissue
      grown in the laboratory from stem cells to treat damaged corneas,
      saying it also holds promise.<br>
      <br>
      Zhang said their results need to be validated in a large number of
      patients "and with a longer follow-up period."<br>
      <br>
      Will it work in older eyes?<br>
      <br>
      One major question remains to be answered: Can it be applied to
      age-related cataracts, the leading cause of blindness?<br>
      <br>
      According to the National Eye Institute, about 24.4 million
      Americans suffer from cataracts. Between 2000 and 2010, the number
      of cataract cases in the U.S. went up by 20 percent, and it's
      expected to continue to grow as the population ages.<br>
      <br>
      "We are now planning a study to test this approach in this old
      patient population. In addition, we are testing if this approach
      can be used in treating other leading causes of blindness, such as
      macular degeneration and glaucoma," said Zhang.<br>
      <br>
      He hopes the surgery will be available to the general population
      within four to five years.<br>
      <br>
      "I would anticipate that it may be available after several
      independent studies with a large number of patients," he said.<br>
      <br>
      Feast your eyes: 8 nutrients to help protect your sight<br>
      <br>
      Some other experts in the field saw great promise in the research.<br>
      <br>
      "Everyone's working on this. Stem cells are like the Holy Grail of
      vision research," Dr. James Tsai, M.D., president of the New York
      Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai, told CBS News. "To me, it's
      very exciting data. They may be on to something."<br>
      <br>
      But he tempered the hope the study offers by noting that the lens
      regeneration work is also "very controversial" and could impact a
      multimillion-dollar industry.<br>
      <br>
      "This is potentially a new surgery. If you think about the
      implications in the long run, lens implants may not be necessary,"
      he said. "There are a lot of doctors who will want to see more
      data."<br>
      <br>
      He also pointed out that the study involved infants, and that
      adults -- the most common cataract patients -- have a different
      regenerative capacity of lens epithelial stem cells.<br>
      <br>
      In the meantime, Tsai said it's hopeful news for some babies with
      congenital cataracts like the children who participated in the
      study. "As a glaucoma specialist, the way we do congenital
      cataracts, there's a great risk these babies will develop glaucoma
      for a lifetime and maybe with this new surgery, they won't have
      that glaucoma risk."<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Maria Valeria Canto-Soler, assistant professor of
      ophthalmology and director of the Retinal Degeneration Research
      Center at Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute, said she was
      impressed by the research.<br>
      <br>
      "The main excitement for me is the ability to regenerate an organ
      or a tissue within an organ," said Canto-Soler, a retina
      specialist.<br>
      <br>
      "From what I know, I'd say this is the first demonstration where
      you can use endogenous stem cells for replacing tissue within the
      eye. It's something we are all looking for. They have actually
      done it in humans."<br>
      <br>
      She said, even without answers to the question of whether it will
      work in aging eyes, it creates hope for children with congenital
      issues. "If you can create it in children, that's a big thing. You
      are giving sight back to little kids and that change their lives."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Larger studies, "more eyes" needed</b><br>
      <br>
      Dr. Kathryn Hatch, an ophthalmologist at Massachusetts Eye and Ear
      in Boston, told CBS News the procedure "seems very exciting," but
      more research is needed.<br>
      <br>
      "I'd need to see a larger study with more eyes, and we need to see
      some reproducibility, and see how long it would take for the lens
      -- if it's able to regenerate -- what are the visual results.
      Because that's what patients really care about. Their vision. If
      it takes months to get to an outcome, it's not superior to the
      lens technologies we have now. I'm not sure what the advantage is.
      Most patients don't even want to wait. They want to get back to
      work, their life," Hatch added.<br>
      <br>
      She also had questions about how the procedure was done with such
      a tiny incision. "I don't understand how they're doing the surgery
      with such a tiny hole without tearing the capsule. If we make a
      three millimeter incision [in traditional cataract surgery],
      that's really small in an adult."<br>
      <br>
      Cataract surgery is "traditionally done by hand with a bent
      needle. That's one of the most difficult steps to learn as a
      surgeon. One of most important steps to learn," she said and there
      could be major eye damage if a surgery was compromised by a tear.<br>
      <br>
      She also noted that baby eye surgery is different from adults in
      that the infant cataract is much softer compared to an adult's
      harder cataract.<br>

      UCLA's Bhat noted another limitation in the study: "These are all
      genetic cataracts. This study wasn't long enough. They [cataracts]
      may come back," he said, but it's also possible the genetic defect
      may not reappear.<br>
      <br>
      He's said it's unclear if the results will be mirrored in older
      cataract patients, the same concern expressed by others in the
      field.<br>
      <br>
      "Cell division is slower in older people," Bhat said. "The biggest
      problem as we grow older, particularly beyond 50, is cell division
      which keeps on decreasing. Our ability to make new cells is
      significantly lost. The process that these people are depending
      upon is tremendously dependent on cell division."<br>
      <br>
      Bhat said he also paused when he read the statement in the paper
      that claimed a 100 percent success rate three months after
      surgery.<br>
      <br>
      "I don't know them. I can't second guess them. You've got to
      believe the written word."<br>

      A group of scientists from Scripps Research Institute (TSRI )
      discovered that immune cells able to conquer HIV are present in
      the human body.<br>
      <br>
      Some people infected with HIV can produce antibodies that
      effectively neutralize many strains of the dangerous, rapidly
      mutating virus. A healthy person, however, would need to be
      immunized with special antigens in order to produce the required
      antibodies.<br>
      <br>
      The success of a potential vaccine depends on the ability of the
      immunogen to bind with cells called B-lymphocytes and to activate
      them so that they produce antibodies. A team of scientists wrote
      in a new study published in Science magazine on March 24 that most
      people have so-called "embryo" precursor cells in their bodies
      which can generate VRC01 antibodies needed to conquer HIV cells.<br>
      <br>
      The scientists tried to develop a special kind of immunogen which
      would bind certain B-lymphocytes, potentially responsible for
      immunity against HIV. The immunogen has to be very unique because
      the required progenitor cells are very rare among other
      B-lymphocytes.<br>
      <br>
      "We found that almost everybody has these broadly neutralizing
      antibody precursors, and that a precisely engineered protein can
      bind to these cells that have potential to develop into HIV
      broadly neutralizing antibody-producing cells, even in the
      presence of competition from other immune cells," said the study's
      lead author, TSRI professor William Schief.<br>
      <br>
      The immunologists synthesized protein immunogen EOD-GT8 60mer. The
      research showed that mice vaccinated with the protein generate
      VRC01 antibodies. If EOD-GT8 60mer can trigger the same reaction
      in humans, the scientists may then develop several more immunogens
      that will jointly cause the synthesis of a wide range of
      antibodies able to conquer HIV.<br>
      <br>
      In a recent article published in Scientific Reports magazine,
      genetic scientists wrote that CRISPR/Cas9&nbsp; technology is able
      to remove HIV virogenes from infected T-lymphocytes which the
      virus usually attacks. The finding may help to develop new methods
      of therapy for people with AIDS.<br>

      As the presidential campaign circus dominates headlines across the
      US, glaring signs the planet is undergoing abrupt anthropogenic
      climate disruption (ACD) abound.<br>
      <br>
      A major study published in Nature Climate Change shows that the
      planet is warming a stunning 50 times faster than when it comes
      out of an ice age. The implications of the rapidity of this
      warming, for those who care to digest it emotionally, are
      horrifying.<br>
      <br>

      ]<br>
      <br>
      The study shows that even if carbon reduction targets are achieved
      and the planet's temperature is kept below the 2 degree Celsius
      warming threshold, sea-level rise will still inundate major
      coastal cities around the world, forcing one-fifth of the total
      world population of humans to migrate away from the coasts. New
      York, London, Rio de Janeiro, Jakarta, Cairo, Kolkata and Shanghai
      will all be underwater.<br>
      <br>
      As though to reinforce this point, NASA recently released data
      confirming that February was the warmest month ever measured
      globally, at 1.57 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial baseline
      temperature average. The new record easily smashed the old global
      temperature record, which was set just one month before, in
      January.<br>

      ]<br>
      <br>
      This means that while it took from the advent of the industrial
      age until October 2015 to warm the planet 1 degree Celsius, humans
      have managed to warm the planet another .57 degrees Celsius in
      just the next four months since then.<br>

      Carbon emissions are now the highest they have been since the age
      of dinosaurs, 66 million years ago.<br>

      <br>
      revealed that carbon emissions are now the highest they have been
      since the age of dinosaurs, 66 million years ago. According to the
      study, the current pace of emissions is even beyond the
      highest-known natural surge of carbon that exists in fossil
      records, an event that occurred 56 million years ago that was
      believed by many to be caused by the release of frozen stores of
      greenhouse gases from the seabed.<br>
      <br>
      That ancient release, which drove temperatures up 5 degrees
      Celsius, is now surpassed by our current surge of carbon release.
      "Given currently available records, the present anthropogenic
      carbon release rate is unprecedented during the past 66 million
      years," the scientists of the new study wrote.<br>
      <br>
      Another ominous sign of escalating ACD: The entire Northern
      Hemisphere surpassed the 2 degree Celsius mark for the first time
      since human civilization began. Bear in mind that 2 degrees
      Celsius is the arbitrary, politically agreed-upon warming limit,
      above which warming is considered "dangerous" to humanity. Former
      NASA scientist James Hansen debunked that goal over two years ago,
      when he published a paper showing that 1 degree Celsius was the
      scientifically proven point of no return.<br>

      Parts of the Arctic were 29 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal
      in February, which even brought large portions of the Arctic above
      freezing and into temperature levels more common in June.<br>
      <br>
      Dozens of countries across Europe and Asia set or tied all-time
      temperature records, and cities across the United States saw
      record warm temperatures, in which the 2015-2016 winter was the
      warmest ever recorded.<br>

      Winter in the US, according to meteorologists, technically takes
      place from December through February. This year, that winter was
      4.6 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal, breaking the previous
      record, which was set in 1999-2000. This winter, all six of the
      states that comprise New England had their warmest winters ever.
      Meanwhile, every single US state had winters nearly 2 degrees

      Underscoring the severity of what is clearly a planetary warming

      The Arctic is where warming continues to be the most blatantly
      obvious. In early March, the start of the famed Iditarod sled dog
      race looked more like something out of a dystopian science fiction
      movie, as snow-starved Anchorage had snow hauled hundreds of miles
      down from Fairbanks to cover the dry streets upon which the dogs
      would run. Then, the typically 11-mile long ceremonial start was
      shortened to three miles.<br>

      Meanwhile, melting in Greenland is occurring so intensely and
      quickly that it is "feeding on itself," according to a recently

      There are several indicators this month of how rapidly the planet
      is changing under increasing stressors from ACD.<br>
      <br>
      In North America, millions of acres of forests are struggling and
      under increasing threat, due to the fact that the speed at which
      the planetary climate is changing is now far, far ahead of the
      forests' ability to adapt to the hotter and drier conditions ACD
      has ushered in across vast areas of the United States and Canada.
      New research shows that all of the forests in the US are
      officially under threat from ACD.<br>

      <br>
      And it's not just forests that are being impacted. The
      agricultural sector is in big trouble, as crops are being impacted
      dramatically by the rapidly changing climate.<br>
      <br>
      For example, in Montana, a recent study shows that agricultural
      losses due to ACD could total up to $736 million annually.<br>

      Panning out, another recent study shows that food scarcity caused
      by ACD would cause at least half a million deaths across the world

      ACD.<br>

      In the continental US alone, millions of people are already at
      risk of being forced out of their homes because of sea-level rise.<br>
      <br>
      Making matters worse, a group affiliated with the UN recently
      released a study showing that an ongoing decline of pollinating
      species now poses a very dire threat to the global food supply.
      The report warns that the species responsible for pollinating and
      promoting the growth of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of
      crops are facing extinction.<br>
      <br>
      Another study, this one published in Nature Climate Change, shows
      that high-latitude insects, like those in Scotland, face severe
      declines in population from ACD, due to the fact that they are far
      more sensitive to warmer temperatures than previously believed.<br>

      <br>
      Even as far north as the Arctic, ACD's growing impact on insects
      is obvious. A recent study published in PLOS ONE shows that
      warming temperatures are impacting beetle populations, and hence
      the entire biodiversity of the Arctic. The temperature change is
      causing the insects to migrate into new habitats, which is having
      a domino effect that is upsetting the natural balance.<br>
      <br>
      For humans in the far north, ACD's impacts are even more obvious.
      Intensifying heat is threatening the way of life of the Indigenous
      population in the Arctic. With the ice disappearing and
      temperatures continuing to rise, the life cycles and numbers of
      fish, marine mammals, caribou and polar bears are being altered,
      which is causing Indigenous communities to face food shortages.<br>
      <br>
      The leaders of First Nations and Inuit communities in the Arctic
      are now also speaking out about the mental health cost of ACD. The
      Native populations of the Arctic are dealing with growing despair
      over the effects of ACD on their lives and communities, and
      observers are connecting this to a growing array of mental health
      and social problems.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to this, ACD has caused the onslaught of rising sea
      levels, melting permafrost and other impacts that have positioned
      residents of the Arctic in a losing battle to stay in their homes.
      Housing shortages are now the norm as land is washing and melting
      away into the rising seas.<br>

      Meanwhile, across the lower latitudes, recent satellite images
      show that tropical rain forests ranging from the Amazon to the
      Philippines are vanishing far more abruptly than was previously

      for February were set in 2011. Moreover, the total volume of the
      Arctic sea ice, which many scientists see as the most important
      factor determining the health of Arctic sea ice, reached its
      second-lowest level ever recorded that same month. The record low
      for sea ice volume was set in 2012, a record that could fall this

      Global rainfall extremes continue to be elevated by ACD. A new
      study published in Nature Climate Change basically warns us to get
      ready for rain, and lots of it. The study shows that ACD is
      already driving increases in rainfall and snowfall extremes around
      the world, even in arid regions. This trend, according to the

      dioxide released as a result of human activities is absorbed into
      the world's oceans, where it alters their chemistry and reduces
      coral growth.<br>

      Meanwhile, a severe coral bleaching event in the most pristine
      portions of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia has caused
      authorities there to raise an alarm over severe local coral
      bleaching, caused by warm ocean temperatures.<br>

      because of sea-level rise. The study shows that sea-level
      increases will cause the homes of 4 million Americans to be
      inundated during high tides with three feet of sea-level rise by
      2100, although the pace of sea-level rise is consistently ahead of
      that projection.<br>

      "Once you take into account growth of population, the numbers end
      up being two to three times more in terms of overall population
      that's going to be impacted than if you just look at current
      populations," said Stetson University landscape ecologist Jason
      Evans, who contributed to the study. "Florida really pops out."<br>
      <br>
      With six feet of sea-level rise, which many scientists believe is
      inevitable, more than 4 million people, in Florida alone, will
      lose their homes.<br>

      <b>Fire</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      In the Southern Hemisphere, ACD-fueled wildfires continue to burn
      apace.<br>
      <br>
      In Tasmania, bushfires have grown so severe that 1,000-year-old
      trees are burning to ash while dried-out peat bogs are on fire.
      Experts there are warning that what is happening in Tasmania is a
      human-caused calamity as severe as the razing of the temples in
      Palmyra by ISIS.<br>
      <br>
      It's also worth noting that in the United States, wildfire season
      is already underway (albeit earlier than normal of course), with
      one massive wildfire having already burnt more than 72,000 acres
      across Oklahoma and Kansas.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Air</b><br>
      <br>
      This month, there are many bright neon warning signs in the Air
      category.<br>
      <br>
      Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have reached new heights,
      signaling an alarming increase. February 2015 to February 2016 saw
      the highest year-to-year growth ever recorded.<br>
      <br>
      Pieter Tans, lead scientist of the National Oceanic and
      Atmospheric Administration's Global Greenhouse Gas Reference
      Network, said the new record accompanied four straight years of
      increases of over 2 parts per million in the atmosphere. Of this,
      Trans said, "We've never seen that. That's unprecedented."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Temperatures across the globe continue to escalate.</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Melbourne, Australia, saw its hottest March night ever recorded,
      breaking the previous record by more than 1 degree Celsius. The
      previous record was set only three years prior.<br>
      <br>
      Moving northward, the rapidly increasing temperatures in the
      Arctic prompted climate scientist Dr. Peter Gleick, president of
      the Pacific Institute in California, to warn that this accelerated
      increase could have a "catastrophic" effect on the planet's
      climate. He explained that the higher temperatures are driving the
      creation of dangerous storms across the Northern Hemisphere, and
      that since early February, the area of the Arctic covered by sea
      ice has been lower this year than any of the last 30 years.<br>
      <br>
      Gleick posted a graph of the diminishing sea ice on Twitter with
      the message: "What is happening in the Arctic now is unprecedented
      and possibly catastrophic."<br>
      <br>
      In parts of the Arctic, February shattered all previous
      temperature records as the entire month reached a staggering 18
      degrees Fahrenheit above normal in some regions. Fort Yukon,
      Alaska, a place that has recorded the lowest temperature on record
      in that state, is experiencing record warm temperatures, causing
      people there to say that the warming trends "have robbed the
      Arctic of its winter."<br>
      <br>
      To make matters worse, methane, a greenhouse gas 100 times more
      potent than carbon dioxide on a 20-year time scale, spiked in
      February to more than 3,000 parts per billion in the atmosphere.
      This was the largest spike of methane ever recorded.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Denial and Reality</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Apparently, impending catastrophe doesn't mean much to some of the
      United States' wealthiest people. Once again a report has arisen
      documenting how fossil fuel millionaires pumped more than $100
      million into Republican presidential super PACs last year. That
      means that $1 out of every $3 donated to Republican candidates
      coming from hyper-rich individuals came from people who made their
      fortunes from fossil fuels. In boosting GOP politicians, these
      funders were simply acting to protect their cash cows from those
      of us who happen to give a damn about the planet.<br>
      <br>
      A recent report by the Center for American Progress Action Fund
      shows that more than six out of every 10 Americans are represented
      by someone in Congress who denies the reality of ACD. According to
      the report, 59 percent of the Republican House caucus and an
      amazing 70 percent of the Republicans in the Senate deny ACD is
      real. The report also reveals that, according to the US Census,
      202,803,591 Americans are represented by an ACD denier.<br>
      <br>
      Florida, a state notorious for having a government led by ACD
      deniers, faces yet another reality check from ACD. Fort
      Lauderdale, which is a boomtown of growth and construction, and
      also expects its population to grow by one-third in the next 15
      years, is hurtling headfirst toward the reality of ACD. Sea-level
      rise will eventually cause the city to be abandoned to the ocean.<br>
      <br>
      Another blow for deniers came in the form of recent polling data,
      which shows a record number of Americans now see ACD as a threat.
      According to Gallup polling, 41 percent of US adults believe ACD
      poses a "serious threat" to them during their lifetimes -- a 4
      percent increase over 2015, and the highest level ever recorded by
      Gallup.<br>
      <br>
      Gallup data also shows that 64 percent of those polled worried
      about ACD "a great deal" or at least "a fair amount," which is the
      highest level recorded since 2008. Meanwhile, only 36 percent of
      Americans said they did not worry about it, or only worried about
      it a little. Additionally, 65 percent of Americans now believe ACD
      is due to greenhouse gases released by human activity, a 10
      percent increase on this topic over last year.<br>
      <br>
      Another reality check came from Dr. James Hansen, who declared
      recently, "We have a global emergency" due to ACD. Hansen noted
      that ACD is poised to render large parts of the world essentially
      uninhabitable by 2100 due to extremely hot temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      Recent data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
      Administration revealed that the planet saw an "explosive" amount
      of annual carbon dioxide growth in the atmosphere during 2015, as
      the amount of carbon dioxide saw its largest single annual
      increase since record-keeping began.<br>
      <br>
      A recent study by the University of Queensland gave yet another
      sobering warning, stating that global temperatures could rise much
      faster than expected, possibly even breaching the 2 degree Celsius
      mark much sooner than predicted (thus missing the politically
      agreed-upon goal of keeping warming below 2 degrees Celsius).<br>
      <br>
      The final reality check for this month's dispatch comes in the
      form of a cruise ship. For the first time ever, the Arctic passage
      that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans is going to be
      opened up to cruise liners this summer. The first of them, the
      Crystal Serenity, will take more than 900 passengers paying over
      $100,000 each through the perilous route that at one time foiled
      most explorers, due to there being too much thick ice throughout
      the summer -- given that it is, after all, the Arctic.<br>

      Not anymore.<br>

      Rosemary could be the secret to living to 100 according to
      researchers investigating 300 centenarians in a remote Italian
      village.<br>
      <br>
      For the herb appears to be commonly used by a group of pensioners
      who have a most remarkable record of not just living longer but
      free of heart disease and Alzheimer’s.<br>
      <br>
      Teams of medical experts have been given permission for the first
      time ever to examine the residents of a coastal hamlet called
      Acciaroli, near the resort of Salerno.<br>
      <br>
      Nestled between the sea and the mountains the area has a
      population of a couple of thousand or so yet among them are at
      least 300 men and women who are already 100 years old or more.<br>
      <br>
      This is a phenomenal ratio compared to, for instance, America
      where just 0..02 per cent of the population will live that long.<br>
      <br>
      It is believed that factors for their long life and low rates of
      both mental and physical illness include the famously healthy
      Mediterranean diet that is popular throughout the region.<br>
      <br>
      But rosemary is particularly prevalent in their cooking, said
      researchers from the University of California San Diego School of
      Medicine and University of Rome, who are carrying out the study.<br>
      <br>
      Other influences include, perhaps obviously, the fresh air and
      walking - the residents regularly walk or hike through mountains
      to go to the shops or to work for instance as part of their daily
      routines.<br>
      <br>
      San Diego doctor Professor Alan Maisel said: ‘We are the first
      group of researchers to be given permission to study this
      population in Acciaroli, Italy.’<br>
      <br>
      The teams will look at diet, lifestyle and take blood samples and
      distribute questionnaires to the 300 centenarians of Acciaroli.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Maisel added: ‘The goal of this long-term study is to
      find out why this group of 300 is living so long by conducting a
      full genetic analysis and examining lifestyle behaviours, like
      diet and exercise.<br>
      <br>
      ‘The results from studying the longevity of this group could be
      applied to our practice at UC San Diego and to patients all over
      the world.’<br>

      The metaphor of society run by the levers of the machine, and the
      "system" that operates government and industry became much more
      literal in the post-war age of cybernetics. <br>
      <br>
      Mathematics and other related fields have got all that behavior
      down to a somewhat exact science.<br>
      <br>
      The use of algorithms and feed back mechanisms to track behavior
      has allowed the social scientist to manage people in mass, in
      often very subtle yet deeply meaningful ways.<br>
      <br>
      Here, Stafford Beer explains a concept outlined by Ross Ashby
      about the natural order and tendencies of systems - including some
      obvious pitfalls that are being played out today.:<br>
      <br>
      Stafford Beer explains the Law of Requisite Variety, also called
      Ashby's Law in honor of W. Ross Ashby his cybernetician friend.<br>
      <br>
      Beers ponders on the dangers of the inability to foresee the
      consequences of the variety explosion due to come in the future as
      everybody wants more and more autonomy.<br>
      <br>
      In political and social terms, this means there must be enough
      inputs for members to give their feedback in order for the system
      to correct to a state that is more "fair" and "democratic" and
      "inclusive," etc.<br>
      <br>
      Using automation and goal directing to manage and control all
      sectors of society, or the entire machine itself, cybernetics
      creates a closed loop for corrective action that is automated, and
      in which man has little direct input.<br>
      <br>
      When there is not a proper balance of power, and there are not
      meaningful channels of communication for dissent, and the exercise
      of liberty, then tyranny is inevitable.<br>
      <br>
      When the system is not properly configured, the injustice of the
      power of the state becomes even greater.<br>
      <br>
      The same is true for economics, where the draconian policies of
      controlling and manipulating, especially through tightening, of
      the monetary supply and the price of business already created a
      rigged game. <br>
      <br>
      Today, though, high speed, automatic trades based on complex
      computer algorithms dominate the marketplace and create an arena
      that is programmed to let insiders win at the expense of everyone
      else.<br>
      <br>
      It is an entirely different sense of order out of chaos - which
      indeed has been anticipated and modeled by mathematicians and
      computer engineers for more than half a century.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <div align="left"><b>Stafford Beer - A Computer Runs Chile - A
          Trekkie Geeks Out</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Stafford Beer was a leading cybernetician from the UK who was
      invited to run the Chilean government - using cybernetic machine
      communiqués - during the short-lived reign of President Salvador
      Allende.<br>
      <br>
      After being elected openly and fairly in 1970, Allende was removed
      by a CIA coup on September 11, 1973 - plotted with then-National
      Security Advisor Henry Kissinger.<br>
      <br>
      Allende was a Marxist and socialist who nationalized industry and
      collectivized social interaction with government.<br>
      <br>
      In a video address explaining how cybernetics works in government,
      Beer expresses his genuine respect for Allende and his policies,
      and obviously felt he was sincere. <br>
      <br>
      He believed a just government was being erected - even in the
      hands of a machine.<br>
      <br>
      Many of these sentiments are well placed.<br>
      <br>
      In the first video (above), Beer makes clear that self-sufficient
      and free people is the goal, and indeed it should be.<br>
      <br>
      In the end, Stafford Beer only had a couple of short years, and
      the promise of political progress - flawed or not - was cut short
      and went unfulfilled (though Beer continued his work in the UK and
      other Latin American countries).<br>
      <br>
      The New Yorker wrote a thorough piece on Stafford Beer's project
      in cybernetic socialism:<br>
      <br>
      The consultant, Stafford Beer, had been brought in by Chile's top
      planners to help guide the country down what Salvador Allende, its
      democratically elected Marxist leader, was calling "the Chilean
      road to socialism."<br>
      <br>
      Beer was a leading theorist of cybernetics - a discipline born of
      midcentury efforts to understand the role of communication in
      controlling social, biological, and technical systems.<br>
      <br>
      Chile's government had a lot to control: Allende, who took office
      in November of 1970, had swiftly nationalized the country's key
      industries, and he promised "worker participation" in the planning
      process.<br>
      <br>
      Beer's mission was to deliver a hypermodern information system
      that would make this possible, and so bring socialism into the
      computer age.<br>
      <br>
      The system he devised had a gleaming, sci-fi name: Project
      Cybersyn.<br>
      <br>
      Beer was an unlikely savior for socialism. He had served as an
      executive with United Steel […] He had a lavish life style […]<br>
      <br>
      To convince workers that cybernetics in the service of the command
      economy could offer the best of socialism, a certain amount of
      reassurance was in order. In addition to folk music, there were
      plans for cybernetic-themed murals in the factories, and for
      instructional cartoons and movies. Mistrust remained.<br>
      <br>
      "Chile Run by Computer," a January, 1973, headline in the Observer
      announced, shaping the reception of Beer's plan in Britain.<br>
      <br>
      At the center of Project Cybersyn (for "cybernetics synergy") was
      the Operations Room, where cybernetically sound decisions about
      the economy were to be made. Those seated in the op room would
      review critical highlights - helpfully summarized with up and down
      arrows - from a real-time feed of factory data from around the
      country.<br>
      <br>
      The prototype op room was built in downtown Santiago, in the
      interior courtyard of a building occupied by the national telecom
      company. It was a hexagonal space, thirty-three feet in diameter,
      accommodating seven white fibreglass swivel chairs with orange
      cushions and, on the walls, futuristic screens.<br>
      <br>
      Tables and paper were banned. Beer was building the future, and it
      had to look like the future.<br>
      <br>
      One wall was reserved for Project Cyberfolk, an ambitious effort
      to track the real-time happiness of the entire Chilean nation in
      response to decisions made in the op room.<br>
      <br>
      Beer built a device that would enable the country's citizens, from
      their living rooms, to move a pointer on a voltmeter-like dial
      that indicated moods ranging from extreme unhappiness to complete
      bliss.<br>
      <br>
      The plan was to connect these devices to a network - it would ride
      on the existing TV networks - so that the total national happiness
      at any moment in time could be determined.<br>
      <br>
      The algedonic meter, as the device was called (from the Greek
      algos, "pain," and hedone, "pleasure"), would measure only raw
      pleasure-or-pain reactions to show whether government policies
      were working.<br>
      <br>
      In many respects, Beer's cybernetic dream has finally come true
      [in the current age of Big Data]: the virtue of collecting and
      analyzing information in real time is an article of faith shared
      by corporations and governments alike.<br>
      <br>
      Beer took the metaphor of the body politic seriously in crafting
      his cybernetics model for Chile - as a means of managing an entire
      country - and even had a control room with Star Trek-inspired
      chairs.<br>
      <br>
      However, a genius mind working among the "game makers" of our
      world cannot be so naive as to think that a pure democracy can be
      operated cheerfully by a cybernetic government.<br>
      <br>
      Once the powers are created to control the masses, and force
      everyone (or even most) onto a centrally-controlled, automated
      system, the abuse of rights is inevitable.<br>
      <br>
      The system is geared towards goals for the "greater good" in a
      collectivist society - and individual needs are routinely seen as
      "noise in the signal", and interference with the goal:<br>
      <br>
      vaccine mandates<br>
      forced quarantines<br>
      mandatory education<br>
      federal income tax<br>
      social security<br>
      health care systems,<br>
      <br>
      ...and more have been forced onto society without meaningful
      choice, and with tremendous levels of propaganda from
      establishment media outlets. <br>
      <br>
      And that is when the system is operating in neutral.<br>
      <br>
      In the wrong hands, Stafford Beer's system could make,<br>
      <br>
      police states<br>
      austerity<br>
      a firm iron grip,<br>
      <br>
      ...operate at the height of efficiency. <br>
      <br>
      This was seen in pre-cybernetics days with Stalin, who ruled
      ruthlessly and absolutely (and who notoriously demanded Soviet
      cybernetics be rejected on grounds of being ‘imperialist').<br>
      <br>
      After his death, it took over Soviet management.<br>
      <br>
      During the height of cybernetics, it was East German Stasi who
      used cybernetics to direct a hyper-efficient surveillance state
      model that repressed absolutely everyone, induced fear of arousing
      suspicion and compelling neighbors and family members to snitch
      out their close companions for crimes against the state.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Collectivism is Tyranny, and the Destruction of the Individual</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Whether in a flourishing modern technological democracy or a
      tight-sealed super state, cybernetics ultimately results in,
      "computeriz[ing] our political decision-making" leaving
      individuality and human freedom more and more on the margins.<br>
      <br>
      Historian Carroll Quigley foresaw the dehumanizing effects of
      technology in the management of society - and properly warned that
      it would strip freedom down to narrow confines where a few options
      exist, but only those which are compatible and acceptable to the
      system itself.<br>
      <br>
      On p. 866 in Tragedy and Hope, he sums up the problem of
      collectivism - which is happening already in the United States -
      where political candidates, the economy and a vast bureaucracy of
      social services had reduced man to a number - hardly the goal of a
      "free" society:<br>
      <br>
      In effect, average Americans have been reduced to mere serfs, and
      will be increasingly shown it as technology takes over everything.<br>
      <br>
      Only non-compliance with the system, and disengagement from the
      machine that runs it, can result in greater freedom.<br>
      <br>
      Everything else is organized tyranny - and there may well be many

        <br>
        <b> Scientists predict 2-D material -- no longer theoretical --
          has unique properties</b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><br>
      Rice University scientists have determined that two-dimensional
      boron is a natural low-temperature superconductor. In fact, it may
      be the only 2-D material with such potential.<br>
      <br>
      Rice theoretical physicist Boris Yakobson and his co-workers
      published their calculations that show atomically flat boron is
      metallic and will transmit electrons with no resistance. The work
      appears this month in the American Chemical Society journal Nano
      Letters.<br>
      <br>
      The hitch, as with most superconducting materials, is that it
      loses its resistivity only when very cold, in this case between 10
      and 20 kelvins (roughly, minus-430 degrees Fahrenheit). But for
      making very small superconducting circuits, it might be the only
      game in town.<br>
      <br>
      The basic phenomenon of superconductivity has been known for more
      than 100 years, said Evgeni Penev, a research scientist in the
      Yakobson group, but had not been tested for its presence in
      atomically flat boron.<br>
      <br>
      "It's well-known that the material is pretty light because the
      atomic mass is small," Penev said. "If it's metallic too, these
      are two major prerequisites for superconductivity. That means at
      low temperatures, electrons can pair up in a kind of dance in the
      crystal."<br>
      <br>
      "Lower dimensionality is also helpful," Yakobson said. "It may be
      the only, or one of very few, two-dimensional metals. So there are
      three factors that gave the initial motivation for us to pursue
      the research. Then we just got more and more excited as we got
      into it."<br>
      <br>
      Electrons with opposite momenta and spins effectively become
      Cooper pairs; they attract each other at low temperatures with the
      help of lattice vibrations, the so-called "phonons," and give the
      material its superconducting properties, Penev said.
      "Superconductivity becomes a manifestation of the macroscopic wave
      function that describes the whole sample. It's an amazing
      phenomenon," he said.<br>
      <br>
      It wasn't entirely by chance that the first theoretical paper
      establishing conductivity in a 2-D material appeared at roughly
      the same time the first samples of the material were made by
      laboratories in the United States and China. In fact, an earlier
      paper by the Yakobson group had offered a road map for doing so.<br>
      <br>
      That 2-D boron has now been produced is a good thing, according to
      Yakobson and lead authors Penev and Alex Kutana, a postdoctoral
      researcher at Rice. "We've been working to characterize boron for
      years, from cage clusters to nanotubes to planer sheets, but the
      fact that these papers appeared so close together means these labs
      can now test our theories," Yakobson said.<br>
      <br>
      "In principle, this work could have been done three years ago as
      well," he said. "So why didn't we? Because the material remained
      hypothetical; okay, theoretically possible, but we didn't have a
      good reason to carry it too far.<br>
      <br>
      "But then last fall it became clear from professional meetings and
      interactions that it can be made. Now those papers are published.
      When you think it's coming for real, the next level of exploration
      becomes more justifiable," Yakobson said.<br>
      <br>
      Boron atoms can make more than one pattern when coming together as
      a 2-D material, another characteristic predicted by Yakobson and
      his team that has now come to fruition. These patterns, known as
      polymorphs, may allow researchers to tune the material's
      conductivity "just by picking a selective arrangement of the
      hexagonal holes," Penev said.<br>
      <br>
      He also noted boron's qualities were hinted at when researchers
      discovered more than a decade ago that magnesium diborite is a
      high-temperature electron-phonon superconductor. "People realized
      a long time ago the superconductivity is due to the boron layer,"
      Penev said. "The magnesium acts to dope the material by spilling
      some electrons into the boron layer. In this case, we don't need
      them because the 2-D boron is already metallic."<br>
      <br>
      Penev suggested that isolating 2-D boron between layers of inert
      hexagonal boron nitride (aka "white graphene") might help
      stabilize its superconducting nature.<br>
      <br>
      Without the availability of a block of time on several large
      government supercomputers, the study would have taken a lot
      longer, Yakobson said. "Alex did the heavy lifting on the
      computational work," he said. "To turn it from a lunchtime
      discussion into a real quantitative research result took a very
      big effort."<br>
      <br>
      The paper is the first by Yakobson's group on the topic of
      superconductivity, though Penev is a published author on the
      subject. "I started working on superconductivity in 1993, but it
      was always kind of a hobby, and I hadn't done anything on the
      topic in 10 years," Penev said. "So this paper brings it full
      circle."<br>

      Two-dimensional boron is expected to exhibit various structural
      polymorphs, all being metallic. Additionally, its small atomic
      mass suggests strong electron–phonon coupling, which in turn can
      enable superconducting behavior. Here we perform first-principles
      analysis of electronic structure, phonon spectra, and
      electron–phonon coupling of selected 2D boron polymorphs and show
      that the most stable structures predicted to feasibly form on a
      metal substrate should also exhibit intrinsic phonon-mediated
      superconductivity, with estimated critical temperature in the
      range of Tc ≈ 10–20 K.<br>

      The Earth's magnetic field permanently protects us from the
      charged particles and radiation that originate in the Sun. This
      shield is produced by the geodynamo, the rapid motion of huge
      quantities of liquid iron alloy in the Earth's outer core. To
      maintain this magnetic field until the present day, the classical
      model required the Earth's core to have cooled by around 3,000 °C
      over the past 4.3 billion years. Now, a team of researchers from
      CNRS and Université Blaise Pascal[1] suggests that, on the
      contrary, its temperature has fallen by only 300 °C. The action of
      the Moon, overlooked until now, is thought to have compensated for
      this difference and kept the geodynamo active. Their work is
      published on 30 march 2016 in the journal Earth and Planetary

      <b><br>
      </b><b>Background</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Low-swirl combustion (LSC) is an aerodynamic flame stabilization
      method discovered in 1991at the Lawrence Berkeley National
      Laboratory. Originally intended as as a burner for basic research,
      its turbulent flowfield and flame properties have been
      investigated by laser diagnostic. The analysis showed that the
      basic LSC principle is fundamentally different than the
      conventional high-swirl combustion method and defies many
      established notions on turbulent flame properties and burner
      engineering concepts.<br>
      <br>
      Due to its exceptional capability to burn ultra lean flames that
      emit very low levels of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), the novel
      low-swirl combustion method has evolved into a simple and robust
      ultra-low emissions combustion technology for burners in
      industrial heaters and in gas turbines for electricity production.<br>
      <br>
      Low-swirl combustion can be implemented in two ways. The original
      approach uses small jets to create the swirling motion. The
      low-swirl burner (LSB) developed for heaters and gas turbines uses
      a patented vane-swirler <b>.<br>
        <br>
      </b>
      <div align="center"><b><img alt="" src="LSI-Labeled.jpg"
            height="326" width="368"></b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Basic knowledge gained from the laboratory studies has provided
      the scientific underpinning to develop an analytical model,
      scaling laws and engineering guidelines for adapting the LSB to
      various combustion devices. The LSB remains a mainstay for
      fundamental research and a growing number of researchers
      world-wide are using the LSB to investigate the fundamental
      turbulent flame processes.<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      The low-swirl burner is scalable. The smallest (left) in
      development for residential furnaces is 1 inch in diameter. The
      largest LSB in development for industrial heating by Maxon (right)
      is 28 inches in diameter. Regardless of the burner sizes, their
      performances in terms of turndown, efficiency, and pollutant
      emissions are the same. Residential appliances contribute to a
      significant amount of air pollution in the urban areas. These
      commodity products cannot afford the sophisticated and expensive
      pollution reduction technologies developed for the larger
      commercial and industrial systems. A simple and truly affordable
      ultra-low emission burner such as the LSB will help these
      appliances to meet the very stringent emissions standard being
      implemented in large metropolitan areas world-wide.<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      NOx emissions from a low-swirl fuel-injector assembly (LSI)
      developed for Solar Turbines' T70 gas turbine are about 2.5 times
      less than the levels emitted by the company's current SoLoNOx
      injector (HSI) that uses the conventional high-swirl burner
      concept. The NOx emissions data were obtained with single injector
      tests at partial and full load conditions. A set of LSI was also
      tested in an engine and produced equally encouraging results.
      (Figures shows NOx data reported in Johnson et. al., 2005)<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Technology Transfer</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science's Laboratory
      Technology Research program supported the first commercial
      development of the LSB. The small 2" diameter burner was
      engineered for residential natural gas water heaters of 50 KBtu/hr
      (15kW) and lowered the NOx emissions from well over 120 ppm to
      below 10 ppm without compromising the efficiency. A significant
      finding was that the small LSB has a very high turndown (i.e.
      ratio of the maximum to minimum power outputs). It is capable of
      operating at up to 2 MMBtu/hr (600 kW). The exceptionally high
      40:1 turndown is unmatched by other low-NOx burner technologies
      and show that the LSB is scalable to the larger sizes for
      industrial processes.<br>
      <br>
      Under the support of California Institute of Energy Efficiency and
      DOE's Industrial Technology Program at the Office Energy
      Efficiency and Renewable Energy, the LSB was scaled to the large
      sizes and demonstrated successfully in natural gas furnaces and
      boilers. Maxon Corp. of Muncie IN introduce the first commercial
      LSB product in 2003. Currently, the company has two lines of LSB
      products from 300 KBtu/hr (90kW) to 120 MMBtu/hr (35 MW) all
      emitting less than 9 ppm NOx (corrected to 3 %O2) while delivering
      exceptionally high performance of 10-15:1 turndown.<br>
      <br>
      Subsequent LSB developments targeted gas turbines that utilize
      natural gas for generating electricity in utility power plants,
      and in industrial and manufacturing sites. DOE's Distributed
      Energy Resources at the Office of Electricity supported LBNL and
      Solar Turbines of San Diego, CA to adapt the LSB to small gas
      turbines of 5 to 7 MW electricity output. These gas turbines
      operate at pressure of up to 15 atmospheres and temperature
      exceeding 400 C. The first challenge was to proof that the LSC
      method is operable at these conditions. The second is to engineer
      the LSB to operating in a gas turbine system. Since a vane-swirler
      is a standard component of the high-swirl burner used in gas
      turbines, a decision was made to fast track the development by
      converting Solar Turbines' current high-swirl burner to operate in
      the low-swirl mode. The conversion was successful and produced a
      low-swirl fuel injector (LSI) that is a retrofit of the current
      SoLoNOx high swirl fuel injector (HSI). The LSI helps reduce the
      NOx emissions to below 5 ppm (corrected to 15 % O2) (see chart on
      the right). The team was honored by a RD100 Award in 2007.<br>
      <br>
      The LSB has also been adapted to smaller microturbines of 100kW
      electricity output. The development was supported by California
      Energy Commission (CEC) as part of a Combined-Heat-and-Power
      project led by CMC Engineering of Sunnyvale CA. The microturbine
      is an integral component of a boiler system to produce electricity
      for powering the air blower of a large boiler burner. CEC is also
      supporting a new development and demonstration of a microturbine
      that operates on digester waste gas from a water treatment plant
      in Oakland CA.<br>
      <br>
      With increasing concern regarding the impact of energy use on
      global climate change, fuel-flexibility has become a critical
      requirement of next-generation gas turbines. The US Department of
      Energy's Office of Fossil Energy is supporting the research to
      extend the LSB technology to a variety of fuels including syngas
      and hydrogen for utility size turbines of over 200 MW electricity
      output. This is one of manyprojects in a large effort to develop
      Near-Zero Emissions Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC)
      Coal Power Plants. For the hydrogen fueled gas turbines in these
      power plants, DOE sets a very aggressive goal of less than 2 ppm
      NOx operation on syngas and up to 90% pure hydrogen at 2500-2600F
      (1371 - 1426 C) turbine firing temperatures. Burning of hydrogen
      in a gas turbine presents significant technical and engineering
      challenges because of the high reactivity of hydrogen, its fast
      flame speed, and the propensity of the H2/air mixture to
      auto-ignite and explode. Many conventional approaches may not work
      without diluting the fuel/air mixture with inert gases or exhaust
      gas NOx cleanup with catalysts.<br>
      <br>
      The development of LSB for H2 is guided by the scientific
      principles of the LSC method. An analytical model has been applied
      to understand the changes in the LSB flame when switching from
      natural gas to hydrogen. Preliminary laboratory tests results are
      very encouraging and show that the basic LSB design accepts fuels
      from pure natural gas to over 90% H2 at simulated gas turbine
      conditions while meeting the &lt; 2 ppm NOx target. Another
      important finding is that the model predicts the changes in the
      LSB flames with fuel contents to confirm its validity as a basis
      for scaling and system adaptation. However, significant amount of
      R&amp;D effort is still required to make LSB a reality in hydrogen
      fueled gas turbines. It will require a gas turbine manufacturer to
      lead the development and address the operational and safety
      issues. The basic knowledge on LSC will be an advantage to help
      the gas turbine manufacturers to overcome the challenges
      associated with the very energetic hydrogen flames.<br>
      <br>
      The low-swirl burner remains cool to the touch because the lifted
      flame does not heat up its body. The lifted flame was thought to
      be highly undesirable because in other burners it signifies
      unstable flame behaviors. But the unique divergent flowfield of
      the LSB allows the lifted flame to self-adjust and remain robust
      at the very lean conditions where NOx emissions are at their
      minimum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="Cheng.jpg" height="362"
          width="250"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The flowlines through the LSB flame shows that there is no flow
      reversal (i.e. flow recirculation) in the vicinity of the flame.
      The flowlines spread-out below the flame to indicate flow
      divergence. Color contours in the background show that the
      disruptive turbulent shear-stresses are insignificant near the
      flame. The velocity data was obtained by a method called Particle
      Image Velocity on a lean methane air flame similar to the one
      shown in the picture above. The studies of laboratory flamse
      provided the scientific background to develop a top-order model
      and scaling laws for adaptation of LSB to different combustion
      systems &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <b>How It Works</b><br>
      <br>
      Lean premixed combustion is the foundation for the technologies in
      almost all modern low-emissions combustion equipment. It burns
      gaseous fuels mixed thoroughly with an amount of air that exceeds
      the quantity needed to consume the fuel (i.e. excessive air
      combustion or fuel lean combustion). This is an approach that
      deliberately weakens the flame to inhibit NOx formation by lower
      the flame temperature. Weakening the flame has many undesirable
      consequences including high carbon monoxide (CO) emissions,
      incomplete combustion, and most significantly, flame instability
      that can trigger severe pressure oscillations to damage or cripple
      the engines and equipment. LSB can harness these undesirable side
      effects to take fully advantage of lean premixed combustion.<br>
      <br>
      Until now, premixed burners have used the high-swirl flame
      stabilization method, which evolved from the non-premixed
      combustion technology found in older and more polluting combustion
      systems. This traditional method uses a recirculating region (i.e.
      back flow or reversed flow) to trap and retain a portion of the
      hot combustion products to ignite fresh reactants. Generations of
      combustion engineers have been trained to design burners with
      swirl intensities well above the vortex breakdown threshold to
      ensure strong recirculation. Combustion researchers are still
      developing theories and computational methods on high-swirl flames
      to predict the strengths and size of the recirculation zone to
      support the engineering designs.<br>
      <br>
      The LSB adopts the opposite approach by operating at swirl
      intensity well below the vortex breakdown threshold. It produces a
      non-recirculating flow characterized by a flow divergence region
      where the axial flow velocity decays linearly with the distance
      away from the burner exit. The lean premixed turbulent flame
      self-propels and burns its most natural state without being
      influenced or restrained by the turbulent shear stresses
      associated with flow recircluation. The operating principle
      exploits the most fundamental property of premixed combustion -
      the premixed flame behaves as a "propagating wave" that moves
      through and consumes the reactants at a flame speed controlled by
      mixture composition, and turbulence intensity. The divergence rate
      of the LSB can be aerodynamically "tuned" to accommodate the
      turbulent flame speed. And turbulence intensity provides the
      feedback for the flame to burn faster and slower with load change.
      This theory is fundamentally different than the flame-holding
      approach of the traditional high-swirl method.<br>
      <br>
      The LSB show in the photograph at the top of this web page has a
      simple design that features an annulus vane swirler surrounding a
      cylindrical center channel. The center channel allows a portion of
      the reactants to pass without being swirled. The centrifugal
      forces of the swirling flow acting on the un-swirling center core
      create flow divergence downstream of the exit. In the figure shown
      to the left, the divergent nature of the flowfield in the
      nearfield region at x &lt; 10 mm is illustrated by streamlines
      that spread outward above x = 0. The rate of flow divergence, i.e.
      the spreading rate, is a LSB design parameter proportional to the
      ratio of the unswirled and the swirled flows. Flow divergence
      creates a flowfield where the axial velocity decays linearly with
      increasing x. When the velocity at the exit is maintained higher
      than the turbulent flame speed, ST, the flame rides on this
      velocity "down-ramp" and self propels at the position where the
      local flow velocity is equal and opposite to ST.<br>
      <br>
      The divergence rate is adjustable via the parameters that define
      the LSI swirl number in Eq. 1. Here a is the vane angle, R =
      Rc/Ri, where Rc and Ri are the corresponding radii of the
      center-channel and the burner, and m= mc/msrepresents the
      flow-split between the unswirled and the swirled flow passages
      where mc and ms are respectively the mass fluxes through the
      center-channel and the swirl annulus. The presence of m in Eq 1
      distinguishes it from the swirl number definition for high-swirl
      burners. When m = 0, i.e. no flow through the center, Eq 1 reduces
      to the swirl number definition for high-swirl burner. m in a LSB
      can be controlled by placing a perforated plate over the open
      center-channel to create aerodynamic drag. m is then the ratio of
      the drag coefficients (or pressure drops) for the perforated plate
      and the swirl vanes. A convenient means to vary the LSB swirl
      number, S, is by changing the blockage ratios or hole sizes of the
      perforated plate.<br>
      <br>
      The engineering guideline for the LSB is specified in terms of a
      range of swirl number (0.4 &lt; S &lt; 0.55), and swirler recess
      (2 &lt; Li/Ri &lt; 3). Typically, two of the three parameters in
      Eq 1 are fixed by the swirler geometry. To meet the design
      criteria, perforated screens with blockages of 30 to 60% are used
      to render S within the design range. To a casual observer, the LSB
      has a striking resemblance to the high-swirl burner. The key and
      fundamental difference is the high-swirl burner has only one flow
      passage, and its solid centerbody promotes flow recirculation in
      its wake. When the centerbody is removed and replaced by an open
      channel, the unswirled flow in the center of the LSB prevents
      vortex breakdown to inhibit recirculation.<br>
      <br>
      The most distinct characteristic of the LSB is a detached flame
      that is lifted above its exit. This feature is quite unnerving to
      engineers who consider lifted flames to be inherently unstable
      because they learned from combustion texts that flame detachment
      from the flame holder is a prelude to combustion instability and
      flame out. The LSB countered this notion by demonstrating that a
      change from recirculating to non-recirculating flow offer stable
      operation over a wider range of conditions including those that
      achieve near zero emissions levels of &lt; 2 ppm NOx and CO. This
      exceptional performance is due to a coupling of the self-similar
      feature of the divergent flowfield and a linear correlation of the
      flame speed with turbulence intensity as expressed in a top-order
      analytical model. As flow velocity changes with load (i.e. power
      output), the structure of the divergent flow remains unchanged due
      to self-similarity but turbulence level increases and decreases
      accordingly. The flame "rides" the divergent flow and burns faster
      or slower in synchronous with the flow velocity because turbulence
      gives the critical feedback to the flame. The net effect is the
      flame remaining stationary regardless of the variation in the flow
      velocity. This is a unique auto-adjusting mechanism that allows
      the LSB to support very lean flames that emit very low
      concentrations of pollutants.<br>
      <br>
      The self-similar flowfield of the LSB also accommodates the
      changes in flame properties associated with the use of different
      gaseous fuels. Due to the variation in chemical properties, some
      fuels burn faster than others. Hydrogen is among the fastest
      burning fuels and the premixed hydrogen flames respond more
      readily to turbulence than natural gas flames. This is expressed
      by the value of the turbulent flame speed correlation parameter
      for hydrogen being two times higher than the values for methane or
      natural gas flames. According to the top-order model, a change in
      the value of the turbulent flame correlation parameter implies a
      change in the flame position. Recent laboratory studies of LSB
      flames with methane and hydrogen flames at standard atmospheric
      and gas turbine conditions have provided the data to support the
      modeling prediction. These results shows that the flame/flowfield
      couping processes described by the model is valid at gas turbine
      conditions. Such knowledge is important for future development of
      the LSB technology for the hydrogen turbines in near-zero
      emissions coal power plants.<br>

      tangential swirl-air jets at the base of the burner are turned on
      they produce the divergent flowfield to allow the flame to

      </b><b>NATURAL DRAFT LOW SWIRL BURNER</b><b><br>
      </b><b>US2014230701</b><br>
      A new design for a low swirl burner is disclosed in which natural
      draft rather than a motorized pump is used to move a fuel-air
      mixture through the burner. This new design enables the burn off
      of gas at refineries in an environment where electric motors
      cannot be used because of the potential for sparks, which could
      trigger explosions. Additional modifications to the burner,
      including the introduction of flue gas to the burner allows for
      the reduction of NOx gas to meet current emission control targets,
      without the need for further post combustion emission control
      systems.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Mechanical swirler for a low-NOx, weak-swirl burner</b><b><br>
      </b><b>US5879148</b><br>
      Disclosed is a mechanical swirler for generating diverging flow in
      lean premixed fuel burners. The swirler of the present invention
      includes a central passage with an entrance for accepting a feed
      gas, a flow balancing insert that introduces additional pressure
      drop beyond that occurring in the central passage in the absence
      of the flow balancing insert, and an exit aligned to direct the
      feed gas into a combustor. The swirler also has an annular passage
      about the central passage and including one or more vanes oriented
      to impart angular momentum to feed gas exiting the annular
      passage. The diverging flow generated by the swirler stabilizes
      lean combustion thus allowing for lower production of pollutants,
      particularly oxides of nitrogen.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ultralean low swirl burner</b><b><br>
      </b><b>US5735681</b><br>
      A novel burner and burner method has been invented which burns an
      ultra lean premixed fuel-air mixture with a stable flame. The
      inventive burning method results in efficient burning and much
      lower emissions of pollutants such as oxides of nitrogen than
      previous burners and burning methods. The inventive method imparts
      weak swirl (swirl numbers of between about 0.01 to 3.0) on a
      fuel-air flow stream. The swirl, too small to cause recirculation,
      causes an annulus region immediately inside the perimeter of the
      fuel-air flow to rotate in a plane normal to the axial flow. The
      rotation in turn causes the diameter of the fuel-air flow to
      increase with concomitant decrease in axial flow velocity. The
      flame stabilizes where the fuel-air mixture velocity equals the
      rate of burning resulting in a stable, turbulent flame.<br>

      <br>
      &nbsp;It just so happened that many of us would like to know in
      advance what will happen to them, because being forewarned is
      being forearmed. But how can you predict the future not only for a
      particular person, but all over the world? For all history of
      existence of humanity such abilities have been possessed by
      people. One of these unique seers was Wolf Messing. With those
      penetrating eyes he looked through time and space, and all that he
      foresaw, was absolutely accurate. For example, he called Joseph
      Stalin's true date of the end of world war II.<br>
      <br>
      But the seer was able not only to look a few years ahead, but even
      more than half a century. For the coming 2016 he also left his
      message. In it the famous psychic speaks to the three countries,
      which will experience the most significant changes.<br>
      <br>
      So, according to him, this year the USA will cease to be a
      superpower, and will be brought down from this position, causing
      the country to be overlooked. That is, to be in such a state which
      no one seriously thinks of America as an opponent. It will inflict
      a crushing blow to the US economy, after which it will simply
      collapse. But 2016 will be not only fatal for the United States.
      According to Messing, Japan, together with Taiwan, is waiting for
      the strongest impact, comparable only with a nuclear one. Where it
      will come down on them, the predictor did not elaborate, but added
      that the country will suffer huge financial and human losses.<br>
      <br>
      Messing's watchful eye has not, of course, bypassed Russia. For
      her, he predicted difficult times. According to him, she will give
      way to China's force in the territory, but whether voluntarily or
      in the course of hostilities, the seer didn't specify. But this
      circumstance does not adversely affect her power, but to the
      contrary. In this year, according to him, Russia will become the
      most spiritual and influential power in the world.<br>
      <br>

      <div align="center"><b> Messing Predictions for 2015</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Messing predictions about the future for the three countries. So
      he predicts that in 2015 the United States will no longer be a
      superpower, because it shifts the aggressor, which no one has yet
      considered a serious contender. Most likely, we are talking about
      China, which will be able in just a few months to get their hands
      on the global economy.<br>
      <br>
      Predictions about the future of Wolf Messing say that the United
      States will come under the influence of a protracted crisis of
      powerful commodity-money strike. It will be the beginning of the
      end is the most developed economy in the world.<br>
      <br>
      The predictions for 2015 Messing mentions that Japan and Taiwan
      expect a strong destructive nuclear strike. And as mentioned
      above, Russia will be forced to cede part of its territory to the
      Chinese. <br>

      Historians of the future, roasting rat kabobs over their
      campfires, will look back at the year 2016 and marvel at the death
      throes of the zombie republic that died eating its own brains.
      This grotesque Deep State lumbers from one misadventure of
      governance to the next consuming its prospects for a plausible
      future in a fugue of autophagy, inducing the great nausea that now
      settles over the land.<br>
      <br>
      President Trump — really? We would be lucky if it only resulted in
      a revolt of the generals, and there goes 200-plus years of
      institutional heritage. Yet it cannot be denied that the Deep
      State needs to be kicked to the curb, stomped, water-boarded, and
      hung out to dry. The sad part is that the job might have been done
      by men of character, but incredibly the long-vaunted baby boomer
      generation did not manage to produce any, nor the so-called Gen-X
      now coming into its own power. And if such hypothetical figures do
      exist, why are they hiding in the thickets of public life?<br>
      <br>
      Well, there is Bernie, after all. Credit must be given to this
      lone crusader for at least opposing the avatar of the Deep State,
      she whose “turn” must not be denied in the rotating management of
      rackets-and-grift that our politics have sunk to. He thrashed her
      roundly in the three primary contests over the weekend — so badly
      in the vote count that she may be suffering an existential
      hangover as I write. The fabled Democratic Party super-delegates
      may also be going through a dark night of the soul as they study
      the intractable anti-charisma of Hillary. Much as I admire
      Bernie’s chutzpah, his particular Old Left theories of wealth
      redistribution do not convince me — though the management of our
      dwindling capital surely lies at the heart of our problems. His
      nomination would go down in the Ripley’s Believe-It-Or-Not annals
      of the world’s greatest improbabilities.<br>
      <br>
      Otherwise, the latest meme spreading across the web wires is how
      deeply the voters divide by sex: men flocking around Trump (or
      Machine Gun Ted Cruz), and the ladies standing at each mighty
      column of Hillary’s azure pant-suit. Yes, a national war of the
      sexes. Just what we need with all our shit falling apart. This
      sorry diversion results not from the triumph of feminism, as
      widely believed, but actually from the failure of American
      manhood. Proof of that, of course, is the ascendance of Trump,
      this punch-line of a political leader with all the gravitas of a
      hood ornament. History repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as
      farce — thank you, Karl Marx, O peevish mischief-maker squirming
      upon your fabled boils!<br>
      <br>
      Finally, what will take the Deep State down is not some
      lance-wielding armored savior on a white horse but the awful
      undertow of financial implosion that awaits as the seasons of 2016
      turn. When faith in our money and the instruments represented in
      it goes, look out below. There are so many rifts in the
      international banking system that the vista begins to look like
      the spring ice break-up on the Lake of Nations. When the grifters
      can’t cash their checks — or move their pixels into the accounts
      receivable column — they will be immobilized. Of course, if that
      happens, so will everything else, including your ability to buy
      any more frozen pizzas.<br>
      <br>
      Trump, Cruz, Hillary, and Bernie are signs that this poor
      paralyzed country needs to go through a convulsion to flush out
      all the toxic idiocy of this historical moment. Trigger warning:
      it may be the messiest revolution in history when it finally
      comes, there is so much dross to clear out of the system. Trump
      and Hillary are like two giant fistulas obstructing the national
      bowel. Of course, a lot of sentient Americans do not want their
      nation dying on the toilet like Elvis. The indignity of it! In the
      name of the founding fathers, please, someone, fetch the enema
      bag.<br>
      <br>
      Events still lie hidden like bear traps on the path to “Decision
      2016” as they like to say on the cable networks. Somewhere in
      London, Singapore, Shanghai, or New York, a 25-year-old coked-out
      Forex trader is going to tap the untoward keystroke that brings
      down a derivatives avalanche… or two brothers of Allah in some
      Berlin row-house will go forth one bright morning in vests of
      Semtex… and finally enough will be enough.<br>
