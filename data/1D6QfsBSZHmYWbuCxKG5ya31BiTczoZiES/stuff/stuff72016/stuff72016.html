      It might sound like a silly idea, but it turns out that drawing
      eyes on the rumps of cattle might deter lions from attacking and
      prevent human retaliation against the mighty predators.<br>
      <br>
      It sounds like a strategy to protect the poor cattle, but the idea
      is actually to protect endangered African lions from human
      retaliation. The majestic felines are on the IUCN Red List of
      Threatened Species, with numbers currently in the range of 23,000
      to 39,000 and rapidly declining. “As protected conservation areas
      become smaller, lions are increasingly coming into contact with
      human populations, which are expanding to the boundaries of these
      protected areas,” says Dr Neil Jordan, a conservation biologist
      from UNSW’s Centre for Ecosystem Science. The lions attack
      livestock, and with no non-lethal way of protecting their
      livelihood farmers often shoot or poison the predators in
      retaliation.<br>
      <br>
      To help humans and their cattle coexist with lions, Jordan has
      come up with a low-cost strategy that he hopes will prevent
      attacks and retaliatory violence. The idea behind painting a pair
      of intimidating eyes on the rumps of cows is that they will trick
      the lions into thinking they’ve been spotted, causing them to
      abandon the hunt. Scientists know that being seen can deter some
      species from attacking their prey. For example, Indian woodcutters
      have long been wearing worn masks on the back of their heads to
      trick man-eating tigers that they’ve been spotted, and butterflies
      with eye-patterns on their wings ward off predatory birds...<br>

      Translation technology has just reached a whole new level with
      ‘Pilot’ – the world’s first smart earpiece that can translate
      foreign languages in real time. So two people who speak different
      languages can actually understand each other using Pilot, and
      engage in a normal conversation.<br>
      <br>
      Developed by New York-based Waverly Labs, Pilot is a three-part
      system – two small Bluetooth earbuds, one for each interlocutor,
      and a smartphone app doing the actual translation. So you and this
      other person speak normally – each in your own language – and the
      Waverly Labs app translates and sends a voice with the other
      person’s speech to the earpiece. There will obviously be some
      delay, so it’s not exactly real time, but it’s pretty close. The
      initial version will support a number of European languages
      (English, Spanish, French, Italian). Other languages, like Hindi,
      Semitic, East Asian, Arabic, Slavic, and African will be included
      in subsequent versions, but you’ll have to pay for them, unless
      you preorder the system.<br>

      <br>
      Monash University researchers have brought next generation energy
      storage closer with an engineering first - a graphene-based device
      that is compact, yet lasts as long as a conventional battery. <br>
      <br>
      Published today in Science, a research team led by Professor Dan
      Li of the Department of Materials Engineering has developed a
      completely new strategy to engineer graphene-based supercapacitors
      (SC), making them viable for widespread use in renewable energy
      storage, portable electronics and electric vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      SCs are generally made of highly porous carbon impregnated with a
      liquid electrolyte to transport the electrical charge. Known for
      their almost indefinite lifespan and the ability to re-charge in
      seconds, the drawback of existing SCs is their low
      energy-storage-to-volume ratio - known as energy density. Low
      energy density of five to eight Watt-hours per litre, means SCs
      are unfeasibly large or must be re-charged frequently.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Li's team has created an SC with energy density of 60
      Watt-hours per litre - comparable to lead-acid batteries and
      around 12 times higher than commercially available SCs. <br>
      <br>
      "It has long been a challenge to make SCs smaller, lighter and
      compact to meet the increasingly demanding needs of many
      commercial uses," Professor Li said.<br>
      <br>
      Graphene, which is formed when graphite is broken down into layers
      one atom thick, is very strong, chemically stable and an excellent
      conductor of electricity.<br>
      <br>
      To make their uniquely compact electrode, Professor Li's team
      exploited an adaptive graphene gel film they had developed
      previously. They used liquid electrolytes - generally the
      conductor in traditional SCs - to control the spacing between
      graphene sheets on the sub-nanometre scale. In this way the liquid
      electrolyte played a dual role: maintaining the minute space
      between the graphene sheets and conducting electricity. <br>
      <br>
      Unlike in traditional 'hard' porous carbon, where space is wasted
      with unnecessarily large 'pores', density is maximised without
      compromising porosity in Professor Li's electrode.<br>
      <br>
      To create their material, the research team used a method similar
      to that used in traditional paper making, meaning the process
      could be easily and cost-effectively scaled up for industrial use.
      <br>
      <br>
      "We have created a macroscopic graphene material that is a step
      beyond what has been achieved previously. It is almost at the
      stage of moving from the lab to commercial development," Professor
      Li said.<br>
      <br>
      The work was supported by the Australian Research Council.<br>

      Electrochemical capacitors (ECs) can rapidly charge and discharge,
      but generally store less energy per unit volume than batteries.
      One approach for improving on the EC electrodes made from porous
      carbon materials is to use materials such as chemically converted
      graphene (CCG, or reduced graphene oxide), in which intrinsic
      corrugation of the sheets should maintain high surface areas. In
      many cases, however, these materials do not pack into compact
      electrodes, and any ECs containing them have low energy densities.
      Yang et al. (p. 534) now show that capillary compression of gels
      of CCG containing both a volatile and nonvolatile electrolyte
      produced electrodes with a high packing density. The intersheet
      spacing creates a continuous ion network and leads to high energy
      densities in prototype ECs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Porous yet densely packed carbon electrodes with high
      ion-accessible surface area and low ion transport resistance are
      crucial to the realization of high-density electrochemical
      capacitive energy storage but have proved to be very challenging
      to produce. Taking advantage of chemically converted graphene’s
      intrinsic microcorrugated two-dimensional configuration and
      self-assembly behavior, we show that such materials can be readily
      formed by capillary compression of adaptive graphene gel films in
      the presence of a nonvolatile liquid electrolyte. This simple soft
      approach enables subnanometer scale integration of graphene sheets
      with electrolytes to form highly compact carbon electrodes with a
      continuous ion transport network. Electrochemical capacitors based
      on the resulting films can obtain volumetric energy densities
      approaching 60 watt-hours per liter.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Stanford Study Reveals Which Canned
            Food Is Most Dangerous to Your Health</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A Stanford University study finds that canned soups raise BPA
      levels far more than other canned foods.<br>
      <br>
      A new study reveals which canned foods are highest in the harmful
      chemical Bisphenol A. It’s commonly known as BPA.<br>
      <br>
      BPA is a hormone disrupter. It binds to hormones, reprogramming
      the cells they target. This leads to an array of health problems.1<br>
      <br>
      BPA is linked to:<br>
      <br>
      Infertility<br>
      Low testosterone<br>
      Obesity<br>
      Type 2 diabetes<br>
      Inflammatory bowel disease<br>
      Heart disease<br>
      Breast and prostate cancers<br>
      <br>
      It is already banned from baby bottles and children’s sippy cups.
      But BPA is still used in the lining of cans to prevent metal
      corrosion and help preserve the food.2<br>
      <br>
      BPA is also found in plastics, dental fillings, water pipes, and
      even sales receipts. While it is almost impossible to totally
      avoid it, there are ways to lessen BPA’s impact on your health.
      Staying away from BPA-laced canned foods is one of the best ways.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers at Stanford University School of Medicine studied data
      on over 7,500 Americans ages 6 and older. The data included what
      each person had eaten in the past 24 hours and the concentration
      of BPA in their urine.<br>
      <br>
      They found that people who consumed just one canned food item had
      a 24% higher concentration of BPA. People who had consumed two or
      more canned foods had a 54% higher concentration of BPA.3<br>
      <br>
      But some canned foods are far worse than others. Stay away from
      soups. They raise BPA levels much higher than other canned foods.<br>
      <br>
      Eating canned soup raises BPA levels by 229%, the study found.
      Canned pastas were next worst at 70%, followed by canned fruits
      and vegetables at 41%.<br>
      <br>
      Why are soups so bad? Researchers say it’s because they require
      more heat for proper sterilization. This leaches more BPA from the
      can lining. Other canned foods, such as fruits and vegetables, are
      acidic and don’t require as much heat sterilization.<br>
      <br>
      The study was published in the journal Environmental Research.<br>
      <br>
      BPA cans are so common, it’s hard to avoid them entirely. If you
      eat in a restaurant, you may not know if you’re getting food from
      a BPA-laden can.<br>
      <br>
      If you do eat canned food products, get the BPA out of your system
      as quickly as possible. Research shows that BPA can linger for
      days, stored in your fat and tissues, wreaking havoc on your
      health.4 But there are simple ways to force it out.<br>
      <br>
      <b>4 Ways to Rid Your Body of BPA</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      &nbsp;Sweat. -- BPA leaves the body through sweat. Take advantage
      of this by exercising, doing hot yoga, or taking a sauna.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Get probiotics. -- Healthy gut bacteria help eliminate BPA.
      Sauerkraut, kimchi, and kefir are all great food sources. Another
      option is a probiotic supplement.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Drink black tea. -- Studies show it combats the unhealthy
      effects of BPA.5<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Melatonin. -- Often used as a sleep aid, a Penn State study
      found this hormone helps the body flush BPA.6 Don’t get the
      synthetic version from a supplement. There are proven, natural
      ways to get more melatonin.<br>
      <br>
      Another option? Some food makers use BPA-free cans. We listed them
      for you recently.<br>
      <br>
      Researcher Jennifer Hartle is the lead author of the Stanford
      study. She says the best way to avoid health problems from BPA is
      to follow one simple rule: “Choose fresh, unpackaged foods

        </b>When a meteor enters the Earth's upper atmosphere it excites
        the air molecules, producing a streak of light and leaving a
        trail of ionization (an elongated paraboloid) behind it tens of
        kilometers long. This ionized trail may persist for less than 1
        second up to several minutes, occasionally. Occurring at heights
        of about 85 to 105 km (50-65 miles), this trail is capable of
        reflecting radio waves from transmitters located on the ground,
        similar to light reflecting from a mirrored surface. Meteor
        radio wave reflections are also called meteor echoes, or pings.<br>

            humans, scientist claims </b></big><br>
      </div>
      <big><b><br>
        </b>A US scientist believes he has discovered clear evidence of
        a lost human ‘sixth sense’ - one similar to that which enables
        animals to navigate the globe by detecting magnetic fields.<br>
        <br>
        For years, planetary scientist Joseph Kirschvink has been trying
        to find a definitive answer to a hotly debated theory that
        suggests humans have an in-built magnetically guided ‘compass’
        sense.<br>
        <br>
        The California Institute of Technology researcher acknowledges
        the topic of ‘magnetoreception’ is scientifically controversial,
        since the theory has “been something of a romping ground for
        quacks and charlatans.”<br>
        <br>
        In 2001, a research team led by Kirschvink described
        magnetite-based magnetoreception as an “attractive hypothesis to
        explain long-distance animal migration.”<br>
        <br>
        “Earth’s magnetic field is the only geophysical signal that
        gives consistent information about position and direction at
        virtually all times and in all environments,” stated the team’s
        paper explaining the background to the phenomenon.<br>
        <br>
        Animals have been found to possess subtle magnetic detecting
        power in previous studies. A 2003 scientific paper, in which
        Kirschvink was also involved, discovered a “magnetic sense” in
        aquatic vertebrates.<br>
        <br>
        However, Kirschvink is now working to publish the findings of an
        admittedly small 24-person experiment which he claims gave a
        result proving once and for all that “humans have functioning
        magnetoreceptors,” report Science Mag.<br>
        <br>
        During the experiment, human test subjects were placed in
        specially designed, darkened space known as a Faraday cage,
        where they were then exposed to a cycle of magnetic fields
        similar to the Earth’s.<br>
        <br>
        Through EEG testing, Kirschvink was able to witness repeated
        active brain responses to the presence of a magnetic field - a
        consistent reaction which up until now has reportedly eluded the
        scientific community.<br>
        <br>
        Speaking to Science Mag, Kirschvink said the sense, which
        happens unconsciously, is “part of our evolutionary history.”<br>
        <br>
        He plans to replicate his findings in the Southern Hemisphere,
        having already repeated the experiment successfully in
        California and Tokyo.<b><br>

        <b>Transcript :<br>
        </b><br>
        Terrorism seems to be everywhere, and it’s getting worse. The
        bad guys have lots of names—ISIS, al Qaeda, Boko Haram—but they
        have one thing in common. They are all killing for a cause:
        Islamic Law known as Sharia.<br>
        <br>
        Sharia is a return to medieval Islam. Sharia demands a Holy War
        called Jihad. The most widely available book of Islamic Law in
        English says: “Jihad means to war against non-Muslims.”<br>
        <br>
        There are two kinds of Jihad. Violent Jihad is horribly simple,
        slaughtering innocents and forcing submission. Violent Jihadists
        want to conquer land for their Caliphate – essentially an
        Islamic State where Sharia Law is supreme.<br>
        <br>
        But there is another kind of Jihad. In their Explanatory
        Memorandum, the Muslim Brotherhood, calls this, “civilization
        jihad,” saying, “The [Muslim Brotherhood] must understand that
        their work in America is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating
        and destroying the Western civilization from within and
        ‘sabotaging’ its miserable house by their hands and the hands of
        the believers…”<br>
        <br>
        Civilization Jihad has the same goal as the Violent Jihad—to
        conquer land for their Caliphate—but instead of waging war or
        staging terror attacks like their brothers in the violent jihad,
        these Civilization Jihadists wear suits and ties, and their work
        is much more subtle.<br>
        <br>
        So what do they do? They file lawsuits for Muslim truck drivers
        who don’t want to drive beer. They convince schools to hold
        Muslim Day, where the girls wear head scarves and the kids say
        Muslim prayers. They complain when our government watches to see
        if their violent buddies are hanging out with them.<br>
        <br>
        They call anyone critical of Islamic Law an “Islamophobe,” a
        term they invented to make people scared to speak out—like the
        neighbors of the terrorists in San Bernardino who knew something
        was wrong, but didn’t want to say anything because they’d be
        accused of profiling.<br>
        <br>
        These bad guys have lots of names, too: the Council on
        American-Islamic Relations (CAIR); the Muslim Student
        Association (MSA); Islamic Society of North America (ISNA). The
        Justice Department found that these groups were, in fact,
        started by the Muslim Brotherhood.<br>
        <br>
        These groups like to say that terrorism has no religion, but
        only Islam has Sharia and Jihad.<br>
        <br>
        Not all Muslims practice Sharia or support it, but an awful lot
        do. They believe that anyone who insults Islam can be killed;
        they believe that women are property; that gaysshould be killed;
        and that little girls should be mutilated and forced to marry
        old men they’ve never men. These things are simply not allowed
        in our free society and are against the Constitution.<br>
        <br>
        There are plenty of Modern Muslims who want to “live and let
        live,” but unfortunately the groups that speak most often for
        the Muslim community follow the medieval version based on
        Sharia.<br>
        <br>
        They are working to make the US more like the Caliphate. They
        have to go.<b><br>

        All along the western Canadian coast, mussels are dying. Their
        blobby bodies are swollen by tumors. The blood-like fluid that
        fills their interiors is clogged with malignant cells. They’re
        all sick with the same thing: cancer. And it seems to be
        spreading. For all its harrowing, terrifying damage, the saving
        grace of cancer has always been that it dies with its host. Its
        destructive power comes from turning victims’ own cells against
        them and making them run amok. But when molecular biologist
        Stephen Goff biopsied these mussels, he found something strange.
        The tumor cells didn’t have the same DNA as their host. Instead,
        every mussel was being killed by the same line of cancerous
        cells, which were jumping from one individual to the next like a
        virus…<br>
        <br>
        National Geographic, Jun 23, 2016: It sounds like the plot of a
        summer horror flick: Malignant cells floating in the sea,
        ferrying infectious cancer everywhere they go. The story is all
        too true, say scientists who’ve made a discovery they call
        “beyond surprising.”… “The evidence indicates that the tumor
        cells themselves are contagious – that they can spread from one
        clam to another in the ocean,” says biochemist and immunologist
        Stephen Goff of Columbia University, co-author, along with
        Michael Metzger of Columbia, of a paper reporting the results in
        the journal Cell. These mussels are one of four species of
        mollusks affected. The mussels at Copper Beach in West
        Vancouver, Canada, are infected with the disease. This week the
        team reported new findings in the journal Nature. The
        transmissible cancer has been discovered in… mussels (Mytilus
        trossulus) in West Vancouver… Mytilus trossulus is the main
        native intertidal mussel in the northern Pacific. In North
        America, it’s found from California to Alaska… The cancer, it’s
        believed, originated in one unfortunate mollusk. It’s
        astounding, Goff says, that a leukemia that has killed countless
        clams traces to one incidence of the disease… What will happen
        in other mollusk species?&nbsp; Ominously, says Goff, “It’s too
        soon to know.”<br>
        <br>
        University of British Columbia, Jun 23, 2016: 1st contagious
        cancer that spreads between species — UBC scientists were
        involved in research that found the first contagious cancer that
        can spread between species, CBC News reported. The leukemia-like
        disease seems to be widespread among shellfish with hinged
        shells, or bivalves, like clams, mussels and cockles.
        Environment Canada scientists worked with UBC researchers to
        collect mussels in West Vancouver and Esquimalt, B.C. and test
        them for cancer.<b><br>

      <big><b><br>
          Inventor(s): HUALUN DENG<br>
          <br>
        </b>The invention discloses a Chinese medicinal herb composition
        for treating malaria. The Chinese medicinal herb composition is
        characterized by comprising the following raw materials in part
        by weight: 25 to 35 parts of bupleurum root, 25 to 35 parts of
        ginseng, 25 to 35 parts of baical skullcap root, 15 to 25 parts
        of pinellia tuber, 10 to 20 parts of dried ginger, 15 to 25
        parts of red date, 15 to 25 parts of magnolia obavata, 15 to 25
        parts of kudzuvine root, 15 to 25 parts of notopterygium root,
        15 to 25 parts of antifeverile dichroa root, 15 to 25 parts of
        Mongolian snakegourd root and 25 to 35 parts of oven earth; and
        the components are decocted trice by adding 1,200 parts of
        water, the decoction is filtered and reclaimed, and juice is
        taken, bottled and sterilized at a high temperature for later
        use. The bupleurum root is taken as a monarch; the ginseng and
        the baical skullcap root are taken as ministers; the pinellia
        tuber, the dried ginger, the red date and the magnolia obavata
        are taken as assistants; and the kudzuvine root, the
        notopterygium root, the antifeverile dichroa root, the Mongolian
        snakegourd root and the oven earth are taken as guides. The
        Chinese medicinal herb composition for treating the malaria has
        the advantages of good effect, convenient manufacture and use,
        safety and no side effect, treats the malaria by compromising,
        dispersing and removing evil and pestilence, and is an ideal
        medicament for treating the malaria.<br>

      <big><b><br>
        </b>Are pomegranates really the superfood we've been led to
        believe will counteract the aging process? Up to now, scientific
        proof has been fairly weak. And some controversial marketing
        tactics have led to skepticism as well. A team of scientists
        from EPFL and the company Amazentis wanted to explore the issue
        by taking a closer look at the secrets of this plump pink fruit.
        They discovered that a molecule in pomegranates, transformed by
        microbes in the gut, enables muscle cells to protect themselves
        against one of the major causes of aging. In nematodes and
        rodents, the effect is nothing short of amazing. Human clinical
        trials are currently underway, but these initial findings have
        already been published in the journal Nature Medicine.<br>
        <br>
        As we age, our cells increasingly struggle to recycle their
        powerhouses. Called mitochondria, these inner compartments are
        no longer able to carry out their vital function, thus
        accumulate in the cell. This degradation affects the health of
        many tissues, including muscles, which gradually weaken over the
        years. A buildup of dysfunctional mitochondria is also suspected
        of playing a role in other diseases of aging, such as
        Parkinson's disease.<br>
        <b><br>
          One molecule plays David against the Goliath of aging<br>
          <br>
        </b>The scientists identified a molecule that, all by itself,
        managed to re-establish the cell's ability to recycle the
        components of the defective mitochondria: urolithin A. "It's the
        only known molecule that can relaunch the mitochondrial clean-up
        process, otherwise known as mitophagy," says Patrick Aebischer,
        co-author on the study. "It's a completely natural substance,
        and its effect is powerful and measurable."<br>
        <br>
        The team started out by testing their hypothesis on the usual
        suspect: the nematode C. elegans. It's a favorite test subject
        among aging experts, because after just 8-10 days it's already
        considered elderly. The lifespan of worms exposed to urolithin A
        increased by more than 45% compared with the control group.<br>
        <br>
        These initial encouraging results led the team to test the
        molecule on animals that have more in common with humans. In the
        rodent studies, like with C. elegans, a significant reduction in
        the number of mitochondria was observed, indicating that a
        robust cellular recycling process was taking place. Older mice,
        around two years of age, showed 42% better endurance while
        running than equally old mice in the control group.<b><br>
          <br>
          Human testing underway<br>
        </b><br>
        Before heading out to stock up on pomegranates, however, it's
        worth noting that the fruit doesn't itself contain the miracle
        molecule, but rather its precursor. That molecule is converted
        into urolithin A by the microbes that inhabit the intestine.
        Because of this, the amount of urolithin A produced can vary
        widely, depending on the species of animal and the flora present
        in the gut microbiome. Some individuals don't produce any at
        all. If you're one of the unlucky ones, it's possible that
        pomegranate juice won't do you any good.<br>
        <br>
        For those without the right microbes in their guts, however, the
        scientists are already working on a solution. The study's
        co-authors founded a start-up company, Amazentis, which has
        developed a method to deliver finely calibrated doses of
        urolithin A. The company is currently conducting first clinical
        trials testing the molecule in humans in European hospitals.<br>
        <br>
        Darwin at your service: parallel evolution makes good dinner
        partners According to study co-author Johan Auwerx, it would be
        surprising if urolithin A weren't effective in humans. "Species
        that are evolutionarily quite distant, such as C elegans and the
        rat, react to the same substance in the same way. That's a good
        indication that we're touching here on an essential mechanism in
        living organisms."<br>
        <br>
        Urolithin A's function is the product of tens of millions of
        years of parallel evolution between plants, bacteria and
        animals. According to Chris Rinsch, co-author and CEO of
        Amazentis, this evolutionary process explains the molecule's
        effectiveness: "Precursors to urolithin A are found not only in
        pomegranates, but also in smaller amounts in many nuts and
        berries. Yet for it to be produced in our intestines, the
        bacteria must be able to break down what we're eating. When, via
        digestion, a substance is produced that is of benefit to us,
        natural selection favors both the bacteria involved and their
        host. Our objective is to follow strict clinical validations, so
        that everyone can benefit from the result of these millions of
        years of evolution."<br>
        <br>
        The EPFL scientists' approach provides a whole new palette of
        opportunities to fight the muscular degeneration that takes
        place as we age, and possibly also to counteract other effects
        of aging. By helping the body to renew itself, urolithin A could
        well succeed where so many pharmaceutical products, most of
        which have tried to increase muscle mass, have failed. Auwerx,
        who has also published a recent discovery about the anti-aging
        effects of another molecule in the journal Science, emphasizes
        the game-changing importance of these studies. "The nutritional
        approach opens up territory that traditional pharma has never
        explored. It's a true shift in the scientific paradigm."<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Flying Insects Defy Aerodynamic Laws
            of Airplanes, Courant Researchers Find.</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <big><br>
        The maneuvers of flying insects are unmatched by even the best
        pilots, and this might be due to the fact that these critters
        don’t obey the same aerodynamic laws as airplanes, a team of New
        York University researchers has found.<br>
        <br>
        “We’ve known for quite a while that the aerodynamic theory for
        airplanes doesn’t work so well in predicting the force of lift
        for flapping wings,” says Leif Ristroph, an assistant professor
        at NYU’s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences who directed
        the study. “We found that the drag or wind resistance also
        behaves very differently, and we put together a new law that
        could help explain how insects move through the air.”<br>
        <br>
        “To double its flight speed, an airplane must increase its
        thrust four-fold to counter the stronger wind resistance,”
        Ristroph explains in outlining the law. “In contrast, we found
        that flapping wings have a drag that is in direct proportion to
        its flight speed – to go twice as fast, an insect simply needs
        to double its thrust.”<br>
        <br>
        The study, which appears in the journal Physical Review Fluids,
        also included: Natalie Agre, the lead author and an
        undergraduate in NYU’s College of Arts and Science; Stephen
        Childress, an emeritus professor at the Courant Institute; and
        Jun Zhang, a professor at the Courant Institute and NYU
        Shanghai.<br>
        <br>
        The significance of aerodynamic drag and its strong increase
        with speed has been known since before the Wright brothers took
        flight. This fact is summarized by a mathematical law that
        posits wind resistance increases as the square of speed; hence,
        moving twice as fast requires four times the thrust to overcome
        the higher drag.<br>
        <br>
        Previous studies of flying insects, which beat their wings
        hundreds of times a second, suggested that these creatures do
        not obey this same relationship.<br>
        <br>
        To make this sense of this discrepancy, the researchers in
        Courant’s Applied Math Lab built a robotic wing apparatus for
        measuring the motions, flows, and forces. The apparatus allowed
        the team to compare steady motions of a wing, as would occur for
        airplane flight, to the maneuvers of insects, in which their
        wings flap as they move through air.<br>
        <br>
        The team’s results showed that the back-and-forth motions cause
        the drag to resist the movement in some instances; however, at
        other times the drag is actually directed forward, more like a
        thrust. The net force that results depends on the flight speed
        as well as the flapping motions, all of which the authors
        include in a new drag law.<br>
        <br>
        This law may not be news to insects, which have been flying with
        flapping wings for hundreds of millions of years. But the
        authors think that their findings could help guide the design of
        tiny flying robots that mimic the wing motions of insects. <br>

        </b>...Recently, it was reported that an internal document
        acknowledging that Queen Elizabeth is a shapeshifting reptilian
        was briefly published as a press release on the Royal Family’s
        official website before being abruptly taken down – but not
        before alert internet users captured screenshots of the
        extraordinary article and proof that the press release did
        appear on Google.<br>
        This announcement published on www.Royal.UK leaves one to wonder
        exactly what was meant by the statement,<br>
        <br>
        “Earlier this week the Queen was seen by thousands of people in
        a form they are not acquainted with.&nbsp; We seek to reassure
        the public that the Queen is still the Queen, and remains the

        admission of…&nbsp; something.&nbsp; Could this be the
        disclosure we have been waiting for?<b><br>
          <br>
          Putin’s Account of the Queen<br>
          <br>
        </b>British media reports criticized Vladamir Putin during a
        2014 visit to the Queen because of his refusal to help the
        monarch down the stairs and because he generally kept his
        distance from her.<br>
        <br>
        But, two years later, Putin has revealed why he kept his
        distance from Queen Elizabeth at the gathering. He told close
        associates and aides that he was alarmed when the queen showed
        her true reptilian bloodline colors by shape-shifting a number
        of times while he greeted her.&nbsp; He claimed the queen
        shifted between Reptoid and human form three or four times while
        meeting with Putin.<br>
        <br>
        According to Putin, when the queen revealed her underlying
        Reptilian nature by shape-shifting, her face turned scary, with
        evil-looking slit eyes and a long dragon-like snout. Her skin
        also turned a “grey dish water color.”&nbsp; He also saw the old
        monarch shape-shifting when Obama and New Zealand’s
        Governor-General Jerry Mateparae helped her down the stairs.
        Putin said that when Obama held the queen, her hands turned
        Reptilian green and scaly, and when she smiled, she revealed

          &nbsp;Princess Diana Confided in Friends About Reptilian Queen<br>
          <br>
        </b>Christine Fitzgerald, a brilliant and gifted healer, who was
        a close friend and confidant of Diana for nine years was one
        person to whom Diana told stories of the Queen Mother. Because
        of Christine’s understanding of the esoteric, Diana was able to
        talk to her about matters she would not dare to share with
        anyone else for fear of being called crazy.&nbsp; Her nicknames
        for the Windsors were “the lizards” and “the reptiles” and she
        used to say in all seriousness: “They’re not human”.<br>
        <br>
        Diana told Christine that the Queen Mother was the power behind
        the Windsors, along with Prince Philip, but, Philip was
        subordinate in the hierarchy to the Queen.<br>
        <br>
        “Diana used to tell me that the Queen Mother was evil”,
        Christine Fitzgerald said, “She actually used that word, evil.
        She said she hated the Queen Mother and the Queen Mother hated
        her.”<br>
        <br>
        During her time at Clarence House, before the wedding, Diana
        told Christine she was being given drugs like Valium.&nbsp;
        “They drugged her”, Christine said, “I’m sure of it.&nbsp; They
        had her doped from the start.”<b><br>
          <br>
          Christine’s Own Words<br>
          <br>
        </b>According to Christine:<br>
        <br>
        “The Queen Mother… now that’s a serious piece of wizardry. The
        Queen Mother is a lot older than people think. To be honest, the
        Royal Family hasn’t died for a long time, they have just
        metamorphosised. It’s sort of cloning, but in a different way.
        They take pieces of flesh and rebuild the body from one little
        bit. Because it’s lizard, because it’s cold-blooded, it’s much
        easier for them to do Frankenstein shit than it is for us. The
        different bodies are just different electrical vibrations and
        they have got that secret, they’ve got the secret of the
        micro-currents, it’s so micro, so specific, these radio waves
        that actually create the bodies. These are the energies I work
        with when I’m healing…”<br>
        <br>
        She also commented, “The Queen Mother is ‘Chief Toad’ of this
        part of Europe and they have people like her in each continent.
        Most people, the hangers on, don’t know, you know, about the
        reptiles. They are just in awe of these people because they are
        so powerful.“<br>
        <br>
        Christine went on to say, “Balmoral, [the Queen’s Scottish
        residence] is a very, very nasty place. That’s somewhere they
        want to dig underground. They will find reptile fossils, it goes
        back that far. Don’t think of people like the Queen Mother and
        Queen Victoria, as different people. Think of them as the same
        person, which, after a while has had to replace their coat. When
        the flesh dies, that energy, while it’s dying, will be
        immediately up someone else’s jacksy backside). It’s very
        vampire- worse than vampire!”&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        Christine also explains that fear is their food.&nbsp; The Queen
        Mother and others like her can actually take fear and manifest
        it into a tangible things.&nbsp; The key is the vibrational
        current.&nbsp; “At that vibrational current, they can manifest
        anything from anything. Its like a holographic image. We are all
        minerals and water vibrating. This is all an illusion we are
        living in. That’s the secret. You know when the monarchy’s
        fallen, it’s not the end of it. They will manifest in another
        form. The reptiles have never been defeated and this is the
        closest they have come to it.”<b><br>
          <br>
          Other Witness Accounts<br>
          <br>
        </b>One witness attended what she refers to as a ritual called
        The Awakening of the Bride atthe Queen Mother’s home near
        Buckingham Palace with Diana.&nbsp; The ritual took place the
        first part of July in 1981, before Diana and Charles were
        married.&nbsp; The ritual took place the last seven days of the
        cycle of the Oak Tree, according to esoteric law.&nbsp; The
        ritual is for all females of the 13 bloodlines who were going to
        be in high public positions and marry reptilians to produce the
        new generation of rulers.&nbsp; Many of the royal family were
        present for this ritual, as was Camilla Parker-Bowles.<br>
        Diana was brought in wearing a white gown.&nbsp; It is reported
        that Diana had been drugged.&nbsp; She was told the she should
        consider her union with Prince Charles as only a means to
        produce heirs and nothing else.&nbsp; It was made clear to Diana
        that Camilla was the Prince’s consort.<br>
        <br>
        According to the witness, Prince Philip and the Queen Mother
        then shape-shifted into reptiles.&nbsp; Diana was told that if
        she ever revealed the truth about them, she would be
        killed.&nbsp; There are various reports of people saying Diana
        was about to reveal this information before she died.<br>
        <br>
        The Queen told Diana that “all ears” would be listening to
        everything she said and “all eyes” would forever be watching
        her.&nbsp; She was also told she would never again have the
        honor of attending another ritual and she was not to ask
        questions about them.<br>
        <br>
        Should all the ears and all the eyes now be on the Royal
        Family?&nbsp; Will all the world see them shape shift soon?<br>

            Waves May Cure Alzheimer’s Disease</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <big><br>
        The most effective treatment for Alzheimer’s Disease is gaining
        more notoriety and it’s drug-free. University of Queensland
        researchers have confirmed that non-invasive ultrasound
        technology breaks apart the neurotoxic amyloid plaques that
        result in memory loss and cognitive decline. The treatment is
        now being touted as the cure for the debilitating condition that
        accounts for 70 percent of all cases of dementia.<br>
        <br>
        Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is not genetic. Research is showing the
        incidence is more correlated to excitotoxins and heavy metals
        which play a critical role in the development of several
        neurological disorders, especially in North America.<br>
        <br>
        In the last few decades, almost $40 billion has been spent
        worldwide on trying to develop a breakthrough drug treatment for
        Alzheimer’s, yet no pharmaceutical approach has worked. We could
        not produce anything that could slow it down, let alone stop the
        disease, until now where new research into sound waves is being
        praised as a possible cure.<br>
        <br>
        AD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive
        cognitive impairment. Although the exact cause of AD remains to
        be elucidated, we know that its development is associated with
        brain shrinkage and the formation of characteristic plaques in
        certain areas. These consist of dead cells and a protein known
        as amyloid-beta (A-Beta), which aggregates into abnormal fibers
        that accumulate as toxic clumps outside of cells.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Sounds Waves Not Drugs</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Much research into AD has focused on preventing the buildup of
        these aggregates or clearing them from the brain, but scientists
        are faced with a problem: The brain is shielded by a delicate
        layer of cells, known as the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is
        very difficult for things to cross, such as therapeutics or
        helpful antibodies.<br>
        <br>
        Amyloid plaques sit between the neurons and end up as dense
        clusters of beta-amyloid molecules, a sticky type of protein
        that clumps together and forms plaques.<br>
        <br>
        Australian researchers have come up with a non-invasive
        ultrasound technology that clears the brain of neurotoxic
        amyloid plaques – structures that are responsible for memory
        loss and a decline in cognitive function in Alzheimer’s
        patients.<br>
        <br>
        Publishing in Science Translational Medicine, the team described
        the technique as using a particular type of ultrasound called a
        focused therapeutic ultrasound, which non-invasively beams sound
        waves into the brain tissue. By oscillating super-fast, these
        sound waves are able to gently open up the blood-brain barrier,
        which is a layer that protects the brain against bacteria, and
        stimulate the brain’s microglial cells to activate. Microglila
        cells are basically waste-removal cells, so they’re able to
        clear out the toxic beta-amyloid clumps that are responsible for
        the worst symptoms of Alzheimer’s.<br>
        <br>
        The team reports fully restoring the memory function of 75
        percentof the mice they tested it on, with zero damage to the
        surrounding brain tissue. They found that the treated mice
        displayed improved performance in three memory tasks – a maze, a
        test to get them to recognize new objects, and one to get them
        to remember the places they should avoid.<br>
        <br>
        “We’re extremely excited by this innovation of treating
        Alzheimer’s without using drug therapeutics,” said team member
        Jurgen Gotz. “The word ‘breakthrough’ is often misused, but in
        this case I think this really does fundamentally change our
        understanding of how to treat this disease, and I foresee a
        great future for this approach.”<br>
        <br>
        At UQ’s Queensland Brain Institute, Queensland Premier
        Annastacia Palaszczuk said the findings could have a wide impact
        for the community.<br>
        <br>
        “The Government’s $9 million investment into this technology was
        to drive discoveries into clinics, and today’s announcement
        indicates that together with the Queensland Brain Institute, it
        was a worthwhile investment,” Ms Palaszczuk said.<br>
        <br>
        “We’re also working on seeing whether this method clears toxic
        protein aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases other than
        Alzheimer’s and whether this also restores executive functions,
        including decision-making and motor control.”<br>
        <br>
        Of the 5.4 million Americans with Alzheimer’s, an estimated 5.2
        million people are age 65 and older, and approximately 200,000
        individuals are under age 65 (younger-onset Alzheimer’s).<b><br>

      What if damaged teeth could heal themselves? That's the
      inspiration behind a new project from Harvard and the University
      of Nottingham to create stem cell stimulating fillings.<br>
      <br>
      Dentists treat hundreds of millions of cavities each year by
      drilling out the decay and putting in a filling.<br>
      <br>
      But 10 to 15 percent of those fillings fail, says Adam Celiz, a
      therapeutic biomaterials researcher from University of Nottingham.
      And that leads to millions of root canals to remove the tooth's
      pulp, the soft tissue in the center of the tooth that contains the
      blood vessels, nerves, and connective tissue. A root canal can
      weaken the tooth, which may eventually need to be pulled.<br>
      <br>
      Celiz and his fellow researchers have developed a new kind of
      filling made from synthetic biomaterial that can stimulate the
      growth of stem cells in the pulp of the tooth. Just like regular
      fillings, the biomaterial is injected into the tooth and hardened
      with UV light.<br>
      <br>
      In in vitro testing, the fillings stimulated the proliferation and
      differentiation of stem cells into dentin, the bony tissue that
      forms the bulk of the tooth under the white enamel. The
      researchers believes that if used in a damaged tooth, those stem
      cells can repair the kind of damage that often comes from the
      installation of a filling. In essence, the biomaterial filling
      would allow the tooth to heal itself.<br>
      <br>
      In the future, Celiz says, all fillings could be made of such
      regenerative material so that damaged teeth could heal themselves,
      lowering the failure rate of fillings, and potentially even
      eliminating the need for most root canals.<br>

      <b>CELL CULTURE SUBSTRATE</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to a substrate for culturing cells, such as
      human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs); polymers, devices and
      methods for cell culture; polymers; and methods of manufacturing
      devices for cell culture .<br>
      <br>
      Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) hold promise towards
      application in regenerative medicine and drug development as well
      as providing new in vitro models of genetic disease due to their
      long-term self-renewal and inherent ability to differentiate into
      all three germ layers. However, for these applications to be
      realised, scalable culture systems capable of generating the
      necessary numbers of cells are needed. Currently, the most widely
      used growth substrates for hPSC culture are mouse embryonic
      fibroblast (MEF) feeder layers or Matrigel™, which is an undefined
      extracellular matrix (ECM) protein mixture harvested from
      Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma cells. To improve scalability
      of growth substrates and avoid the problems associated with
      complex biologically derived material, fully synthetic
      polymer-based growth substrates have been are under investigation
      [ 1 1 -3, 16-20] . However, commercial synthetic alternatives to
      Matrigel™ such as Synthemax™, a peptide-acrylate conjugate coating
      containing a cell adhesion motif derived from vitronectin, have
      not proved cost-effective for large scale hPSC culture . A number
      of groups are therefore engaged in the search for scalable and
      cost effective synthetic polymer substrates on which to expand
      stem cells. [2-3, 14, 16-20] .<br>
      <br>
      The success of polymer-based growth substrates is critical upon
      the preconditioning of the substrate with various ECM proteins.
      This preconditioning step increases the cost of using polymeric
      substrates.<br>
      <br>
      An aim of the present invention is to provide an improved
      substrate and methods for cell culture.<br>
      <br>
      According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a

      <br>
      -a copolymer formed from one or more monomers of formula (la)

      <div align="center"><big><b>New plastic material begins to

        </big></div>
      <br>
      Place this thin layer of plastic in the sun and it begins to
      oscillate irregularly all by itself. Today researchers from
      Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) and the Humboldt
      University in Berlin present this material ­– the first that moves
      spontaneously under the influence of daylight – in the journal
      Nature Communications. According to the researchers, this pliable
      plastic is suitable as a self-cleaning surface, for example for
      solar cells.<br>
      <br>
      Materials that move all by themselves under the influence of light
      – this phenomenon has been known for a number of years. However,
      since the source tends to be ultraviolet light, the required
      intensity can damage the material. The challenge was to find a
      material that behaves in this way in visible light, preferably
      unprocessed sunlight. The researchers from Eindhoven and Berlin
      have now succeeded in producing a thin polymer layer containing
      light-sensitive molecules (azo-dyes). Lying in sunlight, the thin
      film begins to oscillate spontaneously and irregularly.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Combination of factors</b><br>
      <br>
      Why the plastic does this is something that the researchers cannot
      yet quite explain. “It seems to be a combination of factors,”
      suggests TU/e researcher Michael Debije. “The light-sensitive
      molecules bend and stretch under the influence of visible light.
      Since these molecules are bound within the polymer network of
      crystal, this results in the material oscillating as if cramped.
      Of course, there’s more to it than that – this is what we are
      investigating now.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Self-cleaning</b><br>
      <br>
      One of the main possibilities for using the material is as a
      self-cleaning surface. “A surface that vibrates in the sun makes
      it difficult for sand and dust to stick to it,” Debije says.
      Fellow researcher, Dick Broer, thinks that self-cleaning solar
      panels in the desert where there are no water supplies could be an
      option. But the researchers believe there is a whole range of
      other possible applications. “We have just discovered the effect;
      we expect that this will attract attention from many researchers
      from whom we will be hearing a lot over the coming period,” Debije
      says.<br>

      <br>
      Researchers have discovered a catalyst that performs highly
      selective conversion of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide into
      ethylene – an important source material for the chemical industry.
      In the journal “Nature Communications“, a team headed by Prof Dr
      Beatriz Roldan Cuenya from Ruhr-Universität Bochum describes how
      plasma-treated copper can be used for this purpose.<br>

      <br>
      Catalysts traditionally used for the electrochemical conversion of
      carbon dioxide into useful chemicals were not efficient enough.
      The reason: the materials do not have high selectivity; they
      produce a little ethylene and too many unwanted side products.
      This has now been changed.<br>
      More selectivity through plasma treatment<br>
      <br>
      PhD student Hemma Mistry from the Institute for Experimental
      Physics IV in Bochum used copper films treated with oxygen or
      hydrogen plasmas as catalysts. Through these plasma treatments,
      she altered the properties of the copper surface, rendering it
      rougher or less rough, for example, and oxidizing the material.
      The researcher varied the plasma parameters systematically until
      she hit on the optimal surface properties.<br>
      <br>
      Her best catalyst boasts a higher ethylene production rate than
      traditional copper catalysts. At the same time, it acts in a
      highly selective manner, which means that the amount of unwanted
      side products is considerable reduced. “It’s a new record for this
      material,” concludes Beatriz Roldan Cuenya.<br>
      <b><br>
        Mechanism decoded</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The researchers also identified the reason why this form of plasma
      treatment has been successful. Using synchrotron radiation, they
      analysed the copper film’s chemical state during the catalysis of
      the reaction. Through these measurements, they detected the cause
      of the higher ethylene selectivity. The key component was
      positively charged copper ions at the catalyst surface.<br>
      <br>
      It had been assumed that copper can only exist in its metallic
      form under reaction conditions. The researchers’ discovery has now
      disproved this assumption, and their findings were confirmed by
      additional microscopic analysis. “The results open up new
      possibilities for designing catalysts on the nanoscale with
      specific activity and selectivity,” says Beatriz Roldan Cuenya.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      There is an urgent need to develop technologies that use renewable
      energy to convert waste products such as carbon dioxide into
      hydrocarbon fuels. Carbon dioxide can be electrochemically reduced
      to hydrocarbons over copper catalysts, although higher efficiency
      is required. We have developed oxidized copper catalysts
      displaying lower overpotentials for carbon dioxide
      electroreduction and record selectivity towards ethylene (60%)
      through facile and tunable plasma treatments. Herein we provide
      insight into the improved performance of these catalysts by
      combining electrochemical measurements with microscopic and
      spectroscopic characterization techniques. Operando X-ray
      absorption spectroscopy and cross-sectional scanning transmission
      electron microscopy show that copper oxides are surprisingly
      resistant to reduction and copper+ species remain on the surface
      during the reaction. Our results demonstrate that the roughness of
      oxide-derived copper catalysts plays only a partial role in
      determining the catalytic performance, while the presence of
      copper+ is key for lowering the onset potential and enhancing
      ethylene selectivity.<br>

            medical marijuana lowers prescription drug use </b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Medical marijuana is having a po sitive impact on the bottom line
      of Medicare's prescription drug benefit program in states that
      have legalized its use for medicinal purposes, according to
      University of Georgia researchers in a study published today in
      the July issue of Health Affairs.<br>
      <br>
      The savings, due to lower prescription drug use, were estimated to
      be $165.2 million in 2013, a year when 17 states and the District
      of Columbia had implemented medical marijuana laws. The results
      suggest that if all states had implemented medical marijuana the
      overall savings to Medicare would have been around $468 million.<br>
      <br>
      Compared to Medicare Part D's 2013 budget of $103 billion, those
      savings would have been 0.5 percent. But it's enough of a
      difference to show that, in states where it's legal, some people
      are turning to the drug as an alternative to prescription
      medications for ailments that range from pain to sleep disorders….<br>

            ‘Racist’ Remark, Called Snack ‘Brownies’</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      uring an end-of-the-year class party at a New Jersey elementary
      school, a 9-year-old boy said something about brownies and was
      subsequently questioned by a police officer who was called by the
      school to investigate an incident of racism.<br>
      <br>
      It was another student that accused the boy of saying something
      "racist," but the boy's mother said he was talking about "snacks,
      not skin color," according to Philly.com.<br>
      <br>
      "He said they were talking about brownies. Who exactly did he
      offend?" the mother, Stacy dos Santos, asked incredulously.<br>
      <br>
      When the boy's father was contacted later in the day, he was
      informed that the matter was referred to the New Jersey Division
      of Child Protection and Permanency. It is also reported that the
      boy stayed at home for his last day of third grade.<br>
      <br>
      But lest it appear that this was an overreaction from the school,
      as the mother described it, this is actual protocol, decided upon
      at an earlier meeting between the police department,
      representatives from the county prosecutor's office and school
      officials at William P. Tatem Elementary School in Collingswood.<br>
      <br>
      It was decided that any incident that could be deemed criminal
      should be reported to authorities, even something "as minor as a
      simple name-calling incident that the school would typically
      handle internally," Police Chief Kevin Carey said.<br>
      <br>
      After that meeting, it is noted that officers were called more
      often than ever to investigate incidents, sometimes as many as
      five incidents per day in the span of a month.<br>
      <br>
      Dos Santos said this incident has left her son "traumatized" and
      is looking to enroll in another school next year:<br>
      <br>
      "I'm not comfortable with the administration [at Tatem]. I don't
      trust them and neither does my child. He was intimidated,
      obviously. There was a police officer with a gun in the holster
      talking to my son, saying, 'Tell me what you said.' He didn't have
      anybody on his side."<br>
      <br>
      Other parents are echoing these concerns, calling the increased
      police involvement "ridiculous" and "harmful." One teacher from
      another school who has children in the Collingswood district said,
      "Some of it is just typical little-kid behavior. Never in my years
      of teaching have I ever felt uncomfortable handling a situation or
      felt like I didn't know how to handle a situation<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Scientists are getting closer to
            directly observing how and why water is essential to life as
            we know it...</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      A study (Dynamics and Mechanism of Ultrafast Water-Protein
      Interactions) in this week's Proceedings of the National Academy
      of Sciences (PNAS) provides the strongest evidence yet that
      proteins - the large and complex molecules that fold into
      particular shapes to enable biological reactions - can't fold
      themselves.<br>
      <br>
      Rather, the work of folding is done by much smaller water
      molecules, which surround proteins and push and pull at them to
      make them fold a certain way in fractions of a second, like scores
      of tiny origami artists folding a giant sheet of paper at
      blazingly fast speeds.<br>
      <br>
      Dongping Zhong, leader of the research group at The Ohio State
      University that made the discovery, called the study a "major step
      forward" in the understanding of water-protein interactions and
      said it answers a question that's been dogging research into
      protein dynamics for decades.<br>
      <br>
      "For a long time, scientists have been trying to figure out how
      water interacts with proteins.<br>
      <br>
      This is a fundamental problem that relates to protein structure,
      stability, dynamics and - finally - function," said Zhong, who is
      the Robert Smith Professor of physics at Ohio State.<br>
      <br>
      "We believe we now have strong direct evidence that on ultrafast
      time scales (picoseconds, or trillionths of a second), water
      modulates protein fluctuations," he concluded.<br>
      <br>
      Zhong, who is also a professor of chemistry and biochemistry, and
      his team used ultrafast laser pulses to take snapshots of water
      molecules moving around a DNA polymerase, the kind of protein that
      helps DNA reproduce.<br>
      <br>
      The key to getting a good view of the interaction was to precisely
      locate optical probes on the protein surface, he said. The
      researchers inserted molecules of the amino acid tryptophan into
      the protein as a probe, and measured how water moved around it.<br>
      <br>
      Water molecules typically flow around each other at picosecond
      speeds, while proteins fold at nanosecond speeds - 1,000 times
      slower. <br>
      <br>
      Previously, Zhong's group demonstrated that water molecules slow
      down when they encounter a protein. Water molecules are still
      moving 100 times faster than a protein when they connect with it,
      however.<br>
      <br>
      In the new study, the researchers were able to determine that the
      water molecules directly touched the protein's "side chains," the
      portions of the protein molecule that bind and unbind with each
      other to enable folding and function.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers were also able to note the timing of movement in
      the molecules.<br>
      <br>
      Computer simulations at the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC) helped
      the researchers visualize what was going on:<br>
      <br>
      where the water moved a certain way, the protein folded
      nanoseconds later, as if the water molecules were nudging the
      protein into shape.<br>
      <br>
      Water can't arbitrarily shape a protein, Zhong explained.<br>
      <br>
      Proteins can only fold and unfold in a few different ways
      depending on the amino acids they're made of.<br>
      <br>
      "Here, we've shown that the final shape of a protein depends on
      two things: water … the amino acids themselves<br>
      <br>
      We can now say that, on ultrafast time scales, the protein surface
      fluctuations are controlled by water fluctuations.<br>
      <br>
      Water molecules work together like a big network to drive the
      movement of proteins."<br>

      </b><b>Significance</b><br>
      <br>
      Hitherto, both the autonomic nervous system and innate immune
      system were regarded as systems that cannot be voluntarily
      influenced. The present study demonstrates that, through
      practicing techniques learned in a short-term training program,
      the sympathetic nervous system and immune system can indeed be
      voluntarily influenced. Healthy volunteers practicing the learned
      techniques exhibited profound increases in the release of
      epinephrine, which in turn led to increased production of
      anti-inflammatory mediators and subsequent dampening of the
      proinflammatory cytokine response elicited by intravenous
      administration of bacterial endotoxin. This study could have
      important implications for the treatment of a variety of
      conditions associated with excessive or persistent inflammation,
      especially autoimmune diseases in which therapies that antagonize
      proinflammatory cytokines have shown great benefit.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Excessive or persistent proinflammatory cytokine production plays
      a central role in autoimmune diseases. Acute activation of the
      sympathetic nervous system attenuates the innate immune response.
      However, both the autonomic nervous system and innate immune
      system are regarded as systems that cannot be voluntarily
      influenced. Herein, we evaluated the effects of a training program
      on the autonomic nervous system and innate immune response.
      Healthy volunteers were randomized to either the intervention (n =
      12) or control group (n = 12). Subjects in the intervention group
      were trained for 10 d in meditation (third eye meditation),
      breathing techniques (i.a., cyclic hyperventilation followed by
      breath retention), and exposure to cold (i.a., immersions in ice
      cold water). The control group was not trained. Subsequently, all
      subjects underwent experimental endotoxemia (i.v. administration
      of 2 ng/kg Escherichia coli endotoxin). In the intervention group,
      practicing the learned techniques resulted in intermittent
      respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia resulting in profoundly
      increased plasma epinephrine levels. In the intervention group,
      plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 increased
      more rapidly after endotoxin administration, correlated strongly
      with preceding epinephrine levels, and were higher. Levels of
      proinflammatory mediators TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 were lower in the
      intervention group and correlated negatively with IL-10 levels.
      Finally, flu-like symptoms were lower in the intervention group.
      In conclusion, we demonstrate that voluntary activation of the
      sympathetic nervous system results in epinephrine release and
      subsequent suppression of the innate immune response in humans in
      vivo. These results could have important implications for the
      treatment of conditions associated with excessive or persistent
      inflammation, such as autoimmune diseases.<br>

      Young talent such as Lalita Prasida Sripada Srisai, a 13-year-old

      <br>
      ...Lalita developed a low cost bio-absorbent based water purifier.
      It functions mainly on waste corn cobs. The Corn cob is the least
      utilized part of the maize plant. It is a very important
      agricultural waste. Having high mechanical strength, rigidity and
      porosity, corn cob is a suitable absorbent. This enables
      contaminants like oxides of salts, detergent, suspended particles,
      coloured dyes, oil and grease to be absorbed in the surface of the
      corn cobs. Some of the heavy metals are also absorbed.<br>
      <br>
      “If the drain pipe of the household is connected to a chamber
      having different layers of corn cobs in partition layers or to an
      S-trap pipe having corn cobs, it will separate about more than
      70-80 % of contaminants including suspended particles from the
      waste water,” says the report published about her project on the
      Google Science Fair website.<br>
      <br>
      This cheap and eco-friendly way of purifying water will open up a
      new market for corn corbs which are otherwise discarded as
      bio-waste.<br>
      <br>
      To conduct the experiment, Lalita had collected the cobs from a
      nearby farm and sun dried them for a month. To make a hole at the
      centre of one cob, the pith was removed. In it 50 ml of domestic
      effluent collected from a kitchen drain pipe was poured. This was
      allowed to pass through the hole. Thereafter, the collected
      filtrate was tested for purity. This was the pilot stage.<br>
      <br>
      After its successful completion, water with several added chemical
      impurities was through five bottles, each containing a different
      layer for purification. The layers had long pieces of corn cobs,
      small pieces of corn cobs, powdered corn cobs, activated charcoal
      made from corn cobs and fine sand.<br>
      <br>
      The charcoal layer was observed to absorb most of the coloured
      substances present in the water, while the chaff layers of both
      long and small pieces of corn cobs absorbed the suspended
      particles. The powdered corn cob layer absorbed the gasoline
      waste.<br>

      Adsorption is regarded to be easy and effective process for the
      cleaning of waste water (3&amp;5). Bio- adsorbents are commonly
      used to clean water. Fehintola et al.(2015) reported the
      adsorption of Lead, Nickel and Cadmium by powdered egg shells.
      Adsorption of Lead by powdered corn cobs was also reported by
      Fehintola et al.(2015 a). Ismail et al.(2009) reported the
      adsorption of Cadmium by the powdered corn cobs. Nada et al.(2009)
      reported the increased efficiency of corn cobs towards metal ions
      sorption by incorporating certain functional groups, e.g.
      phosphate, sulfate and carboxylic groups. The adsorption of
      Fluoride from water using powdered corn cobs was investigated by
      Parker et al. (2006). They identified that 90 to 120 minutes was
      the best contact time for maximum fluoride adsorption. Binding of
      Cadmium by hemi-cellulose of corn cobs was also reported by
      Muchlisyam et al.(2013).&nbsp; So, the study was designed to
      control and check water pollution from domestic and industrial
      sources by using an agricultural waste...<br>

            visual association</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Researchers have made two new scientific points with a set of
      experiments in which they induced people to perceive colors that
      weren't really there -- one concerning how the brain works and the
      other concerning how to work the brain.<br>
      <br>
      Working with colleagues in Japan, the scientists at Brown
      University used a novel technique to surreptitiously train a small
      group of volunteers to associate vertical stripes with the color
      red and -- to a lesser extent as a consequence -- horizontal
      stripes with the color green.<br>
      <br>
      The first point made by the researchers was that the association
      was induced by specifically targeting the early visual areas of
      the brain. Those "V1" and "V2" areas are the first parts of the
      cortex to process basic visual information coming from the eyes,
      but scientists had not previously seen associative learning
      occurring there.<br>
      <br>
      "This is the first clear study that shows that V1 and V2 are
      capable of creating associative learning," said Takeo Watanabe,
      the Fred M. Seed Professor of Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences at
      Brown and co-corresponding author of the paper in the journal
      Current Biology.<br>
      <br>
      The second point is that the association was learned strongly
      enough that subjects came to perceive the background colors paired
      with vertical bars as red even when the background was gray or
      sometimes a bit greenish. That learned misperception was evident
      in tests as much as five months later.<br>
      <br>
      The demonstration raises the possibility that the training method
      could be used to induce other enduring associations in the brain,
      Watanabe said.<br>
      <br>
      Here is how Watanabe's team induced the association:<br>
      <br>
      With volunteers in the magnetic resonance imaging scanner, the
      first step was to measure patterns of activity in V1 and V2 when
      they saw different combinations of colored backgrounds (red, green
      and gray) behind two different stripe orientations (vertical and
      horizontal). The researchers used that data to encode a
      "classifier" that could distinguish between red and green to
      recognize the brain activity the volunteers induced in those areas
      in future experiments.<br>
      <br>
      Then the experimenters engaged in a subterfuge even greater than a
      little mind reading. With the intent of training 12 of their 18
      volunteers to associate red with vertical stripes, they showed
      them gray backgrounded vertical stripes embedded within a circle
      and then a small plain white disk. They asked the volunteers to
      imagine ways of making the disk larger. The volunteers were
      offered a reward based on the size of the disk they could produce.<br>
      <br>
      Over three days of such training, volunteers thought of a variety
      of ways they might use their brains to enlarge the disk, but
      really the disk only got larger when the classifier saw signs they
      were thinking of red (for whatever coincidental reason). In other
      words, the 12 volunteers were really being trained such that after
      seeing vertical stripes they would induce activity patterns in V1
      and V2 similar to the activity that had occurred when they
      actually saw red.<br>
      <br>
      "Participants were not aware of the purpose of the experiment or
      what kind of activation they learned to induce," Watanabe said.<br>
      <br>
      After the 12 volunteers had been trained and the six others were
      left untrained, the researchers then measured their visual
      perceptions. Both groups of volunteers were shown circles with
      central patterns of vertical, horizontal or diagonal stripes. Each
      of those patterns had backgrounds colored somewhere along a
      continuum of eight settings ranging from obviously to faintly
      green to gray to faintly to obviously red.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="1inception.jpg" height="337"
          width="634"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The key question was whether the trained and untrained subjects
      would exhibit any differences in the colors they perceived in the
      backgrounds behind the vertical stripes. Sure enough, trained
      subjects were significantly more likely than untrained ones to
      perceive the gray background of vertical stripes -- and even the
      faintly green background -- as red. Meanwhile, trained subjects
      were more likely to associate backgrounds behind horizontal
      stripes as greener than untrained subjects.<br>
      <br>
      Neither group showed any incorrect color bias in judging the
      backgrounds behind the diagonal stripes. In testing up to five
      months later, however, trained subjects still showed significant
      associations for vertical gratings.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Applications of associations</b><br>
      <br>
      Associative learning and memory -- "this goes with that" -- is
      pervasive in the brain, but it was a novel finding of basic brain
      science to show that it can occur in early visual areas, Watanabe
      said.<br>
      <br>
      In a more applied vein, Watanabe said he is eager to find out if
      scientists can use the study's technique of training subjects with
      (unwitting) MRI-based feedback to create associations in other
      parts of the brain for educational or therapeutic reasons.<br>
      <br>
      "Our brain functions are mostly based on associative processing,
      so association is extremely important," Watanabe said. "Now we
      know that this technology can be applied to induce associative
      learning."<br>
      <br>
      Through the technique, which Watanabe calls A-DecNef, perhaps
      people can learn even when they don't know what they are learning,
      or that they are learning at all.<br>

      </b><b>Summary</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>Associative learning is an essential brain process where the
      contingency of different items increases after training.
      Associative learning has been found to occur in many brain regions
      [ 1–4 ]. However, there is no clear evidence that associative
      learning of visual features occurs in early visual areas, although
      a number of studies have indicated that learning of a single
      visual feature (perceptual learning) involves early visual areas [
      5–8 ]. Here, via decoded fMRI neurofeedback termed “DecNef” [ 9 ],
      we tested whether associative learning of orientation and color
      can be created in early visual areas. During 3 days of training,
      DecNef induced fMRI signal patterns that corresponded to a
      specific target color (red) mostly in early visual areas while a
      vertical achromatic grating was physically presented to
      participants. As a result, participants came to perceive “red”
      significantly more frequently than “green” in an achromatic
      vertical grating. This effect was also observed 3–5 months after
      the training. These results suggest that long-term associative
      learning of two different visual features such as orientation and
      color was created, most likely in early visual areas. This newly
      extended technique that induces associative learning is called
      “A-DecNef,” and it may be used as an important tool for
      understanding and modifying brain functions because associations
      are fundamental and ubiquitous functions in the brain.<br>

      The idea that people can interfere with others' thoughts and
      implant things in their minds was made famous by the 2010 film
      'Inception'.<br>
      <br>
      But the concept is not completely science fiction, according to a
      group of researchers at Brown University.<br>
      <br>
      The scientists have discovered a way to implant associations in
      people's brains, without the subjects being aware of it happening.<br>
      With volunteers in the scanner, the patterns of activity in two
      areas of the brain were first measured when the subjects saw
      different combinations of coloured backgrounds (red, green and
      grey) behind two different stripe orientations (vertical and
      horizontal)<br>

      grey) behind two different stripe orientations (vertical and
      horizontal)<br>
      <br>
      <b>WHAT IS THE TECHNIQUE? </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The process is called Decoded Neurofeedback, or 'DecNef'.<br>
      <br>
      The idea for neurofeedback technique grew out of research from the
      1960s showing that a person could regulate his heart rate or
      temperature just by thinking about it.<br>
      <br>
      Because our brains regulate temperature and heart rate, the
      researchers wanted to see if we could also regulate other aspects
      of brain activity.<br>
      <br>
      Working with colleagues in Japan, scientists at Brown University
      have been studying how a functional magnetic resonance machine
      (FMRI) can 'induce' knowledge in someone through their visual
      cortex by sending signals that change their brain activity
      pattern.<br>
      <br>
      This process is called Decoded Neurofeedback, or 'DecNef'.<br>
      <br>
      In a recent breakthrough, the group used a new technique to
      surreptitiously train a small group of volunteers to associate
      vertical stripes with the colour red and horizontal stripes with
      the colour green.<br>
      <br>
      The people taking part thought they were seeing the colour red
      when looking at black and white stripes, and had no idea this was
      happening.&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      he association was induced by specifically targeting two early
      visual areas of the brain.<br>
      <br>
      Named 'V1' and 'V2', the areas are the first parts of the cortex
      to process basic visual information coming from the eyes.<br>
      <br>
      But scientists had not previously seen associative learning
      happening in these areas.<br>
      <br>
      After three days of training, participants were trained into
      seeing red when they saw vertical stripes.<br>
      <br>
      'This is the first clear study that shows that V1 and V2 are
      capable of creating associative learning,' said Professor Takeo
      Watanabe, corresponding author of the paper published in the
      journal Current Biology.<br>

      1960s showing that a person could regulate his heart rate or

      Watanabe wanted to see if we could regulate other aspects of brain
      activity. <br>
      <br>
      'Participants were not aware of the purpose of the experiment or
      what kind of activation they learned to induce,'<br>
      <br>
      Professor Watanabe said.<br>
      <br>
      After the experiment, the researchers asked the subjects what they
      were thinking about when they got high scores.<br>
      <br>
      'I imagined a zebra,' said one participant, reported Stat News.<br>
      <br>
      'I imagined a gymnastics match in which I performed well,' 'I
      imagined a situation where I behaved violently,' others reported.<br>
      <br>
      The participants were not hallucinating the color red, Professor
      Watanabe said. Instead their experiences were more similar to
      synesthesia, a condition in which people perceive coloors when
      they look at printed numbers and letters.<br>
      <br>
      Associative learning and memory, the idea that 'this goes with
      that',&nbsp; is pervasive in the brain.<br>

      Decoded Neurofeedback (DecNef) is the process of inducing
      knowledge in a subject by increasing neural activation in
      predetermined regions of interest in the brain, such as their
      visual cortex. This is achieved by measuring neural activity in
      these regions via functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI),
      comparing this to the ideal pattern of neural activation in these
      regions (for the intended purpose), and giving subjects feedback
      on how close their current pattern of neural activity is to the
      ideal pattern. Without explicit knowledge of what they are
      supposed to be doing or thinking about, over time participants
      learn to induce this ideal pattern of neural activation.
      Corresponding to this, their 'knowledge' or way of thinking has
      been found to change accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      It is speculated that this technology could lead to the ability to
      instantly learn new skills such as playing the piano, throwing a
      curve ball etc. by copying the brain patterns of a subject who has
      already learned the skills and then overlaying them onto the brain
      of a target subject.<br>
      <br>
      Experiments conducted at Boston University (BU) and ATR
      Computational Neuroscience Laboratories in Kyoto, Japan, in 2011,
      demonstrated that volunteers were able to quickly solve complex
      visual puzzles, they had not previously had exposure to, after
      receiving the brain patterns of other volunteers who had already
      learned to solve the puzzles through trial and error methods.<br>
      <br>
      The research has far-reaching implications for treating patients
      with various learning disabilities, mental illness, memory
      problems and motor functionality impairments.<br>

      New research published today in the journal Science suggests it
      may be possible to use brain technology to learn to play a piano,
      reduce mental stress or hit a curve ball with little or no
      conscious effort. It's the kind of thing seen in Hollywood's
      "Matrix" franchise.<br>
      <br>
      Experiments conducted at Boston University (BU) and ATR
      Computational Neuroscience Laboratories in Kyoto, Japan, recently
      demonstrated that through a person's visual cortex, researchers
      could use decoded functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
      induce brain activity patterns to match a previously known target
      state and thereby improve performance on visual tasks.<br>
      <br>
      Think of a person watching a computer screen and having his or her
      brain patterns modified to match those of a high-performing
      athlete or modified to recuperate from an accident or disease.
      Though preliminary, researchers say such possibilities may exist
      in the future.<br>
      <br>
      "Adult early visual areas are sufficiently plastic to cause visual
      perceptual learning," said lead author and BU neuroscientist Takeo
      Watanabe of the part of the brain analyzed in the study.<br>
      <br>
      Neuroscientists have found that pictures gradually build up inside
      a person's brain, appearing first as lines, edges, shapes, colors
      and motion in early visual areas. The brain then fills in greater
      detail to make a red ball appear as a red ball, for example.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers studied the early visual areas for their ability to
      cause improvements in visual performance and learning.<br>
      <br>
      "Some previous research confirmed a correlation between improving
      visual performance and changes in early visual areas, while other
      researchers found correlations in higher visual and decision
      areas," said Watanabe, director of BU's Visual Science Laboratory.
      "However, none of these studies directly addressed the question of
      whether early visual areas are sufficiently plastic to cause
      visual perceptual learning." Until now.<br>
      <br>
      Boston University post-doctoral fellow Kazuhisa Shibata designed
      and implemented a method using decoded fMRI neurofeedback to
      induce a particular activation pattern in targeted early visual
      areas that corresponded to a pattern evoked by a specific visual
      feature in a brain region of interest. The researchers then tested
      whether repetitions of the activation pattern caused visual
      performance improvement on that visual feature.<br>
      <br>
      The result, say researchers, is a novel learning approach
      sufficient to cause long-lasting improvement in tasks that require
      visual performance.<br>
      <br>
      What's more, the approached worked even when test subjects were
      not aware of what they were learning.<br>
      <br>
      "The most surprising thing in this study is that mere inductions
      of neural activation patterns corresponding to a specific visual
      feature led to visual performance improvement on the visual
      feature, without presenting the feature or subjects' awareness of
      what was to be learned," said Watanabe, who developed the idea for
      the research project along with Mitsuo Kawato, director of ATR lab
      and Yuka Sasaki, an assistant in neuroscience at Massachusetts
      General Hospital.<br>
      <br>
      "We found that subjects were not aware of what was to be learned
      while behavioral data obtained before and after the neurofeedback
      training showed that subjects' visual performance improved
      specifically for the target orientation, which was used in the
      neurofeedback training," he said.<br>
      <br>
      The finding brings up an inevitable question. Is hypnosis or a
      type of automated learning a potential outcome of the research?<br>
      <br>
      "In theory, hypnosis or a type of automated learning is a
      potential outcome," said Kawato. "However, in this study we
      confirmed the validity of our method only in visual perceptual
      learning. So we have to test if the method works in other types of
      learning in the future. At the same time, we have to be careful so
      that this method is not used in an unethical way."<br>
      <br>
      At present, the decoded neurofeedback method might be used for
      various types of learning, including memory, motor and
      rehabilitation.<br>
      <br>
      The National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health
      and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and
      Technology in Japan supported the research.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      It is controversial whether the adult primate early visual cortex
      is sufficiently plastic to cause visual perceptual learning (VPL).
      The controversy occurs partially because most VPL studies have
      examined correlations between behavioral and neural activity
      changes rather than cause-and-effect relationships. With an
      online-feedback method that uses decoded functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) signals, we induced activity patterns
      only in early visual cortex corresponding to an orientation
      without stimulus presentation or participants’ awareness of what
      was to be learned. The induced activation caused VPL specific to
      the orientation. These results suggest that early visual areas are
      so plastic that mere inductions of activity patterns are
      sufficient to cause VPL. This technique can induce plasticity in a
      highly selective manner, potentially leading to powerful training
      and rehabilitative protocols.<br>

      Sometimes in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for
      one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected
      them with another. It is high time to declare our personal
      independence from any remnant of obligation to those who have spit
      upon the rule of law. We owe them nothing - not respect, not
      loyalty, not obedience….<br>

      Ernst is a member of Energetic Forum who has shared quite a bit of
      his work with his version of a Tesla Magnifying Transmitter.<br>
      <br>
      Although A &amp; P does not necessarily endorse his viewpoint on
      the matter, he has openly shared it and we’re passing this on to
      you.<br>
      <br>
      In this discussion thread at Energetic Forum, you can find Ernst’s
      claims regarding his speculation that the TMT is not just an
      analogy of Tesla’s Self-Acting Engine but works on the same
      principles:
http://www.energeticforum.com/renewable-energy/20499-ere-many-generations-pass.html<br>
      <br>
      Right now, the discussion thread is not very long so you can read
      the whole thing in a few minutes.<br>
      <br>
      Tesla’s Self-Acting Engine works by simply creating a “perpetual”
      cold sink where heat can constantly move towards it, while
      producing mechanical work. Tesla has been quoted as saying it is
      his most important engineering accomplishment. This is
      over-simplified but is the basic idea in a nutshell.<br>
      <br>
      You can watch the introductory video, which presents his ideas
      here:<br>
      <br>
      Here is a link to a Google Drive document, which is a 66 page
      analysis by Ernst explaining the technical details: <br>

      A physicist from Temple University, Rongia Tao, was tasked with a
      challenge, which was to get chocolate to flow through machinery
      without clogging it. Normally, it requires a certain amount of fat
      to get the chocolate to flow. This was funded by Mars, Inc. which
      is a large candy corporation that makes M &amp; M’s and other
      popular candy.<br>
      <br>
      Cocoa solids are like little balls and no matter how close you
      pack them, there is still all that space that surrounds the points
      that don’t touch. And this random scattering of these solids leads
      to a higher viscosity or thickness.<br>
      <br>
      By producing an electric field and pouring chocolate through it,
      the cocoa solids aligned into longer, thinner chains that allowed
      them to be packed closer together and the viscosity reduces
      thereby requiring even less fat to be added. Because there is less
      fat, the cocoa solids stick out more and more of a chocolate
      taste.<br>

      What is important about this technology is that it is rooted in
      another method developed by the same physicist, which is to apply
      an electric or magnetic field to crude oil in order to reduce its
      viscosity while traveling through pipelines. This is used by the
      oil industry to save on pumping costs – up to 75% savings have
      been shown.<br>
      <br>
      Many that are conventionally trained claim that a magnetic or
      electric field cannot have any influence on hydrocarbon molecules,
      paraffin in diesel, etc. since they’re not dipole molecules like
      water.<br>
      <br>
      Well, here is a Temple University developed electrostatic and
      magnetic method for reducing the viscosity of oil, which these
      skeptics claim is impossible – <br>

      Our personal space guides our hands when we reach out, causes us
      to duck when objects hurtle towards us and makes us acutely aware
      of the world around us. And now, for the first time, scientists
      have found a way to help us feel it.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm have tweaked
      a well-known experiment called the rubber hand illusion for a
      study published in the journal Cognition. In the classic version,
      participants are shown a fake rubber hand while their own hand is
      hidden behind a screen. After a few minutes of simultaneous
      stroking of both the real and fake hands, the person’s brain
      starts to believe that the fake hand is actually their own. Here’s
      the proof:<br>
      <br>
      <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=18&amp;v=sxwn1w7MJvk"
        "><b>https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=18&amp;v=sxwn1w7MJvk</b></a><b><br>
      </b>
      <div align="center"><b>The Rubber Hand Illusion - Horizon: Is
          Seeing Believing? - BBC Two </b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      In the new study, which involved 101 adults, scientists repeated
      the test but applied brushstrokes in mid-air above the fake hand,
      rather than touching it. As in the classic experiment,
      participants start to believe that the fake hand is their own. But
      in this version, they also started to sense what feels like a
      “force field” between the brush and the rubber hand.<br>
      <br>
      “We can elicit this bizarre sensation of there actually being
      something in mid-air between the brush and the rubber hand,” Arvid
      Guterstam of the Karolinska Institute, a co-author of the study,
      told New Scientist.<br>
      <br>
      According to the study, the sensation continues as far as 15
      inches above the rubber hand, which indicates the size of what
      scientists of our “peripersonal space”.<br>
      <br>
      Neuroscientific evidence of the phenomenon first emerged in the
      late 1990s in animal studies. Princeton University’s Michael
      Graziano recorded the electrical activity of neurons in the
      parietal and frontal lobes of the brains of monkeys. They found
      that some neurons fired not just when they were touched by an
      object but also when it came near them.<br>
      <br>
      Graziano continued his experiments into the early 2000s,
      discovering that electrically stimulating certain neurons would
      induce a coordinated behaviour that resembled ducking or blocking.<br>
      <br>
      Graziano explained that the primary function of peripersonal space
      is defense, enabling us to quickly detect nearby danger. But it
      also helps us navigate a crowded shopping centre or find a seat on
      a packed train without bumping into people. Graziano told the
      Huffington Post US: “We now understand these peripersonal space
      neurons are important in monitoring the margin of safety around
      the body.”<br>
      <br>
      “The space around the body is processed like a jello mold. Like a
      thick layer of space around the body, deforming and moving as the
      limbs move,” Graziano said.<br>
      <br>
      The experiment has never been repeated in humans, but
      neuroscientists believe there is evidence to suggest that certain
      parts of the brain deal with peripersonal space. People who suffer
      strokes in the right posterior parietal lobe, for example, can’t
      detect peripersonal stimuli on the left side of their bodies.<br>
      <br>
      “These people have no trouble processing distant space, but lose a
      sense of peripersonal space,” Graziano said.<br>
      <br>
      Graziano suggests that this dynamic force field might also be
      extended to other objects, including bikes, cars and clothing.<br>

      The antichrist will be a leader who has the ability to speak
      boldly.<br>
      <br>
      “…and a mouth speaking pompous words.” Daniel 7:7-8<br>
      <br>
      “… And he was given a mouth speaking great things…” Rev. 13:5<br>
      <br>
      The Mahdi will be a leader who has the ability to speak boldly.<br>
      <br>
      “He will be so powerful that if he… shouts among the mountains,
      hard rocks will turn into powder…”. (Bihar al-Anwar, Vol. 52, p.
      32; Al-Hurr al-Amili, Ithbat al-Hudat, Vol. 6, p. 19)<br>
      <br>
      The Antichrist will be accompanied by the false prophet who will
      lead people into serving him.<br>
      <br>
      “Then the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who
      worked signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who
      received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image.”
      Revelation 19:20<br>
      <br>
      The ‘Muslim Jesus’ (not to be confused with the Christian Jesus)
      will return to help the Mahdi get accepted by the world.<br>
      <br>
      “ The Hour will not be established until the son of Mary (i.e.
      Jesus) descends amongst you as a just ruler, he will break the
      cross, kill the pigs, and abolish the Jizya tax. Money will be in
      abundance so that nobody will accept it (as charitable gifts).”
      (Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 43: Kitab-ul-`Ilm (Book of
      Knowledge), Hâdith Number 656)<br>
      The Antichrist will have a powerful army that will do damage to
      the earth. Ultimately causing all to follow him.<br>
      <br>
      “So they worshiped the dragon who gave authority to the beast; and
      they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast? Who is
      able to make war with him?” It was granted to him to make war with
      the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over
      every tribe, tongue, and nation. All who dwell on the earth will
      worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of
      Life…” Rev. 3:4-8<br>
      <br>
      The Mahdi will also have a powerful army that will do damage on
      the earth. Ultimately causing all to follow him.<br>
      <br>

      Muslims. He will lead Muslims in many battles of jihad. ”

      The Antichrist will be a world leader and rule for seven years.<br>
      <br>
      “He will confirm a covenant with many for one seven [7 years]…”
      Daniel 9:27<br>
      <br>
      “Authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation.…”

      The Mahdi will be a world leader and rule for seven years.<br>
      <br>
      “The Mahdi… will fill the earth with equity and justice as it was
      filled with oppression and tyranny, and he will rule for seven
      years.” Sunan Abu Dawud, Book 36, Number 4272, Narrated by Abu

      The Antichrist will change times and laws.<br>
      <br>
      “He..shall intend to change times and laws.” Daniel 7:25<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The Mahdi will more than likely adopt the Islamic calendar thus
      changing the times. In addition he will promote Shariah law
      changing the laws.<br>
      <br>
      “He…will govern the people by the Sunnah of their prophet and
      establish Islam on the earth.” (unan Abu Dawud, Book 36, Number
      4273, Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Mu’minin)<br>
      There is a white horse rider in the Bible that is bad news for the
      world.<br>
      <br>
      “…Behold a pale horse. He that sat on him…went forth conquering
      and to conquer.” Revelations 6:2<br>
      <br>
      The Mahdi comes riding on a white horse.<br>
      <br>
      “It is clear that this man is the Mahdi who will ride the white
      horse and judge by the Qur’an (with justice) and with whom will be
      men with marks of prostration (zabiba) on their foreheads.” ‘Izzat
      and ‘Arif<br>
      <br>
      The Antichrist and false prophet will promote a one world
      religion.<br>
      <br>
      “ He…causes as many as would not worship the image of the beast to
      be killed..” Revelations 13:15<br>
      <br>
      The Mahdi will make Islam the only acceptable religion.<br>
      <br>
      “He…will govern the people by the Sunnah of their prophet and
      establish Islam on the earth.” (unan Abu Dawud, Book 36, Number
      4273, Narrated Umm Salamah, Ummul Mu’minin)<br>
      The Antichrist will execute infidels through beheading.<br>
      <br>
      “I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their
      testimony for Jesus and because of the word of God. They had not
      worshiped the beast or his image and had not received his mark on
      their foreheads or their hands. ” Revelations 4:20<br>
      <br>
      The Mahdi will execute infidels, anyone who does not believe in
      Islam, through beheading.<br>
      <br>
      “I will instill terror into the hearts of the unbelievers: smite
      ye above their necks and smite all their finger-tips off.”&nbsp;
      Surah 8.12<br>
      <br>
      “Therefore, when ye meet the Unbelievers (in fight), strike off
      their heads…” Surah 47:4 <br>
      The Antichrist will kill Jews and Christians. He will kill anyone
      opposing him.<br>
      <br>
      “He was given power to make war against the saints and to conquer
      them…” Revelations 13:7<br>
      <br>
      “The dragon [Antichrist] stood in front of the woman [Israel] who
      was about to give birth, so that he might devour her child the
      moment it was born.” Revelations 12:4<br>
      <br>
      The Mahdi will kill anyone who opposes Islam. He will kill the
      Jews and the Christians.<br>
      <br>
      “Muslims take neither Jews nor the Christians for your friends.
      They are friends with one another. Whoever of you seeks their
      friendship shall become one of their numbers. Allah does not guide
      wrongdoing.” Surah 5.51<br>
      <br>
      “Slay the idolaters wherever you find them. Arrest them, besiege
      them, and lie in ambush for them.” Surah 9.73<br>
      <br>
      The Antichrist will attack and conquer Jerusalem.<br>
      <br>
      “For I will gather all the nations to battle against Jerusalem;
      The city shall be taken…” Zachariah 14:2<br>
      <br>
      The Mahdi will conquer Jerusalem.<br>
      <br>
      “Jerusalem will be the location of the rightly guided caliphate
      and the center of Islamic rule, which will be headed by Imam
      al-Mahdi.” (Sahih Muslim, Book 041, Number 6985)<br>
      The Antichrist performs many signs, wonders, and miracles.<br>
      <br>
      “Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all
      power and signs and lying wonders,” 2 Thess. 2:9<br>
      <br>
      “And he does great wonders, so that he makes fire come down from
      heaven on the earth in the sight of men, And deceives them that
      dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had
      power to do in the sight of the beast…” Rev. 12:13-14<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The Mahdi performs many signs, wonders, and miracles.<br>
      <br>
      “In the last days of my Ummah [universal Islamic community], the
      Mahdi will appear.&nbsp; Allah will give him power over the wind
      and the rain and the earth will bring forth its foliage.&nbsp; He
      will give away wealth profusely, flocks will be in abundance, and
      the Ummah will be large and honored…” (Sahih Hakim Mustadrak,
      related by Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (4:557 and 558), as quoted by
      Kabbani p. 233)<br>
      <br>
      The Antichrist will make people receive a mark on the hand or
      forehead to pledge allegiance to him.<br>
      <br>
      “And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and
      bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their
      foreheads:” “And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had
      the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.”
      Rev. 13:16-17 <br>
      <br>
      Followers of the Mahdi usually mark themselves with headbands on
      the foreheads.<br>
      <br>
      Muslims receive ‘bismillah’ (in the name of allah), unbelievers
      receive ‘bismilkafir’ (in the name of unbelievers)<b><br>

            may prevent and reverse severe damage to aging brain,
            research suggests</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A dietary supplement containing a blend of thirty vitamins and
      minerals -- all natural ingredients widely available in health
      food stores -- has shown remarkable anti-aging properties that can
      prevent and even reverse massive brain cell loss, according to new
      research from McMaster University.<br>
      <br>
      It's a mixture scientists believe could someday slow the progress
      of catastrophic neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's, ALS and
      Parkinson's.<br>
      <br>
      "The findings are dramatic," says Jennifer Lemon, research
      associate in the Department of Biology and a lead author of the
      study. "Our hope is that this supplement could offset some very
      serious illnesses and ultimately improve quality of life."<br>
      <br>
      The formula, which contains common ingredients such as vitamins B,
      C and D, folic acid, green tea extract, cod liver oil and other
      nutraceuticals, was first designed by scientists in McMaster's
      Department of Biology in 2000.<br>
      <br>
      A series of studies published over the last decade and a half have
      shown its benefits in mice, in both normal mice and those
      specifically bred for such research because they age rapidly,
      experiencing dramatic declines in cognitive and motor function in
      a matter of months.<br>
      <br>
      The mice used in this study had widespread loss of more than half
      of their brain cells, severely impacting multiple regions of the
      brain by one year of age, the human equivalent of severe
      Alzheimer's disease.<br>
      <br>
      The mice were fed the supplement on small pieces of bagel each day
      over the course of several months. Over time, researchers found
      that it completely eliminated the severe brain cell loss and
      abolished cognitive decline.<br>
      <br>
      "The research suggests that there is tremendous potential with
      this supplement to help people who are suffering from some
      catastrophic neurological diseases," says Lemon, who conducted the
      work with co-author Vadim Aksenov, a post-doctoral fellow in the
      Department of Biology at McMaster.<br>
      <br>
      "We know this because mice experience the same basic cell
      mechanisms that contribute to neurodegeneration that humans do.
      All species, in fact. There is a commonality among us all."<br>
      <br>
      In addition to looking at the major markers of aging, they also
      discovered that the mice on the supplements experienced
      enhancement in vision and most remarkably in the sense of smell --
      the loss of which is often associated with neurological disease --
      improved balance and motor activity.<br>
      <br>
      The next step in the research is to test the supplement on humans,
      likely within the next two years, and target those who are dealing
      with neurodegenerative diseases. The research is published online
      in the journal Environmental and Molecular Mutagenesis.<br>

      <br>
      If you’re wondering why British people would want to leave the EU,
      just look at this choice example of bureaucratic stupidity.<br>
      <br>
      Brussels bureaucrats were ridiculed yesterday after banning drink
      manufacturers from claiming that water can prevent dehydration.<br>
      <br>
      (Telegraph) EU officials concluded that, following a three-year
      investigation, there was no evidence to prove the previously
      undisputed fact that water helps prevent dehydration.<br>
      <br>
      Producers of bottled water are now forbidden by law from making
      the claim and will face a two-year jail sentence if they defy the
      edict, which comes into force in the UK next month.<br>

      Last night, critics claimed the EU was at odds with both science
      and common sense. Conservative MEP Roger Helmer said: “This is
      stupidity writ large.<br>
      <br>
      “The euro is burning, the EU is falling apart and yet here they
      are: highly-paid, highly-pensioned officials worrying about the
      obvious qualities of water and trying to deny us the right to say
      what is patently true.<br>
      <br>
      “If ever there were an episode which demonstrates the folly of the
      great European project then this is it.”<br>
      <br>
      NHS health guidelines state clearly that drinking water helps
      avoid dehydration, and that Britons should drink at least 1.2
      litres per day.<br>
      <br>
      The Department for Health disputed the wisdom of the new law. A
      spokesman said: “Of course water hydrates. While we support the EU
      in preventing false claims about products, we need to exercise
      common sense as far as possible.”<br>
      <br>
      German professors Dr Andreas Hahn and Dr Moritz Hagenmeyer, who
      advise food manufacturers on how to advertise their products,
      asked the European Commission if the claim could be made on
      labels.<br>
      <br>
      They compiled what they assumed was an uncontroversial statement
      in order to test new laws which allow products to claim they can
      reduce the risk of disease, subject to EU approval.<br>
      <br>
      They applied for the right to state that “regular consumption of
      significant amounts of water can reduce the risk of development of
      dehydration” as well as preventing a decrease in performance.<br>
      <br>
      However, last February, the European Food Standards Authority
      (EFSA) refused to approve the statement.<br>
      <br>
      A meeting of 21 scientists in Parma, Italy, concluded that reduced
      water content in the body was a symptom of dehydration and not
      something that drinking water could subsequently control.<br>
      <br>
      Now the EFSA verdict has been turned into an EU directive which
      was issued on Wednesday.<br>
      <br>
      Ukip MEP Paul Nuttall said the ruling made the “bendy banana law”
      look “positively sane”.<br>
      <br>
      He said: “I had to read this four or five times before I believed
      it. It is a perfect example of what Brussels does best. Spend
      three years, with 20 separate pieces of correspondence before
      summoning 21 professors to Parma where they decide with great
      solemnity that drinking water cannot be sold as a way to combat
      dehydration.<br>
      <br>
      “Then they make this judgment law and make it clear that if
      anybody dares sell water claiming that it is effective against
      dehydration they could get into serious legal bother.<br>
      EU regulations, which aim to uphold food standards across member
      states, are frequently criticised.<br>

            Kits</b><br>
        </big><br>
        <b>by Daniel Burke</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The director of a lab recognized by the International Association
      of Chiefs of Police for forensic science excellence has called
      field drug testing kits “totally useless” due to the possibility
      of false positives. In laboratory experiments, at least two brands
      of field testing kits have been shown to produce false positives
      in tests of Mucinex, chocolate, aspirin, chocolate, and oregano.
      However, law enforcement agencies continue to employ these kits.<br>
      <br>
      Fox 13 Tampa investigated the validity of drug field testing kits
      in the wake of arrests of three people based on false positives
      from field tests. Eventually all three were cleared and all
      charges were dropped. However, for the months between arrest and
      confirmatory testing by the state crime lab, the individuals felt
      that they were “guilty until proven innocent.”<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Omar Bagasra, a research scientist at Claflin University, has
      been looking into the validity of field drug testing kits. In
      controlled tests in his laboratory, Dr. Bagasra, Dr. Cherilyn
      Haggen-Paey, and forensic scientist Chris Addanki, have
      demonstrated that the chemicals used in the kits are prone to give
      false positives even with common household materials. According to
      their tests, Mucinex can produce false positives for heroin and
      morphine; chocolate can be interpreted as marijuana; and soap can
      test positive as GHB. Even exposure to air caused false positives
      in some kits, according to their tests. The scientists noted that
      they had trouble interpreting results in a laboratory environment
      and “you can imagine in the field it’s even more difficult.”
      However, the experts say the problems are not linked to just the
      individual kits tested or a specific manufacturer, as many the
      field test kits tend to contain the same chemicals.<br>
      <br>
      Field drug testing kits were created to screen for illicit
      substances in the field followed by more complete testing in a
      laboratory setting. However, the tests stand in for more
      scientifically valid testing until analysis at state crime labs
      occurs. Drug testing at state crime labs is typically performed
      just prior to trial due to the high rate of plea bargaining in
      drug cases, and therefore false positives are often not discovered
      unless contested at trial. During this time, the false positives
      from field tests can cause innocent citizens to be detained in
      jail for weeks or even months.<br>
      <br>
      “False Positive Equal False Justice,” a 2008 report created for
      the California Attorneys for Criminal Justice, noted that false
      positives resulting in criminal charges has been an ongoing
      problem. In 2003, a Pennsylvania college student was held for
      three weeks when flour was mistaken for cocaine. In 2007, musician
      Don Bolles was arrested for possession of GHB which was actually
      soap. Additionally the report lists approximately forty
      extracts—such as vanilla, peppermint, or ginkgo—which can test as
      false positives for marijuana.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Frederic Whitehurst, a Ph.D. chemist and former FBI lab
      supervisor, has expressed concern with the use of field drug
      testing kits. He stated that he has “no confidence at all in those
      test kits.” Due to the high chance of false positives, both Dr.
      Whitehurst and Dr. Bagasra have recommended that drug field
      testing kits not be used. They say law enforcement would receive
      more valid results by waiting for results from lab testing. The
      kits are single use and range from a $4 to $20 a use depending on
      what drug is being investigated.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Language Matters: DOJ’s Reporting
            Language and Testimony Guidelines</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      Forensic scientists are tasked with the job of explaining often
      complex scientific data to judges, jurors, and attorneys who may
      have little understanding of the science underlying the forensic
      analysis in a case.<br>
      <br>
      Revelations in recent years that hair analysts provided testimony
      that had no scientific validity has highlighted the importance of
      using correct language to convey information about forensic
      analysis and its limitations. Several wrongful convictions have
      been overturned based on faulty testimony about hair evidence and
      a massive review of hair cases is ongoing.<br>
      <br>
      In an effort to improve expert testimony, the U.S. Department of
      Justice has released proposed guidelines called the Uniform
      Language for Testimony and Reports. These guidelines, once
      finalized, will apply to all DOJ personnel who issue reports or
      provide expert forensic testimony, and they will probably be
      viewed as best practices for the entire forensic community. The
      guidelines are currently accessible at
      https://justice.gov/dag/forensic-science, with the public comment
      section running through July 8, 2016.<br>
      <br>
      Attorneys should be aware of these guidelines and be prepared to
      object to any lab report language or testimony that does not
      comply. For example, the Uniform Language for Testimony and
      Reports for the Forensic Latent Print Discipline provides the
      following guidance on what experts cannot say about their
      evidence: (1) they cannot state that two prints originate from the
      same source to the absolute exclusion of all other sources; (2)
      they cannot state that there is any statistical level of certainty
      attributed to their determination; (3) they cannot testify that
      their science is infallible. Similarly, for the testing of bodily
      fluids, analysts may not state or imply that a level of numerical
      certainty is calculated to support the identification of blood or
      semen (i.e., they cannot say they are 95 per cent confident that
      the stain contained blood or there is a one in a hundred chance
      that the stain was something other than semen) and may not state
      or imply that the methods used in performing serological
      examinations have error rates of zero or that they are infallible.
      For drug analysis, the guidelines specify that when no sampling
      plan was used and no reasonable assumption of homogeneity of an
      item was determined, the examiner may not report or state an
      opinion that the conclusions apply to the entirety of an item (or
      a percentage of the item). This limitation is important in pill
      cases where only one pill is tested.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      This unit describes a straightforward method for preparing
      glycerol nucleic acid (GNA) phosphoramidite monomers and
      oligonucleotide polymers using standard cyanoethyl phosphoramidite
      chemistry. GNA is an unnatural nucleic acid analog composed of an
      acyclic three-carbon sugar-phosphate backbone that contains one
      stereogenic center per repeating unit. GNA has attracted
      significant attention as a nucleic acid derivative due to its
      unique ability to form stable Watson-Crick anti-parallel duplex
      structures with thermal and thermodynamic stabilities rivaling
      those of natural DNA and RNA. The chemical simplicity of this
      nucleic acid structure provides access to enantiomerically pure
      forms of right- and left-handed helical structures that can be
      used as unnatural building blocks in DNA nanotechnology.<br>

      <br>
      Salk Institute scientists have found preliminary evidence that
      tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other compounds found in marijuana
      can promote the cellular removal of amyloid beta, a toxic protein
      associated with Alzheimer's disease.<br>
      <br>
      While these exploratory studies were conducted in neurons grown in
      the laboratory, they may offer insight into the role of
      inflammation in Alzheimer's disease and could provide clues to
      developing novel therapeutics for the disorder.<br>
      <br>
      "Although other studies have offered evidence that cannabinoids
      might be neuroprotective against the symptoms of Alzheimer's, we
      believe our study is the first to demonstrate that cannabinoids
      affect both inflammation and amyloid beta accumulation in nerve
      cells," says Salk Professor David Schubert, the senior author of
      the paper.<br>
      <br>
      Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disorder that leads to
      memory loss and can seriously impair a person's ability to carry
      out daily tasks. It affects more than five million Americans
      according to the National Institutes of Health, and is a leading
      cause of death. It is also the most common cause of dementia and
      its incidence is expected to triple during the next 50 years.<br>
      <br>
      It has long been known that amyloid beta accumulates within the
      nerve cells of the aging brain well before the appearance of
      Alzheimer's disease symptoms and plaques. Amyloid beta is a major
      component of the plaque deposits that are a hallmark of the
      disease. But the precise role of amyloid beta and the plaques it
      forms in the disease process remains unclear.<br>
      <br>
      In a manuscript published in June 2016's Aging and Mechanisms of
      Disease, Salk team studied nerve cells altered to produce high
      levels of amyloid beta to mimic aspects of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers found that high levels of amyloid beta were
      associated with cellular inflammation and higher rates of neuron
      death. They demonstrated that exposing the cells to THC reduced
      amyloid beta protein levels and eliminated the inflammatory
      response from the nerve cells caused by the protein, thereby
      allowing the nerve cells to survive.<br>
      <br>
      "Inflammation within the brain is a major component of the damage
      associated with Alzheimer's disease, but it has always been
      assumed that this response was coming from immune-like cells in
      the brain, not the nerve cells themselves," says Antonio Currais,
      a postdoctoral researcher in Schubert's laboratory and first
      author of the paper. "When we were able to identify the molecular
      basis of the inflammatory response to amyloid beta, it became
      clear that THC-like compounds that the nerve cells make themselves
      may be involved in protecting the cells from dying."<br>
      <br>
      Brain cells have switches known as receptors that can be activated
      by endocannabinoids, a class of lipid molecules made by the body
      that are used for intercellular signaling in the brain. The
      psychoactive effects of marijuana are caused by THC, a molecule
      similar in activity to endocannabinoids that can activate the same
      receptors. Physical activity results in the production of
      endocannabinoids and some studies have shown that exercise may
      slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
      <br>
      Schubert emphasized that his team's findings were conducted in
      exploratory laboratory models, and that the use of THC-like
      compounds as a therapy would need to be tested in clinical trials.<br>
      <br>
      In separate but related research, his lab found an Alzheimer's
      drug candidate called J147 that also removes amyloid beta from
      nerve cells and reduces the inflammatory response in both nerve
      cells and the brain. It was the study of J147 that led the
      scientists to discover that endocannabinoids are involved in the
      removal of amyloid beta and the reduction of inflammation.<br>

      Plastics are great. They can take any shape and serve an endless
      variety of roles. But... the beginning and end of a plastic’s life
      are problematic. While some plastics are made from renewable
      agricultural products, most are derived from petroleum. Plastics
      are not as easy to recycle as we'd like, and a huge percentage
      ends up in landfills (or the ocean), where they can be virtually
      immortal.<br>
      <br>
      The easy way to recycle plastic is to just rip it up, melt it
      down, and pour a new mold. But that only works when the plastic is
      all the same chemical type, which is a level of purity you rarely
      find in a recycling bin. Without separating plastics precisely
      into different types, you get a mixture that is much less useful
      than pure plastics. We’re limited in what we can make out of it.
      Other methods for recycling plastics require serious energy input,
      like high pressure and temperatures over 400°C. That can produce a
      variety of hydrocarbon compounds, but they can be difficult to
      work with.<br>
      <br>
      Recently, a team led by Xiangqing Jia of the Shanghai Institute of
      Organic Chemistry decided to try some chemical tricks to turn some
      of these plastics into something useful, even if it’s not more
      plastic. They worked with polyethylene, which makes up the
      majority of the plastic we use. Polyethylenes are essentially long
      chains made of repeating links of carbon, with hydrogen hanging
      off the side. The challenge is to break that resilient chain into
      shorter pieces so we can use the pieces to make other compounds.<br>
      <br>
      The new process involves two steps, each run by a catalyst. The
      first catalyst is a molecule including an atom of iridium. This
      catalyst pulls some of the hydrogens off the carbon backbone of a
      polyethylene. With the loss of these hydrogens, some of the
      single-electron-pair bonds between carbons become double bonds.
      That opens up a vulnerability for the second catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      That second catalyst, which can be based on atoms of rhenium and
      aluminum, teams up with some short chain petroleum compounds that
      the researchers added in. The long chain plastic is sliced at the
      double bond, and pieces of the short chain petroleum molecules are
      glued to either side. Where there was once a single, very long
      chain, there are now two chains.<br>
      <br>
      But the whole process is cyclical and doesn't stop there. The
      first catalyst releases some hydrogens as it pulls them off the
      plastic, which can be used to convert any double bonds back to
      single bonds. The same series of reactions can play out again.
      Repeat this for a few hours, and only shorter chain compounds
      remain. Heat does still have to be added to fuel this process, but
      temperatures around 150°C are sufficient.<br>
      <br>
      The end result is three basic types of compounds. There are very
      short chain compounds (things like butane) that can be used to get
      the reaction started for the next batch of plastic. (The catalysts
      can also be separated out and reused.) There are some longer chain
      wax compounds that are useful inputs for the plastics-making
      process. And in between, you get diesel fuel.<br>
      <br>
      By tuning different parts of the process, the researchers were
      able to control the proportion of wax vs. fuel that came out, as
      well as the range of wax compounds. Most of the plastic can easily
      be turned into fuel. Some of the chemicals that are added to
      plastics to modify their properties should be recoverable, too, so
      they can be used again.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, this isn’t as good as recycling plastics into further
      generations of plastics, particularly when the first generation
      was born of petroleum. But imagine if all the packaging your food
      came in could fuel the next shipment instead of clogging up
      landfills for centuries. And if we grew our plastics instead of
      pumping them from oil fields, we could get two for the renewable
      price of one.<br>

          polyethylenes into liquid fuels and waxes under mild
          conditions</b><br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Polyethylene (PE) is the largest-volume synthetic polymer, and its
      chemical inertness makes its degradation by low-energy processes a
      challenging problem. We report a tandem catalytic cross alkane
      metathesis method for highly efficient degradation of
      polyethylenes under mild conditions. With the use of widely
      available, low-value, short alkanes (for example, petroleum
      ethers) as cross metathesis partners, different types of
      polyethylenes with various molecular weights undergo complete
      conversion into useful liquid fuels and waxes. This method shows
      excellent selectivity for linear alkane formation, and the
      degradation product distribution (liquid fuels versus waxes) can
      be controlled by the catalyst structure and reaction time. In
      addition, the catalysts are compatible with various polyolefin
      additives; therefore, common plastic wastes, such as postconsumer
      polyethylene bottles, bags, and films could be converted into
      valuable chemical feedstocks without any pretreatment.<br>

      …To help create a better industrial-scale method of recycling and
      chemical recovery, researchers from a joint US-China collaboration
      project at UIC and SIOC have come up with a new method to break
      down polyethylene that produces fewer toxic by-products and more
      useful compounds…<br>
      <br>
      The process is what is know as cross-alkane metathesis, which is
      essentially a double-dissolution chemical reaction where two parts
      of two substances form two new substances. In this case, the
      technique selectively degrades a range of PE plastics into fuels
      and waxes under milder conditions and in a more controlled manner
      than in current industrial processes of plastic breakdown and
      recovery. In fact, according to the researchers, the new method
      can completely degrade PE compounds into usable oils and waxes in
      only one day at just 347° F (175° C).. <br>

      <br>
      Many say we can have 100% renewable energy by 2050. This is
      factually incorrect.<br>
      <br>
      We can have 100% renewable electricity production by 2050.<br>
      <br>
      But electricity production is only 18% of total world energy
      demand.<br>
      <br>
      82% of total world energy demand is NOT electricity production.<br>
      <br>
      The other 82% of the world’s energy is used to extract minerals to
      make roads, cement, bricks, glass, steel and grow food so we can
      eat and sleep. Solar panels and wind turbines will not be making
      cement or steel anytime soon. Why? Do you really want to know?
      Here we go.<br>
      TWED = Total World Energy Demand<br>
      <br>
      18% of TWED is electrical grid generation.<br>
      82% of TWED is not electrical grid generation.<br>
      <br>
      In 20 years, solar &amp; wind energy is up from 1% to 3% of TWED.<br>
      <br>
      Solar &amp; wind power are projected to provide 6% of TWED by
      2030.<br>
      <br>
      When you hear stories about solar &amp; wind generating<br>
      50% of all humanity’s electrical power by 2050,<br>
      that’s really only 9% of TWED because<br>
      100% of electrical production is 18% of TWED.<br>
      <br>
      But, it takes 10X as much solar &amp; wind energy to close 1
      fossil fuel power plant simply because they don’t produce energy
      all the time.<br>

        </b></a><br>
      That means it will take 10 X 18% of TWED to close all fossil power
      plants with intermittent power.<br>
      <br>
      Research says it will take 4 X 82% of TWED for a 100% renewable
      energy transition. But then again, whoever trusts research?<br>
      <br>
      10 X 18% + 4 X 82% = 100% Renewable TWED.<br>
      <br>
      CONCLUSION:<br>
      <br>
      We require 10X the fossil electrical grid energy we use now just
      to solve 18% of the emissions problem with solar &amp; wind power.
      This also means that even if we use 100% efficient Carbon Capture
      and Storage (CCS) for all the world’s electricity generation, we
      would still only prevent 18% of our emissions. 100% efficient CCS
      is very unlikely. Switching to electric vehicles would only double
      electrical demand while most of our roads are made out of
      distilled oil sludge.<br>
      <br>
      These figures do not include massive electrical storage and grid
      infrastructure solar &amp; wind require. Such infrastructure is
      hundreds of millions of tons of materials taking decades to
      construct, demanding even more energy and many trillions of
      dollars. With that kind of money in the offing, you can see why
      some wax over-enthused.<br>
      <br>
      Solar &amp; wind systems last 30 years meaning we will always have
      to replace them all over the world again 50% sooner than fossil
      power plants.<br>
      <br>
      Solar and wind power are an energy trap.<br>
      <br>
      It takes 1 ton of coal to make 6-12 solar panels.<br>
      Business As Usual = BAU<br>
      <br>
      In 15 years 40% of humanity will be short of water with BAU.<br>
      In 15 years 20% of humanity will be severely short of water.<br>
      <br>
      Right now, 1 billion people walk a mile every day for water.<br>
      <br>
      In 60 years humanity will not have enough soil to grow food says
      Scientific American. They call it, “The End of Human Agriculture.”
      Humanity’s soil is eroding and degrading away at 24 million acres
      per year.&nbsp; And, when they say 60 years they don’t mean
      everything is wonderful until the last day of the 59th year. We
      will feel the heat of those words in much less than 30 years. Soil
      loss rates will only increase with severe droughts, storms and
      low-land floods. Here’s what BAU really looks like.<br>
      <br>
      50% of humanity’s soil will be gone in 30 years.<br>
      50% of humanity will lack water in 30 years.<br>
      50% of humanity will go hungry in 30 years.<br>
      <br>
      A 100% TWED transition takes 50 years minimum. It is a vastly more
      difficult and complex goal than you are told.<br>

      We are losing earth’s soil and fresh water faster than we can
      effect 100% renewable TWED.<br>
      <br>
      In 25 years civilization will end says Lloyds of London and the
      British Foreign Office.<br>
      <br>
      In my opinion, in 30 years we won’t have enough fossil fuel for a
      100% renewable TWED transition.<br>
      <br>
      This is the most important fact I’ve learned:<br>
      <br>
      Renewable Energy is Unsustainable without massive energy demand
      destruction<br>
      <br>
      Humanity will destroy its soil and water faster than we can switch
      to renewable energy with BAU. We cannot sustain economic growth
      with renewable energy. Without massive political-economic change,
      civilization will collapse with 100% certainty. But, don’t worry,
      I like to fix things.<br>

      Animal Agriculture = AA<br>
      <br>
      Humans + Livestock = 97% of the weight of all land vertebrate
      biomass<br>
      Humans + Livestock = 80% of the cause of all land-air extinctions<br>
      Humans + Livestock = 50% of the use of all land surface area<br>
      Humans + Livestock = 40% consumption of all land plant growth *<br>
      * Net Primary Production.<br>
      <br>
      50% of the soy grown in South America is shipped over to China to
      feed their pigs. Rainforests and deep-rooted scrub are cleared to
      grow animals &amp; feed so that their required fresh water is in
      reality a sky river exported in boats to China and Europe leaving
      little moisture in the air to reach São Paulo. Since rainforest
      roots are so thick they don’t require very much, or even good,
      soil;&nbsp; this leaves rainforest soil so poor and thin that it
      degrades and erodes faster when exposed to the elements.<br>
      <br>
      The Himalayan mountains are heating 2X faster than the planet and
      many fear that China will run out of water in 15 years by 2030.<br>
      <br>
      50% of China’s rivers have vanished since 1980.<br>
      60% of China’s groundwater is too poisoned to touch.<br>
      50% of China’s cropland is too poisoned to safely grow food.<br>
      <br>
      Animal Agriculture will destroy our soil and water long before we
      can effect 100% intermittent TWED transition with BAU.<br>
      <br>
      BAU means 7 billion people will not stop eating meat and wasting
      food without major $$$ incentive. Meaning a steadily rising carbon
      tax on meat. Just saying that can get you killed in some places.<br>
      <br>
      Without using James Hansen’s 100% private tax dividends to carbon
      tax meat consumption out of the market earth will die. 100%
      private tax dividends means 100% for you, 0% for government.<br>
      <br>
      100% for you,<br>
      0% for gov.<br>
      <br>
      The funny thing is that meat and fire saved our ancestors from
      extinction and now meat and fire will cause mass extinction of all
      the life we love on earth. Survival is not an optional menu item
      as is eating meat. We have to act now, not 5 years from now, or
      forever be not remembered as the least greatest generation because
      there’ll be no one left to remember us.<br>
      <br>
      Michael Mann says we will lock-in a 2 degree temperature rise in 3
      years for 2036 with BAU. Ocean fish will be gone in less than 25
      years simply because of the BAU of meat consumption. The BAU of
      fishing kills everything in its path producing lots of waste kill.

      We cannot let governments get control of carbon markets like how
      Sanders, Klein and McKibben want government to get 40% of your
      carbon tax dividend money. Naomi Klein and Bill McKibben are
      funded by the Rockefellers. Klein’s latest video about herself was
      funded by the oil-invested Ford Foundation. This is 100% in direct
      opposition to James Hansen’s tax dividend plan and immoral. Hansen
      said that governments should get 0% of that money, not 40%.&nbsp;
      I strongly believe your carbon dividends should be in a new
      open-source world e-currency directly deposited to your phone to
      be phased in over 10 years. But, I’m kinda simple that way.<br>
      <br>
      Google: Rockefellers fund Bill McKibben. Believe me, the
      Rockefellers don’t fund 350.org out of the kindness of their
      hearts. To learn why they would do such a thing, you can watch the
      educational video at the bottom of this page.<br>

      James Hansen repeated at COP21 that his 100% private carbon tax
      dividends would unite Democrats and Republicans because government
      would be 100% excluded. Socialists like Sanders, Klein and
      McKibben want government to control 40% of that money. They are
      divisive and Republicans will never accept their revolutionary
      rhetoric. We don’t have time for this endless fighting. Forget the
      Socialist vs. Capitalist mentality. We barely even have time to
      unite, and nothing unites like money. Environmentalism in the 21st
      century is about a revolving door of money and power for elite
      socialists and capitalists. Let’s give everyone a chance to put
      some skin in the game.<br>

            Around 2020, Rest Of World Around 2047, Study Says</b><br>
        </big><br>
        <b>Eric Zuesse Investigative historian</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The first study to integrate all prior scientific research in
      order to project approximately when climate change will produce
      permanent catastrophic consequences has been accepted and will
      soon be published in the scientific journal Nature, and it finds
      that things will start going haywire in the tropics at around the
      year 2020, and in our part of the world at around 2047.<br>
      <br>
      Nature shares with Science and PNAS (Proceedings of the National
      Academy of Sciences) the distinction of being tied as the world’s
      three most prestigious scientific journals, and an article is not
      published in these journals unless it has undergone extremely
      rigorous scientific peer-revue; so, climate-change deniers will
      have no professional credibility in attacking this study, as the
      Koch brothers and their friends can reasonably be expected to do,
      since they profit so much from what causes global warming - the
      burning of carbon-based fuels.<br>
      <br>
      According to this study, the tropics, which are the
      near-equatorial region of this planet that’s almost 100%
      impoverished, and that has thus contributed virtually nothing to
      global warming, will begin the period of permanent catastrophe
      starting in approximately 2020; but the (cooler) moderate-latitude
      countries, such as in North America and Europe, will begin this
      catastrophic period in or around 2047.<br>
      <br>
      This isn’t to say that things won’t continue to get worse after
      then; it’s only to say that this is, as the article will be
      titled, “The projected timing of climate departure from recent
      variability.”<br>
      <br>
      This landmark article was co-authored by a team of 14
      climate-scientists. It says: “Unprecedented climates will occur
      earliest in the tropics and among low-income countries.” It
      explains that the reason for this is that the countries near the
      equator have far less variability in their weather than do the
      moderate-climate countries, and so the species that constitute the
      ecosystems there cannot tolerate temperatures outside their narrow
      range, which has existed within that narrow range for thousands of
      years. Consequently, species-extinctions will soar there much
      faster and earlier than here. The existing impoverished economies,
      within around 2,500 miles of the equator (where average per-capita
      incomes are less than 10% of the average in the moderate-latitude
      countries such as ours), will become unlivable…<br>

      A Fountain Green man received the maximum sentence Friday for
      sexually abusing two infant girls between 2003 and 2009 while
      living in Eagle Mountain.<br>
      <br>
      Sterling Allan was sentenced by Judge Darold McDade to 15 years to
      life in the Utah State Prison for two first-degree felony charges
      of attempted sodomy on a child.<br>
      <br>
      The sentence for each charge will run consecutively to each other,
      but because of the sentencing guidelines, prosecuting attorney
      Craig Johnson said Allan will likely have his first parole hearing
      in 22 years.<br>
      <br>
      “Certainly 22 years minimum fits the punitive needs of our
      community,” Johnson said.<br>
      <br>
      Allan, 52, was also fined $20,000.<br>
      <br>
      Allan was found through a joint operation between the FBI and the
      Utah County Sheriff’s Office. A court affidavit states the FBI
      became aware of Allan in December 2015 when they found his YouTube
      channel. In several videos he admits to being a pedophile who has
      committed several sex offenses against children, reports state.<br>
      <br>
      The victims were interviewed in January 2016 and told police that
      because of their age they don’t remember the abuse, reports state.<br>

      jetpacks flying around landmarks and jet-powered hoverboards

      of the Airvinci: a ducted fan VTOL aircraft that is expected to

      The invention has now for object to provide a method which
      obviates the nefarious influence on living beings of the
      above-defined phenomenoms.<br>
      <br>
      [0005]<br>
      For this purpose, one determines the wave length and direction of
      that electro-magnetic field which.is considered as nefarious, and
      one arranges at right angle to the right vector of said magnetic
      field, at least one ampoule which contains a mistletoe (viscum
      album) extract.<br>
      <br>
      [0006]<br>
      In a possible variation of said method, a metalloid is added to
      said extract..<br>
      <br>
      [0013]<br>
      It has now been possible to ascertain that by arranging such an
      ampoule in the above-defined way, the electro-magnetic field may
      be influenced in such a way that the force lines thereof fall
      outside that area which is to be protected. With an ampoule having
      a content about ±1 cm3 , it has been determined that very marked
      results could be obtained, as it appeared from repeated
      measurings...<br>

      This is a new invention, including improvements upon existing
      inventions, which is safer, simpler to use, less invasive into a
      user's daily routine and provides a lower cost solution to
      existing pulsed magnetic field and related vibrational
      electromagnetic therapy devices. This invention (apparatus) is
      referred to as an EnergyWave Therapy Device to distinguish it from
      existing electromagnetic therapy devices. It operates
      non-invasively on a homeopathic level to improve sleep, encourage
      natural healing and reduce pain, swelling, and general
      discomfort.; This is accomplished through different embodiments of
      the apparatus all of which generate Multiple Simultaneous
      Extremely Low Frequency (MSELF) energy waves which may be any
      combination of Alternating Polarity Magnetic Fields (APMF),
      narrowband near-coherent long-wavelength (580 nm to 980 nm) light
      emitting diodes (LEDs), or electrical vibrations transmitted
      through the medium of water using carbon rod electrodes. The MSELF
      vibrations are derived from a quartz crystal with a fundamental
      frequency less than one-half of one percent from a natural
      Fibonacci Sequence Number. The apparatus utilizes firmware
      operating in a microcontroller containing predefined, user
      selectable therapy programs either emulating natural Circadian
      Rhythms for sleep and rest, or other therapeutic programs, all of
      which contain Electromagnetic Field (EMF) dose limitations to
      prevent any possible overexposure.; The microcontroller is also
      clocked at the same fundamental frequency generated by the
      Fibonacci Sequence Quartz Crystal. Additionally, the apparatus's
      unique application of an H-Bridge configuration power-driver with
      Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) capabilities supports a novel
      approach to supply two simultaneous therapeutic frequencies to
      either a copper-trace coil emitter integrated on the main Printed
      Circuit Board (PCB) or optional external energy emitters. The
      result is a more effective, lower energy, safer, lower cost,
      simpler to use, noninvasive, multi-modal, EnergyWave Therapy
      Device.<br>

            Man's Music</b></big><br>

      One doesn't have to be a superstitionist to believe that the
      end-times are upon us. I'm an elderly atheist, and it's never been
      clearer to me that Good vs Evil is the defining issue of human
      existence—since from it existence vs destruction flows—and that
      Good is now being deluged by a tsunami of Evil ... meaning, mass
      destruction is nigh (and well-deserved).<br>
      <br>
      Evil as in Islam; Evil as in socialism and other forms of statism;
      Evil as in the cultural terrorism represented by punk, rap, Wagner
      and other forms of nihilistic headbanging; Evil as in the gleeful
      addiction to trivia and banality manifest on Faecesbook and other
      repositories of mass sub-humanity; Evil as in "Social Justice
      Warriors" who have supplanted human speech with quacking and
      frying in the name of closing down all speech; Evil as in
      mainstream media who have abandoned journalism and acquiesced
      shamelessly to Evil; Evil most woefully as in the appeasement
      thereof by social-climbers and cowards who know better but who
      remain silent or crawl up Evil's rectum ...<br>
      <br>
      It occurred to me tonight as I listened to this incomparable
      performance of Tchaikovsky's Pathetique Symphony that the tale of
      humanity is bound up herein—and I suspect Tchaikovsky knew as
      much, even though this, his final composition, was primarily,
      pre-eminently, personal and auto-biographical.<br>
      <br>
      The first movement could be seen as laying out the Glory of Man as
      He might be, ought to be, can be, and often has been. Midway
      through, He encounters Evil in a thunderous confrontation, but
      emerges intact ... though ominously subdued.<br>
      <br>
      The second movement could be seen as sublime maintenance.
      Life-affirmation, benevolence, conviviality, diligent creativity
      ... all reiterated and writ large. The third could be seen as
      militant maintenance—the same virtues asserted more aggressively.
      But note that in both movements Evil's pesky voice subtly
      insinuates itself into an otherwise seamless optimism, and is left
      to undulate and percolate.<br>
      <br>
      In the fourth movement, the first movement comes crashing down. We
      didn't pay sufficient attention to Evil; we have left it to
      undulate and percolate ... and it has suddenly caught up with us.
      Part of Evil's insidious modus operandi after all was to destroy
      our ability to pay attention in the first place; all that is
      necessary for Evil to triumph, it turns out, is for good men
      constantly to be texting, gaming, burbling inanities on Faecesbook
      ... and, when confronted unavoidably with the likes of Istanbul
      and Orlando, repairing to mindless, evasive excuses.<br>
      <br>
      Another part of Evil's insidious modus operandi was to turn off
      Man's receptors to beauty, so that His very destruction may be
      chronicled to Him in the most beautiful language ever contrived
      without His having a clue.<br>
      <br>
      Here is an instance of "the most beautiful language ever
      contrived"—and in its rediscovery, I submit—that of the Romantic
      genre and the virtues that underpin it—lies Man's only hope of
      salvation.<br>
