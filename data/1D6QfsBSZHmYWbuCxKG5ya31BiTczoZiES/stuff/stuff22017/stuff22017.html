          alter digestive cell structure and function</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Small intestinal cells hindered by chronic exposure to common food
      additive<br>
      <br>
      The ability of small intestine cells to absorb nutrients and act
      as a barrier to pathogens is "significantly decreased" after
      chronic exposure to nanoparticles of titanium dioxide, a common
      food additive found in everything from chewing gum to bread,
      according to research from Binghamton University, State University
      of New York.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers exposed a small intestinal cell culture model to the
      physiological equivalent of a meal's worth of titanium oxide
      nanoparticles -- 30 nanometers across -- over four hours (acute
      exposure), or three meal's worth over five days (chronic
      exposure).<br>
      <br>
      Acute exposures did not have much effect, but chronic exposure
      diminished the absorptive projections on the surface of intestinal
      cells called microvilli. With fewer microvilli, the intestinal
      barrier was weakened, metabolism slowed and some nutrients --
      iron, zinc, and fatty acids, specifically -- were more difficult
      to absorb. Enzyme functions were negatively affected, while
      inflammation signals increased.<br>
      <br>
      "Titanium oxide is a common food additive and people have been
      eating a lot of it for a long time -- don't worry, it won't kill
      you! -- but we were interested in some of the subtle effects, and
      we think people should know about them," said Biomedical
      Engineering Assistant Professor Gretchen Mahler, one of the
      authors of the paper.<br>
      <br>
      "There has been previous work on how titanium oxide nanoparticles
      affects microvilli, but we are looking at much lower
      concentrations," Mahler said. "We also extended previous work to
      show that these nanoparticles alter intestinal function."<br>
      <br>
      Titanium dioxide is generally recognized as safe by the U.S. Food
      and Drug Administration, and ingestion is nearly unavoidable. The
      compound is an inert and insoluble material that is commonly used
      for white pigmentation in paints, paper and plastics. It is also
      an active ingredient in mineral-based sunscreens for pigmentation
      to block ultraviolet light.<br>
      <br>
      However, it can enter the digestive system through toothpastes, as
      titanium dioxide is used to create abrasion needed for cleaning.
      The oxide is also used in some chocolate to give it a smooth
      texture; in donuts to provide color; and in skimmed milks for a
      brighter, more opaque appearance which makes the milk more
      palatable.<br>
      <br>
      A 2012 Arizona State University study tested 89 common food
      products including gum, Twinkies, and mayonnaise and found that
      they all contained titanium dioxide. About five percent of
      products in that study contained titanium dioxide as
      nanoparticles. Dunkin Donuts stopped using powdered sugar with
      titanium dioxide nanoparticles in 2015 in response to pressure
      from the advocacy group As You Sow.<br>
      <br>
      "To avoid foods rich in titanium oxide nanoparticles you should
      avoid processed foods, and especially candy. That is where you see
      a lot of nanoparticles," Mahler said.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Ingestion of titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles from products
      such as agricultural chemicals, processed food, and nutritional
      supplements is nearly unavoidable. The gastrointestinal tract
      serves as a critical interface between the body and the external
      environment, and is the site of essential nutrient absorption. The
      goal of this study was to examine the effects of ingesting the 30
      nm TiO2 nanoparticles with an in vitro cell culture model of the
      small intestinal epithelium, and to determine how acute or chronic
      exposure to nano-TiO2 influences intestinal barrier function,
      reactive oxygen species generation, proinflammatory signaling,
      nutrient absorption (iron, zinc, fatty acids), and brush border
      membrane enzyme function (intestinal alkaline phosphatase). A
      Caco-2/HT29-MTX cell culture model was exposed to physiologically
      relevant doses of TiO2 nanoparticles for acute (4 h) or chronic
      (five days) time periods. Exposure to TiO2 nanoparticles
      significantly decreased intestinal barrier function following
      chronic exposure. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation,
      proinflammatory signaling, and intestinal alkaline phosphatase
      activity all showed increases in response to nano-TiO2. Iron,
      zinc, and fatty acid transport were significantly decreased
      following exposure to TiO2 nanoparticles. This is because
      nanoparticle exposure induced a decrease in absorptive microvilli
      in the intestinal epithelial cells. Nutrient transporter protein
      gene expression was also altered, suggesting that cells are
      working to regulate the transport mechanisms disturbed by
      nanoparticle ingestion. Overall, these results show that
      intestinal epithelial cells are affected at a functional level by
      physiologically relevant exposure to nanoparticles commonly
      ingested from food.<br>

          Antibiotic-Resistant Superbugs<br>
        </b><br>
        <b>by MARCO TORRES</b><b><br>
        </b></div>
      <br>
      Modern medicine has failed miserably at treating antibiotic
      resistant superbugs. Widespread use of antibiotics in farming as
      well as antibacterial agents have promoted the growth of dangerous
      superbugs for decades which could leave millions vulnerable to
      untreatable illness within a generation. A recipe for an eye salve
      found in the British Library in a 10th-century book of Anglo-Saxon
      medical advice may hold the natural solution to which conventional
      medicine has not been able to address.<br>
      <br>
      While infections are becoming increasingly difficult to beat, no
      new class of antibiotic has been discovered since 1987. In
      contrast, a new infection emerges on an almost yearly basis.<br>
      <br>
      Vaccines are known to be causing an unprecedented number of
      mutations creating superbugs and potent viruses and bacteria that
      may eventually threaten future generations and humanity itself.<br>
      <br>
      "It could make even routine operations such as hip surgery
      deadly," said Chief Medical Officer Professor Dame Sally Davies.
      Dame Sally said the ‘catastrophic threat’ from infections
      resistant to frontline antibiotics is so serious that she has
      asked the Government to put antibiotic resistance on the national
      risk register -- ranking it alongside a large-scale terrorist
      attack or flu pandemic.<br>
      <br>
      Bacteria that develop resistance to an antibiotic or other
      antibacterial agent generally grow more slowly than bacteria that
      are sensitive to the agent. From a public-health standpoint, this
      used to be beneficial because when the antibacterial agent was not
      present, the drug-sensitive strain would grow to dominate the
      drug-resistant strain. But new research suggests that bacteria
      that are resistant to antibiotics continue to persist, even
      thrive, whether antibiotics are present or not.<br>
      <br>
      The recipe found in the 10th-century book specifies that specific
      ingredients must be brewed in a brass vessel, strained and then
      left to sit for nine days before use.<br>
      <br>
      The ingredients include: Garlic, Onion or leek, Wine, Oxgall, bile
      from a cow's stomach.<br>
      <br>
      When tested in mice on wounds infected with methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), it was performing well, reported
      scientists at the Annual Conference of the Society for General
      Microbiology this week in the United Kingdom.<br>
      <br>
      "We were absolutely blown away by just how effective the
      combination of ingredients was," Freya Harrison, the University of
      Nottingham microbiologist who led the study, said in a statement.<br>
      <br>
      The idea of testing the remedy came from historian Christina Lee,
      who knows Harrison through a book club at the university at which
      members read at old Anglo-Saxon textbooks together, said Steve
      Diggle. Diggle, an associate professor of microbiology, runs the
      lab where Harrison does her postdoctoral research.<br>

      The remedy proved effective at killing bacteria in a test tube, so
      the researchers decided to try it on MRSA biofilms -- tightly
      packed, sticky coatings of bacteria found all over surfaces in
      places like hospitals. But the potion killed the biofilms too.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers found none of the individual ingredients alone had
      any measurable effect on MRSA, but the combination was highly
      effective.<br>

      Garlic Proven 100 Times More Effective Than Antibiotics, Working
      In A Fraction of The Time ]<br>
      <br>
      [ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3147487/ ]<br>

      Diallyl disulfide is an organosulfur compound derived from garlic
      and a few other genus Allium plants. It is produced during the
      decomposition of allicin, which is released upon crushing garlic.
      British scientists have developed a proprietary process through
      which the naturally occurring allicin in garlic is extracted,
      stabilized and concentrated. <br>
      <br>
      "This work is very exciting to me because it shows that this
      compound has the potential to reduce disease-causing bacteria in
      the environment and in our food supply," said Xiaonan Lu, a
      postdoctoral researcher and lead author of the paper.<br>
      <br>
      Lu and his colleagues looked at the ability of diallyl sulfide to
      kill the bacterium when it is protected by a slimy biofilm that
      makes it 1,000 times more resistant to antibiotics than the free
      floating bacterial cell. They found the compound can easily
      penetrate the protective biofilm and kill bacterial cells by
      combining with a sulfur-containing enzyme, subsequently changing
      the enzyme's function and effectively shutting down cell
      metabolism.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers found the diallyl sulfide was as effective as 100
      times as much of the antibiotics erythromycin and ciprofloxacin
      and often would work in a fraction of the time.<br>
      <br>
      Another recipe of a soup based on more than 50 cloves of garlic,
      onions, thyme and lemon will destroy almost any virus that enters
      its path including colds, flu and even norovirus.<br>
      <br>
      Two previous works published by Lu and WSU colleagues in Applied
      and Environmental Microbiology and Analytical Chemistry found
      diallyl sulfide and other organosulfur compounds effectively kill
      important food-borne pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes and
      Escherichia coli.<br>

      In this video series the currently accepted theories of physics

      the fundamental forces in all matter.<br>
      <br>
      You will be amazed as a magnetic model of the dome at CERN is used
      to create a 100 mm diameter plasma Sun with a 300 mm diameter
      equatorial disc of plasma around it!<br>
      <br>
      All the plasma videos are actual footage with no enhancement or
      manipulation other than speed. In other words, this is real thing.

          dynamics</b><br>

      <br>
      What principle causes the Primer Fields to form? The principle has
      a number of aspects. When an electric current flows in two
      parallel wires in the same direction, the magnetic fields around
      the wires draw the wires together. In space, the magnetic fields
      are formed by the movements of flowing electric plasma. The
      resulting magnetic fields draw the plasma together into
      ever-tighter confinement, until a point is reached when the
      'pinched' fields get tangled up, whereby an effective, magnetic
      discontinuity occurs. The discontinuity creates a magnetic opening
      that has its own unique characteristics. A type of dynamic phase
      shift occurs under the conditions of discontinuity that enables
      the still flowing plasma to be magnetically confined and
      concentrated, and the highly concentrated plasma to be focused
      onto a Sun. The plasma dynamics thus power our Sun as an electric
      star that thereby is also a variable star subject to threshold
      conditions. The same principle even powers the galaxies, for which
      ample of evidence exists. The galaxies, of course, are too
      strongly powered for threshold conditions to be possible.<br>

      In this video I model the power of magnetism thats necessary to
      influence the formation of solar systems. I learned this by
      watching a series of videos titled, "The Primer Fields" ..where
      they work developing some really cool advanced quantum physics
      technologies in their research laboratory. Its fascinating stuff
      that leaves a lot of opportunity for personal growth thru
      discovery, observation and reflection.<br>
      <br>
      I can't take credit for the bases of the Primer Fields discovery
      but dispite the patents, I'm able to take something away of equal
      value for myself. I"m able to imagine or otherwise utilized the

      A tiny, transparent device that can fit into a contact lens has a
      bright future, potentially helping a range of scientific endeavors
      from biomedicine to geology.<br>
      <br>
      Developed by Northwestern University scientists, the device,
      called the Micro-ring resonator detector, can determine the speed
      of the blood flow and the oxygen metabolic rate at the back of the
      eye. This information could help diagnose such common and
      debilitating diseases as macular degeneration and diabetes.<br>
      <br>
      The Micro-ring device builds upon Professor Hao F. Zhang's
      groundbreaking work in 2006 to develop photoacoustic imaging,
      which combines sound and light waves to create images of
      biological materials. The imaging technique is being widely
      explored for both fundamental biological investigations and
      clinical diagnosis, from nanoscopic cellular imaging to human
      breast cancer screening.<br>
      <br>
      For three years, Zhang, associate professor of biomedical
      engineering, worked with Cheng Sun, associate professor of
      mechanical engineering, and their post-doctoral fellows Biqin Dong
      and Hao Li to create the Micro-ring resonator detector.<br>
      <br>
      "We believe that with this technology, optical ultrasound
      detection methods will play an increasingly important role in
      photoacoustic imaging for the retina and many biomedical
      applications," Zhang said.<br>
      <br>
      The team's work on the device resulted in a review article,
      published in the January 2017 edition of the journal Transactions
      on Biomedical Engineering.<br>
      <br>
      In 2006, Zhang was exploring new retinal imaging technologies when
      Dr. Amani Fawzi, now an associate professor of ophthalmology at
      Northwestern's Feinberg School of Medicine, approached him to
      create a new diagnostic device that could measure biological
      activities at the back of the eye.<br>
      <br>
      "We needed a device that had large enough bandwidth for spatial
      resolution," Zhang said. "And it needed to be optically
      transparent to allow light to go through freely."<br>
      <br>
      "Ultrasound detection devices of that time were usually bulky,
      opaque, and not sensitive enough. And they had limited bandwidth,"
      Sun said. "It could only capture part of it what was happening in
      the eye."<br>
      <br>
      To meet Fawzi's challenge, the team needed to develop a radically
      different type of detector—small enough to be used with human
      eyes, soft enough to be integrated into a contact lens and yet
      generate a super-high resolution of hundreds of megahertz.<br>
      <br>
      "The trouble was to fabricate it, have it fit in the size of a
      contact lens, and make it still work," Sun said.<br>
      <br>
      First, the team considered a device that placed the needle-sized
      detector on the eyelid, but that method was not ideal. Next, they
      landed on the idea of a tiny ring implanted in a single-use
      contact lens worn during diagnosis.<br>
      <br>
      However, that idea added an extra challenge—making the device
      transparent.<br>
      <br>
      After nearly three years of work, they created the plastic
      Micro-ring resonator, a transparent device that is 60 micrometers
      in diameter and 1 micron high. There is movement toward using it
      with patients.<br>
      <br>
      The team continues to improve the device with support from
      Northwestern, the National Institutes of Health, Argonne National
      Laboratory, and the National Science Foundation.<br>
      <br>
      As word spreads about the device, about a dozen scientists from a
      variety of fields have approached the team about adapting it for
      their own work. For instance:<br>
      <br>
      Oncologists want to use the system to study the optics of breast
      cancer cells, information that could lead to new treatments.<br>
      <br>
      Neuroscientists are interested in using the Micro-ring resonator
      as a window into rodent brains as a way of studying drug
      protection for the cortex during different points of a stroke.
      "Typically, researchers use a pure piece of glass, but this allows
      for a lot more types of imaging," Zhang said.<br>
      <br>
      Geologists aim to use the technology to investigate the earth
      crust and earthquake. "Hearing from a geologist—that was a
      surprise," he added.<br>

      <b> </b><b>Abstract:</b><b><br>
        <br>
      </b><b>Objective:</b> Photoacoustic (PA) imaging emerges as a
      unique tool to study biological samples based on optical
      absorption contrast. In PA imaging, piezoelectric transducers are
      commonly used to detect laser-induced ultrasonic waves. However,
      they typically lack adequate broadband sensitivity at ultrasonic
      frequency higher than 100 MHz, whereas their bulky size and
      optically opaque nature cause technical difficulties in
      integrating PA imaging with conventional optical imaging
      modalities. To overcome these limitations, optical methods of
      ultrasound detection were developed and shown their unique
      applications in PA imaging. <b>Methods:</b> We provide an
      overview of recent technological advances in optical methods of
      ultrasound detection and their applications in PA imaging. A
      general theoretical framework describing sensitivity, bandwidth,
      and angular responses of optical ultrasound detection is also
      introduced. <b>Results:</b> Optical methods of ultrasound
      detection can provide improved detection angle and sensitivity
      over significantly extended bandwidth. In addition, its versatile
      variants also offer additional advantages, such as device
      miniaturization, optical transparency, mechanical flexibility,
      minimal electrical/mechanical crosstalk, and potential noncontact
      PA imaging. Conclusion: The optical ultrasound detection methods
      discussed in this review and their future evolution may play an
      important role in PA imaging for biomedical study and clinical
      diagnosis.<br>

      Certain examples disclose systems and methods for imaging a
      target. An example method includes: a) activating a subset of
      light-emitting molecules in a wide field area of a target using an
      excitation light; b) capturing one or more images of the light
      emitted from the subset of the molecules illuminated with the
      excitation light; c) localizing one or more activated light
      emitting molecules using one or more single molecule microscopic
      methods to obtain localization information; d) simultaneously
      capturing spectral information for the same localized activated
      light emitting molecules using one or more spectroscopic methods;
      e) resolving one or more non-diffraction limited images of the
      area of the target using a combination of the localization and
      spectral information for the localized activated light emitting

      My recent book tour was very valuable, among other things, in
      gauging audience response to the various topics related to the
      technosphere and its control over us. Specifically, what seems to
      be generally missing is an understanding that the technosphere
      doesn’t just control technology; it controls our minds as well.
      The technosphere doesn’t just prevent us from choosing
      technologies that we think may be appropriate and rejecting the
      ones that aren’t. It controls our tastes, making us prefer things
      that it prefers for its own reasons. It also controls our values,
      aligning them with its own. And it controls our bodies, causing us
      to treat ourselves as if we were mechanisms rather than symbiotic
      communities of living cells (human and otherwise).<br>
      <br>
      None of this invalidates the approach I proposed for shrinking the
      technosphere which is based on a harm/benefit analysis and allows
      us to ratchet down our technology choices by always picking
      technologies with the least harm and the greatest benefit. But
      this approach only works if the analysis is informed by our own
      tastes, not the tastes imposed on us by the technosphere, by our
      values, not the technosphere’s values, and by our rejection of a
      mechanistic conception of our selves. These choices are implicit
      in the 32 criteria used in harm/benefit analysis, favoring local
      over global, group interests over individual interests, artisanal
      over industrial and so on. But I think it would be helpful to make
      these choices explicit, by working through an example of each of
      the three types of control listed above. This week I'll tackle the
      first of these.<br>
      <br>
      A good example of how the technosphere controls our tastes is the
      personal automobile. Many people regard it as a symbol of freedom
      and see their car as an extension of their personalities. The
      freedom to be car-free is not generally regarded as important,
      while the freedoms bestowed by car ownership are rather
      questionable. It is the freedom to make car payments, pay for
      repairs, insurance, parking, towing and gasoline. It is the
      freedom to pay tolls, traffic tickets, title fees and excise
      taxes. It is the freedom to spend countless hours stuck in traffic
      jams and to suffer injuries in car accidents. It is the freedom to
      bring up neurologically damaged children by subjecting them to
      unsafe carbon monoxide levels (you are encouraged to have a CO
      detector in your house, but not in your car—because it would be
      going off all the time). It is the freedom to suffer indignities
      when pulled over by police, especially if you’ve been drinking. In
      terms of a harm/benefit analysis, private car ownership makes no
      sense at all.<br>
      <br>
      It is often argued that a car is a necessity, although the facts
      tell a different story. Worldwide, there are 1.2 billion vehicles
      on the road. The population of the planet is over 7 billion.
      Therefore, there are at least 5.8 billion people alive in the
      world who don’t own a car. How can something be considered a
      necessity if 82% of us don’t seem to need it? In fact, owning a
      car becomes necessary only in a certain specific set of
      circumstances. Here are some of the key ingredients: a landscape
      that is impassable except by motor vehicle, single-use zoning that
      segregates land by residential, commercial, agricultural and
      industrial uses, a lifestyle that requires a daily commute, and a
      deficit of public transportation. In turn, widespread private car
      ownership is what enables these key ingredients: without it,
      situations in which private car ownership becomes a necessity
      simply would not arise.<br>
      <br>
      Now, moving people about the landscape is not a productive
      activity: it is a waste of time and energy. If you can live, send
      your children to school, shop and work all without leaving the
      confines of a small neighborhood, you are bound to be more
      efficient than someone who has to drive between these four
      locations on a daily basis. But the technosphere is rational to a
      fault and is all about achieving efficiencies. And so, an obvious
      question to ask is, What is it about the car-dependent living
      arrangement, and the landscape it enables, that the technosphere
      finds to be efficient? The surprising answer is that the
      technosphere strives to optimize the burning of gasoline;
      everything else is just a byproduct of this optimization.<br>
      <br>
      It turns out that the fact that so many people are forced to own a
      car has nothing to do with transportation and everything to do
      with petroleum chemistry. About half of what can be usefully
      extracted from a barrel of crude oil is in the form of gasoline.
      It is possible to boost the fraction of other, more useful
      products, such as kerosene, diesel fuel, jet fuel and heating oil,
      but not by much and at a cost of reduced net energy. But gasoline
      is not very useful at all. It is volatile (quite a lot of it
      evaporates, especially in the summer); it is chemically unstable
      and doesn’t keep for long; it is toxic and carcinogenic. It has a
      rather low flash point, limiting the compression ratio that can be
      achieved by gasoline-fueled engines, making them thermodynamically
      less efficient. It is useless for large engines, and is basically
      a small-engine fuel. Gasoline-powered engines don’t last very long
      because gasoline-air mixture is detonated (using an electric
      spark) rather than burned, and the shock waves from the
      detonations cause components to wear out quickly. They have few
      industrial uses; all of the serious transportation infrastructure,
      including locomotives, ships, jet aircraft, tractor-trailers,
      construction equipment and electrical generators run on petroleum
      distillates such as kerosene, jet fuel, diesel oil and bunker
      fuel.<br>
      <br>
      If it weren’t for widespread private car ownership, gasoline would
      have to be flared off at refineries, at a loss. In turn, the cost
      of petroleum distillates—which are all of the industrial
      fuels—would double, and this would curtail the technosphere’s
      global expansion by making long-distance freight much more
      expensive. The technosphere’s goal, then, is to make us pay for
      the gasoline by forcing us to drive. To this end, the landscape is
      structured in a way that makes driving necessary. The fact that to
      get from a Motel 8 on one side of the road to the McDonalds on the
      other requires you to drive two miles, navigate a cloverleaf, and
      drive two miles back is not a bug; it's a feature. When James
      Kunstler calls suburban sprawl “the greatest misallocation of
      resources in human history” he is only partly right. It is also
      the greatest optimization in exploiting every part of the crude
      oil barrel in the history of the technosphere.<br>
      <br>
      The proliferation of small gasoline-burning engines in the form of
      cars enables another optimization, forcing us to pay for another
      generally useless fraction of the crude oil barrel: road tar. Lots
      of cars require lots of paved roadways and parking lots. Thus, the
      technosphere wins twice, first by making us pay for the privilege
      of disposing of what is essentially toxic waste at our own risk
      and expense, then by making us pay for spreading another form of
      toxic waste all over the ground. Suburban sprawl is not a failure
      of urban planning; it is a success story in enslaving humans and
      making them toil on behalf of the technosphere while causing great
      damage to themselves and to the environment. Needless to say, you
      have absolutely no control over any of this. You. Are. Not. In.
      Control. You can vote, you can protest, you can lobby, donate to
      environmentalist groups, attend conferences on urban planning… and
      you would just be wasting your time, because you can't change
      petroleum chemistry.<br>
      <br>
      That the need to make people buy gasoline trumps all other
      considerations becomes obvious if we observe how the technosphere
      reacts whenever gasoline demand falters. When rampant wealth
      inequality started making owning a car unaffordable for more and
      more people, the solution was to introduce larger cars for those
      who could still afford one: minivans for the mommies, pickup
      trucks for the daddies, and for everyone the now common SUV. And
      now that gasoline demand is dropping again because of falling
      labor participation rate and an increase in the number of people
      who telecommute, the solution will no doubt be driverless cars
      which will cruise around aimlessly burning gasoline. Mommies may
      think that a minivan will keep their kiddies safer than a compact
      would (not true unless they have 8-9 kids). Daddies may think that
      the pickup truck is a sign of manliness (true if you are some sort
      of gofer/roustabout; pickup trucks are driven by picker-uppers, a
      subspecies of gofer/roustabout). But all they are doing is obeying
      “The Third Law of the Technosphere,” if you will: “For every
      improvement in the efficiency of gasoline-fired engines, there
      must be an equal and opposite improvement in inefficiency.”<br>
      <br>
      So, perhaps you should just relax and go with the flow. After all,
      being a slave in the service of the technosphere is not
      immediately life-threatening… unless you crash into a tree or get
      run over by a drunk. But there is another problem: this
      arrangement isn’t going to last. The net energy that can be
      extracted out of a barrel of oil is quickly shrinking. In less
      then a decade the energy surplus required to maintain a
      car-centric lifestyle will no longer exist. If private car
      ownership and daily driving are required of you in order to
      survive, then you won’t survive. There goes at least 18% of the
      world’s population, which will find itself stranded in the middle
      of an impassable landscape. Oops!<br>
      <br>
      Given that you are not in control, and given that the car-centric
      lifestyle is an evolutionary dead end for your subspecies, what
      can you do? The answer is obvious: you can plan your escape, then
      join the other 82% of the world’s population, which is able to
      live car-free. Some of them even manage to live entirely outside
      of the reach of the technosphere. Let their example be your
      inspiration. <br>

          Read His Stunning Speech</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      CHURCHILL ON ISLAM Unbelievable, but the speech below was written
      in 1899. (Check Wikipedia - The River War). The attached short
      speech from Winston Churchill, was delivered by him in 1899 when
      he was a young soldier and journalist. It probably sets out the
      current views of many, but expresses in the wonderful Churchillian
      turn of phrase and use of the English language, of which he was a
      past master. Sir Winston Churchill was, without doubt, one of the
      greatest men of the late 19th and 20th centuries. He was a brave
      young soldier, a brilliant journalist, an extraordinary politician
      and statesman, a great war leader and British Prime Minister,<br>
      to whom the Western world must be forever in his debt.<br>
      <br>
      He was a prophet in his own time. He died on 24th January 1965, at
      the grand old age of 90 and, after a lifetime of service to his
      country, was accorded a State funeral.<br>
      <br>
      HERE IS THE SPEECH:<br>
      <br>
      "How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its
      votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a
      man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic
      apathy.<br>
      <br>
      The effects are apparent in many countries, improvident habits,
      slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and
      insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet
      rule or live. A degraded sensual-ism deprives this life of its
      grace and refinement, the next of its dignity and sanctity. The
      fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as
      his absolute property, either as a child, a wife, or a concubine,
      must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of
      Islam has ceased to be a great power among men.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Individual Muslims may show splendid qualities, but the influence
      of the religion paralyses the social development of those who
      follow it.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being
      moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It
      has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless
      warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is
      sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which
      it had vainly struggled, the civilization of modern Europe might
      fall, as fell the civilization of ancient Rome."<br>

      II, pages 248-250 London).<br>

          Neuropsychiatric Disorders Following Vaccination of Children
          and Adolescents: A Pilot Case–Control Study</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Douglas L. Leslie, et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Background: Although the association of the measles, mumps, and
      rubella vaccine with autism spectrum disorder has been
      convincingly disproven, the onset of certain brain-related
      autoimmune and inflammatory disorders has been found to be
      temporally associated with the antecedent administration of
      various vaccines. This study examines whether antecedent
      vaccinations are associated with increased incidence of
      obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), anorexia nervosa (AN),
      anxiety disorder, chronic tic disorder, attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder, major depressive disorder, and bipolar
      disorder in a national sample of privately insured children.<br>
      <br>
      Methods: Using claims data, we compared the prior year’s
      occurrence of vaccinations in children and adolescents aged 6–15
      years with the above neuropsychiatric disorders that were newly
      diagnosed between January 2002 and December 2007, as well as two
      control conditions, broken bones and open wounds. Subjects were
      matched with controls according to age, gender, geographical area,
      and seasonality. Conditional logistic regression models were used
      to determine the association of prior vaccinations with each
      condition.<br>
      <br>
      Results: Subjects with newly diagnosed AN were more likely than
      controls to have had any vaccination in the previous 3 months
      [hazard ratio (HR) 1.80, 95% confidence interval 1.21–2.68].
      Influenza vaccinations during the prior 3, 6, and 12 months were
      also associated with incident diagnoses of AN, OCD, and an anxiety
      disorder. Several other associations were also significant with
      HRs greater than 1.40 (hepatitis A with OCD and AN; hepatitis B
      with AN; and meningitis with AN and chronic tic disorder).<br>
      <br>
      Conclusion: This pilot epidemiologic analysis implies that the
      onset of some neuropsychiatric disorders may be temporally related
      to prior vaccinations in a subset of individuals. These findings
      warrant further investigation, but do not prove a causal role of
      antecedent infections or vaccinations in the pathoetiology of
      these conditions. Given the modest magnitude of these findings in
      contrast to the clear public health benefits of the timely
      administration of vaccines in preventing mortality and morbidity
      in childhood infectious diseases, we encourage families to
      maintain vaccination schedules according to CDC guidelines.<br>

      <br>
      Professor Dr. Zbigniew Jaworowski - a world-renowned atmospheric
      scientist and mountaineer, who has excavated ice out of 17
      glaciers on 6 continents in a 50-years career - warned in his 2003
      paper "The Ice Age is Coming" that according to the observed
      average duration of the warm periods between the ice ages, the end
      of the current interglacial period should have already happened
      500 years ago and is evermore immanent. He couldn't have known the
      reason for the delay, because the scientific data for it hadn't
      been available in 2003. It is available now, measured in Carbon-14
      and Berylliun-10 ratios as solar activity proxies, and likewise
      sunspot numbers, solar cosmic-ray-flux density, solar-wind
      pressure, magnetic-pole deflection, and coronal holes on the Sun.
      All of these measurements made in space and on the ground together
      tell us that the solar system is in an amazing free-fall collapse
      (in cosmic terms) towards a new Little Ice Age in the 2030 (phase
      I) and the full Ice Age in the 2050s (phase III).<br>

      ..."A Man Escaped" (1956). Here is a movie about a man condemned
      to death in 1943 in Montluc, a Nazi prison camp in Lyon, inside
      German-occupied France. In a shot that comes even before the
      titles, we learn that 7,000 men were killed there during the war.
      Then we meet the captured Resistance fighter Fontaine (François
      Leterrier), who has every reason to believe he will be one of
      them. The character is based on a postwar memoir by André Devigny,
      who escaped from Montluc on the very day he was scheduled to
      die...<br>

      André Devigny (25 May 1916 – 12 February 1999) was a French
      soldier and member of the Résistance.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Biography</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Devigny was a schoolteacher who joined the French Army just before
      the outbreak of World War II in 1939. He was part of the fighting
      in 1940 as an infantry and light tank officer and wounded in June.
      Like many officers of the French military, he became part of the
      anti-Nazi resistance movement after the occupation of the country.
      He operated in the Lyon region under the code-name Valentin. He
      worked with the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) giving
      them information about the Germans by traveling to Spanish
      Morocco. In October 1942, he joined the resistance group known as
      the Gilbert Network. He became one of three commanders of the
      group, alongside Gilbert Groussard, its namesake, and Jean Cambus.
      The group helped refugees flee to Switzerland, sent information to
      the British via their consul in Geneva, and sabotaged German
      materiel.<br>
      <br>
      In April 1943, Robert Moog infiltrated the group and turned
      several of its members over to the German authorities. Among them
      was Edmee Deletraz, who was then observed by the Gestapo. She was
      later suspected of having betrayed Jean Moulin, one of the
      best-known members of the French Resistance, but Devigny always
      defended her vehemently against this charge. After Devigny met
      her, he was arrested and sent to the formidable Montluc prison,
      which was considered escape-proof. There he was tortured by Klaus
      Barbie and his men, but he gave them no valuable information. He
      did, however, make an unsuccessful series of attempts to escape,
      and was punished after each one. He was sentenced to death on 20
      August 1943, the execution to be carried out on 28 August.[2]
      However, Devigny had discovered a way to remove his handcuffs with
      a safety pin. He ground the end of a spoon to a point on his
      cell's concrete floor and used it to remove the wooden slats near
      the bottom of the cell door and squeeze through the opening. At
      night, he was able to leave the cell and speak with other
      prisoners. On the night of 24–25 August, when conditions for
      escape were optimal, Devigny and another prisoner who had recently
      been placed in his cell climbed out a skylight, using a rope made
      from a blanket and a mattress cover and a grappling hook fashioned
      from the frame of an old lantern, made their way across a roof and
      descended to the courtyard. Devigny threw a sentry to the ground
      and stabbed him with his own bayonet. The two inmates climbed an
      inner perimeter wall and, after a guard patrolling the perimeter
      corridor on bicycle had passed by, flung the end of the rope with
      the grappling hook across a 15-ft gap to the outer wall. They
      swung across the gap on the rope and leapt to the ground, gaining
      the freedom of the streets. Eluding German search parties, Devigny
      fled to Switzerland with the help of comrades in the Resistance.<br>
      <br>
      The Germans took revenge on Devigny by arresting two of his
      cousins and sending them to death camps. Leaving Switzerland, he
      went to Spain, where he was arrested again and escaped again.
      After re-joining the French Army, he participated in the
      Liberation of Alsace. After the war, President Charles de Gaulle
      honored him with the prestigious Cross of the Liberation. Later he
      was appointed a senior official in France's foreign-intelligence
      organization. While serving in Algeria, Devigny wrote a memoir of
      his escape from Montluc prison, published in 1956 as Un condamné à
      mort s'est échappé ("A Man Condemned to Death has Escaped").
      Robert Bresson, who had himself been held by the Germans as a
      prisoner of war, used the memoir as the basis for a film of the
      same name (the English-language version was released as A Man
      Escaped); it won a prize at the Cannes Film Festival. In 1964,
      Devigny was recalled to France to assist with the secret
      re-organization of the French military. He retired in 1971 after
      President Georges Pompidou appointed Alexandre de Marenches as
      head of the intelligence services. He considered entering politics
      but decided not to "when I realized the backstabbing was far worse
      than anything I'd ever encountered in secret warfare." He died in

      Inventor(s): VON BEZOLD ERNST [CA] +<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to an improvement in systems, methods and
      apparati for handling and processing information, energy and
      matter by making use of potentials of new technologies, science
      and industrial art, principally in cymatics, quantum field theory
      and psychoenergetic science. It comprises a system of methods and
      apparati for handling information, energy and material using
      multimodal cymatic (standing wave patterning, whether stationary
      or moving) generation, and manipulation, principally of material
      and energy in vorticoid including concatenated and grouped
      vorticoid forms, to concentrate, cleanse, separate, transform,
      produce etc., materials and energy, including without limitation
      the production of clean water and manufactures materials, the
      production of net usable energy by effects such as Schauberger and
      vacuum potential-related, the collection, processing and
      communication of information by nonlocal quantum coherence
      (entrainment) of dynamic systems, initially cymatic, viz.,
      vorticoid, the similar transport of lower-dimensionality material
      patterns, i.e., materials, also to facilitate transport of living
      organisms, and the tuning of higher-dimensional energy forms,
      i.e., formative fields, for applications such as healing; a means
      of fine-tune controlling such systems directly by means of
      psychoenergetic operator interaction and indirectly by means of
      conditioned space technologies and vibratory enhancing
      technologies such as "scalar" treated materials and systems; and
      by other means described as "gauge-symmetry"-level raising, here,
      e.g., Bearden; and their combination; and a means of facilitating
      learning to generate Tiller-effect spacial conditioning (higher
      gauge symmetry) enhancement using motivated feedback in utilising
      these systems with spacial conditioning technology assist...<br>

      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Essentially, and without limitation of this description to its
      application in an illustrative preferred embodiment, a cymatic (3-
      or higher-dimensional Chladni figure-generating) resonant
      vibrational process is used to induce a rotating standing wave
      figure in a fluid, such as water, air, plasma, or a slurry
      including solids, producing a centripetal vortex or vortex of
      vortices which passing inward through the focus of the tip unwinds
      from its tip in the same or by induction in an opposite rotation,
      or meets another incoming vortex tip or tips, at the juncture
      comprising the tip(s) focus producing differentiable active and
      potential energetic outputs, and from the focus a likewise
      differentiable outflow of materials in directions primarily other
      than that of the axis of tip focus, such as transverse, of least
      resistance as shaped and sorted within transporting flows of
      standing waves e.g., whose node-antinode frequencies, amplitudes
      and spacial configurations are appropriately resonant with
      selected materials and material-energetic configurations. The
      forming and modulation of the form may be by external or internal,
      direct or interferometrically induced, multimodal
      electro-magneto-gravitic-opto-acoustic and scalar potential
      drivers controlled by feedback of functional parameters of the
      manipulated material flow and feedback of the driving energy
      inputs and their energetic transforms, and having regard to
      macroenvironmental conditional-probability fluctuations, e.g., in
      turbulent flow, and, in early embodiments, being fine tuned—later,
      consequent on operator learning based on feedback with the system
      as an instrument of learning, increasingly being generated—by
      operator interaction directly (Vogel), or indirectly using
      conditioned space effect technology (Tiller)
      amplification-modulation or other higher gauge broken symmetry
      operations (Bearden), to bias threshold condition probabilities
      favourably in respect of intended states of the system.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      A new Islamic fatwa in Turkey has decreed that Muslims are allowed
      to use toilet paper.<br>
      <br>
      The Directorate of Religious Affairs for Turkey stated that the
      use of the material for hygiene is acceptable but water was
      preferable.<br>
      <br>
      Islamic teachings traditionally state that followers should use
      water to clean themselves after going to the toilet.<br>
      <br>
      The set of rules for how Muslims should relieve themselves, called
      the Qadaa al-Haajah, was established in the times before toilet
      paper or toilet seats were invented.<br>
      <br>
      Use of the left hand or three stones was also permissible.<br>
      <br>
      The code also states that followers should not speak or read while
      on the toilet and should enter with their left foot and leave with
      their right, speaking a prayer.<br>
      <br>
      Men and women are also told not to stand while relieving
      themselves but to squat or sit. <br>

      The new announcement, stated: "If water cannot be found for

      problem in using toilet paper.<br>
      <br>
      Last month the Directorate of Religious Affairs had also relaxed
      rules on around the use of products containing alcohol - as long
      as they were not consumed.<br>
      <br>
      Hand sanitizes and other similar products used for hygiene
      products are now halal.<br>

      "While it is forbidden to drink substances containing alcohol that
      were produced for cleaning purposes, it is acceptable to use them
      for cleaning," Hurriyet Daily News reported. <br>

      <div align="center"><b>Water evaporation generates electrical
          energy</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      An electric power supply driven by water evaporating from a carbon
      nanomaterial has been unveiled by researchers in China. Their
      device is about 2.5 cm long and can create a voltage of about 1.5
      V – on par with a standard AA battery. While the power supply only
      delivers a few hundred nanoamps, the team connected several
      devices together to run a liquid-crystal display. With further
      improvements, the researchers say, the device could be used to run
      sterilization equipment and to purify or desalinate water in warm
      regions of the world.<br>
      <br>
      The power supply has been built by a team led by Wanlin Guo at
      Nanjing University and Jun Zhou at Huazhong University. It
      involved depositing multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) onto a
      quartz substrate to create two electrodes. The substrate is about
      25 mm long and the 2 mm electrodes are positioned at each end.
      Carbon black – tiny particles of carbon about 20 nm in diameter –
      was then deposited, covering the substrate to a thickness of about
      70 µm. Copper wires were then attached to each electrode and a
      circuit was completed via a voltmeter.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Dunked in water</b><br>
      <br>
      One end of the device is placed in a beaker of deionized water so
      that the bottom few millimetres of the device are immersed.
      Capillary action draws water up the previously dry portion of the
      device, reaching a maximum distance of about 20 mm from the wet
      end in about 1 h. As the water rises through the device, the
      voltage across the electrodes increases, reaching a maximum value
      of about 1 V in 1 h.<br>
      <br>
      When the device and beaker were placed in an enclosed environment
      from which water vapour cannot escape, the voltage dropped to zero
      in about 15 min – and recovered quickly when ventilation was
      provided. Air flow, which is known to boost evaporation, increased
      the voltage on the device up to 1.5 V. An increase in ambient
      humidity, on the other hand, lowered the voltage by inhibiting
      evaporation. Taken together, say the researchers, these
      observations confirm that evaporation is driving the operation of
      the device.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Streaming potential</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      An infrared spectroscopy study of the device suggests that
      electrical energy is created via a streaming potential. This is an
      electrochemical process that occurs when an electrolyte is driven
      by a pressure gradient through a channel or pore.<br>
      <br>
      The team then connected four of their devices in series to create
      a power source that can deliver about 380 nA at 4.8 V – which was
      enough to drive a liquid-crystal display. The team says that the
      performance of the device could be enhanced by optimizing the
      streaming and evaporation processes.<br>

          Neuropsychiatric Disorders Following Vaccination of Children
          and Adolescents: A Pilot Case–Control Study</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Douglas L. Leslie. et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <b>Background:</b> Although the association of the measles, mumps,
      and rubella vaccine with autism spectrum disorder has been
      convincingly disproven, the onset of certain brain-related
      autoimmune and inflammatory disorders has been found to be
      temporally associated with the antecedent administration of
      various vaccines. This study examines whether antecedent
      vaccinations are associated with increased incidence of
      obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), anorexia nervosa (AN),
      anxiety disorder, chronic tic disorder, attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder, major depressive disorder, and bipolar
      disorder in a national sample of privately insured children.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Methods:</b> Using claims data, we compared the prior year’s
      occurrence of vaccinations in children and adolescents aged 6–15
      years with the above neuropsychiatric disorders that were newly
      diagnosed between January 2002 and December 2007, as well as two
      control conditions, broken bones and open wounds. Subjects were
      matched with controls according to age, gender, geographical area,
      and seasonality. Conditional logistic regression models were used
      to determine the association of prior vaccinations with each
      condition.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results:</b> Subjects with newly diagnosed AN were more likely
      than controls to have had any vaccination in the previous 3 months
      [hazard ratio (HR) 1.80, 95% confidence interval 1.21–2.68].
      Influenza vaccinations during the prior 3, 6, and 12 months were
      also associated with incident diagnoses of AN, OCD, and an anxiety
      disorder. Several other associations were also significant with
      HRs greater than 1.40 (hepatitis A with OCD and AN; hepatitis B
      with AN; and meningitis with AN and chronic tic disorder).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusion</b>: This pilot epidemiologic analysis implies that
      the onset of some neuropsychiatric disorders may be temporally
      related to prior vaccinations in a subset of individuals. These
      findings warrant further investigation, but do not prove a causal
      role of antecedent infections or vaccinations in the pathoetiology
      of these conditions. Given the modest magnitude of these findings
      in contrast to the clear public health benefits of the timely
      administration of vaccines in preventing mortality and morbidity
      in childhood infectious diseases, we encourage families to
      maintain vaccination schedules according to CDC guidelines.<br>

        <b>J. Marvin Herndon</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Abstracts </b><br>
      <br>
      Aims: On or about February 14, 2016, an oily-ashy substance was
      accidently released by an aircraft and fell on seven residences
      and vehicles in Harrison Township, Michigan (USA). The aims of
      this investigation are to analyze the “air-drop material” and from
      the results obtained to draw inferences as to the intended purpose
      of the material.<br>
      <br>
      Methodology: Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS)
      and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive
      X-ray (EDX) analysis were used to analyze the “air-drop material”.<br>
      <br>
      Results: The “air-drop material” was found to consist of an
      assemblage of plant material mixed with coal fly ash and salt. The
      splatter pattern on vehicles, ground, and rooftops resembles
      cryoconite holes observed on ablating glaciers worldwide. The
      “air-drop material” resembles to some extent natural cryoconite,
      and appears to be modeled after that substance with coal fly ash
      imparting the dark gray color that absorbs sunlight, melts glacial
      ice, and contributes to global warming.<br>
      <br>
      Conclusions: The results of this investigation provide evidence
      that is indicative of a deliberate effort to hasten the melting of
      glaciers and thereby hasten global warming. If so, this
      investigation reinforces the net effect of daily particulate
      aerosol spraying in the troposphere observed worldwide. Elsewhere
      the author has provided evidence that coal fly ash is the primary
      material being employed in such spraying whose net effect is to
      enhance global warming. Scientists worldwide should call for, and
      indeed demand, a full and open investigation into these covert
      geoengineering activities whose potential impacts on Earth’s
      climate system, the integrity of Earth’s biota, and on human
      health may prove to be extremely hazardous.<br>

      damaged resulting in blindness. In elderly, young and healthy
      individuals, the vision field is mainly damaged.<br>
      <br>
      In the beginning stages of macular degeneration, the field of
      vision isn’t affected. Instead, it slowly alters to a blurry/wavy
      vision to a hole in the whole center of your field of vision. This
      ocular disease affects many people than both glaucoma and
      cataracts. Genetics play an imperative role in the presence of
      disease and smoking will increase your risk of it.<br>
      <br>
      Saffron is commonly used in Indian food, and helps avoid vision
      issues and at the same time, curing existing vision issues.
      Researchers have tested people that were given 20mg of saffron a
      day for 3 months.<br>
      <br>
      They were evaluated in the exact same way. People with macular
      degeneration had signs of healing with their retina, after 3
      months of consuming 20mg of saffron a day. Saffron is beneficial
      in curing and preventing ocular impairment, and some disorders in
      the nervous system.<br>
      <br>
      It is an anti-oxidant, and well responsible in increasing our
      levels of oxygen through our body in the same way as it prevents
      cell deaths. Containing safranal, it is vital in the reduction of
      the process in degeneration of cells that take in light, and aids
      in the optimal function of our blood vessels to the eyes and
      retina.<br>
      <br>
      It is suggested that you take 1 cup of saffron tea per day in
      order to delay blindness as it contains essential fatty acids that
      protect you from vision impairment. If taken daily, it will ensure
      you more tolerance to bright light.<br>

          Supplementation in Early Age-Related Macular Degeneration:
          Sustained Benefits to Central Retinal Function</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>M. Piccardi, et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Objectives. In a previous randomized clinical trial (Falsini et
      al. (2010)), it was shown that short-term Saffron supplementation
      improves retinal flicker sensitivity in early age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether
      the observed functional benefits from Saffron supplementation may
      extend over a longer follow-up duration. Design. Longitudinal,
      interventional open-label study. Setting. Outpatient ophthalmology
      setting. Participants. Twenty-nine early AMD patients (age range:
      55–85 years) with a baseline visual acuity &gt;0.3. Intervention.
      Saffron oral supplementation (20?mg/day) over an average period of
      treatment of 14 (±2) months. Measurements. Clinical examination
      and focal-electroretinogram-(fERG-) derived macular (18°) flicker
      sensitivity estimate (Falsini et al. (2010)) every three months
      over a followup of 14 (±2) months. Retinal sensitivity, the
      reciprocal value of the estimated fERG amplitude threshold, was
      the main outcome measure. Results. After three months of
      supplementation, mean fERG sensitivity improved by 0.3 log units
      compared to baseline values (P &lt; 0.01), and mean visual acuity
      improved by two Snellen lines compared to baseline values (0.75 to
      0.9, P &lt; 0.01). These changes remained stable over the
      follow-up period. Conclusion. These results indicate that in early
      AMD Saffron supplementation induces macular function improvements
      from baseline that are extended over a long-term followup...<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. Discussion</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present data extend the results of a previous, randomized
      study [13] on the potential efficacy of Saffron supplementation in
      AMD, showing that such supplementation may induce a long-term,
      stable improvement in retinal function, as measured by fERG
      sensitivity. To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal
      study, based on an objective electrophysiological technique,
      documenting the long-term effects of Saffron antioxidant on
      retinal function in AMD. While several other studies have already
      shown significant effects of antioxidant supplementation on
      retinal function [8, 10, 13], all these previous studies were more
      limited either in their follow-up duration or in the number of
      testing sessions. The current data show that changes in fERG
      threshold (and consequently its reciprocal value sensitivity)
      after supplementation were within-session consistent,
      reproducible, and durable over a 15-month follow-up period. The
      sensitivity improvements were observed in association with a
      constant slope of the fERG functions, further indicating the
      reproducibility of the fERG function shapes recorded during
      followup. All patients reported a subjective improvement in their
      quality of vision and ultimately in their quality of life,
      supporting the impact of the fERG findings on psychophysical
      visual function of patients...<br>
      <br>
      It may be presumed that the observed improvement in macular
      function is an effect of integrated activities of Saffron's
      chemical compounds, mainly of crocin, and crocetin, antioxidant
      derivatives of carotenoids, which may act through a protective
      mechanism similar to that seen with carotenoid supplementation
      [18–21], resulting in a beneficial effect on retinal function. In
      addition, crocins are able to activate metabolic pathways to
      protect cells from apoptosis and to reduce light-induced death in
      isolated photoreceptors, while crocetin increases oxygen
      diffusivity through liquids, such as plasma [18]...<br>

          Vaccines: Micro- and Nanocontamination</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Antonietta M Gatti and Stefano Montanari</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Vaccines are being under investigation for the possible side
      effects they can cause. In order to supply new information, an
      electron-microscopy investigation method was applied to the study
      of vaccines, aimed at verifying the presence of solid contaminants
      by means of an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope equipped
      with an X-ray microprobe. The results of this new investigation
      show the presence of micro- and nanosized particulate matter
      composed of inorganic elements in vaccines’ samples which is not
      declared among the components and whose unduly presence is, for
      the time being, inexplicable. A considerable part of those
      particulate contaminants have already been verified in other
      matrices and reported in literature as non biodegradable and non
      biocompatible. The evidence collected is suggestive of some
      hypotheses correlated to diseases that are mentioned and briefly
      discussed...<br>
      <br>
      Side effects have always been reported but in the latest years it
      seems that they have increased in number and seriousness,
      particularly in children as the American Academy of pediatrics
      reports [1,2]. For instance, the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis
      (DTaP) vaccine was linked to cases of sudden infant death syndrome
      (SIDS) [3]; measles-mumps-rubella vaccine with autism [4,5];
      multiple immunizations with immune disorders [6]; hepatitis B
      vaccines with multiple sclerosis, etc.<br>
      <br>
      The notice of Tripedia DTaP by Sanofi Pasteur reports “Adverse
      events reported during post-approval use of Tripedia vaccine
      include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, SIDS, anaphylactic
      reaction, cellulitis, autism, convulsion/grand mal convulsion,
      encephalopathia, hypotonia, neuropathy, somnolence and apnea”. The
      epidemiological studies carried out did not show a clear evidence
      of those associations, even if in 2011 the National Academy of
      Medicine (formerly, IOM) admitted: "Vaccines are not free from
      side effects, or adverse effects"[7]...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The investigations verified the physical-chemical composition of
      the vaccines considered according to the inorganic component as
      declared by the Producer. In detail, we verified the presence of
      saline and Aluminum salts, but further presence of micro-,
      sub-micro- and nanosized, inorganic, foreign bodies (ranging from
      100nm to about ten microns) was identified in all cases, whose
      presence was not declared in the leaflets delivered in the package
      of the product (Table 2)...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusion</b><br>
      <br>
      The analyses carried out show that in all samples checked vaccines
      contain non biocompatible and bio-persistent foreign bodies which
      are not declared by the Producers, against which the body reacts
      in any case. This new investigation represents a new quality
      control that can be adopted to assess the safety of a vaccine. Our
      hypothesis is that this contamination is unintentional, since it
      is probably due to polluted components or procedures of industrial
      processes (e.g. filtrations) used to produce vaccines, not
      investigated and not detected by the Producers. If our hypothesis
      is actually the case, a close inspection of the working places and
      the full knowledge of the whole procedure of vaccine preparation
      would probably allow to eliminate the problem.<br>
      <br>
      A further purification of the vaccines could improve their quality
      and could probably decrease the number and seriousness of the
      adverse incidental effects.<br>

          from the administration of naltrexone</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Adiel Mallik, Mona Lisa Chanda &amp; Daniel J. Levitin</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Music’s universality and its ability to deeply affect emotions
      suggest an evolutionary origin. Previous investigators have found
      that naltrexone (NTX), a µ-opioid antagonist, may induce
      reversible anhedonia, attenuating both positive and negative
      emotions. The neurochemical basis of musical experience is not
      well-understood, and the NTX-induced anhedonia hypothesis has not
      been tested with music. Accordingly, we administered NTX or
      placebo on two different days in a double-blind crossover study,
      and assessed participants’ responses to music using both
      psychophysiological (objective) and behavioral (subjective)
      measures. We found that both positive and negative emotions were
      attenuated. We conclude that endogenous opioids are critical to
      experiencing both positive and negative emotions in music, and
      that music uses the same reward pathways as food, drug and sexual
      pleasure. Our findings add to the growing body of evidence for the
      evolutionary biological substrates of music...<br>
      <br>
      Naltrexone (NTX) and the chemically similar naloxone are
      broad-spectrum antagonists that block µ-opioid, kappa and (to a
      lesser extent, 10:1) delta opioid receptors. They have been shown
      to reduce reward after physical activity23,24, reduce food
      pleasantness and subjective appetite during eating25,26 and
      modulate pain and mood27. For the past few decades, they have been
      used to treat alcohol and opioid dependence28, and to reduce
      consumption of pleasurable foods in rats29,30 and humans31,32. An
      intriguing finding is that NTX administration is associated with a
      generalized reduction in hedonics — participants report feeling
      reduced highs and lows, joy and sadness33,34,35. This informed the
      present study, in which we sought to investigate musical anhedonia
      — to explore whether musical emotion is governed by the same
      hedonic/reward system as other experiences, such as food, drugs,
      and sex...<br>
      <br>
      Here, we’ve provided evidence for the NTX-induced anhedonia
      hypothesis, and thus evidence that musical pleasure is mediated by
      the brain’s endogenous opioid system. The fact that music
      listening triggers a well-defined neurochemical response suggests
      an evolutionary origin for music, although one must be cautious
      and not over-interpret these results; it is also possible that
      music has developed to exploit an already existing reward system
      that evolved for other purposes, such as recognizing and
      responding appropriately to various human and animal
      vocalizations...<br>

          Scientists DO NOT Believe in Man-Made Climate Change!</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>By Scott Osborn</b><br>

      <br>
      Climate Change activists from Al Gore down have been saying for
      almost a decade that 98% of the Scientific community believe in
      man-made climate change.<br>
      <br>
      But what they fail to tell you is that 98% comes from an equation
      of only 75 out of 77 climate change scientists.<br>
      Imagine that! Al Gore lied, and he knows he lied!<br>
      <br>
      The 98% lie comes from a 2009 American Geophysical Union (AGU)
      survey consisting of an intentionally brief two-minute, two
      question online survey sent to 10,257 earth scientists by two
      researchers at the University of Illinois.<br>
      <br>
      The widely used survey was sent to only 10,000 scientists, 3,000
      came back and only 77 peer-reviewed climate scientists
      participated!<br>
      Yet it is the main talking point used by the left to prove the
      Climate Change Hoax!!<br>
      <br>
      As Larry Bell writes in Forbes:<br>
      <br>
      “Then of those [3,146 that actually took the survey], only a small
      subset, just 77 who had been successful in getting more than half
      of their papers recently accepted by peer-reviewed climate science
      journals, were considered in their survey statistic. That “98% all
      scientists” referred to a laughably puny number of 75 of those 77
      who answered “yes”.”...<br>

      Dr Luc Montagnier and his colleague Claude Lavallee initially
      observed that filtering a culture supernatant of human lymphocytes
      infected with the bacterium Mycoplasma pirum (about 300 nm in
      diameter) through filters with pore size of 100 nm or 20 nm gave
      apparently sterile fluid. However, the sterile fluid was able to
      regenerate the original mycoplasma when incubated with a
      mycoplasma-negative culture of human lymphocytes within 2 to 3
      weeks. Similarly, filtering an infective fraction of HIV particles
      (120 nm) through 20 nm filter failed to retain the infective
      agent.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the infectious filtrate produced electromagnetic
      waves of low frequency in a reproducible manner after appropriate
      dilutions in water. They suspected a “resonance phenomenon”
      depending on excitation by the ambient electromagnetic fields such
      as the 50/60 Hz signals from the mains. The infectious signal
      appeared associated with “polymeric nanostructures of defined
      size” present in the diluted filtrate. The supernatant of
      uninfected eukaryotic cells used as controls did not have those
      infectious effects.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EM signals associated with nanostructures</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Given the initial clues, the researcher team set out to
      investigate the phenomenon more thoroughly, to characterize the
      electromagnetic (EM) signals and the nanostructures produced by
      the purified bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to M. pirum, they looked at E. coli. The supernatants
      of deliberately infected human lymphocytes containing 106 or 107
      infectious units per ml were filtered twice first through 450 nm
      Millipore filters to remove debris, and then 100 or 20 nm filters
      to remove mycoplasma cells. The filtrates were confirmed sterile
      by incubation for several weeks in enriched growth medium.
      Repeated search for traces of mycoplasma DNA by polymerase chain
      reactions (PCR) was also consistently negative.<br>
      <br>
      However, when the filtrates were incubated for two weeks or three
      weeks with a culture of human activated T lymphocytes, the
      mycoplasma was recovered in the medium with all its original
      characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      The filtrates were analysed just after filtration for production
      of EM waves of low frequency. For this purpose, a devise
      previously designed by Benveniste and Coll was used for the
      detection of signals produced<br>
      <br>
      The filtrates were serially diluted 1 in 10, after each dilution,
      the tube is tightly stopped and strongly agitated on a Vortex
      apparatus for 15 seconds. This step, which is equivalent to
      homeopathic ‘succussion’, has been found critical for the
      generation of signals.<br>
      <br>
      After all dilutions have been made (15 to 20), the stopped tubes
      were read one by one on an electromagnetic coil (copper wire on a
      bobbin, impedance 300 Ohms), connected to a Sound Blaster Card,
      itself connected to a laptop computer powered by its 12 volt
      battery. Each emission is recorded twice for 6 seconds, amplified
      500 times and processed with different softwares to visualise the
      signals on the computer screen. The main harmonics of the complex
      signals were analysed by softwares for Fourier transformations. In
      each experiment, the internal noise generated by the different
      pieces of the reading system was first recorded (coil alone, coil
      with a tube filled with ordinary water). Fourier analysis shows
      that the noise was predominantly very low frequencies probably
      generated at least in part by the 50/60 Hz ambient electric
      current. Using the 12 volt battery to power the computer reduced
      the noise, but did not abolish it altogether; as the noise was
      found to be necessary for the induction of the resonance signals
      from the specific nanostructure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EM signals did not decrease with dilution</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      When the EM signals from serial dilutions of the M. pirum filtrate
      were recorded, the first obvious change was an increase in the
      overall amplitude of the signals at certain dilutions over the
      background noise, and also higher frequencies. This change was
      abolished if the tube analysed was placed inside a box shielded
      with sheets of copper and mumetal, which also shields static
      magnetic field as well as low frequency EM fields.<br>
      <br>
      Fourier analysis of the M. pirum signals confirmed a shift towards
      higher frequencies close to 1 000 Hz and multiples thereof. The
      profiles were identical and highly reproducible for all the
      dilutions showing an increase in amplitude.<br>
      <br>
      The first low dilutions were usually negative, showing the
      background noise only, positive signals were typically obtained at
      dilutions ranging from 10-5 to 10-8 up to 10-12, at which the
      signal was greatest before it became negative at 10-13.<br>
      <br>
      The positive dilutions varied according to the type of filtration;
      the 20 nm filtrate being generally positive at dilutions higher
      than those of the 100 nm. The original unfiltered suspension was
      negative at all dilutions, a phenomenon observed for all the
      microorganisms studied.<br>
      <br>
      The 20 nm filtrate was centrifuged through a density gradient to
      separate components with different densities that were tested for
      electromagnetic emissions. The emitting structures were
      distributed in a large range of densities from 1.15 to 1.25 gm per
      ml.<br>
      <br>
      In the experiment with E. coli, supernatants of cultures
      containing 109 units/ml were used.&nbsp; No signal appeared after
      filtration through 20nm filters, suggesting that the structures
      associated with the signals were retained by those filtered, and
      therefore had a size greater than 20 nm and lower than 100 nm.<br>
      <br>
      The final filtrate was sterile. Signal producing dilutions again
      range form 10-8 to 10-11, with profiles on Fourier transformation
      similar to, yet distinct from those of M. Pirum. In one
      experiment, some very high dilutions were found to be positive,
      ranging from 10-9 to 10-18.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast, the unfiltered supernatant did not show any signal
      above background up to 10-38 dilution. This suggests that the low
      dilutions are self-inhibitory, probably by interference of the
      multiple sources emitting in the same wave length, slightly out of
      phase, like radio jamming. Alternatively, the abundance of
      nanostructures can form a gel in water and therefore inhibited
      from vibrating (more later).<br>
      EM signal can be transferred<br>
      <br>
      The researchers wondered whether or not it was possible to
      generate new signal-emitting structures from tube to tube by
      wave-transfer. The answer was yes.<br>
      <br>
      A donor tube of a low “silent” dilution of E. coli (10-3) was
      placed side by side close to a receiver tube of the positive
      “loud” highest dilution of the same preparation (10-9). Both tubes
      were placed together in a mumetal box for 24 hours at room
      temperature, so the tubes were not exposed to external
      electromagnetic noise and only exposed to the signals generated by
      the structures present in the tubes themselves. When tested after
      that, the donor tube was still silent, and the receiver tube too,
      became silent.<br>
      <br>
      But when further dilutions were made from the receiver tube, they
      became positive again. These results suggest that the receiver
      tube was made silent by the formation of an excess of new
      nanostructures, which could emit signals again upon further
      dilution. The effect was suppressed by putting a sheet of mumetal
      between the two tubes during the 24 h contact period, pointing to
      a role of low frequency waves in the phenomenon.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EM signals from all pathogenic bacteria</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Emission of similar EM signals was found with other bacteria such
      as Streptococcus B, Staphylococcus aueus, Pseudomonas aerogniosa,
      Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella, Clostridium
      perfringens, all in the same range of dilutions as for E. coli,
      and only after filtrating at 100 nm,&nbsp; not 20 nm. Importantly,
      the transfer effect between the two tubes, one silent, one loud,
      was only observed if both contained dilutions of the same
      bacterial species. These results indicate that the signal transfer
      is species-specific.<br>
      <br>
      Does the signal depend on the initial number of cells? To
      investigate that, a stationary culture of E. coli was counted and
      adjusted to 109 cells/ml and serially dilution 1 in 100 down to 1
      cell/ml. Each dilution was filtered through 100 nm, then analyzed
      for signal emission. Surprisingly, the range of positive dilutions
      were not strictly dependent on the initial concentration of E.
      coli cells, being roughly the same from 109 down to 10 cells,
      suggesting that the same final number of nanostructures was
      reached at all concentrations.<br>
      <br>
      Was the effect dependent on the operator? No. Two operators
      measuring independently the same dilutions of E. coli produced
      exactly the same results. The results were also independent of the
      order in which the samples were read, whether in descending
      dilutions from the lowest to the highest or vice versa. And even
      in random order. That was achieved by letting another lab worker
      place the diluted samples in random order, the labels being
      unknown to the person reading the samples. Again the same results
      were obtained, provided each tube was well separated from the
      others to avoid cross-talk between them. Finally, the results were
      independent of the reading site. They were the same in France
      (Paris), Canada (Montreal) and Cameroun (Yaoundé), even though the
      background noise at each place was distinct. The positive signal
      is always clearly differentiated by the same higher frequency
      peaks.<br>
      <br>
      A non-exhaustive survey of the bacterial species displaying EM
      signals suggests that most of the bacteria pathogenic for humans
      are in this category. In contrast, probiotic non-pathogenic
      bacteria such as Lactobacillus and their DNA are negative for EM
      signal emission.<br>
      <br>
      <b>What is the nature of the EM signal emitting nanostructures?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The nanostructures were not destroyed by treatments with enzymes
      that destroy RNA, DNA or protein (RNAse A, DNAse 1, proteinase K);
      only by heating at 70 °C for 30 minutes, or freezing for 1 hour at
      -20 °C or -60 °C. Treatment with lithium cations, known to affect
      H-bonding of water molecules, reduced the intensity of the
      signals, while the range of the positive dilution remained
      unchanged.<br>
      EM signals traced to specific pathogenic DNA sequences<br>
      <br>
      In preliminary experiments, the researchers found that treating a
      suspension of E. coli with formaldehyde, which killed the
      bacteria, did not alter the capacity to induce the EM signals.
      This treatment denatured the surface proteins of the bacteria but
      did not change their genetic material - the double-helical DNA -
      and suggests that the source of the signals may be the DNA itself.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, DNA extracted from the bacterial suspension by the usual
      method, after filtering and appropriate dilutions in water, was
      able to emit EM signals similar to those produced by intact
      bacteria under the same conditions. DNAse treatment of the
      extracted DNA solution abolishes its capacity to emit signals, so
      long as the nanostructures previously induced by the DNA are
      destroyed.<br>
      <br>
      The same as for the intact microorganisms, the isolated DNA must
      be filtered before the EM signals can be detected in the diluted
      solutions. This suggested to the researchers that filtering is
      necessary to break up a “network of nanostructures organized in a
      gel at high concentrations in water,” allowing them to be
      dispersed in further dilutions. One complication is that the
      filtration through 100 nm pore size filter did not retain the DNA.
      The dilutions positive the EMS were in the same range as those for
      the intact bacteria, generally between 10-7 to 10-13.<br>
      <br>
      At the high dilution of 10-13, calculations indicate that there is
      no DNA molecule larger than 105 Da in the solution; making it
      unlikely that the EM signals are produced directly by the DNA
      itself, but rather by the “self-sustained nanostructures induced
      by the DNA.” Generally, all the bacterial species shown to be
      positive for EM signals yielded also DNA preparations positive for
      EM signals, and they were all pathogens.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of E. coli, some non-pathogenic strains used for gene
      cloning were negative. This suggests that only some sequences of
      DNA are the source of the EMS.<br>
      <br>
      The signal is linked to the ability of the bacteria to cause
      diseases, which in turn depends on the capacity of the
      microorganism to bind to eukaryotic cells. They looked in M. prium
      DNA, where a single gene – adhesion coding for a 126 kDa protein –
      is responsible for the adhesion of the mycoplasma to human cells.
      The gene was cloned previously in Montagnier’s laboratory, and
      they had it as two fragments: 1.5 kbp N terminal part and 5 kbp C
      terminal part of the protein in two different plasmids. The two
      plasmids containing the fragments were amplified in the E. coli
      strain that did not produce EM signals. <br>
      <br>
      But when the E.coli strain (XL1blue) was transformed with either
      plasmids carrying an adhesion gene fragment, EM signals were
      produced.<br>
      <br>
      The two adhesion DNA fragments were then cut out by specific
      restriction enzymes and isolated by agarose electrophoresis. Each
      DNA fragment was able to induce the EM signal. To confirm the
      result, they purified a large fraction of the adhesion DNA from
      the whole mycoplasma genome using specific primers and amplication
      by PCR, and found that this fragment induced EM signals.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers have discovered a novel property of DNA, the
      capacity of some sequences to emit electromagnetic waves in
      resonance after excitation by the ambient electromagnetic
      background. They speculated that all DNA may be capable of
      emitting EM signals, but “in our conditions of detection, it seems
      to be associated with only certain bacterial sequences.”<br>
      <br>
      They detected similar EM signals in the plasma and in DNA
      extracted from the plasma of patients suffering from Alzheimer,
      Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis,
      suggesting that bacterial infections are present in those
      diseases. They require 20 nM filtrations suggesting that the
      nanostructures produced are smaller than those produced b y
      bacterial DNA.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, EM signals can be detected also from RNA viruses, such
      as HIV, influenza virus A, Hepatitis C virus, In patients infected
      with HIV, EM signals can be detected mostly in patients treated by
      antiretroviral therapy and having a very low viral load in their
      plasma. Such nanostructures persisting in the plasma may
      contribute to the viral reservoir which escapes the antiviral
      treatment, assuming that they carry genetic information of the
      virus.<br>
      <br>
      It is known from the very early X-ray diffraction studies of DNA
      that water molecules are tightly associated with the double helix,
      and DNA in water solution forms gels associating a large number of
      water molecules.<br>
      <br>
      The capacity of diluted solutions to emit EMS after they have been
      isolated in mumetal boxes last up to 48 hours, indicating the
      relative stability of the nanostructures.<br>
      <br>
      What exactly are these nanostructures and why do they emit
      electromagnetic waves? Mantagnier and his team are not very
      explicit on this. But we shall examine this more carefully at the
      end of the next article in this series...<br>

          Habitation, Doctor Says</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      All 23 districts of Tokyo contaminated with radiation from the
      Fukushima meltdown, worse than at Chernobyl after the accident,
      and blood cells of children under ten are showing worrying
      changes; the WHO, the IAEA &amp; the Japanese government cannot be
      trusted Susie Greaves<br>
      <br>
      In July 2014 Dr Shigeru Mita wrote a letter to his fellow doctors
      to explain his decision to move his practice from Tokyo to Okayama
      city in the West of Japan [1]. In it, he appeals to their sense of
      duty to answer the anxieties of parents in Japan who do not
      believe the information coming from the authorities. He says “I
      must state that the policies of the WHO, the IAEA or the Japanese
      government cannot be trusted.” and “if the power to save our
      citizens and future generations exists somewhere, it does not lie
      within the government or any academic association, but in the
      hands of individual clinical doctors ourselves.”<br>
      <br>
      Mita claims that all 23 districts of Tokyo are contaminated, with
      the eastern area worst affected - up to 4 000 Bq/kg. (The
      becquerel is a unit of radioactivity. One Bq is the activity of a
      quantity of radioactive material in which one nucleus decays per
      second.) These findings confirm what the nuclear physicist Arnie
      Gundersen of Fairewinds Nuclear Education found in 2012, when he
      picked up five random soil samples in Tokyo from between paving
      stones, in parks and playgrounds. The levels of contamination were
      up to 7 000 Bq/kg; in the US, anything registering these levels
      would be considered nuclear waste [2].<br>
      <br>
      While practising in Tokyo, Mita also discovered changes in the
      white blood cells of children under 10.<br>

      <b>Independent science &amp; independent reporting in Japan

      <br>
      In December 2013, the Japanese parliament passed a bill whereby
      public officials and private citizens could face ten years in
      prison for divulging “special state secrets”, and journalists,
      five years, for seeking to obtain classified information. The bill
      is widely interpreted as a way of preventing sensitive information
      about Fukushima (among other topics) reaching the Japanese public
      and by extension the rest of the world [3].<br>
      <br>
      The independent organisation Reporters without Borders has
      downgraded Japan in its world press freedom index from 22nd place
      in 2012, to 53rd in 2013 and to 59th in 2014, following the
      passing of the state secrets bill. Reporters without Borders say
      that Japan“has been affected by a lack of transparency and almost
      zero respect for access to information on subjects directly or
      indirectly related to Fukushima” [4]...<br>

          molecules turn into electrical generators</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The bacterial world is rife with unusual talents, among them a
      knack for producing electricity. In the wild, "electrogenic"
      bacteria generate current as part of their metabolism, and now
      researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB),
      have found a way to confer that ability upon non-electrogenic
      bacteria. This technique could have applications for sustainable
      electricity generation and wastewater treatment, the researchers
      report February 9 in the journal Chem.<br>
      <br>
      "The concept here is that if we just close the lid of the
      wastewater treatment tank and then give the bacteria an electrode,
      they can produce electricity while cleaning the water," says
      co-first author Zach Rengert, a chemistry graduate student at
      UCSB. "And the amount of electricity they produce will never power
      anything very big, but it can offset the cost of cleaning water."<br>
      <br>
      The bacteria that inspired this study, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1,
      live in oxygen-free environments and can breathe in metal minerals
      and electrodes -- instead of air -- via current-conducting
      proteins in their cell membranes. Most bacterial species, however,
      do not have such proteins and therefore naturally do not produce
      current. Taking inspiration from S. oneidensis' membrane-spanning
      conductive proteins, the team hypothesized that with the right
      kind of bio-compatible molecular additive, this electrogenesis
      might be conferred to bacteria that have not evolved to do so.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers, under the guidance of senior author Guillermo
      Bazan at UCSB, built a molecule called DFSO+, which contains an
      iron atom at its core. To add the DFSO+ to bacteria, the
      researchers dissolved a small amount of the rust-colored powder
      into water and added that solution to bacteria. Within a few
      minutes, the synthetic molecule found its way into the bacteria's
      cell membranes and began conducting current through its iron core,
      providing a new pathway for the bacteria to shuttle electrons from
      inside to outside the cell.<br>
      <br>
      Because the DFSO+ molecule's shape mirrors the structure of cell
      membranes, it can quickly slip into the membranes and remain there
      comfortably for weeks. The approach might need some tweaking
      before being applied to long-term power generation, the
      researchers say, but it's an encouraging initial finding.<br>
      <br>
      This chemical approach to changing bacteria's capabilities will
      most likely be cheaper than bacteria genetically engineered to do
      the same job. "It's a totally different strategy for microbial
      electrical energy generation," says the other co-first author,
      Nate Kirchhofer (@natekirchhofer), formerly a grad student at UCSB
      and now a postdoctoral researcher at Asylum Research in Santa
      Barbara, CA. "Before, we were building these devices, and we were
      limited to optimizing them by changing reactor materials and
      architectures or using genetic engineering techniques."<br>
      <br>
      The researchers call the DFSO+ molecule a "protein prosthetic"
      because it is a non-protein chemical that does a protein's job.
      "It's sort of analogous to a prosthetic limb, where you're using a
      plastic limb that's not actually made out of someone else's body,"
      says Rengert.<br>
      <br>
      Understanding how electrogenic bacteria consume organic fuels and
      use their metabolic processes to generate electric currents could
      lead to more efficient biological electricity-generating
      technology. "It's useful to have a well-defined, well-understood
      molecule that we can interrogate," says Kirchhofer. "We know how
      it's interfaced with the bacteria, so it gives us very precise
      electrochemical control over the bacteria. While this molecule
      might not be the best one that will ever exist, it's the first
      generation of this kind of molecule."<br>

      </b><b>The Bigger Picture</b><br>
      <br>
      Bacteria and other microorganisms are self-healing,
      reaction-specific “nanoreactors” that exist virtually everywhere
      on earth. As a result of site-to-site variation in the composition
      of contaminated waters, it is advantageous to boost the metabolic
      function of naturally dominant bacterial species to aid in
      contaminant breakdown. If such species can further be used to
      generate electrical energy at electrodes, this provides a potent
      means of generating clean power that offsets the cost of treating
      water in situ. Global adoption of this strategy is prevented,
      however, because many organisms cannot electrically communicate
      with an electrode. We therefore designed a chemical additive
      (DSFO+) that modifies cell membranes for conductivity and boosts
      power output without toxic side effects. DSFO+ finds immediate
      relevance in many bioelectronic water-treatment applications, and
      we anticipate that the molecular design of DSFO+ will inspire the
      design of additional relevant molecules.<br>

      For emerging bioelectronic technologies, charge-transfer processes
      remain rate limited by energy-level mismatching and poor contacts
      at biotic-abiotic interfaces. Direct chemical modification of
      these interfaces represents an underdeveloped approach for
      amplifying biocatalyzed current production. We present the
      synthesis and application of DSFO+, a redox-active molecule that
      is designed for membrane affinity and that catalytically couples
      to biological respiratory transmembrane electron transport,
      similarly to a heme-containing protein. DSFO+ was employed with
      three strains of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 (an electrogenic
      wild-type and two non-electrogenic knockout mutants) and amplified
      anodic biocurrent in all strains without toxicity at a
      physiologically relevant redox potential. Of particular interest,
      DSFO+ increased metabolic efficiency and biological electron
      production, thus stimulating respiratory biocurrent production in
      non-electrogenic bacterial phenotypes. The overall effect is akin
      to a “protein prosthetic” electron transfer agent.<br>

      <b>DIABETES </b><br>
      <br>
      According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 30 million
      people across the globe in 1985 had diabetes - 0.6% of the world's
      population. This had increased to 171 million (2.8% of the global
      population) by 2000, and it is expected to more than double to 366
      million (4.5% of the world's population) by 2030. Doctors
      attribute this rise in diabetes to poor diet and limited exercise
      resulting in obesity, and seldom look for causes other than
      lifestyle and genetics. But is this explanation good enough to
      provide the answers to the following newspaper headline in 2010:
      "One in ten Chinese adults are diabetics, study finds"? The
      article went on to say, "...with 92 million diabetics, China is
      now home to the most cases worldwide, overtaking India. The change
      is happening very rapidly." <br>
      <br>
      There appears to be only one major cause - diet. But have the
      Chinese and Indian diets changed that much? Is it not possible
      that this diabetic catastrophe has as much to do with access to
      new technology as it does to the food they eat? Indeed, in the Far
      East, the diet has barely changed over the last century, most of
      the population still eating a traditional diet. Very few of them
      eat Western-style food with its added salt and sugar content. This
      is particularly true for members of the rural community in China,
      who survive on an income of as little as $2 a day and have no
      access to Western-style foods. These people are suffering from
      diabetes at a greater rate than their urban counterparts. Unless
      there is evidence that their diet has changed significantly, this
      cannot be the exclusive reason why there is such an epidemic in
      new cases of the disease. There has to be another factor. <br>
      <br>
      One scientific paper suggests another cause for diabetes, one
      which has been brought upon us all inadvertently - so-called
      "dirty electricity", or what I would call man-made electromagnetic
      fields. In a study published in the journal Electromagnetic
      Biology and Medicine, 2008, Magda Havas cites overwhelming
      evidence that there should be a shift in the way we look at
      diabetes. In addition to the current type 1 and type 2 diabetes,
      she suggests that there should be a third type, which is
      exacerbated or induced by exposure to electromagnetic frequencies.
      The following case studies were taken from her report, and if you
      are reading this and have been told you have diabetes, it should
      make you think very carefully about how you might be able to
      reduce your blood sugar level without needing to be dependent on
      drugs. <br>
      <br>
      In a study following a 51-year-old man with type 2 diabetes over a
      one-week period, it was found that changes in his blood glucose
      levels were not related to his food intake, but were directly
      related to his working environment. The more he worked on his
      computer, the more his levels rose, and the levels quickly receded
      as soon as he walked away from the computer. An astonishing fact,
      however, was that the doctor's office where he had his tests,
      directly affected his diabetes levels. On entering the doctor's
      clinic, his blood sugar levels were tested and found to be
      prediabetic. Then, after sitting in the doctor's waiting area for
      only twenty minutes, his blood sugar level had risen to that of a
      type 2 diabetic. He then left the building and waited in the car
      park, an environment with no obvious electromagnetic fields, for a
      further twenty minutes. Upon measuring his levels immediately
      after the rest period, it was found that the glucose levels had
      gone back to normal. So what was in the doctor's clinic that could
      have made the difference? Dr Havas alleges that is was the five
      computers kicking out electromagnetic fields that had caused the
      changes. The conclusion one can draw from this is that if you are
      going to test a patient for diabetes, do it in an
      electromagnetically clean environment, to prevent misdiagnosis and
      to accurately determine the severity of the disease. <br>
      <br>
      A second experiment involved a 57-year-old woman with type 2
      diabetes who was taking no medication for her diabetes yet managed
      to control her plasma glucose levels simply by exercise and a
      strict diet. In this study, she was tested throughout the day. The
      results showed that exercising by walking caused her blood sugar
      levels to drop from a mean of 11. 8 to 7.2 mmol/L. However, if she
      practised the same amount of walking on an exercise machine, her
      blood sugar levels actually rose from 10 to 11.7 mmol/L. What
      could have caused this? It is suggested the large electrical motor
      used to generate the moving tread kicked out such a large
      electromagnetic field that it caused the blood sugar level to
      rise. How ironic that doctors recommend exercise for patients
      thinking that it will always help them - if this exercise is
      carried out indoors, on a running machine, it seems it will in
      fact have completely the opposite effect. So if you have diabetes,
      do not go to a gym with a high number of electrically powered
      exercise machines as the gym environment could be doing you enough
      damage to outweigh the positive effects of the exercise. <br>
      <br>
      Another study was conducted on a 28-year-old man with type 2
      diabetes who found it very difficult to reduce his blood sugar
      levels despite the fact that he was taking medication three times
      a day. In an attempt to reduce his levels, he introduced four GS
      (Graham Stetzer) filters into his home. GS filters are an
      invention that supposedly reduces the amount of electromagnetism
      in a localised area, such as your living room or bedroom; they
      simply plug into the socket. Within three days of introducing
      these filters into his home, the man's blood sugar levels dropped
      significantly to an amount that he not been able to achieve using
      just medication. <br>
      <br>
      What I believe these case studies show, quite clearly, is that
      environmental factors play a significant role in the likely causes
      of illnesses, particularly diabetes. If one thing is to be learned
      from the studies described here, it is that we should all
      immediately go out and buy a pack of GS filters and stick them in
      our homes. After reading Havas's article, it was the first thing I
      did, and I now have them in every room at home. In one of my
      offices, the reading went down from 240 to 40 GS units as soon as
      I put the filter in. The office has five computers - I had never
      thought about them before, but as soon as I observed the change in
      the filter reading, it awakened my thoughts on how large and
      prevalent these types of waves are. <br>
      <br>
      Anecdotal success of GS filters has been shown in one school in
      Wisconsin that was supposedly diagnosed with "sick building
      syndrome", whatever that encompassed. According to the district
      nurse, once the GS filters were installed, only three of the
      thirty- seven students in the school who used inhalers on a daily
      basis subsequently required their inhalers, and then they only
      needed them for exercise-induced asthmas. GS filters were also
      placed in a school in Toronto,and approximately 50% of the
      teachers documented an improvement in their own energy,
      performance, mood and/or health, in a single-blind study. Student
      behaviour, especially at the elementary level, also improved. The
      symptoms that changed were the ones we associate with attention
      deficit disorder (ADD) and attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD). <br>
      <br>
      Following on from her studies on diabetes, Havas then investigated
      whether electromagnetic fields had an effect on other illnesses.
      It was not much of a surprise that the few case studies that she
      completed showed similar results to those for diabetes. In one
      study on multiple sclerosis, a teacher in Wisconsin suffered from
      double vision, cognitive difficulties and memory issues. She
      managed to persuade her school to introduce GS filters, and within
      days her symptoms disappeared. Havas attempted to analyse other
      people with multiple sclerosis, with similar positive results. One
      man aged twenty-seven noticed improvements within twenty-four
      hours and steadily improved over the following weeks. He suffered
      from common symptoms of multiple sclerosis: he could not walk
      without the use of an aid, he had tremors, and he suffered from
      exceptional tiredness. Three days after he installed GS filters in
      his home, the study discovered that his symptoms had begun to
      disappear, only returning when he went shopping in the local
      centre. The symptoms then disappeared three hours after he had
      rested at home within the confines of the GS filters. <br>
      <br>
      If these case studies are to be believed, what other illnesses is
      electromagnetic radiation causing? What are the most recent
      increases in illnesses that are occurring in the West besides
      those of multiple sclerosis and diabetes? Two illnesses that I
      personally am aware of are chronic fatigue/fibromyalgia and hay
      fever. The prevalence of these two illnesses is growing at a rate
      similar to that suggested for diabetes by the WHO. Could they be
      all related to the same problem - dirty electricity? If this is
      the case, surely the governing bodies know about it and have the
      situation under control. Well, yes and no. The WHO is aware that
      appliances emit low-level electromagnetic pollution but believes
      this to be at such a low level as to be insignificant. However, I
      believe the WHO needs to change its attitude very soon, as more
      and more scientific studies are reporting biological and health
      effects associated with electromagnetic pollution well below WHO
      guidelines. <br>
      <br>
      Studies so far that show a direct link between electromagnetic
      pollution and heath include the following: <br>

        <b>By </b><br>

      <br>
      Just by flapping in the wind, a new energy-generating flag
      produces enough electricity to power small electronic devices. The
      flag converts mechanical energy into electricity using the effect
      behind static electricity. Floating high above the ground using
      balloons, it could harvest high-altitude winds to power weather
      and environmental monitoring sensors, as well as navigation
      systems.<br>
      <br>
      Winds at high altitudes are faster and more consistent than those
      near the ground, but ground-based turbines are unable to reach
      those heights. Many groups are testing technologies such as
      floating turbines, kites, sails, and winged craft to harness these
      high-altitude winds.<br>
      <br>
      “How about a little piece of fabric for wind power?” asks Zhong
      Lin Wang, a materials science and engineering professor at Georgia
      Tech, in Atlanta. The flag’s low cost and easy scalability could
      make it competitive with other airborne wind power technologies,
      he says.The details of the Georgia Tech team’s research appear in
      the journal ACS Nano.<br>
      <br>
      The flag operates on the triboelectric effect. When the surfaces
      of two different materials touch and separate, electrons transfer
      from one to the other, building up opposite charges on the two
      surfaces. This can lead to a voltage that drives electric current.<br>
      <br>
      Wang’s group has made several generators that scavenge energy from
      body movements and mechanical vibrations to produce electricity.
      In early 2015, the team reported a slinky-shaped generator and an
      energy-scavenging fabric that could power gadgets using human
      motion.<br>
      <br>
      The flag is the researchers’ newest form of triboelectric
      generator. They made it by weaving together 1.5-centimeter-wide,
      30-cm-long strips made from two kinds of fabric. The weft is a
      nickel-coated polyester textile belt and the warp is a polyimide
      plastic-coated copper film. All the nickel belts are connected
      using copper tape to form one electrode; all the copper belts are
      connected together as the other electrode. The flag, which weighs
      15 grams, can be bent, folded and twisted. <br>
      <br>
      “The weave is loose and there is a few hairs’ distance between the
      two fabric strips,” Wang explains. So as the flag flutters in
      artificially generated wind, the two fabric units repeatedly touch
      and separate from each other, generating power.<br>
      <br>
      At a wind speed of 22 meters per second, the flag produces a
      maximum of about 40 volts and 30 microamperes. Three flags
      connected in parallel could light up 16 commercial LEDs. As a
      demonstration, the researchers connected the flag’s output to a
      button cell battery that powered a humidity and temperature sensor
      node that transmits data wirelessly to a computer. This whole
      system was tethered to a meteorological balloon that hovered in an
      indoor laboratory where the researchers were able to vary
      temperature and humidity. <br>

      Wind energy at a high altitude is far more stable and stronger
      than that near the ground, but it is out of reach of the wind
      turbine. Herein, we develop an innovative freestanding woven
      triboelectric nanogenerator flag (WTENG-flag) that can harvest
      high-altitude wind energy from arbitrary directions. The
      wind-driven fluttering of the woven unit leads to the current
      generation by a coupled effect of contact electrification and
      electrostatic induction. Systematic study is conducted to optimize
      the structure/material parameters of the WTENG-flag to improve the
      power output. This 2D WTENG-flag can also be stacked in parallel
      connections in many layers for a linearly increased output.
      Finally, a self-powered high-altitude platform with
      temperature/humidity sensing/telecommunicating capability is
      demonstrated with the WTENG-flag as a power source. Due to the
      light weight, low cost, and easy scale-up, this WTENG-flag has
      great potential for applications in weather/environmental
      sensing/monitoring systems.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Quartz, as the most stable low-pressure polymorph of silica
      (SiO2), is widely abundant in Earth's crust and mantle, exhibiting
      relatively high chemical stability. Although silica is only
      slightly soluble in water at ambient conditions, producing
      silicon-based weakly acidic compounds, Shinozaki et al. (2014)
      have shown recently that water itself can be formed by dissolution
      of SiO2 in H2H2 fluid under high- temperature and pressure
      conditions. Here, we have simulated this process via
      molecular-dynamics techniques based on a reactive force-field
      description of the SiO2/H2SiO2/H2 interface. Diffusion of the H2H2
      fluid into the quartz crystal lattice was observed upon increasing
      temperature and pressure, followed by interaction of dissociated,
      atomic hydrogen with oxygen atoms in the SiO2 lattice, disrupting
      the lattice and leading to the formation of water. Interestingly,
      water is evolved in the subsurface region of the silica, and it
      remains confined there, isolated from the hydrogen fluid, which
      corresponds precisely to the ice-like spectroscopic patterns
      observed experimentally. The over-pressured water formed from
      quartz and H2H2 is a possible trigger for nucleating enigmatic
      deep earthquakes in the continental mantle lithosphere.<br>

        <br>
        <b>Li-na Niu, et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Remineralization of demineralized dentin is important for
      improving dentin bonding stability and controlling primary and
      secondary caries. Nevertheless, conventional dentin
      remineralization strategy is not suitable for remineralizing
      completely-demineralized dentin within hybrid layers created by
      etch-and-rinse and moderately aggressive self-etch adhesive
      systems, or the superficial part of a caries-affected dentin
      lesion left behind after minimally invasive caries removal.
      Biomimetic remineralization represents a different approach to
      this problem by attempting to backfill the demineralized dentin
      collagen with liquid-like amorphous calcium phosphate
      nanoprecursor particles that are stabilized by biomimetic analogs
      of noncollagenous proteins.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This paper reviewed the changing concepts in calcium phosphate
      mineralization of fibrillar collagen, including the recently
      discovered, non-classical particle-based crystallization concept,
      formation of polymer-induced liquid- precursors (PILP),
      experimental collagen models for mineralization, and the need for
      using phosphate-containing biomimetic analogs for biomimetic
      mineralization of collagen. Published work on the remineralization
      of resin-dentin bonds and artificial caries-like lesions by
      various research groups was then reviewed. Finally, the problems
      and progress associated with the translation of a
      scientifically-sound concept into a clinically-applicable approach
      are discussed.<br>
      Results and Significance<br>
      <br>
      The particle-based biomimetic remineralization strategy based on
      the PILP process demonstrates great potential in remineralizing
      faulty hybrid layers or caries-like dentin. Based on this concept,
      research in the development of more clinically feasible dentin
      remineralization strategy, such as incorporating poly(anionic)
      acid-stabilized amorphous calcium phosphate
      nanoprecursor-containing mesoporous silica nanofillers in dentin
      adhesives, may provide a promising strategy for increasing of the
      durability of resin-dentin bonding and remineralizing
      caries-affected dentin.<br>

      here are many hidden dangers of light-emitting diode (LED)
      lighting that most people have no idea exist. Though LED lights
      are more efficient than fluorescent lights, they also produce a
      good amount of light in the blue spectrum. Richard Hansler, a
      light researcher at John Carroll University in Cleveland, says
      that ordinary incandescent lights do produce some blue light, but
      far less than fluorescent lightbulbs.<br>
      <br>
      At night specifically, light throws the body’s biological clock,
      known as the circadian rhythm, out of its cycle, disturbing sleep
      as a result. Research even shows that this disruption may cause
      cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Though light of any
      kind can suppress melatonin secretion, it is blue light in
      particular that is of most concern. In one study, Harvard
      researchers and their colleagues discovered that, through an
      experiment in which they compared the effects of 6.5 hours of
      exposure to blue light to the exposure of green light of
      comparable brightness, blue light suppressed melatonin for nearly
      twice as long as the green light. Furthermore, circadian rhythms
      were shifted by twice as much...<br>

      <br>
      Can thermal solar energy be stored until wintertime? Yes, this is
      possible, using a cheap material like sodium lye. Within a
      European research consortium Empa scientists and their colleagues
      have spent four years studying this question by pitting three
      different techniques against each other.<br>
      <br>
      We are still a far cry from a sustainable energy supply: in 2014,
      71 percent of all privately-owned apartments and houses in
      Switzerland were heated with fossil fuels, and 60 percent of the
      hot water consumed in private households is generated in this way.
      In other words, a considerable amount of fossil energy could be
      saved if we were able to store heat from sunny summer days until
      wintertime and retrieve it at the flick of a switch. Is there a
      way to do this? It certainly looks like it. Since autumn of 2016,
      following several years of research, Empa has a plant on a lab
      scale in operation that works reliably and is able to store heat
      in the long term. But the road to get there was long and winding.<br>
      <br>
      The theory behind this kind of heat storage is fairly
      straightforward: if you pour water into a beaker containing solid
      or concentrated sodium hydroxide (NaOH), the mixture heats up. The
      dilution is exothermic: chemical energy is released in the form of
      heat. Moreover, sodium hydroxide solution is highly hygroscopic
      and able to absorb water vapor. The condensation heat obtained as
      a result warms up the sodium hydroxide solution even more.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summer heat in a storage tank</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The other way round is also possible: if we feed energy into a
      dilute sodium hydroxide solution in the form of heat, the water
      evaporates; the sodium hydroxide solution will get more
      concentrated and thus stores the supplied energy. This solution
      can be kept for months and even years, or transported in tanks. If
      it comes into contact with water (vapor) again, the stored heat is
      re-released.<br>
      <br>
      So much for the theory, anyway. But could the beaker experiment be
      replicated on a scale capable of storing enough energy for a
      single-family household? Empa researchers Robert Weber and
      Benjamin Fumey rolled up their sleeves and got down to work. They
      used an insulated sea container as an experimental laboratory on
      Empa’s campus in Dübendorf – a safety precaution as concentrated
      sodium hydroxide solution is highly corrosive. If the system were
      to spring a leak, it would be preferable for the aggressive liquid
      to slosh through the container instead of Empa’s laboratory
      building.<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, the so-called COMTES prototype didn’t work as
      anticipated. The researchers had opted for a falling film
      evaporator – a system used in the food industry to condense orange
      juice into a concentrate, for instance. Instead of flowing
      correctly around the heat exchanger, however, the thick sodium
      hydroxide solution formed large drops. It absorbed too little
      water vapor and the amount of heat that was transferred remained
      too low.<br>
      Heat exchangers from instant water heaters provided the solution:
      the sodium hydroxide solution spirals along a pipe, absorbs water
      vapor and emits heat.<br>
      <br>
      Then Fumey had a brainwave: the viscous storage medium should
      trickle along a pipe in a spiral, absorb water vapor on the way
      and transfer the generated heat to the pipe. The reverse –
      charging the medium – should also be possible using the same
      technique, only the other way round. It worked. And the best thing
      about it: spiral-shaped heat exchangers are already available ex
      stock – heat exchangers from flow water heaters.<br>
      <br>
      Fumey then optimized the lab system further: which fluctuations in
      NaOH concentration are optimal for efficiency? Which temperatures
      should the inflowing and outflowing water have? Water vapor at a
      temperature of five to ten degrees is required to drain the store.
      This water vapor can be produced with heat from a geothermal
      probe, for instance. In the process, 50-percent sodium hydroxide
      solution runs down the outside of the spiral heat exchanger pipe
      and is thinned to 30 percent in the steam atmosphere. The water
      inside the pipe heats up to around 50 degrees Celsius – which
      makes it just the ticket for floor heating.<br>
      "Charged" sodium hydroxide<br>
      <br>
      While replenishing the store, the 30-percent, “discharged” sodium
      hydroxide solution trickles downwards around the spiral pipe.
      Inside the pipe flows 60-degree hot water, which can be produced
      by a solar collector, for instance. The water from the sodium
      hydroxide solution evaporates; the water vapor is removed and
      condensed. The condensation heat is conducted into a geothermal
      probe, where it is stored. The sodium hydroxide solution that
      leaves the heat exchanger after charging is concentrated to 50
      percent again, i.e. “charged” with thermal energy.<br>
      <br>
      “This method enables solar energy to be stored in the form of
      chemical energy from the summer until the wintertime,” says Fumey.
      “And that’s not all: the stored heat can also be transported
      elsewhere in the form of concentrated sodium hydroxide solution,
      which makes it flexible to use.” The search for industrial
      partners to help build a compact household system on the basis of
      the Empa lab model has now begun. The next prototype of the sodium
      hydroxide storage system could then be used in NEST, for example.<br>

      Goodchild's 7 foot tall Musical Tesla Coils.<br>
      <br>
      This was the first time the coils have ever been run together. It
      was a marvelous first test.<br>
      <br>
      These are two gigantic solid state musical Tesla Coils. A Tesla
      Coil is a special type of transformer invented by Nikola Tesla
      that is able to generating extremely large voltages using a
      phenomenon known as electrical resonance. Each coil in this video
      is capable of generating a 13 foot spark. This equates to about
      500,000 volts of electricity.<br>
      <br>
      The primary drive system for the coils consists of high power
      semiconductors arranged into an H-Bridge switching configuration.
      During a spark event, the coil is pulsed on for a few hundred
      millionths of a second. During this short time, thousands of amps
      circulate within the primary tank circuit and the energy is
      coupled into the secondary resonator through magnetism.<br>
      <br>
      So what appears to be a continuous burst of sparks is actually a
      specific number of sparks generated per second. By modulating the
      number of sparks that emit from the coil each second, different
      tones can be produced by the coils.<br>

      These coils were constructed by Eric Goodchild and Steven Caton.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The restoration of dentine lost in deep caries lesions in teeth is
      a routine and common treatment that involves the use of inorganic
      cements based on calcium or silicon-based mineral aggregates. Such
      cements remain in the tooth and fail to degrade and thus normal
      mineral volume is never completely restored. Here we describe a
      novel, biological approach to dentine restoration that stimulates
      the natural formation of reparative dentine via the mobilisation
      of resident stem cells in the tooth pulp. Biodegradable,
      clinically-approved collagen sponges are used to deliver low doses
      of small molecule glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3) antagonists
      that promote the natural processes of reparative dentine formation
      to completely restore dentine. Since the carrier sponge is
      degraded over time, dentine replaces the degraded sponge leading
      to a complete, effective natural repair. This simple, rapid
      natural tooth repair process could thus potentially provide a new
      approach to clinical tooth restoration...<br>
      <br>
      ...We developed a method that uses an already clinically-approved
      biomaterial (collagen sponge – Kolspon) as a delivery vehicle for
      small molecule GSK-3 inhibitors that act as Wnt agonists. Both BIO
      and CHIR99021 have been extensively used experimentally to elevate
      Wnt activity while Tideglusib is in clinical trials for systemic
      use in the treatment of neurological disorders include Alzheimers
      disease...<br>

      ...Has the Food and Drug Administration engineered a shortage of
      intravenous vitamin C as part of an overall attack on natural and
      non-toxic approaches to healing that compete with prescription
      drugs? An analysis by Natural Blaze would suggest that the answer
      is yes.<br>
      <br>
      Natural Blaze claims that a critical shortage of IV bags in
      general followed an FDA ban on the mass production of intravenous
      vitamin C. The FDA limited the availability of IV-C and the
      pharmaceutical industry halted production of injectable vitamins
      and minerals, after a 60 minute story about the miraculous
      recovery of a swine flu patient on life support. Because of the
      shortage of IV-C, doctors called upon compounding pharmacies to
      produce it. But the FDA began to limit compounding pharmacies
      after injectable steroids produced by the New England Compounding
      Center were contaminated with a fungus that caused a deadly
      outbreak of meningitis. Here is an example of an entire industry
      being punished for the dubious practices of one compounding

      The discoverer claims it surpasses absorption limits of other
      forms of vitamin C and sites a number of studies so indicating.<br>
      <br>
      There are different types of ports on the cells in the body, and
      one of the ports is for vitamin C.<br>
      <br>
      The form of vitamin C disclosed in the video and on the web site
      is absorbed through the glucose ports on the cells, and there are
      4-5 times more glucose ports than ascorbic acid/vitamin C ports in
      the cells, so much higher absorption rates are achieved with this
      form (it also takes energy to absorb vitamin C through the vitamin
      C ports, but it doesn't take energy to absorb through the glucose
      ports). (Absorption into blood stream from digestive tract and
      from blood stream into cells in the body).&nbsp; The cells can
      then convert this form of vitamin C back to the common form.<br>

      Small nuclear power plants for hard-to-get-at regions. SUBSTANCE:
      reactor has electrolysis chamber, water circulating system,
      detonating-mixture storage device, and turbine- generator set.
      Uranium taken from spent fuel rods of nuclear reactor is converted
      into granules of composite uranium oxide and binder. Radioactivity
      of granules obtained is high enough to use them for radiolytic
      decomposition of water. Radiolytic water is treated by means of
      voltaic cell wherein it is decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen
      (detonating mixture). In this way radioactive wastes are converted
      from useless environmentally hazardous ballast into product used
      for producing low-cost energy. EFFECT: enhanced efficiency of
      reactor.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Bats have long captured the imaginations of scientists and
      engineers with their unrivaled agility and maneuvering
      characteristics, achieved by functionally versatile dynamic wing
      conformations as well as more than 40 active and passive joints on
      the wings. Wing flexibility and complex wing kinematics not only
      bring a unique perspective to research in biology and aerial
      robotics but also pose substantial technological challenges for
      robot modeling, design, and control. We have created a fully
      self-contained, autonomous flying robot that weighs 93 grams,
      called Bat Bot (B2), to mimic such morphological properties of bat
      wings. Instead of using a large number of distributed control
      actuators, we implement highly stretchable silicone-based membrane
      wings that are controlled at a reduced number of dominant wing
      joints to best match the morphological characteristics of bat
      flight. First, the dominant degrees of freedom (DOFs) in the bat
      flight mechanism are identified and incorporated in B2’s design by
      means of a series of mechanical constraints. These biologically
      meaningful DOFs include asynchronous and mediolateral movements of
      the armwings and dorsoventral movements of the legs. Second, the
      continuous surface and elastic properties of bat skin under wing
      morphing are realized by an ultrathin (56 micrometers) membranous
      skin that covers the skeleton of the morphing wings. We have
      successfully achieved autonomous flight of B2 using a series of
      virtual constraints to control the articulated, morphing wings.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Quartz, as the most stable low-pressure polymorph of silica
      (SiO2), is widely abundant in Earth's crust and mantle, exhibiting
      relatively high chemical stability. Although silica is only
      slightly soluble in water at ambient conditions, producing
      silicon-based weakly acidic compounds, Shinozaki et al. (2014)
      have shown recently that water itself can be formed by dissolution
      of SiO2 in H2H2 fluid under high- temperature and pressure
      conditions. Here, we have simulated this process via
      molecular-dynamics techniques based on a reactive force-field
      description of the SiO2/H2SiO2/H2 interface. Diffusion of the H2H2
      fluid into the quartz crystal lattice was observed upon increasing
      temperature and pressure, followed by interaction of dissociated,
      atomic hydrogen with oxygen atoms in the SiO2 lattice, disrupting
      the lattice and leading to the formation of water. Interestingly,
      water is evolved in the subsurface region of the silica, and it
      remains confined there, isolated from the hydrogen fluid, which
      corresponds precisely to the ice-like spectroscopic patterns
      observed experimentally. The over-pressured water formed from
      quartz and H2H2 is a possible trigger for nucleating enigmatic
      deep earthquakes in the continental mantle lithosphere.<br>

        <br>
        <b>Li-na Niu, et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Remineralization of demineralized dentin is important for
      improving dentin bonding stability and controlling primary and
      secondary caries. Nevertheless, conventional dentin
      remineralization strategy is not suitable for remineralizing
      completely-demineralized dentin within hybrid layers created by
      etch-and-rinse and moderately aggressive self-etch adhesive
      systems, or the superficial part of a caries-affected dentin
      lesion left behind after minimally invasive caries removal.
      Biomimetic remineralization represents a different approach to
      this problem by attempting to backfill the demineralized dentin
      collagen with liquid-like amorphous calcium phosphate
      nanoprecursor particles that are stabilized by biomimetic analogs
      of noncollagenous proteins.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Methods</b><br>
      <br>
      This paper reviewed the changing concepts in calcium phosphate
      mineralization of fibrillar collagen, including the recently
      discovered, non-classical particle-based crystallization concept,
      formation of polymer-induced liquid- precursors (PILP),
      experimental collagen models for mineralization, and the need for
      using phosphate-containing biomimetic analogs for biomimetic
      mineralization of collagen. Published work on the remineralization
      of resin-dentin bonds and artificial caries-like lesions by
      various research groups was then reviewed. Finally, the problems
      and progress associated with the translation of a
      scientifically-sound concept into a clinically-applicable approach
      are discussed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results and Significance</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The particle-based biomimetic remineralization strategy based on
      the PILP process demonstrates great potential in remineralizing
      faulty hybrid layers or caries-like dentin. Based on this concept,
      research in the development of more clinically feasible dentin
      remineralization strategy, such as incorporating poly(anionic)
      acid-stabilized amorphous calcium phosphate
      nanoprecursor-containing mesoporous silica nanofillers in dentin
      adhesives, may provide a promising strategy for increasing of the
      durability of resin-dentin bonding and remineralizing
      caries-affected dentin.<br>

      Institute of Nuclear Technology in Xi'an have been working on a
      potent microwave weapon. This one, which recently won China's
      National Science and Technology Progress Award, is small enough to
      fit on a lab work bench, making it theoretically portable enough

      here are many hidden dangers of light-emitting diode (LED)
      lighting that most people have no idea exist. Though LED lights
      are more efficient than fluorescent lights, they also produce a
      good amount of light in the blue spectrum. Richard Hansler, a
      light researcher at John Carroll University in Cleveland, says
      that ordinary incandescent lights do produce some blue light, but
      far less than fluorescent lightbulbs.<br>
      <br>
      At night specifically, light throws the body’s biological clock,
      known as the circadian rhythm, out of its cycle, disturbing sleep
      as a result. Research even shows that this disruption may cause
      cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Though light of any
      kind can suppress melatonin secretion, it is blue light in
      particular that is of most concern. In one study, Harvard
      researchers and their colleagues discovered that, through an
      experiment in which they compared the effects of 6.5 hours of
      exposure to blue light to the exposure of green light of
      comparable brightness, blue light suppressed melatonin for nearly
      twice as long as the green light. Furthermore, circadian rhythms
      were shifted by twice as much...<br>

      <br>
      Can thermal solar energy be stored until wintertime? Yes, this is
      possible, using a cheap material like sodium lye. Within a
      European research consortium Empa scientists and their colleagues
      have spent four years studying this question by pitting three
      different techniques against each other.<br>
      <br>
      We are still a far cry from a sustainable energy supply: in 2014,
      71 percent of all privately-owned apartments and houses in
      Switzerland were heated with fossil fuels, and 60 percent of the
      hot water consumed in private households is generated in this way.
      In other words, a considerable amount of fossil energy could be
      saved if we were able to store heat from sunny summer days until
      wintertime and retrieve it at the flick of a switch. Is there a
      way to do this? It certainly looks like it. Since autumn of 2016,
      following several years of research, Empa has a plant on a lab
      scale in operation that works reliably and is able to store heat
      in the long term. But the road to get there was long and winding.<br>
      <br>
      The theory behind this kind of heat storage is fairly
      straightforward: if you pour water into a beaker containing solid
      or concentrated sodium hydroxide (NaOH), the mixture heats up. The
      dilution is exothermic: chemical energy is released in the form of
      heat. Moreover, sodium hydroxide solution is highly hygroscopic
      and able to absorb water vapor. The condensation heat obtained as
      a result warms up the sodium hydroxide solution even more.<br>
      Summer heat in a storage tank<br>
      <br>
      The other way round is also possible: if we feed energy into a
      dilute sodium hydroxide solution in the form of heat, the water
      evaporates; the sodium hydroxide solution will get more
      concentrated and thus stores the supplied energy. This solution
      can be kept for months and even years, or transported in tanks. If
      it comes into contact with water (vapor) again, the stored heat is
      re-released.<br>
      <br>
      So much for the theory, anyway. But could the beaker experiment be
      replicated on a scale capable of storing enough energy for a
      single-family household? Empa researchers Robert Weber and
      Benjamin Fumey rolled up their sleeves and got down to work. They
      used an insulated sea container as an experimental laboratory on
      Empa’s campus in Dübendorf – a safety precaution as concentrated
      sodium hydroxide solution is highly corrosive. If the system were
      to spring a leak, it would be preferable for the aggressive liquid
      to slosh through the container instead of Empa’s laboratory
      building.<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, the so-called COMTES prototype didn’t work as
      anticipated. The researchers had opted for a falling film
      evaporator – a system used in the food industry to condense orange
      juice into a concentrate, for instance. Instead of flowing
      correctly around the heat exchanger, however, the thick sodium
      hydroxide solution formed large drops. It absorbed too little
      water vapor and the amount of heat that was transferred remained
      too low.<br>
      <br>
      Heat exchangers from instant water heaters provided the solution:
      the sodium hydroxide solution spirals along a pipe, absorbs water
      vapor and emits heat.<br>
      <br>
      Then Fumey had a brainwave: the viscous storage medium should
      trickle along a pipe in a spiral, absorb water vapor on the way
      and transfer the generated heat to the pipe. The reverse –
      charging the medium – should also be possible using the same
      technique, only the other way round. It worked. And the best thing
      about it: spiral-shaped heat exchangers are already available ex
      stock – heat exchangers from flow water heaters.<br>
      <br>
      Fumey then optimized the lab system further: which fluctuations in
      NaOH concentration are optimal for efficiency? Which temperatures
      should the inflowing and outflowing water have? Water vapor at a
      temperature of five to ten degrees is required to drain the store.
      This water vapor can be produced with heat from a geothermal
      probe, for instance. In the process, 50-percent sodium hydroxide
      solution runs down the outside of the spiral heat exchanger pipe
      and is thinned to 30 percent in the steam atmosphere. The water
      inside the pipe heats up to around 50 degrees Celsius – which
      makes it just the ticket for floor heating.<br>
      "Charged" sodium hydroxide<br>
      <br>
      While replenishing the store, the 30-percent, “discharged” sodium
      hydroxide solution trickles downwards around the spiral pipe.
      Inside the pipe flows 60-degree hot water, which can be produced
      by a solar collector, for instance. The water from the sodium
      hydroxide solution evaporates; the water vapor is removed and
      condensed. The condensation heat is conducted into a geothermal
      probe, where it is stored. The sodium hydroxide solution that
      leaves the heat exchanger after charging is concentrated to 50
      percent again, i.e. “charged” with thermal energy.<br>
      <br>
      “This method enables solar energy to be stored in the form of
      chemical energy from the summer until the wintertime,” says Fumey.
      “And that’s not all: the stored heat can also be transported
      elsewhere in the form of concentrated sodium hydroxide solution,
      which makes it flexible to use.” The search for industrial
      partners to help build a compact household system on the basis of
      the Empa lab model has now begun. The next prototype of the sodium
      hydroxide storage system could then be used in NEST, for example.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      The restoration of dentine lost in deep caries lesions in teeth is
      a routine and common treatment that involves the use of inorganic
      cements based on calcium or silicon-based mineral aggregates. Such
      cements remain in the tooth and fail to degrade and thus normal
      mineral volume is never completely restored. Here we describe a
      novel, biological approach to dentine restoration that stimulates
      the natural formation of reparative dentine via the mobilisation
      of resident stem cells in the tooth pulp. Biodegradable,
      clinically-approved collagen sponges are used to deliver low doses
      of small molecule glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3) antagonists
      that promote the natural processes of reparative dentine formation
      to completely restore dentine. Since the carrier sponge is
      degraded over time, dentine replaces the degraded sponge leading
      to a complete, effective natural repair. This simple, rapid
      natural tooth repair process could thus potentially provide a new
      approach to clinical tooth restoration...<br>
      <br>
      ...We developed a method that uses an already clinically-approved
      biomaterial (collagen sponge – Kolspon) as a delivery vehicle for
      small molecule GSK-3 inhibitors that act as Wnt agonists. Both BIO
      and CHIR99021 have been extensively used experimentally to elevate
      Wnt activity while Tideglusib is in clinical trials for systemic
      use in the treatment of neurological disorders include Alzheimers
      disease...<br>

      ...Has the Food and Drug Administration engineered a shortage of
      intravenous vitamin C as part of an overall attack on natural and
      non-toxic approaches to healing that compete with prescription
      drugs? An analysis by Natural Blaze would suggest that the answer
      is yes.<br>
      <br>
      Natural Blaze claims that a critical shortage of IV bags in
      general followed an FDA ban on the mass production of intravenous
      vitamin C. The FDA limited the availability of IV-C and the
      pharmaceutical industry halted production of injectable vitamins
      and minerals, after a 60 minute story about the miraculous
      recovery of a swine flu patient on life support. Because of the
      shortage of IV-C, doctors called upon compounding pharmacies to
      produce it. But the FDA began to limit compounding pharmacies
      after injectable steroids produced by the New England Compounding
      Center were contaminated with a fungus that caused a deadly
      outbreak of meningitis. Here is an example of an entire industry
      being punished for the dubious practices of one compounding

      <br>
      So how much is that costing us? Trucost’s headline results are
      fairly stunning.<br>
      <br>
      First, the total unpriced natural capital consumed by the more
      than 1,000 “global primary production and primary processing

      ... He is, really, best defined as the visible effect of the
      ongoing social phase transition. A discrete change in our path in
      the direction of collapse.<br>
      <br>
      For a good number of years, I have been studying the reasons for
      the collapse of societies. And, at the beginning, I tended to
      explain it as mainly the result of the depletion of crucial
      resources; crude oil, in our case. But, the more I think about
      that, the more I understand that the relation between depletion
      and collapse is far from being straightforward. A society can very
      well collapse without running out of anything; think of the case
      of the Soviet Union. When it collapsed, the Union had still plenty
      of mineral resources, but it couldn't find a way to exploit them
      in a convenient manner. In the case of the Roman Empire, also,
      there is no evidence that it run out of food or of any basic
      resource. Rather, it ran out of the resource it used for paying
      its troops, gold and silver for its currency. In both cases, it
      was a question of the collapse of control. As we all know, power
      without control is nothing....<br>

      ...The tenets of capitalism are ritually followed in the
      proclaimed belief that “a rising tide lifts all boats”, i.e.
      so-called improvements in the general economy will benefit all
      participants in that economy. Centuries of unbridled capitalism
      have demonstrated beyond any doubt that it does not lift all
      boats. A new study finds that half of Americans are “shut off from
      economic growth”. The rules of the game are so stacked against the
      masses that this week a professor said “only all-out thermonuclear
      war might fundamentally reset the existing distribution of
      resources.” Capitalism’s imperative for expansion, growing profit
      levels, and efficiency has ultimately dehumanized our culture. Not
      even when our basic life support systems are being torn asunder do
      the vast majority question the path we are on. We are all a
      captive audience to the system and those few dissident voices are
      snuffed out under the wheels of “progress”.<br>
      <br>
      Truth be told, the corporate elite have long written off all those
      people living hand to mouth. Trump’s pick for Labor Secretary
      said, unlike workers, machines are “always polite, they always
      upsell, they never take a vacation, they never show up late,
      there’s never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex, or race
      discrimination case.” Massive global unemployment resulting from
      the automation revolution has not yet been addressed by
      governments. Roughly half of all jobs in the U.S. are at risk of
      automation and two-thirds in the developing countries. This is all
      coming at a time when humans are fast destroying the ecosystems
      underpinning the very foundation upon which human civilization has
      developed over thousands of years. Mass migration of climate
      refugees will only further destabilize governments, stoke ethnic
      and cultural tensions, and give rise to fascist political
      movements. No conspiracy is needed to exterminate the “useless
      eaters”, just allow mother nature to take its course and climate
      change will be killing billions by mid century. Those in military
      planning know this and periodically express their fear of what is
      coming, but business-as-usual rolls on....<br>

      To most people, crystals mean diamond bling, semiprecious gems or
      perhaps the jagged amethyst or quartz crystals beloved by
      collectors.<br>
      <br>
      To Norman Yao, these inert crystals are the tip of the iceberg.<br>
      <br>
      If crystals have an atomic structure that repeats in space, like
      the carbon lattice of a diamond, why can’t crystals also have a
      structure that repeats in time? That is, a time crystal?<br>
      <br>
      In a paper published online last week in the journal Physical
      Review Letters, the UC Berkeley assistant professor of physics
      describes exactly how to make and measure the properties of such a
      crystal, and even predicts what the various phases surrounding the
      time crystal should be — akin to the liquid and gas phases of ice.<br>
      <br>
      A one-dimensional chain of ytterbium ions was turned into a time
      crystal by physicists at the University of Maryland, based on a
      blueprint provided by UC Berkeley’s Norman Yao. Each ion behaves
      like an electron spin and exhibits long-range interactions
      indicated as arrows. (Image courtesy of Chris Monroe)<br>
      <br>
      This is not mere speculation. Two groups followed Yao’s blueprint
      and have already created the first-ever time crystals. The groups
      at the University of Maryland and Harvard University reported
      their successes, using two totally different setups, in papers
      posted online last year, and have submitted the results for
      publication. Yao is a co-author on both papers.<br>
      <br>
      Time crystals repeat in time because they are kicked periodically,
      sort of like tapping Jell-O repeatedly to get it to jiggle, Yao
      said. The big breakthrough, he argues, is less that these
      particular crystals repeat in time than that they are the first of
      a large class of new materials that are intrinsically out of
      equilibrium, unable to settle down to the motionless equilibrium
      of, for example, a diamond or ruby.<br>
      <br>
      “This is a new phase of matter, period, but it is also really cool
      because it is one of the first examples of non-equilibrium
      matter,” Yao said. “For the last half-century, we have been
      exploring equilibrium matter, like metals and insulators. We are
      just now starting to explore a whole new landscape of
      non-equilibrium matter.”<br>
      <br>
      While Yao is hard put to imagine a use for a time crystal, other
      proposed phases of non-equilibrium matter theoretically hold
      promise as nearly perfect memories and may be useful in quantum
      computers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>An ytterbium chain</b><br>
      <br>
      The time crystal created by Chris Monroe and his colleagues at the
      University of Maryland employs a conga line of 10 ytterbium ions
      whose electron spins interact, similar to the qubit systems being
      tested as quantum computers. To keep the ions out of equilibrium,
      the researchers alternately hit them with one laser to create an
      effective magnetic field and a second laser to partially flip the
      spins of the atoms, repeating the sequence many times. Because the
      spins interacted, the atoms settled into a stable, repetitive
      pattern of spin flipping that defines a crystal.<br>
      Phase diagram for time crystal<br>
      <br>
      This phase diagram shows how changing the experimental parameters
      can ‘melt’ a time crystal into a normal insulator or heat up a
      time crystal to a high temperature thermal state. Norman Yao
      graphic.<br>
      <br>
      Time crystals were first proposed in 2012 by Nobel laureate Frank
      Wilczek, and last year theoretical physicists at Princeton
      University and UC Santa Barbara’s Station Q independently proved
      that such a crystal could be made. According to Yao, the UC
      Berkeley group was “the bridge between the theoretical idea and
      the experimental implementation.”<br>
      <br>
      From the perspective of quantum mechanics, electrons can form
      crystals that do not match the underlying spatial translation
      symmetry of the orderly, three-dimensional array of atoms, Yao
      said. This breaks the symmetry of the material and leads to unique
      and stable properties we define as a crystal.<br>
      <br>
      A time crystal breaks time symmetry. In this particular case, the
      magnetic field and laser periodically driving the ytterbium atoms
      produce a repetition in the system at twice the period of the
      drivers, something that would not occur in a normal system.<br>
      <br>
      “Wouldn’t it be super weird if you jiggled the Jell-O and found
      that somehow it responded at a different period?” Yao said. “But
      that is the essence of the time crystal. You have some periodic
      driver that has a period ‘T’, but the system somehow synchronizes
      so that you observe the system oscillating with a period that is
      larger than ‘T’.”<br>
      <br>
      Yao worked closely with Monroe as his Maryland team made the new
      material, helping them focus on the important properties to
      measure to confirm that the material was in fact a stable or rigid
      time crystal. Yao also described how the time crystal would change
      phase, like an ice cube melting, under different magnetic fields
      and laser pulsing.<br>
      <br>
      The Harvard team, led by Mikhail Lukin, set up its time crystal
      using densely packed nitrogen vacancy centers in diamonds.<br>
      <br>
      “Such similar results achieved in two wildly disparate systems
      underscore that time crystals are a broad new phase of matter, not
      simply a curiosity relegated to small or narrowly specific
      systems,” wrote Phil Richerme, of Indiana University, in a
      perspective piece accompanying the paper published in Physical
      Review Letters. “Observation of the discrete time crystal…
      confirms that symmetry breaking can occur in essentially all
      natural realms, and clears the way to several new avenues of
      research.”<br>
      <br>
      Yao is continuing his own work on time crystals as he explores the
      theory behind other novel but not-yet-realized non-equilibrium
      materials.<br>
      <br>
      Yao’s co-authors are UC Berkeley professor of physics Ashvin
      Vishwanath,; Andrew Potter, now an assistant professor at the
      University of Texas at Austin; and UC Berkeley graduate student
      Ionut-Dragos Potirniche.<br>

      which could prove the existence of the virus in any scientific
      literature. This raises the question of what was actually injected
      into millions over the past few decades...<br>

      in African-American children following the MMR vaccine.<br>
      <br>
      Brian Hooker's research in the Translational Neurodegeneration
      Journal provides the most recent epidemiological evidence showing
      that African American males receiving the MMR vaccine prior to 24
      months of age or 36 months of age are more likely to receive an
      autism diagnosis...<br>

      German biologist Dr. Stefan Lanka initially offered 100,000 euros
      to anyone who could provide scientific evidence that the measles
      virus existed. He had initially been ordered to pay up in court
      after Doctor David Bardens attempted to claim the prize after
      providing the biologist with a study that had been published in a
      medical journal. At that time, a Judge in the regional court in
      Ravensburg, South Germany, ruled in the favour of Dr. Bardens in a
      controversial decision claiming the criteria for evidence had been
      met...<br>
      <br>
      In the trial, the results of research into so-called genetic
      fingerprints of alleged measles virus have been introduced. Two
      recognised laboratories, including the world's largest and leading
      genetic Institute, arrived at exactly the same results
      independently.The results prove that the authors of the six
      publications in the measles virus case were wrong, and as a direct
      result all measles virologists are still wrong today: They have
      misinterpreted ordinary constituents of cells as part of the
      suspected measles virus...<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      The infant mortality rate (IMR) is one of the most important
      indicators of the socio-economic well-being and public health
      conditions of a country. The US childhood immunization schedule
      specifies 26 vaccine doses for infants aged less than 1 year—the
      most in the world—yet 33 nations have lower IMRs. Using linear
      regression, the immunization schedules of these 34 nations were
      examined and a correlation coefficient of r = 0.70 (p &lt; 0.0001)
      was found between IMRs and the number of vaccine doses routinely
      given to infants. Nations were also grouped into five different
      vaccine dose ranges: 12–14, 15–17, 18–20, 21–23, and 24–26. The
      mean IMRs of all nations within each group were then calculated.
      Linear regression analysis of unweighted mean IMRs showed a high
      statistically significant correlation between increasing number of
      vaccine doses and increasing infant mortality rates, with r =
      0.992 (p = 0.0009). Using the Tukey-Kramer test, statistically
      significant differences in mean IMRs were found between nations
      giving 12–14 vaccine doses and those giving 21–23, and 24–26
      doses. A closer inspection of correlations between vaccine doses,
      biochemical or synergistic toxicity, and IMRs is essential.<br>

      Iranian researchers and scientist unveil the world's first herbal
      medicine to treat Alzheimer’s called Melitropic. <br>
      <br>
      Iranian researchers and scientists have put on display the world’s
      first ever herbal medicine to cure Alzheimer’s or stop it from
      progressing through alleviating its symptoms such as memory loss
      and confusion.<br>
      <br>
      The medicine, named Melitropic, was unveiled during a ceremony in
      Iran’s Institute of Medicinal Plants at Jihad University on
      Saturday morning.<br>
      <br>
      Iranian Health Minister Hassan Qazizadeh Hashemi, President of
      Jihad University Seyyed Hamidreza Tayyebi and a number of
      researchers were in attendance.<br>
      <br>
      The Iranian researchers reportedly drew on the country’s
      historically extensive expertise in treatment of brain disorders,
      and utilized latest related studies in the world to produce the
      herbal medicine.<br>
      <br>
      Chairman of the Institute of Medicinal Plants at Jihad University,
      Dr. Shamsali Rezazadeh, said a series of clinical experiments were
      carried out on 42 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s
      symptoms to determine the effectiveness of Melitropic.<br>
      <br>
      He added that the patients were aged 65-80. While dracocephalum
      extract was administered to those in the experiment group, the
      patients in the control group received placebos.<br>
      <br>
      Rezazadeh said forgetfulness and recognition indices plus
      potential side effects were analyzed after four months of studies;
      and the results recorded an obvious and noticeable improvement in
      the mental status of patients, who had been given dracocephalum
      extract. The anxiety disorder and irritability symptoms had
      considerably dropped among subjects in the experiment group. <br>
      <br>
      The chairman of the Institute of Medicinal Plants at Jihad
      University emphasized that certain measures have been taken into
      consideration in order to introduce Melitropic to world markets.<br>

      AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT is HURTLING towards Earth, and a Russian
      astronomer say’s it’s a fragment of Nibiru. Astronomers say that
      the mystery object dubbed as 2016 WF9 appears extremely DARK and
      unreflective. In addition to that, scientists state that the
      object has an unknown origin. But, Nibiru is just a myth,
      right?... <br>
      <br>
      The object in question is known as 2016 WF9, and it is hurtling
      towards Earth and is being tracked by NASA.<br>
      <br>
      Strangely, NASA has still no idea what the object is exactly. The
      only thing we know it will miss Earth, passing at a distance of
      nearly 32 million miles on February 25.<br>
      <br>
      However, Russian astronomer Dr. Dyomin Damir Zakharovich has said
      the space agency is wrong.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Zakharovich warns that the mystery object could collide with
      our planet on February the 16th, sparking catastrophic tsunamis
      and causing the planet’s seas to boil.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the Russian astronomer warns that the mysterious
      object comes from the rogue planet Nibiru, also called Planet X,
      on the edge of the solar system.<br>

      <br>
      Researchers have identified a metal that conducts electricity
      without conducting heat - an incredibly useful property that
      defies our current understanding of how conductors work.<br>
      <br>
      The metal contradicts something called the Wiedemann-Franz Law,
      which basically states that good conductors of electricity will
      also be proportionally good conductors of heat, which is why
      things like motors and appliances get so hot when you use them
      regularly.<br>
      <br>
      But a team in the US has shown that this isn't the case for
      metallic vanadium dioxide (VO2) - a material that's already well
      known for its strange ability to switch from a see-through
      insulator to a conductive metal at the temperature of 67 degrees
      Celsius (152 degrees Fahrenheit)... <br>
      <br>
      Surprisingly, they found that the thermal conductivity that could
      be attributed to the electrons in the material was 10 times
      smaller than that amount predicted by the Wiedemann-Franz Law.<br>
      <br>
      The reason for this appears to be the synchronised way that the
      electrons move through the material.<br>
      <br>
      "The electrons were moving in unison with each other, much like a
      fluid, instead of as individual particles like in normal metals,"
      said Wu...<br>

      </b><b>Decoupling charge and heat transport</b><br>
      <br>
      In metals, electrons carry both charge and heat. As a consequence,
      electrical conductivity and the electronic contribution to the
      thermal conductivity are typically proportional to each other. Lee
      et al. found a large violation of this so-called Wiedemann-Franz
      law near the insulator-metal transition in VO2 nanobeams. In the
      metallic phase, the electronic contribution to thermal
      conductivity was much smaller than what would be expected from the
      Wiedemann-Franz law. The results can be explained in terms of
      independent propagation of charge and heat in a strongly
      correlated system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Abstrac</b>t<br>
      <br>
      In electrically conductive solids, the Wiedemann-Franz law
      requires the electronic contribution to thermal conductivity to be
      proportional to electrical conductivity. Violations of the
      Wiedemann-Franz law are typically an indication of unconventional
      quasiparticle dynamics, such as inelastic scattering, or
      hydrodynamic collective motion of charge carriers, typically
      pronounced only at cryogenic temperatures. We report an
      order-of-magnitude breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law at high
      temperatures ranging from 240 to 340 kelvin in metallic vanadium
      dioxide in the vicinity of its metal-insulator transition.
      Different from previously established mechanisms, the unusually
      low electronic thermal conductivity is a signature of the absence
      of quasiparticles in a strongly correlated electron fluid where
      heat and charge diffuse independently.<br>

      information. <br>
      <br>
      Just now when I was updating RRW with information on finding
      resettlement offices near you, I came across this guide prepared
      by the US State Department showing refugee activists what they
      must do to make your city or town a new site.<br>

      Laurence Bartlett (DOS) with an earlier version of the
      resettlement sites map we can no longer find.<br>
      <br>
      I haven’t had time to read it carefully, but if you are in a
      pocket of resistance, or fear for your town, you better have a
      look at this...<br>

      Multiculturalism and political correctness are sucking the life
      out of western society and making us less free. We can now be
      arrested for having the wrong opinion, democracy can no longer
      change our destiny, and in turning a blind eye to the misogyny of
      Islam, we’re behaving as if the rights of women are negotiable.
      Enough is enough. Silence is no longer an option. Putting the boot
      into religion and flying the flag for free speech, Pat Condell’s
      irreverent video monologues have entertained millions around the
      world. Here they are in colourful black and white. This second
      volume of transcripts includes a 32-page introduction.<br>
