            </b>To make the following very clear, it has now been
            published that the flu shot is in fact an anti fertility
            vaccine.<br>
            Due to complete censorship, 500 trojan links, and trollage
            in the in box, I'm taking this to the max.<br>
            Anti fertility vaccines are old news now.<br>
            <br>
            " First they came for the Africans, and I did not speak up
            because I was _____. Then they came for the Mexicans and I
            was too busy to care. Then they came for the filipinos,
            Asian indians, and I had a BarBq to attend. And then I was
            sterile because they came for me at the local piggly wiggly
            pharmacy, and CNN did not say jack, and I am 35 and will
            never have kids because I waited "until later" and this damn
            shot won't wear off until my clock has completely ticked
            out.<br>
            The topic of anti fertility vaccines is so established it is
            easy to find stuff like this:<br>
            Anti fertility vaccines containing both progesterone and
            Human Chorionic Gonadotropin have been around and known
            about since the 80's, and from the beginning it was known
            that it was the WHO and the U.N. doing it. Early broad scale
            releases of these vaccines went to Iran and Latin America.
            This is a super old topic of mine, if people think "hard
            proof" was found for the first time recently in Kenya, they
            are new to the topic, this has been going on with HARD PROOF
            for THREE full decades. Take a look at this Pub Med release
            dated July 14 1987. New topic? NOT HARDLY!<br>
            <br>
            This Pub Med report dated 1987 proves the anti fertility
            vaccine is NOT just an "internet conspiracy" and has been
            around a LONG TIME.<br>
            A potential anti-pregnancy vaccine built by conjugation of
            the beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin to
            adjuvant-active muramyl peptide.<br>

            Abstract<br>
            <br>
            The beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)
            conjugated to tetanus toxoid is being investigated as a
            vaccine for human fertility control. Initial clinical trials
            indicated that the level of antibody response induced by
            such an immunogen was not always sufficient to prevent
            pregnancy. Therefore, efforts are being made to evaluate new
            carriers for the beta-subunit and to select adjuvants to
            yield a more efficient vaccine. In the present report, we
            demonstrate that conjugates of the beta-subunit of hCG with
            muramyl dipeptide (MDP), or its nonpyrogenic derivative
            murabutide, may have potential as an effective antipregnancy
            vaccine. The copolymer of beta hCG and MDP administered with
            Al(OH)3 to mice induced a high anti-beta hCG response,
            better than that induced by the conjugate of beta hCG to
            tetanus toxoid given with Al(OH)3. Moreover, the antibodies
            induced by such an immunogen were competent for neutralizing
            the biological activity of hCG in vivo. Even more
            interesting, a copolymer of beta hCG and of murabutide
            induced high levels of biologically active antibodies. This
            immunogen may represent a promising candidate for the
            development of an efficient vaccine for human fertility
            control.<br>
            <br>
            Here are more PubMed links. I'll find a few of these before
            continuing on to how such vaccines were used to sterilize
            women via vaccination campaigns that never said what they
            were really for.<br>
            DNA used to enhance sterility after vaccination<br>
            Another reference to anti fertility vaccines<br>
            This link talks about various methods of inducing sterility
            via vaccination<br>
            This link proves an 80 percent effective anti fertility
            vaccine was developed before 2011.<br>
            This link proves women who have been nailed by one of these
            vaccines won't notice a thing.<br>
            Here is a cute anti fertility vaccine proposal that uses a
            unique mechanism of action.<br>
            HERE IS A GOOD ONE - THIS IS WHAT THE FLU SHOT USES (read
            the flu shot abstract in the main report below and figure it
            out,) this is a connection you have to draw by yourself
            because they sure as * are not going to tell it to you
            straight up.<br>
            <br>
            HERE IS ANOTHER GREAT ONE, dated 2004 - "The possibility of
            using a subunit or fragment of human chorionic gonadotropin
            (hCG) as an immunogen for birth control has been actively
            explored for many years. This proves it was an old topic in
            2004!<br>
            Here is the original study, that proves they had success
            with anti fertility vaccines in 1976.<br>
            This is the basis of the tetanus vaccine they used to
            sterilize many third world women. The current flu shot
            sterilization methods are far more advanced, and were
            developed in 2005 (see links above).<br>
            Here is the abstract for the original effort, dated 1976<b><br>
              Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1976 Jan;73(1):218-22.<br>
              Isoimmunization against human chorionic gonadotropin with
              conjugates of processed beta-subunit of the hormone and
              tetanus toxoid. Talwar GP, Sharma NC, Dubey SK, Salahuddin
              M, Das C, Ramakrishnan S, Kumar S, Hingorani V.<br>
              Abstract -- </b>The immunogenicity of the conjugate
            prepared from "processed" beta-subunit of human chorionic
            gonadotropin (choriogonadotropin, HCG) and tetanus toxoid
            has been studied in animals and a human subject. The
            conjugate elicited the formation of high-affinity (Ka =
            10(9)-10(11) M-1) anti-HCG and anti-tetanus antibodies. On
            primary immunization, the antibody, response lasted for
            several months. Repeat injection of the conjugate in the
            declining phase of antibody titers produced a booster
            response without a lag period. The antibodies reacted with
            the beta-subunit of HCG and the complete HCG molecule but
            were devois of significant crossreactivity with human growth
            hormone, placental lactogen, follicle-stimulating hormone,
            thyroid-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone at
            tonic and surge levels. The antibodies were competent for
            neutralizing the biological activity of HCG in the mouse
            uterine weight gain assay, the ventral prostate weight gain
            assay, and the radioligand assay for binding of 125I-labeled
            HCG to receptors on corpus luteum. HCG (5000 international
            units) administered to an immunized subject was completely
            bound by circulating antibodies. Administration of HCG (in
            contrast to conjugate) was without booster effect on
            anti-HCG titers.<b><br>
              <br>
            </b>My comment: This is the vaccine that was used to
            sterilize third world women. To give it maximum
            effectiveness, three shots were given (above it says only
            one, without the boosters, wore off after "several months"
            but booster shots made it last longer - history has proven
            out the boosters caused it to sterilize women for 15 years.<br>
            <br>
            I know we have these perverts BUSTED with this, they are
            using the flu shot to sterilize American women now. Why keep
            this tech in the third world? They have proven they can get
            away with nailing American women with this too, (thanks to a
            scamming MSM that won't report it, so why not! The following
            covers this VERY WELL.<br>
            IT CANNOT GET ANY SIMPLER THAN THIS:<br>
            <b><br>
            </b>The natural miscarriage rate is between 13 and 14
            percent every year. This is confirmed outside of this study.
            No matter how anyone trolls this (and it is getting heavily
            trolled everywhere, even when others post about the same
            topic the same way I did without reposting what is here, I
            mean separate independent reports,) the 7.7 number
            represents a 77 percent miscarriage rate after two
            subsequent flu shots.<br>
            <br>
            After the first flu shot, the miscarriage rate jumps to 37
            percent, after the second it jumps to 77 percent which
            proves the flu shot is in fact an anti fertility vaccine,
            and anti fertility vaccines need more than one dose to
            become highly effective. They are always administered as an
            initial dose and two or more subsequent boosters. This
            correlation of increase between subsequent flu shots fits
            the profile exactly for historic incidents of administration
            of clandestine anti fertility shots in nations other than
            America.<br>
            <br>
            There is no difference between the flu shot given in America
            which is now a proven veiled anti fertility vaccine, and the
            tetanus shots which were also revealed as anti fertility
            vaccines administered to women in the Phillipines, Africa,
            and Mexico. It is the same old story in America now, and the
            new vector the elite are using is the flu shot. Folks, it
            can't get any simpler than this, READ IT AND BE AWARE:<b><br>
              <br>
            </b>Vaccine eugenics trolls are ALL OVER THIS. They have to
            protect their weapon from the light of public scrutiny at
            all cost, clearly they expected this report to stay buried
            deep on page 49,355 and never expected it to see the light
            of day. On top of it, the report was done by pro vaxxers who
            for whatever reason produced the real numbers and then
            ignored them, instead burying them under unbelievably wide
            error margins. It stayed buried for five years until someone
            shed light on it.<br>
            <br>
            MAJOR REPORT: FLU VACCINE PROVEN TO BE IN FACT AN ANTI
            FERTILITY VACCINE BY MAJOR VERIFIED SCIENTIFIC GROUP<br>
            Two subsequent years of receiving the flu vaccine boosts
            miscarriage rates from a baseline of 14 percent to 77%<br>
            Pay no attention to how they whitewash this, because they
            actually gave the real numbers, which speak for themselves.<br>
            <br>
            More than just the abstract was hidden behind a paywall, but
            the abstract had all the key info!<br>
            <br>
            The abstract proves that every time you get the flu shot
            after the first shot, it is only a booster shot to make the
            anti fertility component work even better. This study only
            shows what happens after two subsequent years of getting the
            shot.<br>
            <br>
            FINAL OUTCOME: Normal miscarriage rates are 14 percent after
            pregnancy is confirmed (when you are not calling induced
            abortions miscarriages.) After ONE flu shot, a woman's
            chance of miscarriage increases to 37 percent. If the next
            year she gets another flu shot (which is obviously an anti
            fertility vaccine booster shot), her chances of miscarriage
            increase to 77 percent. The study did not go to the third
            year of getting the flu shot.<b><br>

            </b>IMPORTANT NOTE: If you use planned parenthood's numbers
            which are greatly overstated and plug them into the numbers
            in this abstract, the miscarriage rate would have to be over
            200 percent (which we all know is not possible) because
            Planned Parenthood calls induced abortions miscarriages.
            Planned Parenthood has successfully polluted the infosphere
            almost entirely with their B.S., but the study used the
            actual real miscarriage stats, which I confirmed with a
            little work. So if you decide to try to verify this, make
            sure you use clean numbers because planned parenthood has
            wrecked almost all data sources with fraudulent miscarriage
            stats.<br>

              Abstract<br>
              <br>
            </b>Inactivated influenza vaccine is recommended in any
            stage of pregnancy, but evidence of safety in early
            pregnancy is limited, including for vaccines containing
            A/H1N1pdm2009 (pH1N1) antigen. We sought to determine if
            receipt of vaccine containing pH1N1 was associated with
            spontaneous abortion (SAB).<br>
            <b><br>
            </b>My comment - the bolded text means that this was a study
            to see if the flu vaccine really was an anti fertility
            vaccine, hence the phrase "spontaneous abortion methods".
            This proves they had a reason to be suspicious, because they
            only did this study to see if the flu vaccine was an anti
            fertility vaccine, which causes spontaeous abortions.<br>
            <b><br>
              Methods<br>
              <br>
            </b>We conducted a case-control study over two influenza
            seasons (2010-11, 2011-12) in the Vaccine Safety Datalink.
            Cases had spontaneous abortion and controls had live births
            or stillbirths and were matched on site, date of last
            menstrual period, and age. Of 919 potential cases identified
            using diagnosis codes, 485 were eligible and confirmed by
            medical record review. Exposure was defined as vaccination
            with inactivated influenza vaccine before the SAB date; the
            primary exposure window was the 1-28 days before the SAB.<br>
            <br>
            My comment - This paragraph establishes the legitimacy of
            the test, by stating the test conditions.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Results<br>
              <br>
            </b>The overall adjusted odds ratio (aOR) was 2.0 (95% CI,
            1.1-3.6) for vaccine receipt in the 28-day exposure window;
            there was no association in other exposure windows. In
            season-specific analyses, the aOR in the 1-28 days was 3.7
            (95% CI 1.4-9.4) in 2010-11 and 1.4 (95% CI 0.6-3.3) in
            2011-12. The association was modified by influenza
            vaccination in the prior season (post hoc analysis). Among
            women who received pH1N1-containing vaccine in the previous
            influenza season, the aOR in the 1-28 days was 7.7 (95% CI
            2.2-27.3); the aOR was 1.3 (95% CI 0.7-2.7) among women not
            vaccinated in the previous season. This effect modification
            was observed in each season.<br>
            <br>
            My comment: The above states the ratios of what happened
            between unvaccinated women and vaccinated women, with the
            maximum possible error swings also stated. The error swings
            are reported in a way that is way out of whack to leave near
            mentally deranged margins of error. In this case the margin
            allowed was 2.0, when the normal rate of miscarriage was
            1.4, which represents a margin of error that allows a result
            more than double normal miscarriage rates to simply be
            called "error" to help conceal how bad the damage from the
            vaccines was. This fails because the damage was too much to
            bury even with that huge error swing allowed.<br>
            <br>
            The first numbers outside of quotes - 3.7 followed by 1.4,
            shows 3.7 as the rate of miscarriage after vaccination in
            the first year (before their "error margins" were applied,
            and 1.4 as the baseline miscarriage rate (which is 14
            percent) in unvaccinated women for the same year. For the
            second subsequent year of women getting the flu shot, the
            rate of miscarriage in vaccinated women was 7.7, and the
            rate of miscarriage in unvaccinated women was 1.3 (13
            percent) due to small yearly variations in natural
            miscarriage rates<br>
            <b><br>
              Conclusion<br>
              <br>
            </b>Spontaneous abortion was associated with influenza
            vaccination in the preceding 28 days. The association was
            significant only among women vaccinated in the previous
            influenza season with pH1N1-containing vaccine. This study
            does not and cannot establish a causal relationship between
            repeated influenza vaccination and spontaneous abortion, but
            further research is warranted<br>
            <br>
            My comment: It is clear they tried to lie here by leaving
            margin of errors so high that they buried the first year
            stats, but in the second year the damage was so much they
            could not hide it, no matter how they fudged the data. After
            showing an increase in miscarriage from 14 percent to 77
            percent, they then say it is no big deal and can be ignored
            until further research proves the vaccine is actually a
            veiled anti fertility vaccine. But the numbers more than
            obviously speak for themselves.<br>
            <br>
            This abstract was discovered by GreenMedInfo.com. Their
            report is very different from mine, because I saw what they
            were talking about, and then re-did all the confirmation my
            own way, in much easier to understand terms.<br>
            <br>
            The problem with their report, (even though they stated the
            same thing in a different way) is that if anyone tries to
            confirm what they said, and then gets mired in a pool of
            Planned parenthood fact rigging bullshit which dominates the
            infosphere, they won't make any sense of the abstract
            because inserting planned parenthood's numbers into it would
            put the miscarriage rate after two years of flu vaccination
            at over 200 percent, and almost every source out there is
            using planned parenthood's numbers.<br>
            <br>
            But Greenmedinfo found this buried abstract to begin with
            and should be commended for that, and may have made the
            mistake of not clearing up the issue of planned parenthood
            fact rigging because they know planned parenthood has
            obscured the real miscarriage stats badly and as a result
            never got ensnared by them and then had to filter fact from
            bullshit. You can read their report HERE Their report is
            well worth reading also, because it goes into the politics
            of the issue, and my report was a basic fact check.<br>
            <b><br>
            </b>SO MY FINAL NUMBERS: The flu vaccine, after two
            subsequent years, boosts the miscarriage rate to 77 percent,
            which is a 592 percent increase over normal. Green Med Info
            came up with a final answer of a 640 percent increase. The
            difference is negligible. Two decent sites looked at the
            same abstract and reached the same conclusion. OBVIOUS
            ANSWER: There is no way the flu vaccine is anything but an
            anti fertility vaccine, and I'd bet the kids who do get
            through pregnancy after their mom takes the jab have a
            hugely higher autism stat.<br>

            <b>&nbsp;<br>
            </b>The predominant focus in the neurobiological study of
            memory has been on remembering (persistence). However,
            recent studies have considered the neurobiology of
            forgetting (transience). Here we draw parallels between
            neurobiological and computational mechanisms underlying
            transience. We propose that it is the interaction between
            persistence and transience that allows for intelligent
            decision-making in dynamic, noisy environments.
            Specifically, we argue that transience (1) enhances
            flexibility, by reducing the influence of outdated
            information on memory-guided decision-making, and (2)
            prevents overfitting to specific past events, thereby
            promoting generalization. According to this view, the goal
            of memory is not the transmission of information through
            time, per se. Rather, the goal of memory is to optimize
            decision-making. As such, transience is as important as
            persistence in mnemonic systems.<br>

            <b><br>
            </b>It’s time for forgetting to get some respect, says Ben
            Storm, author of a new article on memory in Current
            Directions in Psychological Science, a journal of the
            Association for Psychological Science. “We need to rethink
            how we’re talking about forgetting and realize that under
            some conditions it actually does play an important role in
            the function of memory,” says Storm, who is a professor at
            the University of Illinois at Chicago.<br>
            <br>
            “Memory is difficult. Thinking is difficult,” Storm says.
            Memories and associations accumulate rapidly. “These things
            could completely overrun our life and make it impossible to
            learn and retrieve new things if they were left alone, and
            could just overpower the rest of memory,” he says.<br>
            <br>
            But, fortunately, that isn’t what happens. “We’re able to
            get around these strong competing inappropriate memories to
            remember the ones we want to recall.” Storm and other
            psychological scientists are trying to understand how our
            minds select the right things to recall—if someone’s talking
            about beaches near Omaha, Nebraska, for example, you will
            naturally suppress any knowledge you’ve collected about
            Omaha Beach in Normandy.<br>
            <br>
            In one kind of experiment, participants are given a list of
            words that have some sort of relation to each other. They
            might be asked to memorize a list of birds, for example. In
            the next part of the test, they have to do a task that
            requires remembering half the birds. “That’s going to make
            you forget the other half of the birds in that list,” Storm
            says. That might seem bad—it’s forgetting. “But what the
            research shows is that this forgetting is actually a good
            thing.”<br>
            <br>
            People who are good at forgetting information they don’t
            need are also good at problem solving and at remembering
            something when they’re being distracted with other
            information. This shows that forgetting plays an important
            role in problem solving and memory, Storm says.<br>
            <br>
            There are plenty of times when forgetting makes sense in
            daily life. “Say you get a new cell phone and you have to
            get a new phone number, do you really want to remember your
            old phone number every time someone asks what your number
            is?” Storm asks. Or where you parked your car this
            morning—it’s important information today, but you’d better
            forget it when it comes time to go get your car for tomorrow
            afternoon’s commute. “We need to be able to update our
            memory so we can remember and think about the things that
            are currently relevant.” <br>

            <b><br>
            </b>Our brains not only contain learning mechanisms but also
            forgetting mechanisms that erase “unnecessary” learning. A
            research group at Lund University in Sweden has now been
            able to describe one of these mechanisms at the cellular
            level.<br>
            <br>
            The results explain a theoretical learning phenomenon which
            has so far been difficult to understand.<br>
            <br>
            The premise is that human or animal subjects can learn to
            associate a certain tone or light signal with a puff of air
            to the eye. The air puff makes the subject blink, and
            eventually they blink as soon as they hear the tone or see
            the light signal.<br>
            <br>
            The strange thing, however, is that if the tone and the
            light are presented together (and with the air puff), the
            learning does not improve, but gets worse.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Two stimuli therfore achieve worse
            results than just one. It seems contrary to common sense,
            but we believe that the reason for it is that the brain
            wants to save energy”, says brain researcher and professor
            Germund Hesslow.<b><br>
              <br>
              Can You Please Be Quiet, Please<br>
              <br>
            </b>His colleague Anders Rasmussen, who performed the
            present study, has previously shown that when the brain has
            learnt a particular association sufficiently, certain
            neurons that act as a brake on the learning mechanism, are
            activated.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “You could say that the part of the brain
            that learned the association (a part of the brain called the
            cerebellum) is telling its ‘teacher’: ‘I know this now,
            please be quiet’. When the brain has learnt two
            associations, the brake becomes much more powerful. That is
            why it results in forgetting, usually only temporarily,
            however”, explains Germund Hesslow.<br>
            <br>
            Maintaining unnecessary association pathways requires energy
            for the brain. The researchers believe that this is the
            reason for the brake mechanism – even though in this case it
            happened to be a little too powerful.<br>
            <br>
            The Lund researchers were able to describe how the nerve
            cells learn and forget through studies of animals, but
            believe that the mechanisms are likely to be the same in the
            human brain. Therefore, these findings are of fundamental
            interest for both brain researchers and psychologists. They
            could also be of practical interest to educators.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Obviously, it should be important for
            teachers to know the mechanisms by which the brain erases
            the things it considers unnecessary. You do not want to
            accidentally activate these mechanisms”, says Germund
            Hesslow.<b><br>

            </b>Fast essential transcription: For me it is quite easy to
            think in higher dimensioanl realms… For me it is quite easy
            to imagine higher dimensional biology, trans-dimensional
            beings and what I observed out of this point of view when I
            looked at Morgellons disease…it looks like a high
            dimensional being abusing humans to reproduce his own
            species and before these pseudo-morphic fruiting bodies
            leave the body, they extract enough biophotons from the
            forehead to ascend to a parallel dimension, from then on
            there are invisible, but they are still within the body and
            this now is pure science, this is what we found in the lab,
            This is what can be explained with the higher dimensional
            theories, but it also refers to mythology. If you have an
            invisible creature crawling through your body, trying to
            access your energetic system, this is very close to what one
            might call a demon or an archon and if you look at the
            descriptions of the archons, from 2500 years ago..the
            description of the biology is identical of what the
            morgellon victim was painting… It is described that they
            live as light parasites and this is basically what the
            entire black magic tradition is about..Black Magician means
            to communicate with those Archons and offering them access
            to your physical light system, feeding them with the
            biophotons, feeding them with life force and in exchange
            they offer power, power over other human beings..This is
            what Black Magic Ritual is about, so we are starting to get
            a picture and if you look at the political entities, who
            might be responsible to introduce morgellons into the air...<br>

                  event could happen by 2100 – study</b></font><br>
            </div>
            <b><br>
            </b>Over the past 540 million years Earth has suffered five
            mass extinction events, the worst of which wiped out more
            than 9 per cent of marine life on the planet. A new study
            has suggested that the next such catastrophe might not be
            too far away.<br>
            <br>
            Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) geophysicist and
            mathematician, Daniel Rothman has been busy studying
            previous mass extinctions. He reckons the next one might be
            a mere 83 years away.<br>
            <br>
            The previous five catastrophic events each unfolded over
            millions of years and involved the natural cycle of carbon
            through the oceans and atmosphere being disturbed,
            resulting, in some cases, the death of almost all life on
            Earth.<br>
            <br>
            The award-winning mathematician identified two “thresholds
            of catastrophe” that, if exceeded, would upset the natural
            order of the cycle, leading to an unstable environment and
            eventually a mass extinction.<br>
            <br>
            The first relates to changes in the carbon cycle over a
            period of thousands or millions of years. A mass extinction
            will occur if the rate of change in the cycle occurs faster
            than global ecosystems can adapt.<br>
            <br>
            The second pertains to the size or magnitude of the carbon
            flux over a shorter period, as has been the case over the
            last century.<br>
            <br>
            Therein lies a problem, however, as Rothman says: “How can
            you really compare these great events in the geologic past,
            which occur over such vast timescales, to what's going on
            today, which is centuries at the longest?”<br>
            <br>
            “So I sat down one summer day and tried to think about how
            one might go about this systematically.”<br>
            <br>
            He set about searching through hundreds of geochemistry
            papers trying to find an answer, classifying the events as
            either long or short in duration. Throughout his studies,
            Rothman identified 31 instances over the past 542 million
            years in which a major change occurred in the carbon cycle.<br>
            <br>
            Following this, he devised a mathematical formula to
            determine the total mass of carbon added to the oceans
            during each event, after which “it became evident that there
            was a characteristic rate of change that the system
            basically didn't like to go past.”<br>
            <br>
            Rothman estimates this to be 310 gigatons. He thinks that
            given the rise of carbon dioxide over the last century, a
            sixth mass extinction could be on the way as estimates
            suggest that humans will add roughly 310 gigatons to the
            cycle by 2100.<br>
            <br>
            “This is not saying that disaster occurs the next day,”
            Rothman said. “It’s saying that, if left unchecked, the
            carbon cycle would move into a realm which would be no
            longer stable, and would behave in a way that would be
            difficult to predict. In the geologic past, this type of
            behavior is associated with mass extinction.”<b><br>

            <b><br>
              Abstract </b>-- The history of the Earth system is a
            story of change. Some changes are gradual and benign, but
            others, especially those associated with catastrophic mass
            extinction, are relatively abrupt and destructive. What sets
            one group apart from the other? Here, I hypothesize that
            perturbations of Earth’s carbon cycle lead to mass
            extinction if they exceed either a critical rate at long
            time scales or a critical size at short time scales. By
            analyzing 31 carbon isotopic events during the past 542
            million years, I identify the critical rate with a limit
            imposed by mass conservation. Identification of the
            crossover time scale separating fast from slow events then
            yields the critical size. The modern critical size for the
            marine carbon cycle is roughly similar to the mass of carbon
            that human activities will likely have added to the oceans
            by the year 2100.<br>

            <b><br>
            </b>A new environmental study, performed by State University
            of New York and the University of Minnesota, says there are
            microscopic fibers of plastic in our water systems and we
            ingest them with every sip. Yuck.<br>
            <br>
            Officials with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
            knew about poisonous lead in the tap water in Flint,
            Michigan, as early as April, and did nothing about it.<br>
            <br>
            <b>3,000 US Cities Have Worse Water Contamination than
              Flint, Michigan</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            According to a report by the Sacramento Bee, the researchers
            examined 159 water samples from many nations across five
            continents, and found that 83 percent of the samples
            contained plastic fibers. In the US, 94 percent of samples
            were found to contain the nasty fibers.<br>
            <br>
            The US samples were reportedly taken from several important
            locations, including the US Congressional buildings in
            Washington, DC; Trump Tower in New York; and ironically, the
            Environmental Protection Agency's headquarters, also in
            Washington.<br>
            <br>
            Scientists claim that these plastic fibers may also contain
            toxic chemicals that are released into your system as they
            are digested. The smallest particles, deemed
            "nanoparticles," would also be able to penetrate your body's
            cells and cause internal damage, the scientists claim.<br>
            <br>
            "If the fibers are there, it is possible that the
            nanoparticles are there too that we can't measure," Anne
            Marie Mahon, from the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology,
            told the Guardian. "Once they are in the nanometer range
            they can really penetrate a cell and that means they can
            penetrate organs, and that would be worrying."<br>
            <br>
            As to where these particles are coming from, scientists
            can't really tell. One possible explanation says the fibers
            come from synthetic materials in our clothes, as washing
            machines reportedly flush about 700,000 fibers into the
            environment, according to one study by Plymouth University
            in the United Kingdom.<br>
            <br>
            This is the first global water tap survey ever performed, so
            the scientists emphasize there is still a lot of research to
            be done on the topic.<br>
            <br>
            "The results of this study serve as an initial glimpse at
            the consequences of human plastic use [and] disposal rather
            than a comprehensive assessment of global plastic
            contamination," says Mary Kosuth, one of the University of
            Minnesota researchers. "These results call for further
            testing within and between regions."<br>

                  Invent 'Pen' Which Can Detect Cancer in 10 Seconds</b></font><br>
            </div>
            <b><br>
            </b>Scientists at the University of Texas have come up with
            a quick and unique way of helping cancer surgeons know much
            tissue to remove from a patient.<br>
            <br>
            A handheld device which can identify cancerous tissue in 10
            seconds has been created by scientists at the University of
            Texas.<br>
            <br>
            Tests, published in Science Translational Medicine, suggest
            the technology is accurate 96 percent of the time.<br>
            <br>
            The inventors of the MasSpec Pen say it could be used during
            surgery to make sure that all of a tumor has been removed
            and would avoid the "heartbreak" of leaving cancer in place,
            where it could potentially start growing again.<br>
            <b><br>
              How It Works<br>
              <br>
            </b>The pen works by dripping water onto tissue and then
            sucking the droplet back into the device. <br>
            <br>
            It is then inserted into a mass spectrometer, which can
            measure the mass of thousands of chemicals every second.<br>
            <br>
            The scientists at the University of Texas say they are able
            to produce a chemical footprint within seconds to confirm
            whether or not the tissue is cancerous.<br>
            <br>
            Surgeons operating on tumors currently have to make a
            judgement when trying to delete a tumor.<br>
            <br>

              Abstract --&nbsp; </b>Echolocation is the ability to use
            sound-echoes to infer spatial information about the
            environment. Some blind people have developed extraordinary
            proficiency in echolocation using mouth-clicks. The first
            step of human biosonar is the transmission (mouth click) and
            subsequent reception of the resultant sound through the ear.
            Existing head-related transfer function (HRTF) data bases
            provide descriptions of reception of the resultant sound.
            For the current report, we collected a large database of
            click emissions with three blind people expertly trained in
            echolocation, which allowed us to perform unprecedented
            analyses. Specifically, the current report provides the
            first ever description of the spatial distribution (i.e.
            beam pattern) of human expert echolocation transmissions, as
            well as spectro-temporal descriptions at a level of detail
            not available before. Our data show that transmission levels
            are fairly constant within a 60° cone emanating from the
            mouth, but levels drop gradually at further angles, more
            than for speech. In terms of spectro-temporal features, our
            data show that emissions are consistently very brief (~3ms
            duration) with peak frequencies 2-4kHz, but with energy also
            at 10kHz. This differs from previous reports of durations
            3-15ms and peak frequencies 2-8kHz, which were based on less
            detailed measurements. Based on our measurements we propose
            to model transmissions as sum of monotones modulated by a
            decaying exponential, with angular attenuation by a modified
            cardioid. We provide model parameters for each echolocator.
            These results are a step towards developing computational
            models of human biosonar. For example, in bats, spatial and
            spectro-temporal features of emissions have been used to
            derive and test model based hypotheses about behaviour. The
            data we present here suggest similar research opportunities
            within the context of human echolocation. Relatedly, the
            data are a basis to develop synthetic models of human
            echolocation that could be virtual (i.e. simulated) or real
            (i.e. loudspeaker, microphones), and which will help
            understanding the link between physical principles and human
            behaviour.<br>

                  without electricity</b></font><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            Scientists cooled water without electricity by sending
            excess heat where it won't be noticed -- space. The
            specialized optical surfaces they developed are a major step
            toward applying this technology to air conditioning and
            refrigeration. <br>
            <br>
            It looks like a regular roof, but the top of the Packard
            Electrical Engineering Building at Stanford University has
            been the setting of many milestones in the development of an
            innovative cooling technology that could someday be part of
            our everyday lives. Since 2013, Shanhui Fan, professor of
            electrical engineering, and his students and research
            associates have employed this roof as a testbed for a
            high-tech mirror-like optical surface that could be the
            future of lower-energy air conditioning and refrigeration.<b><br>
              <br>
            </b>Research published in 2014 first showed the cooling
            capabilities of the optical surface on its own. Now, Fan and
            former research associates Aaswath Raman and Eli Goldstein,
            have shown that a system involving these surfaces can cool
            flowing water to a temperature below that of the surrounding
            air. The entire cooling process is done without electricity.<br>
            <br>
            "This research builds on our previous work with radiative
            sky cooling but takes it to the next level. It provides for
            the first time a high-fidelity technology demonstration of
            how you can use radiative sky cooling to passively cool a
            fluid and, in doing so, connect it with cooling systems to
            save electricity," said Raman, who is co-lead author of the
            paper detailing this research, published in Nature Energy
            Sept. 4.<br>
            <br>
            Together, Fan, Goldstein and Raman have founded the company
            SkyCool Systems, which is working on further testing and
            commercializing this technology.<b><br>
              <br>
              Sending our heat to space<br>
            </b><br>
            Radiative sky cooling is a natural process that everyone and
            everything does, resulting from the moments of molecules
            releasing heat. You can witness it for yourself in the heat
            that comes off a road as it cools after sunset. This
            phenomenon is particularly noticeable on a cloudless night
            because, without clouds, the heat we and everything around
            us radiates can more easily make it through Earth's
            atmosphere, all the way to the vast, cold reaches of space.<br>
            <br>
            "If you have something that is very cold -- like space --
            and you can dissipate heat into it, then you can do cooling
            without any electricity or work. The heat just flows,"
            explained Fan, who is senior author of the paper. "For this
            reason, the amount of heat flow off Earth that goes to the
            universe is enormous."<br>
            advertisement<br>
            <br>
            Although our own bodies release heat through radiative
            cooling to both the sky and our surroundings, we all know
            that on a hot, sunny day, radiative sky cooling isn't going
            to live up to its name. This is because the sunlight will
            warm you more than radiative sky cooling will cool you. To
            overcome this problem, the team's surface uses a multilayer
            optical film that reflects about 97 percent of the sunlight
            while simultaneously being able to emit the surface's
            thermal energy through the atmosphere. Without heat from
            sunlight, the radiative sky cooling effect can enable
            cooling below the air temperature even on a sunny day.<br>
            <br>
            "With this technology, we're no longer limited by what the
            air temperature is, we're limited by something much colder:
            the sky and space," said Goldstein, co-lead author of the
            paper.<br>
            <br>
            The experiments published in 2014 were performed using small
            wafers of a multilayer optical surface, about 8 inches in
            diameter, and only showed how the surface itself cooled.
            Naturally, the next step was to scale up the technology and
            see how it works as part of a larger cooling system.<b><br>
              <br>
              Putting radiative sky cooling to work<br>
            </b><br>
            For their latest paper, the researchers created a system
            where panels covered in the specialized optical surfaces sat
            atop pipes of running water and tested it on the roof of the
            Packard Building in September 2015. These panels were
            slightly more than 2 feet in length on each side and the
            researchers ran as many as four at a time. With the water
            moving at a relatively fast rate, they found the panels were
            able to consistently reduce the temperature of the water 3
            to 5 degrees Celsius below ambient air temperature over a
            period of three days.<br>
            <br>
            The researchers also applied data from this experiment to a
            simulation where their panels covered the roof of a
            two-story commercial office building in Las Vegas -- a hot,
            dry location where their panels would work best -- and
            contributed to its cooling system. They calculated how much
            electricity they could save if, in place of a conventional
            air-cooled chiller, they used vapor-compression system with
            a condenser cooled by their panels. They found that, in the
            summer months, the panel-cooled system would save 14.3
            megawatt-hours of electricity, a 21 percent reduction in the
            electricity used to cool the building. Over the entire
            period, the daily electricity savings fluctuated from 18
            percent to 50 percent.<b><br>
              <br>
              The future is now<br>
              <br>
            </b>Right now, SkyCool Systems is measuring the energy saved
            when panels are integrated with traditional air conditioning
            and refrigeration systems at a test facility, and Fan,
            Goldstein and Raman are optimistic that this technology will
            find broad applicability in the years to come. The
            researchers are focused on making their panels integrate
            easily with standard air conditioning and refrigeration
            systems and they are particularly excited at the prospect of
            applying their technology to the serious task of cooling
            data centers.<br>
            <br>
            Fan has also carried out research on various other aspects
            of radiative cooling technology. He and Raman have applied
            the concept of radiative sky cooling to the creation of an
            efficiency-boosting coating for solar cells. With Yi Cui, a
            professor of materials science and engineering at Stanford
            and of photon science at SLAC National Accelerator
            Laboratory, Fan developed a cooling fabric.<br>
            <br>
            "It's very intriguing to think about the universe as such an
            immense resource for cooling and all the many interesting,
            creative ideas that one could come up with to take advantage
            of this," he said.<b><br>

              Abstract -</b>- Cooling systems consume 15% of electricity
            generated globally and account for 10% of global greenhouse
            gas emissions. With demand for cooling expected to grow
            tenfold by 2050, improving the efficiency of cooling systems
            is a critical part of the twenty-first-century energy
            challenge. Building upon recent demonstrations of daytime
            radiative sky cooling, here we demonstrate fluid cooling
            panels that harness radiative sky cooling to cool fluids
            below the air temperature with zero evaporative losses, and
            use almost no electricity. Over three days of testing, we
            show that the panels cool water up to 5?°C below the ambient
            air temperature at water flow rates of 0.2?l?min-1?m-2,
            corresponding to an effective heat rejection flux of up to
            70?W?m-2. We further show through modelling that, when
            integrated on the condenser side of the cooling system of a
            two-storey office building in a hot dry climate (Las Vegas,
            USA), electricity consumption for cooling during the summer
            could be reduced by 21% (14.3?MWh).<b><br>

            Magnesium batteries offer promise for safely powering modern
            life -- unlike traditional lithium ion batteries, they are
            not flammable or subject to exploding -- but their ability
            to store energy has been limited.<br>

            Researchers reported Aug. 24 in the journal Nature
            Communications the discovery of a new design for the battery
            cathode, drastically increasing the storage capacity and
            upending conventional wisdom that the magnesium-chloride
            bond must be broken before inserting magnesium into the
            host.<br>
            <br>
            "We are combining a nanostructured cathode and a new
            understanding of the magnesium electrolyte," said Yan Yao,
            associate professor of electrical and computer engineering
            at the University of Houston and lead author on the paper.
            "That's new."<br>
            <br>
            The work was first conceived by Yao and postdoctoral fellow
            Hyun Deog Yoo in 2014; the project spanned several years and
            involved scientists from three universities and three
            national laboratories, working both experimentally and
            theoretically.<br>
            <br>
            "Magnesium ion is known to be hard to insert into a host,"
            said Yoo, first author on the paper. "First of all, it is
            very difficult to break magnesium-chloride bonds. More than
            that, magnesium ions produced in that way move extremely
            slowly in the host. That altogether lowers the battery's
            efficiency."<br>
            <br>
            The new battery stores energy by inserting magnesium
            monochloride into a host, such as titanium disulfide. By
            retaining the magnesium-chloride bond, Yao said, the cathode
            demonstrated much faster diffusion than traditional
            magnesium versions.<br>
            <br>
            The researchers report the new battery has storage capacity
            of 400 mAh/g, compared with 100 mAh/g for earlier magnesium
            batteries. Commercial lithium ion batteries have a cathode
            capacity of about 200 mAh/g, said Yao, who is also a
            principal investigator with the Texas Center for
            Superconductivity at UH.<br>
            <br>
            Voltage of the new battery remains low at about one volt.
            That compares to three to four volts for lithium batteries.<br>
            <br>
            The high voltage, coupled with their high energy density,
            has made lithium ion batteries the standard. But lithium is
            expensive and can develop breaches in its internal
            structure, a condition known as dendrite growths, which can
            cause the batteries to catch fire. As an earth-abundant
            resource, magnesium is cheaper and does not form dendrites.
            Until now, however, it has been held back by the need for a
            better cathode -- the electrode from which the current flows
            -- and more efficient electrolytes, the medium through which
            the ionic charge flows between cathode and anode.<b><br>
              <br>
              This work suggests a solution<br>
              <br>
            </b>The key, Yoo said, is to expand the titanium disulfide
            to allow magnesium chloride to be inserted -- a four-step
            process called intercalation -- rather than breaking the
            magnesium-chloride bonds and inserting the magnesium alone.
            Retaining the magnesium-chloride bond doubled the charge the
            cathode could store.<br>
            <br>
            The magnesium monochloride molecules are too large to be
            inserted into the titanium disulfide using conventional
            methods. Building upon their earlier work, the researchers
            created an open nanostructure by expanding the gaps in the
            titanium disulfide by 300 percent, using organic "pillars."<br>
            <br>
            The opening still was small, increased from 0.57 nanometers
            to 1.8 nanometers, but Yao said that allowed for the
            magnesium chloride to be inserted.<br>
            <br>
            "Combined theoretical modeling, spectroscopic analysis, and
            electrochemical study reveal fast diffusion kinetics of
            magnesium monochloride cations without scission of magnesium
            chloride bond," the researchers wrote. ." .. The large
            capacity accompanies excellent rate and cycling performances
            even at room temperature, opening up possibilities for a
            variety of effective intercalation hosts for multivalent-ion
            batteries."<br>
            <br>
            "We hope this is a general strategy," Yoo said. "Inserting
            various polyatomic ions in higher voltage hosts, we
            eventually aim to create higher-energy batteries at a lower
            price, especially for electric vehicles."<b><br>

            heavy water, predicts Dr. James E. Kendall, head of the
            chemistry department at Edinburgh University, in Scotland.
            Heavy water, containing the heavy hydrogen atom, has the
            same effect on the body as lowering its temperature without
            actually doing so. It would slow functional processes,
            reducing bodily wear and tear without appreciably impairing
            man's faculties. Dr. Kendall believes persons over sixty
            soon will drink heavy water to slow the pace of life and to
            prolong it.<b><br>

                  When the Evil play GOD.</b></font><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            I am well aware that Haarp proper has its limits, and can't
            modify the weather as many people claim. I instead and cite
            the real source I believe is used in this report while
            calling it Haarp technology because Haarp is what people
            relate to (like Kleenex)...<br>
            <br>
            It is a cold hard fact that even if the entire electrical
            grid output was used for weather modification, there would
            be insufficient power available to do much of anything. The
            distances are too wide, volumes too huge, and locations in
            relation to a transmitter seldom ideal. Yet weather
            modification is a reality. How? This article explains how it
            can be done, from a scientific perspective, and also
            provides direct evidence from Nasa that Haarp intensified
            hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Emily.<br>
            <br>
            Most everyone has heard that silicon is a semiconductor. A
            semiconductor only permits current flow when the conditions
            are correct.<br>
            <br>
            In a typical silicon semiconductor, it's current flow
            characteristics are determined by the addition of doping
            agents - these are mixed with the silicon and become part of
            it's molecular matrix during the manufacturing process. The
            two most common doping agents are arsenic and boron.<br>
            <br>
            Doping agents cause the silicon to have an excess number of
            electrons in the P doped regions, and a deficiency of
            electrons in the N doped regions. A small electronic charge
            applied to the junction between the N and P regions will
            cause a cascade effect of a much greater magnitude if a
            power supply voltage is applied to one side of the piece of
            silicon, and a load is applied on the other side. That is
            what makes a transistor, the heart of a basic amplifier.<br>
            <br>
            How HAARP technology works, and a possible real reason why
            there are "chem trails"<br>
            <br>
            Most people do not realize this, but common air - the air we
            all breathe, is also a semiconductor, and it can be made to
            behave just like a piece of silicon if the right doping
            agents are added to it.<br>
            <br>
            If you wish to modify the electrical characteristics of the
            atmosphere, you need to use an aircraft to disperse the
            doping agents at a high altitude. If you then take a pair of
            huge transmitters, such as haarp, and transmit a frequency
            to a specific region which is timed to phase cancel against
            the opposing transmitter the frequencies they transmit will
            vanish and leave a standing DC bias voltage in the
            atmosphere at the selected region.<br>
            <br>
            This voltage is the electrical equivalent of the electronic
            charge applied between the N and P regions of a silicon
            transistor. The chem trails are the doping agent, and the
            ionosphereis the power supply.<br>
            <br>
            A flow of current is then is triggered from the ionosphere
            to the earth below. Because the ionosphere has virtually
            endless power to give, it is possible to take a transmitter
            pair with a radiated power of only a couple of billion
            watts, and use it to trigger a cascade of trillions of
            watts. That is enough to heat the atmosphere, and trigger a
            change of climate, storms, ect. It is very important to make
            sure you do not exceed certain limits, or "clip" the
            atmosphere, or you will cause a lightning bolt of a sort not
            ever witnessed. But if kept below certain thresholds, a
            great amount of atmospheric heating can be caused and no one
            on the ground would ever notice a thing.<br>
            <br>
            This of course would cause very odd electrical readings in
            the atmosphere. So someone should have been able to detect
            this, right? Nasa did. They noticed several hurricanes,
            including Katrina, were not electrically normal. These were
            the only 3 hurricanes to ever be that way. This could be
            done using the method illustrated below.<br>
            <br>
            The following illustration is a drawing of how a Haarp type
            system could be set up to work.<br>
            <br>
            Considering the precision modern weather modification
            systems have, giant installations such as HAARP can't be
            doing it all<br>
            Now onto WHY ON EARTH American cell towers have so much
            juice going to them.<br>
            <br>
            What if thousands of cell towers with over 50, 000 watts
            each were used rather than a pair of big Haarp arrays?
            Multiple signal source locations would allow the drawing of
            patterns, patterns which many people have noticed in weather
            radar<br>
            <br>
            How much is 50, 000 watts, compared to what is really needed
            for cell service?<br>
            In America, computer wifi is limited to 20 milliwatts
            transmit power and often even with that tiny amount you can
            connect from hundreds of feet away with no special antennas
            or hardware. Your cell phone can transmit 300 milliwatts.
            That's well over 10 times the power of wifi, and the range
            of your cell phone is that much better. All that is needed
            to make a great cellular node is a 10 watt transmitter (to
            make sure it gets real good penetration into the surrounding
            buildings, ) and a receiver that is more sensitive than the
            one in your cell phone because you are talking back with a
            lot less than 10 watts.<br>
            <br>
            10 watts is 500 times as strong as your wireless N router
            that comes in perfect everywhere. A lucky neighbor might
            snag your unsecured router with only 20 milliwatts of output
            from over a block away with just a cheap netbook. Why then,
            since 10 watts will clearly do the job, are there these
            ENORMOUS out in the open giant goose invading "cell towers"
            in America that are obviously capable of pumping many
            thousands of watts?<br>
            <br>
            It's because the cell towers in America have a totally
            different purpose than stated. Sure, the tower does indeed
            accomplish the job of supporting cell phone service, but it
            is not needed at all for that purpose. They are there to
            hide something clandestine right in the great wide open.<b><br>
              <br>
            </b>A reader sent the following:<br>
            <br>
            "My company also erected many cell towers, and I always
            wondered why they had us bring so much electrical power to
            these cell towers."<br>
            <br>
            He NAILED IT. As a technical type, I paid attention to the
            cell towers, and noticed that they always seem to have a
            400KVA or bigger transformer feeding them (I was never able
            to get close enough to look at the data plate but they were
            obviously way too large). 400KVA is approximately 400, 000
            watts. And I never really thought about it, why on earth
            they always got fed so much juice. Sometimes you just need
            to wake up and start thinking. Mexico confirms this - many
            cell towers are obviously low powered, with thin wires and
            tiny tower mounted amplifiers. A perfectly functional node
            can be fed less juice than needed by an average laptop and
            run on a small solar panel. These are common in Mexico.<br>
            <br>
            Another comment came in stating that American cell towers in
            fact only get anywhere from twenty thousand to sixty
            thousand watts, complete with verified documentation that
            that is "all it is". Ok, Fine then. WLS AM radio in Chicago
            which is well known as the GIANT clear channel monster in
            America broadcasts through the night with 50, 000 watts, and
            with a good radio you can hear it anywhere in the world when
            conditions are right. To sometimes pump even more than that
            into a single American neighborhood via the local tower
            which is serving only a two mile area is far beyond
            suspicious, It is case proven. Those cell towers ARE NOT
            WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD and I am certain that even 60, 000
            watts would be a conservative estimate for many of them.<b><br>
              <br>
            </b>Why pump so many watts?<br>
            <br>
            The antenna arrays on the cell towers are highly
            directional. That's obvious. So since the signal from them
            is confined to a zone, rather than going out
            omnidirectionally, whatever is in that zone will get
            extremely high R.F. levels. Maybe you need that much for
            mind control, but I seriously doubt it. With such an ability
            to confine the signal to within a zone, I would expect a
            mind control beam to not need more than a couple thousand
            watts. Where is the rest of that power going?<br>
            <br>
            My guess, is Japan, Hurricane Katrina, or Chiapas Mexico.
            Whatever earthquake or disaster "they" need to accomplish a
            political objective. And there is something you need to know
            about radio wave propagation - it can be steered. So just
            because a cell tower appears to only be able place all it's
            RF output within a confined zone, it does not mean that
            signal cannot be diverted and sent elsewhere. This is
            because a neighboring cell tower can be synchronized in such
            a way that it steers the output from surrounding towers to a
            new remote area. And that is how modern Haarp technology
            works.<br>
            <br>
            American cell towers then, I believe in this order, have
            multiple purposes. The first is EMF mind control.... <b><br>

            </b>Everyone empirically knows that stressful events
            certainly affect sound sleep. Scientists have found that the
            active component rich in sugarcane and other natural
            products may ameliorate stress and help having sound sleep.
            <br>
            <br>
            In today's world ever-changing environment, demanding job
            works and socio-economic factors enforces sleep deprivation
            in human population. Sleep deprivation induces tremendous
            amount of stress, and stress itself is one of the major
            factors responsible for sleep loss or difficulty in falling
            into sleep. Currently available sleeping pills does not
            address stress component and often have severe side effects.
            Sleep loss is also associated with certain other diseases
            including obesity, cardiovascular diseases, depression,
            anxiety, mania deficits etc.<b><br>
            </b><br>
            The research group led by Mahesh K. Kaushik and Yoshihiro
            Urade of the International Institute for Integrative Sleep
            Medicine (WPI-IIIS), University of Tsukuba, found that
            octacosanol reduces stress and restores stress-affected
            sleep back to normal.<br>
            <br>
            Octacosanol is abundantly present in various everyday foods
            such as sugarcane (thin whitish layer on surface), rice
            bran, wheat germ oil, bee wax etc. The crude extract is
            policosanol, where octacosanol is the major constituent.
            Policosanol and octacosanol have already been used in humans
            for various other medical conditions.<br>
            <br>
            In the current study, authors made an advancement and
            investigated the effect of octacosanol on sleep regulation
            in mildly stressed mice by oral administration. Octacosanol
            reduced corticosterone level in blood plasma, which is a
            stress marker. The octacosanol-administered mice also showed
            normal sleep, which was previously disturbed due to stress.
            They therefore claim that the octacosanol mitigates stress
            in mice and restores stress-affected sleep to normal in
            mice. The sleep induced by octacosanol was similar to
            natural sleep and physiological in nature. However, authors
            also claimed that octacosanol does not affect sleep in
            normal animals. These results clearly demonstrated that
            octacosanol is an active compound that has potential to
            reduce stress and to increase sleep, and it could
            potentially be useful for the therapy of insomnia caused by
            stress. Octacosanol can be considered safe for human use as
            a therapy, because it is a food-based compound and believed
            to show no side effects.<br>
            <br>
            Octacosanol/policosanol supplements are used by humans for
            functions such as lipid metabolism, cholesterol lowering or
            to provide strength. However, well-planned clinical studies
            need to be carried out to confirm its effect on humans for
            its stress-mitigation and sleep-inducing potentials. "Future
            studies include the identification of target brain area of
            octacosanol, its BBB permeability, and the mechanism via
            which octacosanol lowers stress," Kaushik says.<b><br>

              Abstract</b> -- Octacosanol, a component of various food
            materials, possesses prominent biological activities and
            functions. It fights against cellular stress by increasing
            glutathione level and thus scavenging oxygen reactive
            species. However, its anti-stress activity and role in sleep
            induction remained elusive. We hypothesize that octacosanol
            can restore stress-affected sleep by mitigating stress. Cage
            change strategy was used to induce mild stress and sleep
            disturbance in mice, and effects of octacosanol
            administration on amount of sleep and stress were
            investigated. Results showed that octacosanol did not change
            rapid eye movement (REM) or non-REM (NREM) sleep compared to
            vehicle in normal mice. However, in cage change experiment,
            octacosanol induces significant increase in NREM sleep at
            doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg (75.7 ± 14.9 and
            82.7 ± 9.3 min/5 h) compared to vehicle
            (21.2 ± 5.1 min/5 h), and decreased sleep latency.
            Octacosanol induced sleep by increasing number of sleep
            episodes and decreasing wake episode duration. Plasma
            corticosterone levels were significantly reduced after
            octacosanol (200 mg/kg) administration, suggesting a
            decrease in stress level. <br>
            <br>
            Octacosanol-induced changes in sleep-wake parameters in
            stressed-mice were comparable to the values in normal mice.
            Together, these data clearly showed that, though octacosanol
            does not alter normal sleep, it clearly alleviates stress
            and restore stress-affected sleep....<b><br>

                  convert methane to methanol using gold-palladium
                  nanoparticles</b></font><br>
            </div>
            <b><br>
            </b>Liquid methanol is widely used as a feedstock for other
            chemicals and also has considerable potential as an
            alternative fuel source. However, converting methane -- the
            primary component of abundant natural gas -- into methanol
            is currently achieved by an indirect process which requires
            high heat and pressure.<br>
            <br>
            Now researchers have discovered a new approach that allows
            the direct conversion of methane to methanol utilizing
            molecular oxygen under much milder reaction conditions.<br>
            <br>
            A collaborative team led by Graham J. Hutchings at the
            Cardiff Catalysis Institute, and Christopher J. Kiely at
            Lehigh University, have used colloidal gold-palladium
            (Au-Pd) nanoparticles to directly oxidize methane to
            methanol with high selectivity in aqueous solution at low
            temperatures. Their findings have been published in an
            article in Science: "Aqueous Au-Pd colloids catalyze
            selective CH4 oxidation to CH3OH with O2 under mild
            conditions."<br>
            <br>
            "Our work has shown that if a stable supply of methyl
            radicals can be established -- for example, by incorporating
            a very small amount of hydrogen peroxide into the reaction
            mixture -- then the selective oxidation of methane to
            methanol using molecular oxygen is entirely feasible," said
            Kiely, the Harold B. Chambers Senior Professor Materials
            Science and Chemical Engineering at Lehigh.<br>
            <br>
            This latest discovery has been guided by Kiely's and
            Hutchings' longtime collaboration on developing Au-Pd
            nanoparticles as effective catalysts for many other
            reactions.<br>
            <br>
            According to Kiely, the researchers were surprised to find
            that for this particular reaction to proceed they needed the
            Au-Pd nanoparticles to exist as free-floating colloids in a
            very weak hydrogen peroxide solution into which they
            injected pressurized methane and oxygen gas.<br>
            <br>
            "Usually when we use Au-Pd nanoparticles as catalysts they
            are nearly always dispersed on high surface area oxide
            supports such as titania," said Kiely. "In this case
            however, the presence of the ceramic support turned out to
            be highly detrimental."<br>
            <br>
            In the chemical industry methane is currently indirectly
            converted to methanol via the production of synthesis gas
            (CO + H2) at high temperatures and pressures, which is an
            expensive and energy intensive process. The most promising
            candidate processes discovered to date for the direct
            conversion of methane to methanol have tended to be complex,
            inefficient, and often require very high temperatures and
            aggressive reaction environments.<br>
            <br>
            "The new simplified approach we have demonstrated brings us
            a step closer to making the direct conversion of methane to
            methanol a practically viable proposition," said Kiely.<b><br>

              Abstract -- </b>The selective oxidation of methane, the
            primary component of natural gas, remains an important
            challenge in catalysis. Using colloidal gold-palladium
            nanoparticles rather than the same nanoparticles supported
            on titanium oxide, we oxidized methane to methanol with high
            selectivity (92%) in aqueous solution at mild temperatures.
            Using isotopically labeled O2 as an oxidant in the presence
            of H2O2, we demonstrate that the methanol produced
            incorporated a substantial fraction (70%) of gas-phase O2.
            More oxygenated products were formed than H2O2 consumed,
            suggesting that the controlled breakdown of H2O2 activates
            methane which subsequently incorporates molecular oxygen
            through a radical process. If a source of methyl radicals
            can be established, then the selective oxidation of methane
            to methanol using molecular oxygen is possible.<br>

            physical exam and step on the scale. Last year, the doctor
            said you were overweight. Now he says you are obese — at the
            same weight.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A nurse takes your blood pressure. You
            have hypertension — with the same previously healthy reading
            you’ve had for years.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The doctor scans your wrist bone. You
            have a condition called “osteopenia” — with the same bone
            density that was fine last time you were measured…<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are suddenly sick, simply because
            the definitions of disease have changed. And behind those
            changes, a Seattle Times examination has found, are the
            companies that make all those newly prescribed pills.<br>

            This is nothing new. Unfortunately, the above quotation is
            from the introduction to a 2005 series of articles. They
            were sounding the alarm early, but things have only gotten
            worse.<br>
            <br>
            Back then, the pharmaceutical industry had a hand in
            designing the testing tools for osteoporosis. They helped
            change the definition of obesity. They redefined diseases
            without any strong evidence. And they did this by giving
            money to doctors in order to promote their agenda. Some of
            the doctors who received kickbacks were policy setters in
            the World Health Organization, the U.S. National Institute
            for Health, and other medical associations.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Every time the boundary of a disease is
            expanded — the hypertension threshold is lowered by 10
            blood-pressure points, the guideline for obesity is lowered
            by 5 pounds — the market for drugs expands by millions of
            consumers and billions of dollars.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The result? Skyrocketing sales of
            prescription drugs. Soaring health-care costs. Escalating
            patient anxiety. Worst of all, millions of people taking
            drugs that may carry a greater risk than the underlying
            condition. The treatment, in fact, may make them sick or
            even kill them...<b><br>

            </div>
            <b> </b><br>
            The use of pig's blood and corpses by American forces in the
            Philippines has been thoroughly established by the testimony
            of multiple military officers and contemporary reports in
            the New York Times and the Scientific American. And by
            General Pershing in his own autobiography.<br>
            <br>
            Despite assiduous efforts by discredited partisan "fact
            checking" sites, Snopes and FactCheck, their history denial
            has failed utterly in the face of the facts.<br>
            <br>
            Assorted other attacks have claimed that it would have been
            out of character for General Pershing to act this way. But
            while Pershing, like most commanders in that kind of
            situation, employed both carrot and stick, alternating
            between force and diplomacy, his views on Islam were quite
            clear.<br>
            <br>
            He described the Mohammedan Moro as having "a fanatical
            disregard of the consequences of crime and an inborn desire
            to fight and plunder." <br>
            <br>
            "The Moro is of a peculiar make-up as to character though
            the reason is plain when considered, first, that he is a
            savage, second that he is a Malay, and that he is a
            Mohammedan."<br>
            <br>
            When there was talk of integrating Islam into the school
            system, Pershing quickly warned about the dangers of
            Islamization.<br>
            <br>
            "It has been seriously suggested that Islamic preceptors be
            brought into the Province to teach Mohammedanism through the
            medium of the public schools... to anyone who has even
            casually investigated the character of the prosyletizing
            Arabian and other Mohammedan teachers who have hitherto
            cursed this Province, there appears every reason to oppose
            the suggestion. Their presence here has been detrimental to
            good government and there is little doubt that to their
            occult inspiration may be charged much of the opposition
            that we have met among the Moros during the last ten years.<br>
            <br>
            "The provinicial government could not consistently approve
            any plan for the propogation of Mohammedanism through the
            prostitution of the public schools."<br>
            <br>
            General Pershing had also observed, "In the development of
            the individual, control by datus, whose authority is founded
            on Mohammedanism must eventually be abolished."<br>
            <br>
            Pershing proved to be much wiser about the dangers of
            Islamization spread from the Middle East than most modern
            officers. If men like McMaster understood what Pershing did,
            our national policy would be in far better hands.<br>

            A very significant study found that people residing with 80m
            (~250 ft) of cell towers had statistically significant
            lowered levels of glutathione and other antioxidants and

            The frequencies emitted by the cell towers was between
            900MHz and 1800MHz. The RF exposure level for the exposed
            group was in the range of 2.80–7.52 mW/m2, well under the
            FCC limit of 10,000 mW/m2.&nbsp; The RF exposure level for
            the control group was 0.014–0.065 mW/m2, which is at least
            100 times lower than the exposure level in the exposed
            group.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Comparing exposed groups to control group , the following

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statistically significant lowered
            activities of antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT) (p &lt;
            0.001) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (p &lt; 0.001) in the
            exposed group<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statistically significant rise in lipid
            peroxidation (LOO)&nbsp; (p &lt; 0.001), a product of free
            radical oxidation, in the exposed group<br>
            <br>
            "Multiple linear regression analyses revealed a significant

            with increasing RF power density...<br>
            <br>
            Cells possess a number of compensatory mechanisms to deal
            with ROS [reactive oxygen species] and its effects. Among
            these are the induction of antioxidant proteins such as GSH,
            SOD and CAT. Enzymatic antioxidant systems function by
            direct or sequential removal of ROS, thereby terminating
            their activities. An imbalance between the oxidative forces
            and antioxidant defense systems causes oxidative injury,
            which has been implicated in various diseases, such as
            cancer, neurological disorders, atherosclerosis, diabetes,
            liver cirrhosis, asthma, hypertension and ischemia...<br>
            <br>
            Because of the significant decrease in endogenous
            antioxidants and increased LOO among the exposed group, the
            extra burden of free radicals is unlikely to get
            neutralized, and these surplus ROS may react with important
            cellular macromolecules including DNA forming either DNA
            adducts or stand breaks, which may be later expressed as
            micronuclei once the cell decides to divide."<br>

            A lot of studies show a decrease in glutathione or
            glutathione enzymatic activity from exposure to wireless
            radiation. Why is glutathione important?&nbsp; It is the
            main antioxidant in your body and produced by your liver.
            People take glutathione by mouth for treating cataracts and
            glaucom a, preventing aging, treating or preventing
            alcoholism, asthma, cancer, heart disease(atherosclerosis
            and high cholesterol), hepatitis, liver disease, diseases
            that weaken the body’s defense system (including AIDS and
            chronic fatigue syndrome), memory loss, Alzheimer’s disease,
            osteoarthritis, and Parkinson’s disease. Glutathione is also
            used for maintaining the body’s defense system (immune
            system) and fighting metal and drug poisoning. <br>

            </div>
            <br>
            In July 2016 I was informed about the Italian BAC coil which
            I had not heard of before. It’s function is very much like
            that of the Joe Cell coil described above, but it is much
            more simple. The video shown at YouTube describes its
            construction and uses. This is not a coil which I have
            tested and so all that I can do is to pass on the
            information. The coil is a bi-filar coil which is closed off
            to form a single, continuous loop but it is wound in a
            clockwise direction which is not the usual direction...<br>
            <br>
            The claims made for this coil are quite remarkable and as
            the coil is so very simple that they are easily checked. The
            number of turns in the coil is a critical factor, depending
            on the application. The coil is wound using two wires of 1
            sq. mm. diameter copper wire and connected together as shown
            in the illustration. The coil is said to improve the quality
            of a wide range of things:<br>
            <br>
            Water quality can be improved very substantially as follows;
            Water with mild limestone hardness can be improved with one
            15-turn coil on the water pipe; Water with severe limestone
            hardness can be improved with one 13-turn coil; For
            industrial use in a severe hardness area: two separate
            13-turn coils on the water pipe; Water treated with any of
            these procedures makes much healthier drinking water; "Fuel
            treatment results in improved mpg results:<br>
            <br>
            Petrol: two separate 13-turn coils on the fuel pipe; Diesel:
            one 13-turn coil plus one 7-turn coil on the fuel pipe; LPG:
            one 13-turn coil plus one 28-turn coil on the fuel pipe; Up
            to 25% fuel reduction can be expected. <br>
            <br>
            "Natural gas:<br>
            <br>
            One 13-turn coil on the gas pipe OR one 28-turn coil if the
            13-turn coil is not effective; Up to 25% gas reduction can
            be expected.<br>
            <br>
            On High-voltage cables such as spark-plug leads; One 13-turn
            coil on the high-voltage lead; A further 15% mpg improvement
            may result from improved fuel burn.<br>
            <br>
            "The web page mentions these and many other applications,
            including medical applications. These coils are generally
            wound using “figure of eight” wire, but there is no reason
            why two separate strands of single core stranded wire should
            not be used provided that the two wires are wound side by
            side as shown in the car fuel line winding below where a
            green/yellow wire and a white wire are used separately..."<br>

            <br>
            The world's largest manufacturer of rubber bands is making
            its main product immortal.<br>
            <br>
            Alliance Rubber Co., a 94-year-old company based out of
            Alliance, Ohio, has announced a new partnership with British
            researchers to infuse graphene into its rubber bands.<br>
            <br>
            The rubber bands could transform how food travels through
            supply chains, simplify the shipment of fragile electronics,
            and, most satisfyingly, last forever.<br>
            <br>
            Graphene's signature property is its super-strength. More
            than 200 times tougher than steel, it is the strongest
            substance known to humans.<br>
            <br>
            Somewhat famously, in 2008, Columbia University engineer
            James Hone said it would take an elephant standing on a
            pencil to pierce through a sheet of graphene as thick as
            Saran Wrap.<br>
            <br>
            Jason Risner, director of business strategy at Alliance,
            said the company is spending the next year working with
            University of Sussex researchers to determine the perfect
            ratio of graphene to rubber.<br>
            <br>
            Too little graphene, and the bands won't be maximally
            durable. Too much, and they will lose their elasticity.<br>
            <br>
            Once Alliance figures out the recipe for perfect,
            unbreakable rubber bands, Risner said the company can begin
            selling to numerous industries, including retailers like
            Staples and Office Depot, along with wholesalers working in
            agribusiness and technology.<br>
            <br>
            Graphene stands to fill in many of the gaps of traditional
            rubber bands, Risner said. For example, graphene bands can
            be anti-static, which is critical for companies shipping
            bundles of electronic goods.<br>
            <br>
            "Nobody who's in the electronics industry wants anything
            coming near their motherboards and their circuit boards that
            has the ability to build up static charge," he told Business
            Insider.<br>
            <br>
            "An anti-static band could be used in all of those settings
            around electronics and not be a danger to ruining the
            equipment."<br>
            <br>
            Graphene-infused bands could also be embedded with RFID tags
            and change colour depending on temperature or time.<br>
            <br>
            Risner said this holds enormous potential for farmers and
            grocers looking to track their produce as it makes it way to
            stores for purchase - down to the exact location a single
            green onion was picked.<br>
            <br>
            "Imagine a rubber band that changes colours if it reaches
            above 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius)," Risner
            said.<br>
            <br>
            Given that stores must adhere to certain standards for the
            produce they intake, "the grocery store would know that that
            produce went above the temperature that was promised to be
            deliver in, and that it's going to spoil faster. They could
            reject it at the store because it's changed colour based on
            temperature."<br>
            <br>
            Customers, too, would benefit once the food makes it to
            shelves. If a bundle of asparagus normally comes with a blue
            rubber band but one bunch's is black, for instance, people
            would know which produce to avoid.<br>
            <br>
            For the millions of people who use rubber bands on a daily
            basis in home or office settings, however, durability may
            stand out as the greatest win, Risner said.<br>
            <br>
            Eventually, Alliance wants to put graphene in every rubber
            band it produces. According to Risner, turning an ordinary
            piece of rubber into a traceable device - one that won't
            snap on a moment's notice - would mark the next great leap
            forward.<br>

            </b><b>Abstract:</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            OBJECTIVES: In the present study, therapeutic effects of the
            Cimicifuga racemosa preparation CR BNO 1055
            (Klimadynon/Menofem) on climacteric complaints, bone
            metabolism and endometrium will be compared with those of
            conjugated estrogens (CE) and placebo. The question whether
            CR BNO 1055 contains substances with selective estrogen
            receptor modulator (SERM) activity will be investigated.
            METHODS: Sixty-two evaluable postmenopausal women were
            included in the double-blind, randomized, multicentre study,
            and treated either with CR BNO 1055 (daily dose
            corresponding to 40 mg herbal drug), 0.6 mg CE, or matching
            placebo, for 3 months. Menopausal symptoms were assessed by
            the menopause rating scale (MRS) and a diary. Levels of
            CrossLaps (marker of bone degradation) were determined by
            ELECSYS system and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase
            (marker of bone formation) by an enzymatic assay.
            Endometrial thickness was measured via transvaginal
            ultrasound; vaginal cytology was also studied. The primary
            efficacy criterion was the change from baseline to end point
            in the MRS. Change from baseline was analyzed for the
            secondary variables too. RESULTS: CR BNO 1055 proved to be
            equipotent to CE and superior to placebo in reducing
            climacteric complaints. Under both verum preparations,
            beneficial effects on bone metabolism have been observed in
            the serum. CR BNO 1055 had no effect on endometrial
            thickness, which was significantly increased by CE. Vaginal
            superficial cells were increased under CE and CR BNO 1055
            treatment. CONCLUSION: The results concerning climacteric
            complaints and on bone metabolism indicate an equipotent
            effect of CR BNO 1055 in comparison to 0.6 mg CE per day. It
            is proposed that CR BNO 1055 contains substances with SERM
            activity, i.e. with desired effects in the
            brain/hypothalamus, in the bone and in the vagina, but
            without exerting uterotrophic effects.<br>

            OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of beer consumption on bone
            mass in a group of healthy women, by using phalangeal bone
            ultrasound to evaluate the amplitude-dependent speed of
            sound. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 1697
            healthy women (mean age 48.4 y, body mass index (BMI)
            19.0-32.0 kg/m(2)), recruited in a clinical convenience
            sample and screened for the existence of disease and/or
            medication that would affect calcium metabolism. Of this
            total, 710 were premenopausal, 176 were perimenopausal, and
            811 were postmenopausal. The women recruited completed a
            questionnaire that contained detailed sections on current
            cigarette, alcohol, caffeine, and nutrient consumption. In
            terms of current alcohol intake, the subjects were
            classified as moderate drinkers, light drinkers, and
            nondrinkers. Drinkers were also analyzed according to the
            kind of alcohol consumed: wine or beer. RESULTS:
            Quantitative bone ultrasound values were greater in the beer
            drinkers compared with the no beer and/or wine drinkers.
            Taking the amplitude-dependent speed of sound as a dependent
            variable, and age, BMI, gonadal status, intake of beer and
            wine, and number of cigarettes per day as independent
            variables, we found age (beta = -1.52), BMI (beta = -3.86),
            gonadal status (beta = -27.47), and beer intake (beta =
            1.06) to be significant. CONCLUSION: The greater bone
            density found in women beer drinkers might be a result of
            the phytoestrogen content of this alcoholic drink; this
            requires further investigation.<br>

            </b><br>
            Aside from existing drug therapies, certain lifestyle and
            nutritional factors are known to reduce the risk of
            osteoporosis. Among the nutritional factors, dried plum or
            prunes (Prunus domestica L.) is the most effective fruit in
            both preventing and reversing bone loss. The objective of
            the present study was to examine the extent to which dried
            plum reverses bone loss in osteopenic postmenopausal women.
            We recruited 236 women, 1-10 years postmenopausal, not on
            hormone replacement therapy or any other prescribed
            medication known to influence bone metabolism. Qualified
            participants (n 160) were randomly assigned to one of the
            two treatment groups: dried plum (100 g/d) or dried apple
            (comparative control). Participants received 500 mg Ca plus
            400 IU (10 µg) vitamin D daily. Bone mineral density (BMD)
            of lumbar spine, forearm, hip and whole body was assessed at
            baseline and at the end of the study using dual-energy X-ray
            absorptiometry. Blood samples were collected at baseline, 3,
            6 and 12 months to assess bone biomarkers. Physical activity
            recall and 1-week FFQ were obtained at baseline, 3, 6 and 12
            months to examine physical activity and dietary confounders
            as potential covariates. Dried plum significantly increased
            BMD of ulna and spine in comparison with dried apple. In
            comparison with corresponding baseline values, only dried
            plum significantly decreased serum levels of bone turnover
            markers including bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and
            tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b. The findings of the
            present study confirmed the ability ofdried plum in
            improving BMD in postmenopausal women in part due to
            suppressing the rate of bone turnover. <br>

            <br>
            A 3,700-year-old clay tablet has proven that the Babylonians
            developed trigonometry 1,500 years before the Greeks and
            were using a sophisticated method of mathematics which could
            change how we calculate today.<br>
            <br>
            The tablet, known as Plimpton 332, was discovered in the
            early 1900s in Southern Iraq by the American archaeologist
            and diplomat Edgar Banks, who was the inspiration for
            Indiana Jones.<br>
            <br>
            The true meaning of the tablet has eluded experts until now
            but new research by the University of New South Wales,
            Australia, has shown it is the world’s oldest and most
            accurate trigonometric table, which was probably used by
            ancient architects to construct temples, palaces and canals.<br>
            <br>
            However unlike today’s trigonometry, Babylonian mathematics
            used a base 60, or sexagesimal system, rather than the 10
            which is used today. Because 60 is far easier to divide by
            three, experts studying the tablet, found that the
            calculations are far more accurate...<br>
            <br>
            A trigonometric table allows a user to determine two unknown
            ratios of a right-angled triangle using just one known
            ratio. But the tablet is far older than Hipparchus,
            demonstrating that the Babylonians were already well
            advanced in complex mathematics far earlier...<br>
            <br>
            The new study is published in Historia Mathematica, the
            official journal of the International Commission on the
            History of Mathematics.<br>

            Researchers have developed a device that can switch cell
            function to rescue failing body functions with a single

            skin cells into other types of cells required for treating
            diseased conditions. “It takes just a fraction of a second.
            You simply touch the chip to the wounded area, then remove

            State University Wexner Medical Center. “At that point, the
            cell reprogramming begins.” In a series of lab tests,
            researchers applied the chip to the injured legs of mice
            that vascular scans showed had little to no blood flow. “We
            reprogrammed their skin cells to become vascular cells,” Sen
            said. “Within a week we began noticing the transformation.”
            By the second week, active blood vessels had formed, and by
            the third week, the legs of the mice were saved—with no
            other form of treatment. “It extends the concept known as
            gene therapy, and it has been around for quite some time,”
            said study collaborator James Lee, PhD, a professor of
            chemical and biomolecular engineering at Ohio State. “The
            difference with our technology is how we deliver the DNA
            into the cells.” The chip, loaded with specific genetic code
            or certain proteins, is placed on the skin, and a small
            electrical current creates channels in the tissue. The DNA
            or RNA is injected into those channels where it takes root
            and begins to reprogram the cells. In a new study published
            in Nature Nanotechnology, first author Daniel Gallego-Perez
            of Ohio State demonstrated that the technique worked with up
            to 98 percent efficiently. “What’s even more exciting is
            that it not only works on the skin, but on any type of
            tissue,” Sen said. In fact, researchers were able to grow
            brain cells on the skin surface of a mouse, harvest them,
            then inject them into the mouse’s injured brain. Just a few
            weeks after having a stroke, brain function in the mouse was
            restored, and it was healed. Because the technique uses a
            patient’s own cells and does not rely on medication,
            researchers expect it to be approved for human trials within
            a year.<br>

            </div>
            <b>Abstract</b><br>
            <br>
            Psilocybin is the psychotropic tryptamine-derived natural
            product of Psilocybe carpophores, the so-called "magic
            mushrooms". Although its structure has been known for 60
            years, the enzymatic basis of its biosynthesis has remained
            obscure. We characterized four psilocybin biosynthesis
            enzymes. These include i) PsiD which represents a new class
            of fungal l-tryptophan decarboxylases, ii) PsiK, that
            catalyzes the phosphotransfer step, iii) the methyl
            transferase PsiM, catalyzing iterative N-methyltransfer as
            terminal biosynthetic step, and iv) PsiH, a monooxygenase.
            In a combined PsiD/PsiK/PsiM reaction, psilocybin was
            synthesized enzymatically in a step-economic route from
            4-hydroxy-l-tryptophan. Given the renewed pharmaceutical
            interest in psilocybin, our results may lay the foundation
            for its biotechnological production.<br>

                Developing a New Test to Tell</b><br>
              <br>
              <b>by Lauran Neergaard</b><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            Diagnosing if a tick bite caused Lyme or another disease can
            be difficult but scientists are developing a new way to do
            it early - using a "signature" of molecules in patients'
            blood.<br>
            <br>
            It's still highly experimental, but initial studies suggest
            the novel tool just might uncover early-stage Lyme disease
            more accurately than today's standard test, researchers
            reported Wednesday. And it could tell the difference between
            two tick-borne diseases with nearly identical early
            symptoms.<br>
            <br>
            "Think about it as looking at a fingerprint," said
            microbiology professor John Belisle of Colorado State
            University, who helped lead the research.<br>
            <br>
            Lyme disease is estimated to infect 300,000 people in the
            U.S. every year. Lyme-causing bacteria are spread by
            blacklegged ticks - also called deer ticks - primarily in
            the Northeast and Midwest, although their range is
            spreading. Lyme typically starts as a fever, fatigue and
            flu-like symptoms - often but not always with a hallmark
            bulls-eye rash - and people usually recover quickly with
            prompt antibiotics. But untreated, Lyme causes more serious
            complications, including swollen joints and arthritis,
            memory and concentration problems, even irregular heartbeat.<br>
            <br>
            Yet today's best available test often misses early Lyme.
            It's considered no more than 40 percent accurate in the
            first few weeks of infection. It measures infection-fighting
            antibodies the immune system produces. Those take a while to
            form, making the test more useful a month or more after
            infection sets in than when people first start feeling
            ill....<br>

                stimulation of motor behaviors in awake, freely moving

            Abstract -- Establishing how neurocircuit activation causes
            particular behaviors requires modulating the activity of
            specific neurons. Here, we demonstrate that magnetothermal
            genetic stimulation provides tetherless deep brain
            activation sufficient to evoke motor behavior in awake mice.
            The approach uses alternating magnetic fields to heat
            superparamagnetic nanoparticles on the neuronal membrane.
            Neurons heat-sensitized by expressing TRPV1 are activated
            with magnetic field application. Magnetothermal genetic
            stimulation in the motor cortex evoked ambulation, deep
            brain stimulation in the striatum caused rotation around the
            body-axis, and stimulation near the ridge between ventral
            and dorsal striatum caused freezing-of-gait. The duration of
            the behavior correlated tightly with field application. This
            approach provides genetically and spatially targetable,
            repeatable and temporarily precise activation of deep-brain
            circuits without need for surgical implantation of any
            device.<br>

                Sand to Produce Energy</b><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            Magaldi Group is using sand to produce and store energy in a
            100-kilowatt thermal power demonstration plant in Salerno, a
            short drive from the famous Amalfi Coast. Production is set
            to start later this year.<br>
            <br>
            “If you’ve ever walked on the beach in the sun and burned
            your feet,” you know how sand takes on heat, founder and
            Chairman Mario Magaldi, who has put 10 million euros ($11
            million) into the project so far, said in an interview.
            “With wind farms you only have energy when it’s windy, with
            solar, only when there’s sun. With this technology you can
            concentrate energy into one receiver and use it when there’s
            no more sun.”<br>
            <br>
            The plant is a concentrated solar power, or CSP, system,
            which uses mirrors to focus sunlight to heat sand. The hot
            sand then produces steam which can run turbines and generate
            electricity.<br>
            <br>
            CSP technology, which is widely used in Spain, the U.S,
            Middle East and Asia, often uses heated molten salt to
            produce energy, while the Magaldi plant uses common silica
            sand, which owners say is cheaper.<br>
            <br>
            The plant can produce about 500 kilowatts of energy with one
            turbine, or enough to power a small town. More turbines can
            be added for increased power. The facility can also work at
            night.<br>
            <br>
            “We have about 270 tons of sand stored in the plant’s
            receiver, so when the sun goes down the plant can keep
            producing steam for another six hours using the thermal
            energy stored inside,” says Matteo Mauro, engineer for the
            company.<br>
            <br>
            Magaldi says the technology behind the plant could be useful
            in remote areas in need of energy. He says the company is in
            touch with possible clients in Australia, South Africa and
            Central America.<br>

            <div align="center"><b>Amazing New Features from Russian
                Search Giant Yandex While Google Censors Dissent</b><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            Yandex now features Artificial Intelligence in its searches
            - something Google doesn't have yet.<br>
            <br>
            Yandex is far superior to Google for Russian searches, and
            is destroying Google in the Russian market.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Google just can't compete with Russia's homegrown search
            engine in Russia.<br>
            <br>
            You may think it obvious that a national search engine would
            take priority in it's own country, but this is not so in
            most of the world.<br>
            <br>
            In Germany and the UK, countries the west is always touting
            as being superior and more advanced to Russia, their
            internet users are effectively slaves to an American
            company, Google, with no national search engine.<br>
            <br>
            This excellent segment from Russia's main evening news show
            describes new Artificial Intelligence features just rolled
            out by Yandex.<br>
            <br>
            Russia however, is totally self sufficient, her search
            engine Yandex is far more advanced, and optimized for use in
            the country and neighboring countries.<br>
            <br>
            Anyone who talks about Russia being only a giant gas
            station, with no technological achievements (somehow
            forgetting she put the first man in space), is clearly
            ignorant of the fact that Russians have largely created
            their own substitutes for western IT products.<br>
            <br>
            Russia has her own version of Facebook, VK, which like
            Yandex is far more popular in the Russian, Ukraine, and much
            of the post-soviet market. This is because Russians are not
            globalists, whilst they seek international friendship,
            Russian people always prefer to create independent homegrown
            things, rather than being a subject to a global hegemony.<br>
            <br>
            Whereas Google holds a hegemony over the internet in most
            places, when given the choice, Russians choose Yandex.<br>

            <br>
            In Durham, North Carolina, the seat of Duke University, a
            gang of largely white males destroyed public property by
            pulling down a statue of a Confederate soldier. Perhaps they
            took their cue from the neo-Nazis installed in Ukraine by
            Obama and Hillary following the US-engineered coup that
            overthrew the elected democratic government. The first thing
            the new Obama-installed neo-Nazi regime did was to pull down
            all the Soviet war memorials of the liberation of Ukraine
            from Nazi Germany. The neo-Nazis who pulled down the war
            memorials were the descendants of the Ukrainians who fought
            for Nazi Germany. These neo-Nazis comprise the government of
            the “democracy” that Obama and Hillary brought to the
            Ukraine and is the government that the US government and its
            European vassals support.<br>
            <br>
            What did the destruction of public property in Durham
            achieve, and where were the police?<br>
            <br>
            What the films of the event reveal is a collection of crazed
            white people, mainly white men, kicking and spitting at a
            bronze statue and jumping back as if the statue were going
            to strike back. It was a display of ignorant psychopathic
            hatred.<br>
            <br>
            Where did this hatred come from and why was it directed at a
            statue? To the ignorant gangsters, most likely Duke
            University students, the destroyed statue is a symbol of
            slavery.<br>
            <br>
            This ignorant association between a Confederale soldier and
            slavery contradicts all known history. Slavery in the
            Southern states was confined to large argicultural tracts
            known as plantations. Slaves were the agricultural
            workforce. This institution long predated the Confederacy
            and the United States itself. It was an inherited
            institution from the time that the New World was colonized
            by European economic interests. Slaves were not a Southern
            invention. They were brought in long prior to the
            Declaration of Independence, because there were resources to
            be exploited but no work force.<br>
            <br>
            The first slaves were white slaves, but they died like flies
            from malaria and yellow fevor. Next indigenious Americans
            (“Indians”) were used as slaves, but they would not work.
            Then it was discovered that some Africans had immunity to
            malaria and resistance to yellow fever, and finally a work
            force was located. The slaves were purchased from the
            African tribes that annually conducted warfare between
            themselves, the booty of which was slaves. Socialist
            historians, such as Karl Polanyi, the Jewish brother of my
            Jewish Oxford professor, the distinguished physical chemist
            and philosopher Michael Polanyi, to whom my first book is
            dedicated, wrote detailed and exacting histories of the
            African slave trade conducted by black Africans.<br>
            <br>
            Confederate soldiers did not own slaves, and as every honest
            historian knows, they were not fighting for slavery. They
            were fighting, because their country had been invaded.<br>
            <br>
            The Confederacy was not their country any more than the
            United States had been. Their country was their state. In
            those days people’s loyalty was to their state. They thought
            of their state as their country. To their minds, the United
            States was something like the EU is to the French, Italians,
            Dutch, British, etc. The French still think of themselves as
            French, not as EU.<br>
            <br>
            Remember, when Robert E. Lee was offered command of the
            Union Army, he declined on the grounds that he could not
            bring war to his own country, by which he meant Virginia.<br>
            <br>
            Lee’s army was the Army of Northern Virginia.<br>
            <br>
            As President Lincoln said over and over, the war is not
            about slavery. It is about “preserving the union,” that is,
            the empire. If the South were permitted to separate, it
            would mean that there would be two countries competing for
            the vast lands to the west of the Mississippi River. The
            budding empire in Washington did not want any such
            competition.<br>
            <br>
            If the South were permitted to seperate, the North would
            lose its market for its relatively high priced manufactured
            goods that it hoped to sell to the South by placing a tariff
            against the cheaper British goods.<br>
            <br>
            The South figured, correctly, that it would be doubly hit.
            Higher prices from the North and retaliatory tariffs from
            the British on its cotton exports.<br>
            <br>
            This economic conflict between the North and South went on
            for a long time before it provoked secession. The left-wing
            American Historian, Charles Beard, explains the so-called
            “Civil War” in the economic terms that provoked it. It had
            nothing whatsoever to do with slavery.<br>
            <br>
            The very designation, “Civil War,” is a lie. A civil war is
            when two sides fight for control of the government. The
            South was not fighting for control of the US government. It
            was fighting, because the North had invaded.<br>
            <br>
            Lincoln did not free the slaves. Moreover, had Lincoln not
            been assassinated, his plan was to send the blacks, whom he
            regarded as inferior to whites, back to Africa. This is not
            a “conspiracy theory.” It is the documented fact. It is
            totally impossible to refute this documented fact.<br>
            <br>
            The Emancipation Proclamation was propaganda. It had two
            purposes: one was to shut up the abolitionists. The other
            was to promote a slave rebellion in the Southern states that
            would draw Confederate troops out of the front lines to
            protect the women and children at home. As Lincoln’s own
            Secretary of State, William H. Seward, said, we have freed
            the slaves where we have no jurisdiction and left them in
            slavery where we have jurisdiction. Seward’s exact words:
            “We show our sympathy with slavery by emancipating slaves
            where we cannot reach them and holding them in bondage where
            we can set them free.”<br>
            <br>
            The left-wing historian Richard Hofstadter ridiculed
            Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation for freeing only the
            slaves over which Lincoln had no power.<br>
            <br>
            Lincoln’s purpose was not to free slaves but to provoke the
            slave rape of Southern women and murder of Southern children
            that would pull the Southern troops his generals could not
            defeat off the front lines and impel them home to protect
            their families from Lincoln’s slave revolt.<br>
            <br>
            But the slaves did not revolt even though there was no one
            there to conrol them but women and children. So what kind of
            oppression was this?<br>
            <br>
            Lincoln issued the proclamation intended to produce a slave
            rebellion because he had run through countless generals, and
            although the Union army in its engagements with Robert E.
            Lee always outnumbered the Southerns by two or three to one,
            and sometimes more, the Army of Northern Virginia did not
            lose a battle for the first two years of the War. If the
            South had had more people, a number of Southern battle
            victories would have ended in the capture of Washington and
            the end of the war. But the South never had the number of
            soldiers sufficient to have a reserve to capitalize on its
            military victories. In contrast, the North had an endless
            supply of immigrants from Ireland, most of whom died for the
            American Empire.<br>
            <br>
            Opposition to the war in the North was high. Lincoln had to
            arrest and imprison 300 northern newspaper owners and
            editors and exile a US Congressman.<br>
            <br>
            Slavery was an inherited institution, not a Southern
            construct. Slavery would have gradually disappeared as
            immigrants into the South begin forming a work force and the
            over-cultivated plantation lands begin losing their
            fertility. Slavery existed as long as it did because new
            immigrants, instead of becoming a local work force, moved
            west, occupied Indian land and became independent farmers.<br>
            <br>
            Of course, the abolitionist created all the hatred of the
            South that they possibly could. Indeed, during my entire
            life, lived almost exclusively outside the South, I have
            observed the liberals foment racial hatred of blacks toward
            whites, and I have watched feminists foment gender hatred of
            women toward men. Hatred is the great cause of the liberals.
            It is what defines them.<br>
            <br>
            The stupid liberals have sowed social enmity between races
            and genders. The destruction of America will be the result.<br>
            <br>
            Perhaps we will fall apart, occupied in racial and gender
            warfare, before the Russians and Chinese have to blow us off
            the face of the earth.<br>

            </div>
            <b>&nbsp;</b><br>
            American democracy has a problem - a voting problem.<br>
            <br>
            According to a new study of U.S. Census data, America has
            more registered voters than actual live voters. It's a
            troubling fact that puts our nation's future in peril.<br>
            <br>
            The data come from Judicial Watch's Election Integrity
            Project. The group looked at data from 2011 to 2015 produced
            by the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, along
            with data from the federal Election Assistance Commission.<br>
            <br>
            As reported by the National Review's Deroy Murdock, who did
            some numbers-crunching of his own, "some 3.5 million more
            people are registered to vote in the U.S. than are alive
            among America's adult citizens. Such staggering inaccuracy
            is an engraved invitation to voter fraud." ...<br>
