          </b><b>Secret Court Issuing Website "Takedown" Orders in
            America, Targeting "Vaccine Truth" Sites</b><b><br>
          </b>January 23, 2020, by Mike Adams, editor, Natural News<br>
          <br>
          Take note, all independent media publishers and vaccine
          skeptics: A Natural News investigation has discovered the
          existence of a "secret court" in America which is run by the
          vaccine industry and is currently issuing takedown orders to
          tech companies and hosting infrastructure companies to cause
          targeted disruptions (sabotage) of independent media websites
          that question any official vaccine narrative.<br>
          <br>
          Natural News has learned that these secret court orders are
          hidden inside sealed, terminated court cases which are being
          laundered through the federal bankruptcy courts but have
          nothing to do with bankruptcies. They are hidden from public
          view and assigned a secret code that indicates their real
          purpose; to disrupt and sabotage the independent media by
          ordering tech companies to remove websites, de-platform
          channels or disrupt indy media operations.<br>
          <br>
          The secret court orders are packaged as "Temporary Restraining
          Orders" demanding "Preliminary Injunction" actions to hosting
          companies. They are being shotgunned out to ensnare
          independent publishers who have nothing at all to do with the
          court cases under which the secret orders are being hidden. In
          effect, the vaccine deep state, as we call it, has hijacked
          and weaponized the federal courts to escalate censorship
          operations to a whole new level.<br>
          <br>
          Natural News has learned that dozens of independent publishers
          are being hit with these TROs and that the secret orders
          preclude hosting companies from alerting their own clients to
          the nature of the sabotage.<br>
          <br>
          We now live in a tyrannical police state where any website can
          be sabotaged, disrupted or taken down by a secret court order
          that is fabricated out of thin air, with absolutely no legal
          justification whatsoever...<br>

          tank 1 and coupled to the table, and multistage vibrating
          blades 5 mounted to the lower parts of the vibrating rods 4
          and surface-plated with palladium or platinum serving as a
          catalyst in element transmutation, characterized in that the
          high frequency vibrating motor 3 is controlled by an inverter
          6 so as to vibrate the multistage vibrating blades 5 at a
          frequency of 100-170 Hz in an aqueous solution 2 containing an
          element to be transmuted in the treatment tank 1, thereby
          transmuting the element in the aqueous solution 2 into another
          element. By adding heavy water to the solution to be treated,
          the transmutation efficiency can be elevated.<br>

          </b><br>
          The big question for the year 2020 is simple: can America get
          its mind right?<br>
          <br>
          If the answer is no, we may not have much chance of continuing
          as a peaceful, functioning country. The era of the long
          emergency, as I call it, is of a piece with Strauss and Howe’s
          figurative winter in their Fourth Turning view of history
          playing out in generational cycles analogous to seasons of the
          year. Whatever you call it, the current disposition of things
          has had a harsh effect on our collective psychology. It has
          made an unusually large cohort of Americans functionally
          insane, believing in demons, hobgoblins, and phantoms,
          subscribing to theories that, in previous eras, children would
          laugh at, while contesting obvious realities and provoking
          grave political hazard...<br>

          </b><b>Vaccinating Against Hate: Using Attitudinal Inoculation
            to Confer Resistance to Persuasion by Extremist Propaganda</b><b><br>
          </b><b>Kurt Braddock</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Research in several domains has shown that attitudinal
          inoculation effectively promotes resistance to persuasion.
          Despite its proven efficacy, inoculation has not been
          empirically tested as a strategy for preventing the adoption
          of beliefs and attitudes consistent with violent extremist
          ideologies. The current study addresses this gap in the
          literature. In a between-subjects experiment performed in the
          U.S., participants (N = 357) were exposed to an inoculation
          message or no-inoculation control message before reading left-
          or right-wing extremist propaganda. Inoculation positively
          predicted psychological reactance, which in turn, reduced
          intention to support the extremist group. Inoculation also
          negatively predicted perceptions of the extremist group’s
          credibility, which positively predicted support intention.
          Neither the apparent source of the inoculation message, nor
          the ideological focus of the propaganda, moderated any of
          these relationships. These results effectively extend the
          scope of inoculation theory into the realm of violent
          extremism and have implications for the development of
          messages intended to prevent persuasive outcomes consistent
          with extremist ideologies.<br>

          </b><b>One Of The Most Common Ingredients In The Western Diet
            Has Been Found To Alter Genes In The Brain</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          The use of soybean oil has increased dramatically over the
          last few decades, to the extent that is has become the most
          widely consumed edible oil in the US and other Western
          nations. However, its rise has coincided with an alarming
          escalation in metabolic conditions like diabetes, insulin
          resistance, and obesity, and a new study indicates that this
          may be down to the way that soybean oil causes genetic changes
          in the brain.<br>
          <br>
          Previous research has shown that mice fed a diet that is high
          in soybean oil are much more likely to develop these
          conditions than rodents fed on other fats like coconut oil.
          Further studies hinted that the culprit may be linoleic acid,
          as mice that consumed soybean oil that had been modified to
          lack this key ingredient were spared many of these harmful
          effects.<br>
          <br>
          To better understand how soybean oil produces these negative
          consequences, scientists decided to investigate its impact on
          the expression of genes in the hypothalamus, a brain region
          that regulates metabolism and a range of other essential
          processes.<br>
          <br>
          Mice were split into groups, of which one received a diet that
          was high in normal soybean oil, another consumed a diet high
          in soybean oil that lacked linoleic acid, and another was fed
          on a diet rich in coconut oil.<br>
          <br>
          Writing in the journal Endocrinology, the study authors
          explain that soybean oil was found to modify the expression of
          around 100 different genes in the hypothalamus, affecting
          processes such as metabolism, neurological disease, and
          inflammation.<br>

          Writing in the journal Endocrinology, the study authors

          around 100 different genes in the hypothalamus, affecting
          processes such as metabolism, neurological disease, and
          inflammation.<br>
          <br>
          Among the altered genes were some that are associated with
          schizophrenia, depression, and Alzheimer’s disease, although
          by far the most affected was a gene that codes for the
          production of a hormone called oxytocin.<br>
          <br>
          Oxytocin is sometimes referred to as the “love hormone” as it
          promotes social bonding and feelings of euphoria, and
          disruptions to its functioning have been linked to depression
          and autism. However, it also plays a key role in regulating
          body weight and glucose metabolism, and mice fed on soybean
          oil were therefore found to suffer from glucose intolerance,
          while those fed on coconut oil had no such problems.<br>
          <br>
          Furthermore, the oxytocin gene was affected equally in mice
          that consumed regular soybean oil and the version that lacked
          linoleic acid, suggesting that the removal of this ingredient
          does not protect against the harmful effects of soybean oil.<br>
          <br>
          With linoleic acid ruled out as the main driver of these
          harms, the researchers turned their attention to another
          compound found in soybean oil called stigmasterol. A further
          group of mice were fed a diet rich in coconut oil that had
          been modified to contain high quantities of stigmasterol, to
          see if this caused similar genetic changes within the
          hypothalamus.<br>
          <br>
          Yet no such genetic alterations were found in the hypothalamus
          of these mice, indicating that stigmasterol is not to blame
          for the dangers of soybean oil.<br>
          <br>
          Future research will now need to focus on determining which
          ingredient is responsible for these genetic changes, although
          study author Poonamjot Deol of the University of California,
          Riverside says that while many questions remain unanswered,
          some very concrete statements can be made off the back of this
          study.<br>
          <br>
          "If there's one message I want people to take away, it's this:
          reduce consumption of soybean oil," she said in a statement.<br>

          </b><b>Poonamjot Deol, et al.</b><b><br>
          </b><b><br>
          </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>Soybean oil consumption has increased greatly in the past
          half-century and is linked to obesity and diabetes. To test
          the hypothesis that soybean oil diet alters hypothalamic gene
          expression in conjunction with metabolic phenotype, we
          performed RNA-seq analysis using male mice fed isocaloric,
          high-fat diets based on conventional soybean oil (high in
          linoleic acid, LA), a genetically modified, low-LA soybean oil
          (Plenish) and coconut oil (high in saturated fat, containing
          no LA). The two soybean oil diets had similar, albeit
          non-identical, effects on the hypothalamic transcriptome,
          whereas the coconut oil diet had a negligible effect compared
          to a low-fat control diet. Dysregulated genes were associated
          with inflammation, neuroendocrine, neurochemical, and insulin
          signaling. Oxt was the only gene with metabolic, inflammation
          and neurological relevance upregulated by both soybean oil
          diets compared to both control diets. Oxytocin
          immunoreactivity in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei
          of the hypothalamus was reduced while plasma oxytocin and
          hypothalamic Oxt were increased. These central and peripheral
          effects of soybean oil diets were correlated with glucose
          intolerance but not body weight. Alterations in hypothalamic
          Oxt and plasma oxytocin were not observed in coconut oil diet
          enriched in stigmasterol, a phytosterol found in soybean oil.
          We postulate that neither stigmasterol nor LA is responsible
          for effects of soybean oil diets on oxytocin and that Oxt mRNA
          levels could be associated with the diabetic state. Given its
          ubiquitous presence in the American diet, the observed effects
          of soybean oil on hypothalamic gene expression could have
          important public health ramifications.<br>

          ...ESTEC's oxygen extraction is taking place using a method
          called molten salt electrolysis, involving placing regolith in
          a metal basket with molten calcium chloride salt to serve as

          regolith remains solid.<br>

          </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>A method is provided for producing metal by electrolytic
          reduction of a feedstock comprising an oxide of a first metal.
          The method comprises the steps of arranging the feedstock in
          contact with a cathode and a molten salt within an
          electrolysis cell, arranging an anode in contact with the
          molten salt within the electrolysis cell, and applying a
          potential between the anode and the cathode such that oxygen
          is removed from the feedstock. The anode comprises a second
          metal, which at the temperature of electrolysis within the
          cell is a molten metal. The second metal is a different metal
          to the first metal. Oxygen removed from the feedstock during
          electrolysis reacts with the molten second metal to form an
          oxide comprising the second metal. Thus, oxygen is not evolved
          as a gas at the molten anode.<br>

          <b>Ready-to-use Recipe for Turning Plant Waste into Gasoline</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Bioscience engineers at KU Leuven, Belgium, already knew how
          to make gasoline in the laboratory from plant waste such as
          sawdust. Now, the researchers have developed a road map, as it
          were, for industrial cellulose gasoline.<br>
          <br>
          In 2014, at KU Leuven’s Centre for Surface Chemistry and
          Catalysis, researchers succeeded in converting sawdust into
          building blocks for gasoline. A chemical process made it
          possible to convert the plant cellulose in sawdust into
          hydrocarbon chains. These hydrocarbons can be used as an
          additive in gasoline. The resulting cellulose gasoline is a
          second-generation biofuel, explains Professor Bert Sels. “We
          start with plant waste and use a chemical process to make a
          product that is a perfect replica of its petrochemical
          counterpart. In the end product, you can only tell the
          difference with fossil gasoline using carbon dating.”<br>
          <br>
          For this type of bio-refining, the researchers built a
          chemical reactor in their lab with which they can produce
          cellulose gasoline on a small scale. “But the question
          remained how the industry can integrate this and produce it in
          large quantities. Our researcher, Aron Deneyer, has now
          investigated this. He determined when in the existing
          petroleum refining process the cellulose is best added to the
          petroleum to obtain a strongly bio-sourced gasoline. In other
          words, we now have a ready-to-use recipe for cellulose
          gasoline that the industry can apply directly, without loss of
          quality for the gasoline and making maximum use of existing
          installations.”<br>
          <br>
          Cellulose gasoline must be seen as a transitional phase,
          Professor Sels says. “The cellulose is still mixed with
          petroleum. This gasoline will never be sourced 100 percent
          from renewable raw materials. Current consumption is too high
          to produce all gasoline from plant waste. However, our product
          does offer the possibility of using greener gasoline while a
          large proportion of the vehicles on our roads still run on
          liquid fuel. In the future, we will remain dependent on liquid
          fuels, albeit to a lesser extent, and then they may indeed be
          fully bio-based. We therefore suspect that the industry will
          show interest in this process.”<br>

          </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>There is an urgent need to address environmental problems
          caused by our transportation systems, which include the
          reduction of associated CO2 emissions. In the short term,
          renewable drop-in fuels are ideal, as they allow a direct
          integration into the existing infrastructure. However,
          preferably they would perform better than current alternatives
          (for example, bioethanol) and be synthesized in a more
          efficient way. Here we demonstrate the production of
          biogasoline with a direct upstream integration into processes
          in existing petrorefinery facilities that targets the 10%
          bio-based carbon in accordance with the current European Union
          directives (for 2020) for biofuels. To achieve this goal, we
          show the valorization of (hemi)cellulose pulp into light
          naphtha using a two-phase (H2O:organic) catalytic slurry
          process. A C5–C6 alkane stream, enriched with bio-derived
          carbon and compatible with further downstream petrorefinery
          operations for (bio)gasoline production, is automatically
          obtained by utilizing fossil light straight run naphtha as the
          organic phase. The ease of integration pleads for a joint
          petro/bio effort to gradually produce bio-enriched gasolines,
          wherein the chemical compounds of the bio-derived fraction are
          indistinguishable from those in current high-quality gasoline
          compositions.<br>

          valuable product families at high yield and purity from
          lignocellulosic biomass; the product families, merely
          comprising of stable products, are (i) a lignin oil enriched
          with high contents of lignin-derived (mono)phenolics, (ii)
          essentially humin (furanic oligomers)-free
          hemicellulose-derived polyols, and (iii) a cellulose pulp.
          This is achieved by processing biomass in a close to
          equivolumetric mixture of an alcohol (such as n-butanol) and
          water at elevated temperature, in the presence of a metal
          catalyst and hydrogen. During this one-pot fractionation
          process, the hot liquor disentangles the polymeric biomass and
          depolymerises lignin and hemicellulose, while the catalyst and
          reductive environment are essential to accumulate and target
          stable products at high yield (such as phenolics and polyols,
          respectively). The process is particularly industrially
          relevant because its overcomes difficult and complex
          separation protocols, at place in classic biorefinery
          technology; the process foresees simple product recuperation
          in one process step into the three fractions; the solid
          carbohydrate pulp (mainly cellulose) is retrieved upon
          filtration, while phase separation of n-butanol and water
          occurs below 125 °C, offering a facile and effective strategy
          to isolate lignin-derived phenolics, present in the alcohol
          (such as n- butanol phase) from polyols, present in the
          aqueous phase at the same time. The three resulting product
          streams provide a versatile platform for down-stream
          conversion towards added-value bio-based chemicals.<br>

          </b>...a breakthrough by researchers in Drexel’s College of
          Engineering, could now make installing an antenna as easy as
          applying some bug spray.<br>
          <br>
          In research recently published in Science Advances, the group
          reports on a method for spraying invisibly thin antennas, made
          from a type of two-dimensional, metallic material called
          MXene, that perform as well as those being used in mobile
          devices, wireless routers and portable transducers.<br>
          <br>
          “This is a very exciting finding because there is a lot of
          potential for this type of technology,” said Kapil Dandekar,
          Ph.D., a professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering in
          the College of Engineering, who directs the Drexel Wireless
          Systems Lab, and was a co-author of the research. “The ability
          to spray an antenna on a flexible substrate or make it
          optically transparent means that we could have a lot of new
          places to set up networks—there are new applications and new
          ways of collecting data that we can’t even imagine at the
          moment.”<br>
          <br>
          The researchers, from the College’s Department of Materials
          Science and Engineering, report that the MXene titanium
          carbide can be dissolved in water to create an ink or paint.
          The exceptional conductivity of the material enables it to
          transmit and direct radio waves, even when it’s applied in a
          very thin coating.<br>
          <br>
          “We found that even transparent antennas with thicknesses of
          tens of nanometers were able to communicate efficiently,” said
          Asia Sarycheva, a doctoral candidate in the A.J. Drexel
          Nanomaterials Institute and Materials Science and Engineering
          Department. “By increasing the thickness up to 8 microns, the
          performance of MXene antenna achieved 98 percent of its
          predicted maximum value.”<br>
          <br>
          Preserving transmission quality in a form this thin is
          significant because it would allow antennas to easily be
          embedded—literally, sprayed on—in a wide variety of objects
          and surfaces without adding additional weight or circuitry or
          requiring a certain level of rigidity.<br>
          <br>
          “This technology could enable the truly seamless integration
          of antennas with everyday objects which will be critical for
          the emerging Internet of Things,” Dandekar said. “Researchers
          have done a lot of work with non-traditional materials trying
          to figure out where manufacturing technology meets system
          needs, but this technology could make it a lot easier to
          answer some of the difficult questions we’ve been working on
          for years.”<br>
          <br>
          Initial testing of the sprayed antennas suggest that they can
          perform with the same range of quality as current antennas,
          which are made from familiar metals, like gold, silver, copper
          and aluminum, but are much thicker than MXene antennas. Making
          antennas smaller and lighter has long been a goal of materials
          scientists and electrical engineers, so this discovery is a
          sizeable step forward both in terms of reducing their
          footprint as well as broadening their application.<br>
          <br>
          “Current fabrication methods of metals cannot make antennas
          thin enough and applicable to any surface, in spite of decades
          of research and development to improve the performance of
          metal antennas,” said Yury Gogotsi, Ph.D., Distinguished
          University and Bach professor of Materials Science and
          Engineering in the College of Engineering, and Director of the
          A.J. Drexel Nanomaterials Institute, who initiated and led the
          project. “We were looking for two-dimensional nanomaterials,
          which have sheet thickness about hundred thousand times
          thinner than a human hair; just a few atoms across, and can
          self-assemble into conductive films upon deposition on any
          surface. Therefore, we selected MXene, which is a
          two-dimensional titanium carbide material, that is stronger
          than metals and is metallically conductive, as a candidate for
          ultra-thin antennas.”<br>
          <br>
          Drexel researchers discovered the family of MXene materials in
          2011 and have been gaining an understanding of their
          properties, and considering their possible applications, ever
          since. The layered two-dimensional material, which is made by
          wet chemical processing, has already shown potential in energy
          storage devices, electromagnetic shielding, water filtration,
          chemical sensing, structural reinforcement and gas separation.<br>
          <br>
          Naturally MXene materials have drawn comparisons to promising
          two-dimensional materials like graphene, which won the Nobel
          Prize in 2010 and has been explored as a material for
          printable antennas. In the paper, the Drexel researchers put
          the spray-on antennas up against a variety of antennas made
          from these new materials, including graphene, silver ink and
          carbon nanotubes. The MXene antennas were 50 times better than
          graphene and 300 times better than silver ink antennas in
          terms of preserving the quality of radio wave transmission.<br>
          <br>
          “The MXene antenna not only outperformed the macro and micro
          world of metal antennas, we went beyond the performance of
          available nanomaterial antennas, while keeping the antenna
          thickness very low,” said Babak Anasori, Ph.D., a research
          assistant professor in A.J. Drexel Nanomaterials Institute.
          “The thinnest antenna was as thin as 62 nanometers—about
          thousand times thinner than a sheet of paper—and it was almost
          transparent. Unlike other nanomaterials fabrication methods,
          that requires additives, called binders, and extra steps of
          heating to sinter the nanoparticles together, we made antennas
          in a single step by airbrush spraying our water-based MXene
          ink.”<br>

          </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), the
          demand for thin and wearable electronic devices is growing
          quickly. The essential part of the IoT is communication
          between devices, which requires radio-frequency (RF) antennas.
          Metals are widely used for antennas; however, their bulkiness
          limits the fabrication of thin, lightweight, and flexible
          antennas. Recently, nanomaterials such as graphene, carbon
          nanotubes, and conductive polymers came into play. However,
          poor conductivity limits their use. We show RF devices for
          wireless communication based on metallic two-dimensional (2D)
          titanium carbide (MXene) prepared by a single-step spray
          coating. We fabricated a ~100-nm-thick translucent MXene
          antenna with a reflection coefficient of less than &#8722;10 dB. By
          increasing the antenna thickness to 8 &#956;m, we achieved a
          reflection coefficient of &#8722;65 dB. We also fabricated a
          1-&#956;m-thick MXene RF identification device tag reaching a
          reading distance of 8 m at 860 MHz. Our finding shows that 2D
          titanium carbide MXene operates below the skin depth of copper
          or other metals as well as offers an opportunity to produce
          transparent antennas. Being the most conductive, as well as
          water-dispersible, among solution-processed 2D materials,
          MXenes open new avenues for manufacturing various classes of
          RF and other portable, flexible, and wearable electronic
          devices...<br>
          <br>
          <b>MXene synthesis</b><b><br>
          </b>The material used in this study was synthesized by
          selective etching of Al atomic layers from Ti3AlC2. One gram
          of Ti3AlC2 powder (particle size, &lt;44 &#956;m; Carbon-Ukraine)
          was gradually added to a 10 mL solution of 6 ml of 12 M
          hydrochloric acid, 3 ml of 49% hydrofluoric acid
          (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1 ml of deionized water (23). The mixture
          was kept in an ice bath for 10 min and then stirred for 24
          hours at room temperature. After etching, the mixture was
          washed five times by centrifugation in two 150-ml plastic
          centrifuge tubes at 3500 rpm for 2 min until the pH of the
          supernatant reached 7 to 6. After that, the sediment was added
          to a cold 20% solution of lithium chloride (LiCl) in water.
          The mixture was dispersed by manual shaking, stirred in an ice
          bath for 10 min, and then stirred at room temperature for 4
          hours. After that, MXene was washed three times until the
          supernatant becomes dark, which is an indication of the
          beginning of delamination. The unreacted Ti3AlC2 and large
          multilayered Ti3C2 particles were separated by centrifugation
          at 3500 rpm for 1 min, and the collected supernatant was used
          for spraying. Ti2C and Mo2TiC2 films were made as described
          elsewhere (22).<br>

          Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) have patented a
          novel design for rapidly spinning the gas in combustion
          engines to boost efficiency by 5-10%.<br>
          <br>
          The ability to absorb energy while being heated of an ideal
          spinning gas is greater than that of a stationary one. A gas
          rotating at roughly the speed of sound, when used in a
          thermodynamic cycle, could allow engines to operate at lower
          temperature more efficiently than conventional internal
          combustion engines.<br>
          <br>
          The invention uses an eight-cycle engine, rather than a
          four-cycle engine, in order to spin the gas at the right
          points in the cycle<br>

          </b><b>John Greenwald, Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory</b><b><br>
          </b><b><br>
          </b>When it comes to car and truck engines, not much has
          changed since Nikolaus Otto invented the modern internal
          combustion engine in 1876. But the internal combustion engine
          could, at least theoretically, be in for a big change.<br>
          esearchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Princeton
          Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) have received a patent from
          the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for a novel design that
          could increase the efficiency and reduce toxic emissions from
          gasoline-fueled internal combustion engines that power
          millions of cars and trucks around the world. The theoretical
          design lays out methods for rapidly spinning the gas inside
          internal combustion cylinders that engines use to propel
          vehicles.<br>
          <br>
          “The idea is to get net power out of engines working at lower
          temperature than otherwise thought possible and thereby reduce
          toxic nitrogen oxide emissions,” said PPPL physicist Nat
          Fisch, a Princeton professor of astrophysical sciences who is
          a co-developer of the patented method. The lead developer is
          physicist Vasily Geyko, who worked on the project as a
          graduate student in the Princeton Program in Plasma Physics at
          PPPL, which Fisch directs. <br>
          <br>
          The patent, which Fisch and Geyko initially applied for in
          2014, grew out of research the physicists were conducting on
          rapid spinning and compressing of plasma — the hot, charged
          soup of electrons and atomic nuclei — rather than gasoline.
          During the study, supported by the DOE’s National Nuclear
          Security Administration (NNSA) and the U.S. Defense Threat
          Reduction Agency, the researchers discovered that rapidly
          rotating a neutral gas could produce conditions that benefit <br>
          <br>
          However, Geyko and Fisch discovered that the heat capacity of
          an ideal spinning gas, its ability to absorb energy while
          being heated, is greater than that of a stationary one. The
          scientists then realized that a gas rotating at roughly the
          speed of sound, when used in a thermodynamic cycle, could
          allow engines to operate at lower temperature more efficiently
          than conventional internal combustion engines.<br>
          <br>
          As Geyko points out, “utilized for Otto or diesel cycles,”
          which power gasoline or diesel engines, “the heat capacity
          effect increases the thermodynamic efficiency for fixed
          maximum and minimum operating temperatures. Moreover, the
          relative efficiency gain is greater as maximum operating
          temperatures grow smaller. This makes the invention
          particularly beneficial for use in very low temperature
          engines.”<br>
          <br>
          The spinning gas also modifies the standard internal
          combustion engine design. “The invention features an
          eight-cycle engine, rather than a four-cycle engine, in order
          to spin the gas at the right points in the cycle,” said Fisch.
          “That complicates the engine, of course. And a conventional
          engine will be more efficient at conventional temperatures. <br>
          <br>
          “But at very low temperatures, where conventional engines
          operate with very poor efficiency, the emission of poisonous
          nitrogen oxides from burning gasoline will be significantly
          less. At those temperatures our invention might be practiced
          to advantage, with higher efficiency and fuel economy, with
          corresponding public health benefits from improved air quality
          through the reduction of the nitrogen oxides emission.”<br>
          <br>
          For now, the patented findings remain theoretical. But, for
          example, if Congress were to legislate a nationwide reduction
          in nitrogen oxide, the theoretical possibilities could be
          worth further development, Fisch said. “In principle,” added
          Geyko, “even a moderate reduction of allowed combustion
          temperatures, to around say 1,300-1,800 degrees Celsius from
          around 2,500 degrees Celsius, would be enough to achieve a
          relative efficiency advantage for a spinning gas-based engine
          of 5-to-10% as compared to a conventional Otto cycle
          engine.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

          </b>An internal combustion engine is disclosed and includes a
          main cylinder and main piston that are relatively axially
          displaceable along a main axis to define a variable volume
          main working chamber. At least one valve is configured to
          admit air and fuel into the working chamber forming an
          air/fuel mixture. The main cylinder is configured to cause the
          air/fuel mixture in the main cylinder to spin rapidly enough
          to cause a substantive change in the heat capacity of the
          air/fuel mixture creating a spinning air/fuel mixture. The
          main cylinder and main piston are configured to compress the
          spinning air/fuel mixture to create an ignitable spinning
          air/fuel mixture. The spinning air/fuel mixture is ignited and
          the main cylinder and main piston are configured to extract
          mechanical energy from the ignited spinning air/fuel mixture.
          An exhaust valve is configured to exhaust combustion products
          from the main working chamber.<br>

          </b><b>Precision Fermentation: What It Is, and How It Could
            Make Farming Obsolete</b><b><br>
          </b><b>By Edd Gent</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Concerns around the environmental impact of modern farming are
          causing us to reassess our relationship with food. But are
          claims that lab-grown food will replace agriculture in the
          coming decades realistic?<br>
          <br>
          British journalist and environmental activist George Monbiot
          made a stir last week with the release of his documentary
          Apocalypse Cow, in which he claims that a technology called
          “precision fermentation” could make traditional farming
          obsolete in just a few decades.<br>
          <br>
          In an article for The Guardian he contends that we will be
          able to produce the vast majority of our nutrients through
          industrial-scale brewing of single-celled organisms specially
          designed to produce particular compounds...<br>
          <br>
          n making his case for lab-grown food, Monbiot highlights the
          technology of Solar Foods, which uses solar energy to split
          water into oxygen and hydrogen to provide energy for microbes
          that then produce feedstocks. He claims this process is ten
          times as efficient as photosynthesis, and because everything
          is done in vats the land efficiency is roughly 20,000 times
          greater than arable farming.<br>
          <br>
          But the company clarified to New Scientist that when you take
          into account the land required for solar panels, it would only
          be around ten times more efficient than farming soya. More
          importantly, renewable energy like solar is still a limited
          resource at present, and one that can only be expanded so
          fast.<br>
          <br>
          Diverting it to power agriculture would inevitably lead to
          boosting carbon emissions elsewhere. And research has already
          shown that cultured meat produced using less sustainable
          energy sources could actually be worse for the climate.<br>
          <br>
          Monbiot’s plans also assume huge improvements in the
          capabilities of lab-grown food companies to create food that
          is both nutritious and palatable. Cultured meat is still a
          long way from being able to recreate the combinations of
          muscle, fat, and connective tissue that make a steak so
          delicious.<br>
          <br>
          More importantly, it will be incredibly hard to engineer
          anything as efficient as a plant at using solar energy to
          create food with the perfect balance of vitamins, minerals,
          and fiber, Cambridge University plant scientist David Hanke
          writes in a letter responding to Monbiot’s Guardian article.<br>
          <br>
          While supplying minerals to microbes would likely rely on
          intensive chemical processes, plants are capable of extracting
          trace elements from the environment. They can also build solar
          harvesting equipment without the huge cost and pollution that
          would be involved in building enough solar panels to power
          agriculture....<br>
          <br>
          There are also far more pressing and tractable places to apply
          technology if you want to improve the efficiency of our food
          supply chains, and therefore cut down their costs and
          environmental impact. The great tragedy of modern agriculture
          is that we already produce enough food for ten billion people,
          but a third of it goes to waste....<br>

          </b><b>The motion of electrons is not the cause of magnetic
            field</b><b><br>
          </b><b>Jean de Climont</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          The magnetic field of an electron beam is canceled when the
          beam is deviated by 90°. This occurs in the Cyclotron.
          Scientists have long known that the electron, proton or ion
          beam of cyclotrons do not have any magnetic field although
          they travel at speeds of tens of thousands of kilometer per
          second. It is therefore that the magnetic field can not result
          from the motion of electrons<br>
          <br>
          The question now is how a zero dimension charge rotation could
          produce a magnetic field?<br>
          <br>
          Many scientific reports, including several doctoral thesis,
          propose such a structure of electron. So that it could be that
          the intrinsic magnetic field of electrons should not be a
          result of the motion of the electric charge.<br>
          <br>
          But several experimental situations question also this idea
          strongly rooted in the deepest part of our mind that motion of
          charges would be the cause of magnetic fields.<br>
          <br>
          They are presented in a short video, but you may prefer read
          the text attached.<br>
          <br>
          The situation is very similar to what happens with the
          direction of the current in conductor which appears to be the
          opposite of what it had been thought before electron was
          discovered. In fact the change was not so dramatic!<br>
          The magnetic field of electrical current is directly a result
          of the intrinsic magnetic field of electrons. Would this
          change be so dramatic? <br>
          <br>
          It will avoid another problem. There are presently two
          potential causes of magnetic fields of conductors; the
          intrinsic magnetic field of electrons present in the
          conductors and their motion in the conductor. This is too
          much!<br>

          </b><i>Airplanes have a lot to learn from birds, and PigeonBot
            is teaching us about the magic of feathered flight</i><i><br>
          </i><b>By Evan Ackerman</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Birds have been doing their flying thing with flexible and
          feathery wings for about a hundred million years, give or
          take. And about a hundred years ago, give or take, humans
          decided that, although birds may be the flying experts, we’re
          just going to go off in our own direction with mostly rigid
          wings and propellers and stuff, because it’s easier or
          whatever. The few attempts at making artificial feathers that
          we’ve seen in the past have been sufficient for a few specific
          purposes but haven’t really come close to emulating the
          capabilities that real feathers bestow on the wings of birds.
          So a century later, we’re still doing the rigid wings with
          discrete flappy bits, while birds (one has to assume) continue
          to judge us for our poor choices.<br>
          <br>
          In a paper published today in Science Robotics, researchers at
          Stanford University have presented some new work on
          understanding exactly how birds maintain control by morphing
          the shape of their wings. They put together a flying robot
          called PigeonBot with a pair of “biohybrid morphing wings” to
          test out new control principles, and instead of trying to
          develop some kind of fancy new artificial feather system, they
          did something that makes a lot more sense: They cheated, by
          just using real feathers instead. <br>
          <br>
          The reason why robots are an important part of this research
          (which otherwise seems like it would be avian biology) is
          because there’s no good way to use a real bird as a test
          platform. As far as I know, you can’t exactly ask a pigeon to
          try and turn just using some specific wing muscles, but you
          can definitely program a biohybrid robot to do that. However,
          most of the other bioinspired flying robots that we’ve seen
          have been some flavor of ornithopter (rigid flapping wings),
          or they’ve used stretchy membrane wings, like bats.<br>
          <br>
          By examining real feathers, the Stanford researchers
          discovered that adjacent feathers stick to each other to
          resist sliding in one direction only using micron-scale
          features that researchers describe as “directional Velcro.”<br>
          <br>
          Feathers aren’t just more complicated to manufacture, but you
          have to find some way of replicating and managing all of the
          complex feather-on-feather interactions that govern wing
          morphing in real birds. For example, by examining real
          feathers, the researchers discovered that adjacent feathers
          stick to each other to resist sliding in one direction only
          using micron-scale features that researchers describe as
          “directional Velcro,” something “new to science and
          technology.” Real feathers can slide to allow the wing to
          morph, but past a certain point, the directional Velcro
          engages to keep gaps from developing in the wing surface.
          There are additional practical advantages, too: “they are
          softer, lighter, more robust, and easier to get back into
          shape after a crash by simply preening ruffled feathers
          between one’s fingers.”<br>
          <br>
          With the real feathers elastically connected to a pair of
          robotic bird wings with wrist and finger joints that can be
          actuated individually, PigeonBot relies on its biohybrid
          systems for maneuvering, while thrust and a bit of additional
          stabilizing control comes from a propeller and a conventional
          tail. The researchers found that PigeonBot’s roll could be
          controlled with just the movement of the finger joint on the
          wing, and that this technique is inherently much more stable
          than the aileron roll used by conventional aircraft, as
          corresponding author David Lentink, head of Stanford's
          Bio-Inspired Research &amp; Design (BIRD) Lab, describes:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other cool thing we found is that the
          morphing wing asymmetry results automatically in a steady roll
          angle. In contrast aircraft aileron left-right asymmetry
          results in a roll rate, which the pilot or autopilot then has
          to stop to achieve a steady roll angle. Controlling a banked
          turn via roll angle is much simpler than via roll rate. We
          think it may enable birds to fly more stably in turbulence,
          because wing asymmetry corresponds to an equilibrium angle
          that the wings automatically converge to. If you are flying in
          turbulence and have to control the robot or airplane attitude
          via roll rate in response to many stochastic perturbations,
          roll angle has to be actively adjusted continuously without
          any helpful passive dynamics of the wing. Although this
          finding requires more research and testing, it shows how
          aerospace engineers can find inspiration to think outside of
          the box by studying how birds fly. <br>
          <br>
          The researchers suggest that the directional Velcro technology
          is one of the more important results of this study, and while
          they’re not pursuing any of the numerous potential
          applications, they’ve “decided to not patent this finding to
          help proliferate our discovery to the benefit of society at
          large” in the hopes that anyone who makes a huge pile of money
          off of it will (among other things) invest in bird
          conservation in gratitude.<br>
          <br>
          As for PigeonBot itself, Lentink says he’d like to add a
          biohybrid morphing tail, as well as legs with grasping feet,
          and additional actuators for wing folding and twisting and
          flapping. And maybe make it fly autonomously, too. Sound good
          to me—that kind of robot would be great at data transfer.<br>

          </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>Since the Wright Flyer, engineers have strived to develop
          flying machines with morphing wings that can control flight as
          deftly as birds. Birds morph their wing planform parameters
          simultaneously—including sweep, span, and area—in a way that
          has proven to be particularly challenging to embody
          robotically. Previous solutions have primarily centered around
          the classical aerospace paradigm of controlling every degree
          of freedom to ensure predictable performance, but underperform
          compared with birds. To understand how birds accomplish wing
          morphing, we measured the kinematics of wing flexion and
          extension in common pigeons, Columba livia. The skeletal and
          feather kinematics show that the 20 primary and 20 secondary
          feathers are coordinated via approximately linear transfer
          functions controlled by wrist and finger motion. To replicate
          this control principle in a robot, we developed a biohybrid
          morphing wing with real feathers to understand the underlying
          design principles. The outcome, PigeonBot, embodies 42 degrees
          of freedom that control the position of 40 elastically
          connected feathers via four servo-actuated wrist and finger
          joints. Our flight tests demonstrate that the soft feathered
          wings morph rapidly and robustly under aerodynamic loading.
          They not only enable wing morphing but also make robot
          interactions safer, the wing more robust to crashing, and the
          wing reparable via “preening.” In flight tests, we found that
          both asymmetric wrist and finger motion can initiate turn
          maneuvers—evidence that birds may use their fingers to steer
          in flight.<br>

          </b><b>A robot equipped with real pigeon feathers flies like a
            living bird</b><b><br>
          </b><b>By Jason Arunn Murugesu </b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          A robot that resembles a pigeon and can make tight turns like
          real birds may point to the future of aerospace engineering –
          a continuously morphing wing.<br>
          <br>
          Understanding exactly how birds fly has always been tricky,
          because individual wings are made up of multiple feathers.
          These feathers are always interacting with each other,
          allowing the bird’s wings to morph continuously mid-flight.<br>
          <br>
          To learn more, David Lentink at Stanford University in
          California and his colleagues first looked at the wing of a
          pigeon cadaver. Each wing had 40 feathers, 20 on the upper
          side, and 20 on the lower.<br>
          <br>
          “We attached a marker onto each individual wing and we were
          able to carefully measure the relationship between feather
          motion and bone motion,” says Lentink. “We then just moved the
          wing, in and out.”<br>
          <br>
          They found that the wrist angle determined the angles of all
          the flight feathers at any one time, meaning that the birds
          can change the shape of their wings without having to control
          each individual feather. This reduces the number of variables
          – or degrees of freedom – required to model the wings.<br>
          <br>
          “We let go of the idea that you have to control every degree
          of freedom and I think future aircraft will benefit from this
          finding. Future airplanes may not flap their wings, but I
          think they will change shape,” says Lentink.<br>
          <br>
          The team put this new finding to use in the construction of
          PigeonBot, a intended to recreate pigeon flight. It is powered
          by a propeller and has wrist and feather joints in each wing
          that can be controlled remotely. Its average speed is about 40
          kilometres per hour, which is a bit slower than the average
          pigeon.<br>
          <br>
          Lentink and his colleagues also found that this type of flight
          was possible only because of certain molecules embedded
          throughout the feathers. These molecules, which are just 10
          micrometres across, allow feathers to move away from each
          other while ensuring they don’t get too far apart. This in
          turn reduces the level of individual feather control required
          for accurate flight.<br>
          <br>
          PigeonBot also uses real pigeon feathers, because no synthetic
          material has this property. “Feathers also have these unique
          properties, they have a lightness, a firmness to carry the
          aerodynamic load, and they’re easy to repair,” says Lentink.<br>

          </b><b>Wing shapes take flight</b><b><br>
          </b>Birds can dynamically alter the shape of their wings
          during flight, although how this is accomplished is poorly
          understood. Matloff et al. found that two mechanisms control
          the movement of the individual feathers. Whenever the skeleton
          moves, the feathers are redistributed passively through
          compliance of the elastic connective tissue at the feather
          base. To prevent the feathers from spreading too far apart,
          hook-shaped microstructures on adjacent feathers form a
          directional fastener that locks adjacent feathers. These
          features are found across a range of bird sizes; however,
          because the detachment of the hooks is noisy, they are notably
          absent in silent fliers, such as barn owls.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>Variable feather overlap enables birds to morph their
          wings, unlike aircraft. They accomplish this feat by means of
          elastic compliance of connective tissue, which passively
          redistributes the overlapping flight feathers when the
          skeleton moves to morph the wing planform. Distinctive
          microstructures form “directional Velcro,” such that when
          adjacent feathers slide apart during extension, thousands of
          lobate cilia on the underlapping feathers lock
          probabilistically with hooked rami of overlapping feathers to
          prevent gaps. These structures unlock automatically during
          flexion. Using a feathered biohybrid aerial robot, we
          demonstrate how both passive mechanisms make morphing wings
          robust to turbulence. We found that the hooked microstructures
          fasten feathers across bird species except silent fliers,
          whose feathers also lack the associated Velcro-like noise.
          These findings could inspire innovative directional fasteners
          and morphing aircraft.<br>

            </b></b><b>'Monumental': Scientists successfully grow
            mysterious ancient organism that could be origin of life as
            we know it</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          &nbsp;A team of researchers has unravelled a scientific
          mystery by successfully growing an ancient life form in a lab,
          a breakthrough that brings us one step closer to discovering
          our very first ancestors on Earth.<br>
          <br>
          The previously unknown organism was unearthed on the floor of
          the Arctic ocean in 2010. It was dubbed Lokiarchaeota in honor
          of the Loki’s Castle hydrothermal vent where it was found.<br>
          <br>
          What made the finding significant was that the peculiar
          organism was a type of microbe, called an Archaea, but it
          appeared to have characteristics of a completely separate type
          of early life form, a eukaryote. Significantly, all animals,
          including humans, that have ever walked on Earth are
          eukaryotes.<br>
          <br>
          However, doubt hung over the stunning discovery, with some
          claiming that it was the result of contamination. That doubt
          has finally been laid to rest after a team of Japanese
          scientists, who were already studying deep sea microbes,
          managed to isolate Lokiarchaeota and regrow it in a
          laboratory.<br>
          <br>
          To achieve this the researchers collected deep sea sediment
          core from the Nankai Trough, 2,533 metres (8,310 feet) below
          sea level, off the coast of Japan in 2006. They then carefully
          cultivated the samples for five years in a methane-fed system,
          to mimic the conditions of a deep-sea methane vent. <br>
          <br>
          The team then placed the samples in glass tubes, fed them with
          nutrients and watched to see what would develop. After a year
          the first faint signs of Lokiarchaeota started to develop. <br>
          <br>
          After several more years the patient scientists had developed
          a healthy population of the strange organism. They named their
          cultivated microbe Prometheoarchaeum syntrophicum - after
          Prometheus, who created humans out of clay in Greek mythology.<br>
          <br>
          Further testing revealed that the organism only grew in
          conjunction with one or two other microbes and it had long
          tentacles sprouting from its body, under which the partner
          microbes nestled.<br>
          <br>
          In their paper, published in Nature this week, the scientists
          hypothesized that the adaptable organism could have switched
          its partners to bacteria that used oxygen as that vital
          element started increasing on Earth. This crucial move would
          have increased its chances for survival and could have set the
          course for life as we know it.<br>
          <br>
          “This is a monumental paper that reflects a tremendous amount
          of work and perseverance,” evolutionary microbiologist Thijs
          Ettema, who wasn't involved with the research, told Nature.
          “It's a major step forward in understanding this important
          lineage.”<br>

          <br>
          <b>Progress and Potential</b><br>
          Engineered living building materials (LBMs) use biology to
          confer multiple functionalities to materials for the built
          environment. Microorganisms can be leveraged for multiple
          purposes in the design of LBMs, including increasing the rate
          of manufacturing, imparting mechanical benefit, and sustaining
          biological function. In this work, we used photosynthetic
          microorganisms to biomineralize inert sand-gelatin scaffolds
          to create LBMs. These materials are capable of exponential
          regeneration of the living component in response to physical
          switches. Thus, from one starting generation of material,
          multiple regenerations are produced on demand. In this study,
          microorganism-precipitated calcium carbonate conferred high
          fracture toughness to the LBMs. More broadly, LBMs represent a
          platform technology whereby biology can be leveraged to
          potentially deliver multiple functionalities to infrastructure
          materials by design.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Summary</b><br>
          Living building materials (LBMs) were engineered that are
          capable of both biological and structural functions. LBMs were
          created by inoculating an inert structural sand-hydrogel
          scaffold with Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, a photosynthetic
          cyanobacterium. The scaffold provided structural support for
          Synechococcus, which toughened the hydrogel matrix via calcium
          carbonate biomineralization. Temperature and humidity switches
          were utilized to regulate the metabolic activity of the
          microorganisms and achieve three successive regenerations of
          viable LBMs from one parent generation. Microbial viability in
          LBMs maintained in at least 50% relative humidity for 30 days
          was 9%–14%, which far exceeded literature values of
          microorganisms encapsulated in cementitious materials for
          similar timeframes (0.1%–0.4%). While structural function was
          maximized at ultradesiccated conditions, prolonged dehydration
          compromised microbial viability. Despite this tradeoff in
          biological-structural function, LBMs represent a platform
          technology that leverages biology to impart novel sensing,
          responsive, and regenerative multifunctionality to structural
          materials for the built environment.<br>

          <br>
          This is the building where Pope Francis watched the creepy
          circus perform in. It’s called the Papal Audience Hall
          building, and as you can see, the building inside and out is
          in the shape of a giant snake. Have a look at the image below
          and compare its shape to the image of a snake beside it. Note
          the overall shape — wide back, narrow, rounded front, eyes in
          the middle, nostril at the front, and curved top. So even from
          the outside and viewed from the sky, the entire building is a
          dead-ringer for a snake’s head.<br>

          devices. Its doesn’t have to be Silver and the ‘charged’ water
          has a myriad of other uses. <br>
          <br>
          The simple 4 silver rods comprising the Silver Joe cell is a
          marvel in Magnetic Field creation devices that doesn’t use
          coiled wires to create a Magnetic Field. Instead it uses the
          90 degree interaction of one ‘electric’ Pole or Field in
          proximity to another. With just two wires like the standard
          (colloidal) silver makers, the electrical energy doesn’t
          create a “Field” and so the energy has no where to go but to
          the opposite pole or electrode and this deconstructs its own
          energy matrix.<br>
          <br>
          With 4 silver rods, two are Pos+ and 2 are Neg- in a diagonal
          format. This sees the energy available along the entire length
          of the wire when immersed within a magnetic field conducting
          solution. Rather than a “straight line” flow (like a straight
          wire in an electric jug) The 2 Neg wires have more than one
          place, for the energy to flow to thus creating a magnetic
          field that interacts with the water with a “signature” of
          Silver Memory. This electro-magnetically restructures the
          water into silver.<br>

          <b>The Role of Geomagnetic Field Intensity in Late Quaternary
            Evolution of Humans and Large Mammals</b><b><br>
          </b><b>J. E. T. Channell, L. Vigliotti</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>It has long been speculated that biological evolution was
          influenced by ultraviolet radiation (UVR) reaching the Earth's
          surface, despite imprecise knowledge of the timing of both UVR
          flux and evolutionary events. The past strength of Earth's
          dipole field provides a proxy for UVR flux because of its role
          in maintaining stratospheric ozone. The timing of Quaternary
          evolutionary events has become better constrained by fossil
          finds, improved radiometric dating, use of dung fungi as
          proxies for herbivore populations, and improved ages for nodes
          in human phylogeny from human mitochondrial DNA and Y
          chromosomes. The demise of Neanderthals at ~41 ka can now be
          closely tied to the intensity minimum associated with the
          Laschamp magnetic excursion, and the survival of anatomically
          modern humans can be attributed to differences in the aryl
          hydrocarbon receptor that has a key role in the evolutionary
          response to UVR flux. Fossil occurrences and dung&#8208;fungal
          proxies in Australia indicate that episodes of Late Quaternary
          extinction of mammalian megafauna occurred close to the
          Laschamp and Blake magnetic excursions. Fossil and dung fungal
          evidence for the age of the Late Quaternary extinction in
          North America (and Europe) coincide with a prominent decline
          in geomagnetic field intensity at ~13 ka. Over the last ~200
          kyr, phylogeny based on mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosomes in
          modern humans yields nodes and bifurcations in evolution
          corresponding to geomagnetic intensity minima, which supports
          the proposition that UVR reaching Earth's surface influenced
          mammalian evolution with the loci of extinction controlled by
          the geometry of stratospheric ozone depletion.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Plain Language Summary</b><b><br>
          </b>The strength of Earth's magnetic field in the past,
          recorded by rocks and sediments, provides a proxy for past
          flux of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) to Earth's surface due to
          the role of the field in modulating stratigraphic ozone. About
          40,000 years ago, mammalian fossils in Australia and Eurasia
          record an important die&#8208;off of large mammals that included
          Neanderthals in Europe. In the Americas and Europe, a large
          mammalian die&#8208;off appears to have occurred ~13,000 years ago.
          Both die&#8208;offs can be linked to minima in Earth's magnetic
          field strength implying that UVR flux variations to Earth's
          surface influenced mammalian evolution. For the last ~200,000
          years, estimates of the timing of branching episodes in the
          human evolutionary tree, from modern and fossil DNA and Y
          chromosomes, can be linked to minima in field strength, which
          implies a long&#8208;term role for UVR in human evolution. New
          fossil finds, improved fossil dating, knowledge of the past
          strength of Earth's magnetic field, and refinements in the
          human evolutionary tree, are sharpening the focus on a
          possible link between UVR arriving at the Earth's surface,
          magnetic field strength, and events in mammalian evolution.<br>

          </b><b>ARIA BENDIX</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          According to new research from New York University, flame
          retardants resulted in a loss of 162 million IQ points among
          children in the US between 2001 and 2016.<br>
          <br>
          The study, published Tuesday in the journal Molecular and
          Cellular Endocrinology, looked at the four chemicals known to
          impact the brain of a developing child most: lead, mercury,
          pesticides, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (otherwise
          known as flame retardants).<br>
          <br>
          Leo Trasande, a paediatrician and public-health researcher at
          NYU who co-authored the study, described these pollutants as
          "hit-and-run" chemicals: Once a child is exposed to them,
          there's no reversing the damage.<br>
          <br>
          "Kids' brain development is exquisitely vulnerable," Trasande
          told Business Insider. "If you disrupt, even with subtle
          effects, the way a child's brain is wired, you can have
          permanent and lifelong consequences."<br>
          <br>
          The study found that lead cost US kids 78 million IQ points
          during the 15-year period studied, while pesticides caused a
          loss of nearly 27 million IQ points during those years.
          Mercury, meanwhile, caused a loss of 2.5 million IQ points...<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>Endocrine disrupting chemicals are known to cause
          neurodevelopmental toxicity through direct and indirect
          pathways. In this study we used data from the National Health
          and Nutrition Examination Surveys, along with known
          exposure-disease relationships, to quantify the intellectual
          disability burden attributable to in utero exposure to
          polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), organophosphates, and
          methylmercury and early life exposure to lead. We also
          estimated the cost of the IQ points lost and cases of
          intellectual disability. PBDE exposure was the greatest
          contributor to intellectual disability burden, resulting in a
          total of 162 million IQ points lost and over 738,000 cases of
          intellectual disability. This was followed by lead,
          organophosphates, and methylmercury. From 2001 to 2016, IQ
          loss from PBDEs, methylmercury, and lead have decreased or
          remained stagnant. Organophosphate exposure measurements were
          only available up to 2008 but did show an increase in
          organophosphate-attributable IQ loss. Although most of these
          trends show benefit for children's neurodevelopmental health,
          they may also point towards the use of potentially harmful
          substitutions for chemicals that are being phased out.<br>

          </b><b>Mexican Entrepreneurs Create Vegan Cactus Leather</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Two entrepreneurs in Mexico have developed a durable vegan
          leather from cactus, and it could very well replace animal
          leather!<br>
          <br>
          Adrian Lopez Velarde and Marte Cazarez came together to create
          a cruelty-free alternative to animal leather, and just last
          month, they debuted Desserto, a first-of-it’s-kind organic
          leather made entirely from nopal or prickly-pear cactus.<br>
          <br>
          Apart from being natural and cruelty-free, the material also
          meets the specifications of several industries and can be used
          in: Fashion, Leather goods, Furniture, Automobiles<br>
          <br>
          It’s also flexible, breathable and durable, making it an ideal
          replacement for animal and synthetic leather. The touch and
          feel of the material is also soft and very similar to real
          leather. “After two years of research and development, we
          managed to produce a suitable material that complies with the
          features and technical/mechanical specifications required by
          those industries that use animal and synthetic leather,” said
          Lopez.<br>
          <br>
          The product is also highly sustainable with a lower carbon
          footprint than other leather alternatives. It also happens to
          be: Less water intensive, Free from phthalates, Free from
          toxic chemicals, PVC-free<br>
          <br>
          The duo showcased the product last month at the International
          Leather Fair Lineappelle in Milan, Italy.<br>
          <br>
          Plant-based leather alternatives are a growing market, with
          innovators turning to pineapple, olives and coconuts to
          produce eco-friendly materials. Earlier this year, high-street
          retailer H&amp;M unveiled a vegan jacket made from pineapple
          leather, while German footwear brand thies launched a line of
          leather shoes made from olive leaves. Closer to home,
          Kerala-based brand Malai fashions leather and accessories from
          coconuts!<br>

          </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>The primo vascular system (PVS) was first introduced by
          Bong-Han Kim via his five research reports. Among these the
          third report was most extensive and conclusive in terms of the
          PVS anatomy and physiology relating to the acupuncture
          meridians. His study results, unfortunately, were not
          reproduced by other scientists because he did not describe the
          materials and methods in detail. In 2002, a research team in
          Seoul National University reinitiated the PVS research,
          confirmed the existence of PVS in various organs, and
          discovered new characteristics of PVS. Two important examples
          are as follows: PVS was found in the adipose tissue and around
          cancer tissues. In parallel to these new findings, new methods
          for observing and identifying PVS were developed. Studies on
          the cell and material content inside the PVS, including the
          immune function cells and stem cells, are being progressed. In
          this review, Bong-Han Kim’s study results in his third report
          are summarized, and the new results after him are briefly
          reviewed. In the last section, the obstacles in finding the
          PVS in the skin as an anatomical structure of acupuncture
          meridian are discussed.<br>

          Kim Bong-han (Korean: &#44608;&#48393;&#54620;; born 1916) is a North Korean
          medical surgeon at Pyongyang Medical University and Kyung-Rak
          institute (KRI). He is primarily known for his research on a
          proposed mechanism for acupuncture that was not accepted by
          the mainstream medical community[1] that has come to be called
          the "primo-vascular system".[2] He received the People's Prize
          for his research. The primo vascular system was claimed to be
          scientifically confirmed in 2002,[3] but the matter remains
          controversial. In 1966 the Kyung-Rak institute was closed, and
          Kim disappeared...<br>

          </b><b>EKG proof – Smart meters damage your heart</b><b><br>
          </b><b><br>
          </b>...The results are visible – and undeniable<br>
          <br>
          The video (below) shows Warren Woodward, a specialist in smart
          meter microwave transmission power, connected to an EKG
          monitor while lying near an Elster smart meter. The Elster is
          connected to a high frequency analyzer, which measures
          microwave frequencies.<br>
          <br>
          As the HFA alternates between readings of 00.1 and 00.2, the
          EKG laptop monitor display – which shows the electrical
          activity of Woodward’s heart – indicates a regular,
          symmetrical pattern. When the meter momentarily spikes to
          139.3, there is a corresponding – and drastic – alteration in
          Woodward’s EKG pattern.<br>
          <br>
          According to Dr. Gilberto Leon, a holistic medicine doctor in
          Chandler, AZ, the symmetrical pattern represents the
          characteristic waves of normal heart rhythm. The sudden
          irregularity, which he describes as a “massive” change in the
          pattern, occurs at a time when Woodward’s heart should be
          resting.<br>
          <br>
          Over time, this type of reaction makes the heart work too
          hard, causing fatigued cardiac function, Leon says. And, the
          process is symptomless and “silent” – especially in healthy
          people, who may not feel the disruption...<br>

          The evidence in this video is a world first, and shifts the
          debate from whether anyone should have to pay a fee to refuse
          a "smart" meter to: When does the safety recall start?<br>
          <br>

          <div align="center"><b>Game-changing new stem cell treatment
              REVERSES aging in mouse brains </b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          &nbsp;In what could prove to be a game changer for us humans,
          scientists have discovered how to make old brains young and
          young brains stronger and more effective using targeted stem
          cell therapy on mice.<br>
          <br>
          The team wanted to investigate if increasing the number of
          stem cells in the brain would help in recovering cognitive
          functions, like learning and memory, that had worsened or had
          been lost entirely during the aging process. <br>
          <br>
          To do so, researchers from TU Dresden’s Center for
          Regenerative Therapies used a method to stimulate and increase
          the number of neural stem cells located in the brains of mice
          and thus increase the number of neurons they generate. <br>
          <br>
          Much to their surprise, the newly generated neurons survived
          and formed new contacts in neighboring brain cells. To put
          these freshly minted neurons to the test, the boffins then
          tested the navigational abilities of the test subject mice. <br>
          <br>
          Mice and humans develop strategies for navigation in much the
          same way: when both species are young, our brains build and
          remember cognitive maps of an environment. As we age, however,
          this ability fades significantly.<br>
          <br>
          Older mammalian brains must instead learn the list of detailed
          navigational steps to reach a target destination within an
          environment with little to no access to the overall cognitive
          map. This means that, should the starting point change in the
          same environment, it would take far longer to navigate to the
          end destination. <br>
          <br>
          By stimulating the neural stem cells in their brains, the old
          mice in the study successfully recovered their cognitive
          mapping ability, and remembered the layout of a given
          environment for far longer, effectively reversing the effects
          of the aging process on this particular skill. <br>
          <br>
          “Age-related impairments can be rescued by hijacking the
          endogenous neurogenic potential of the brain, thus,
          rejuvenating its function,” explained Professor Federico
          Calegari, senior author of the study.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers took it one step further and carried out the
          same neural stem cell stimulation treatment on the brains of
          young mice and found that cognitive impairments were delayed
          and memory was preserved for longer over the course of their
          lives. <br>
          <br>
          A part of the brain known as the hippocampus is crucial for
          remembering places and events but this degrades over time and,
          as a result, older brains use other structures that are more
          closely associated with habit-forming. The researchers now
          believe they can delay this switch and thus improve overall
          cognition throughout an animal’s lifespan, though this
          treatment is of course some time away from human trials. <br>

          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>In contrast to the corresponding cells of the developing
          embryo the expansion of somatic stem and progenitor cells
          revealed particularly difficult to expand both in vitro and in
          vivo . The object of the invention is to provide compositions
          and methods that allow the expansion of somatic stem and
          progenitor cells, in particular neural stem cells (NSC) and
          neural progenitor cells (NPC), in vitro and in particular in
          vivo . The object of the invention is solved by a vector that
          contains genes encoding a cyclin dependet kinase (cdk) and a
          cyclin forming a G1-specific cdk/cyclin protein complex,
          preferably cdk4 and cyclinD1 (cycD1).<br>

              nuclear wastewater</b><br>
            <b>by David L. Chandler, Massachusetts Institute of
              Technology</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Nuclear power continues to expand globally, propelled, in
          part, by the fact that it produces few greenhouse gas
          emissions while providing steady power output. But along with
          that expansion comes an increased need for dealing with the
          large volumes of water used for cooling these plants, which
          becomes contaminated with radioactive isotopes that require
          special long-term disposal. <br>
          <br>
          Now, a method developed at MIT provides a way of substantially
          reducing the volume of contaminated water that needs to be
          disposed of, instead concentrating the contaminants and
          allowing the rest of the water to be recycled through the
          plant's cooling system. The proposed system is described in
          the journal Environmental Science and Technology, in a paper
          by graduate student Mohammad Alkhadra, professor of chemical
          engineering Martin Bazant, and three others.<br>
          <br>
          The method makes use of a process called shock
          electrodialysis, which uses an electric field to generate a
          deionization shockwave in the water. The shockwave pushes the
          electrically charged particles, or ions, to one side of a tube
          filled with charged porous material, so that concentrated
          stream of contaminants can be separated out from the rest of
          the water. The group discovered that two radionuclide
          contaminants—isotopes of cobalt and cesium—can be selectively
          removed from water that also contains boric acid and lithium.
          After the water stream is cleansed of its cobalt and cesium
          contaminants, it can be reused in the reactor.<br>
          <br>
          The shock electrodialysis process was initially developed by
          Bazant and his co-workers as a general method of
          removing&nbsp; salt from water, as demonstrated in their first
          scalable prototype four years ago. Now, the team has focused
          on this more specific application, which could help improve
          the economics and environmental impact of working nuclear
          power plants. In ongoing research, they are also continuing to
          develop a system for removing other contaminants, including
          lead, from drinking water.<br>
          <br>
          Not only is the new system inexpensive and scalable to large
          sizes, but in principle it also can deal with a wide range of
          contaminants, Bazant says. "It's a single device that can
          perform a whole range of separations for any specific
          application," he says.<br>
          <br>
          In their earlier desalination work, the researchers used
          measurements of the water's electrical conductivity to
          determine how much salt was removed. In the years since then,
          the team has developed other methods for detecting and
          quantifying the details of what's in the concentrated
          radioactive waste and the cleaned water<br>
          <br>
          "We carefully measure the composition of all the stuff going
          in and out," says Bazant, who is the E.G. Roos Professor of
          Chemical Engineering as well as a professor of mathematics.
          "This really opened up a new direction for our research." They
          began to focus on separation processes that would be useful
          for health reasons or that would result in concentrating
          material that has high value, either for reuse or to offset
          disposal costs.<br>
          <br>
          The method they developed works for sea water desalination,
          but it is a relatively energy-intensive process for that
          application. The energy cost is dramatically lower when the
          method is used for ion-selective separations from dilute
          streams such as nuclear plant cooling water. For this
          application, which also requires expensive disposal, the
          method makes economic sense, he says. It also hits both of the
          team's targets: dealing with high-value materials and helping
          to safeguard health. The scale of the application is also
          significant—a single large nuclear plant can circulate about
          10 million cubic meters of water per year through its cooling
          system, Alkhadra says<br>
          <br>
          For their tests of the system, the researchers used simulated
          nuclear wastewater based on a recipe provided by Mitsubishi
          Heavy Industries, which sponsored the research and is a major
          builder of nuclear plants. In the team's tests, after a
          three-stage separation process, they were able to remove 99.5
          percent of the cobalt radionuclides in the water while
          retaining about 43 percent of the water in cleaned-up form so
          that it could be reused. As much as two-thirds of the water
          can be reused if the cleanup level is cut back to 98.3 percent
          of the contaminants removed, the team found.<br>
          <br>
          While the overall method has many potential applications, the
          nuclear wastewater separation, is "one of the first problems
          we think we can solve [with this method] that no other
          solution exists for," Bazant says. No other practical,
          continuous, economic method has been found for separating out
          the radioactive isotopes of cobalt and cesium, the two major
          contaminants of nuclear wastewater, he adds.<br>
          <br>
          While the method could be used for routine cleanup, it could
          also make a big difference in dealing with more extreme cases,
          such as the millions of gallons of contaminated water at the
          damaged Fukushima Daichi power plant in Japan, where the
          accumulation of that contaminated water has threatened to
          overpower the containment systems designed to prevent it from
          leaking out into the adjacent Pacific. While the new system
          has so far only been tested at much smaller scales, Bazant
          says that such large-scale decontamination systems based on
          this method might be possible "within a few years." <br>

              from Contaminated Water by Shock Electrodialysis</b><br>

          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>The increasing popularity of nuclear energy necessitates
          development of new methods to treat water that becomes
          contaminated with radioactive substances. Because this
          polluted water comprises several dissolved species (not all of
          which are radioactive), selective accumulation of the
          radionuclides is desirable to minimize the volume of nuclear
          waste and to facilitate its containment or disposal. In this
          article, we use shock electrodialysis to selectively,
          continuously, and efficiently remove cobalt and cesium from a
          feed of dissolved lithium, cobalt, cesium, and boric acid.
          This formulation models the contaminated water commonly found
          in light-water reactors and in other nuclear processes. In a
          three-pass process, a consistent trade-off is observed between
          the recovery of decontaminated water and the percentage of
          cobalt removed, which offers flexibility in operating the
          system. For example, 99.5% of cobalt can be removed with a
          water recovery of 43%, but up to 66% of the water can be
          recovered if deionization of cobalt is allowed to drop to
          98.3%. In general, the energy consumed during this process
          (ranging between 1.76 and 4.8 kW h m–3) is low because only
          charged species are targeted and virtually no energy is
          expended removing boric acid, the most abundant species in
          solution.<br>

              Collecting Bubble Barrier</b><br>
            <b>by Dan Edel</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          An innovative way to collect plastic waste has begun operation
          in Amsterdam, known as The Great Bubble Barrier. This is
          designed to collect the plastic before it can reach the North
          Sea.<br>
          <br>
          Bubble Barrier is a Dutch start-up. What they’ve come up with
          is a way to divert plastic without interfering with fish and
          other natural habitats. As the company points out, every
          minute the equivalent of one full garbage truck of plastic is
          dumped into the sea! That equates to 8 billion kilos of
          plastic trash per year.<br>
          <br>
          Tests have shown that it’s possible to divert more than 80% of
          floating debris in rivers and canals. Philip Ehrhorn,
          co-inventor of the barrier, states: “More than two-thirds of
          plastics in the ocean leave rivers and canals, so if you have
          to intercept it, why not start from its origin?<br>
          <br>
          Ehrhorn is an ocean engineer and German naval architect who
          studied in Australia in 2015. While overseas, he visited a
          water treatment plant and was inspired by the idea. “On one
          stage they aerate the water, and on a large surface they put
          air bubbles like a large Jacuzzi,” he said.<br>
          <br>
          He goes on to explain his thoughts:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The little pieces of plastic that people
          throw into the bathroom were collected in a corner and that
          was the kind of spark for me. If you can guide the plastic to
          one side, can’t you do it in a more directed and purposeful
          way in a river?<br>
          <br>
          As reported in The Guardian, it was around the same time when
          three Dutch amateur sailors and friends, Anne Marieke
          Eveleens, Francis Zoet, and Saskia Studer, came up with an
          idea for a curtain of bubbles to separate waste. The team of
          friends and Ehrhorn ended up getting together to work on their
          ideas. Back in September, the team also won the ‘Postcode
          lottery green challenge’ funding with the prize money of
          €500,000.<br>
          <br>
          What they came up with is a bubble barrier. This 60-meter
          perforated tube runs diagonally along the bottom of the
          historic Amsterdam canal belt. A compressed air system pumps
          bubbles into the canal and the natural flow of water helps
          push the trash to the side, where it is trapped in a
          collection platform net to Westerdokskade.<br>

              mineralization frontier ensuring epitaxial growth</b><br>
            <b>Changyu Shao, et al.</b><br>
          </div>
          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>The regeneration of tooth enamel, the hardest biological
          tissue, remains a considerable challenge because its
          complicated and well-aligned apatite structure has not been
          duplicated artificially. We herein reveal that a rationally
          designed material composed of calcium phosphate ion clusters
          can be used to produce a precursor layer to induce the
          epitaxial crystal growth of enamel apatite, which mimics the
          biomineralization crystalline-amorphous frontier of hard
          tissue development in nature. After repair, the damaged enamel
          can be recovered completely because its hierarchical structure
          and mechanical properties are identical to those of natural
          enamel. The suggested phase transformation–based epitaxial
          growth follows a promising strategy for enamel regeneration
          and, more generally, for biomimetic reproduction of materials
          with complicated structure.<br>

              Cancer Cells in Mice</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>An interdisciplinary team of scientists from KU Leuven,
          the University of Bremen, the Leibniz Institute of Materials
          Engineering, and the University of Ioannina has succeeded in
          killing tumour cells in mice using nano-sized copper compounds
          together with immunotherapy. After the therapy, the cancer did
          not return.<br>
          <br>
          Recent advances in cancer therapy use one’s own immunity to
          fight the cancer. However, in some cases, immunotherapy has
          proven unsuccessful.<br>
          <br>
          The team of biomedical researchers, physicists, and chemical
          engineers found that tumours are sensitive to copper oxide
          nanoparticles – a compound composed of copper and oxygen. Once
          inside a living organism, these nanoparticles dissolve and
          become toxic. By creating the nanoparticles using iron oxide,
          the researchers were able to control this process to eliminate
          cancer cells, while healthy cells were not affected.<br>
          <br>
          “Any material that you create at a nanoscale has slightly
          different characteristics than its normal-sized counterpart,”
          explain Professor Stefaan Soenen and Dr Bella B. Manshian from
          the Department of Imaging and Pathology, who worked together
          on the study. “If we would ingest metal oxides in large
          quantities, they can be dangerous, but at a nanoscale and at
          controlled, safe, concentrations, they can actually be
          beneficial.”<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Vaccine</b><br>
          As the researchers expected, the cancer returned after
          treating with only the nanoparticles. Therefore, they combined
          the nanoparticles with immunotherapy. “We noticed that the
          copper compounds not only could kill the tumour cells
          directly, they also could assist those cells in the immune
          system that fight foreign substances, like tumours,” says Dr
          Manshian.<br>
          <br>
          The combination of the nanoparticles and immunotherapy made
          the tumours disappear entirely and, as a result, works as a
          vaccine for lung and colon cancer – the two types that were
          investigated in the study. To confirm their finding, the
          researchers injected tumour cells back into the mice. These
          cells were immediately eliminated by the immune system, which
          was on the lookout for any new, similar, cells invading the
          body.<br>
          <br>
          The authors state that the novel technique can be used for
          about sixty per cent of all cancers, given that the cancer
          cells stem from a mutation in the p53 gene. Examples include
          lung, breast, ovarian, and colon cancer.<br>
          <br>
          A crucial element is that the tumours disappeared without the
          use of chemotherapy, which typically comes with major
          side-effects. Chemotherapeutic drugs not only attack cancer
          cells, they often damage healthy cells along the way. For
          example, some of these drugs wipe out white blood cells,
          abolishing the immune system.<br>
          Interdisciplinary collaboration<br>
          <br>
          “As far as I’m aware, this is the first time that metal oxides
          are used to efficiently fight cancer cells with long-lasting
          immune effects in live models,” Professor Soenen says. “As a
          next step, we want to create other metal nanoparticles, and
          identify which particles affect which types of cancer. This
          should result in a comprehensive database.”<br>
          <br>
          The team also plans to test tumour cells derived from cancer
          patient tissue. If the results remain the same, Professor
          Soenen wants to organise a clinical trial. For that to happen,
          however, there are still some hurdles along the way. He
          explains: “Nanomedicine is on the rise in the USA and Asia,
          but Europe is lagging behind. It’s a challenge to advance in
          this field, because doctors and engineers often speak a
          different language. We need more interdisciplinary
          collaboration, so that we can understand each other better and
          build upon each other’s knowledge.”<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          The progress in nanomedicine (NM) using nanoparticles (NPs) is
          mainly based on drug carriers for the delivery of classical
          chemotherapeutics. As low NM delivery rates limit therapeutic
          efficacy, an entirely different approach was investigated. A
          homologous series of engineered CuO NPs was designed for dual
          purposes (carrier and drug) with a direct chemical
          composition–biological functionality relationship. Model&#8208;based
          dissolution kinetics of CuO NPs in the cellular interior at
          post&#8208;exposure conditions were controlled through Fe&#8208;doping for
          intra/extra cellular Cu2+ and biological outcome. Through
          controlled ion release and reactions taking place in the
          cellular interior, tumors could be treated selectively,
          in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. Locally administered NPs enabled tumor
          cells apoptosis and stimulated systemic anti&#8208;cancer immune
          responses. We clearly show therapeutic effects without tumor
          cells relapse post&#8208;treatment with 6&#8201;% Fe&#8208;doped CuO NPs
          combined with myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cell silencing.<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          The safe implementation of nanotechnology requires
          nanomaterial hazard assessment in accordance with the material
          physicochemical properties that trigger the injury response at
          the nano/bio interface. Since CuO nanoparticles (NPs) are
          widely used industrially and their dissolution properties play
          a major role in hazard potential, we hypothesized that tighter
          bonding of Cu to Fe by particle doping could constitute a
          safer-by-design approach through decreased dissolution.
          Accordingly, we designed a combinatorial library in which CuO
          was doped with 1–10% Fe in a flame spray pyrolysis reactor.

              Are Toxic to Cancer Cells</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          A new study at the University of Georgia has found a way to
          attack cancer cells that is potentially less harmful to the
          patient. Sodium chloride nanoparticles – more commonly known
          as salt – are toxic to cancer cells and offer the potential
          for therapies that have fewer negative side effects than
          current treatments.<br>
          <br>
          Led by Jin Xie, associate professor of chemistry, the study
          found that SCNPs can be used as a Trojan horse to deliver ions
          into cells and disrupt their internal environment, leading to
          cell death. SCNPs become salt when they degrade, so they’re
          not harmful to the body.<br>
          <br>
          “This technology is well suited for localized destruction of
          cancer cells,” said Xie, a faculty member in the Franklin
          College of Arts and Sciences. “We expect it to find wide
          applications in treatment of bladder, prostate, liver, and
          head and neck cancer.”<br>
          <br>
          Nanoparticles are the key to delivering SCNPs into cells,
          according to Xie and the team of researchers. Cell membranes
          maintain a gradient that keeps relatively low sodium
          concentrations inside cells and relatively high sodium
          concentrations outside cells. The plasma membrane prevents
          sodium from entering a cell, but SCNPs are able to pass
          through because the cell doesn’t recognize them as sodium
          ions.<br>
          <br>
          Once inside a cell, SCNPs dissolve into millions of sodium and
          chloride ions that are trapped inside by the gradient and
          overwhelm protective mechanisms, inducing rupture of the
          plasma membrane and cell death. When the plasma membrane
          ruptures, the molecules that leak out signal the immune system
          that there’s tissue damage, inducing an inflammatory response
          that helps the body fight pathogens.<br>
          <br>
          “This mechanism is actually more toxic to cancer cells than
          normal cells, because cancer cells have relatively high sodium
          concentrations to start with,” Xie said.<br>
          <br>
          Using a mouse model, Xie and the team tested SCNPs as a
          potential cancer therapeutic, injecting SCNPs into tumors.
          They found that SCNP treatment suppressed tumor growth by 66%
          compared to the control group, with no drop in body weight and
          no sign of toxicity to major organs.<br>
          <br>
          They also performed a vaccination study, inoculating mice with
          cancer cells that had been killed via SCNPs or freeze thaw.
          These mice showed much greater resistance to a subsequent live
          cancer cell challenge, with all animals remaining tumor free
          for more than two weeks.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers also explored anti-cancer immunity in a tumor
          model. After injecting primary tumors with SCNPs and leaving
          secondary tumors untreated, they found that the secondary
          tumors grew at a much lower speed than the control, showing a
          tumor inhibition rate of 53%.<br>
          <br>
          Collectively, the results suggest that SCNPs killed cancer
          cells and converted the dying cancer cells to an in situ
          vaccine.<br>
          <br>
          SCNPs are unique in the world of inorganic particles because
          they are made of a benign material, and their toxicity is
          based on the nanoparticle form, according to Xie.<br>
          <br>
          “With a relatively short half-life in aqueous solutions, SCNPs
          are best suited for localized rather than systemic therapy.
          The treatment will cause immediate and immunogenic cancer cell
          death,” he said. “After the treatment, the nanoparticles are
          reduced to salts, which are merged with the body’s fluid
          system and cause no systematic or accumulative toxicity. No
          sign of systematic toxicity was observed with SCNPs injected
          at high doses.”<br>

              Therapeutic</b><br>
            <b>Wen Jiang, et al.</b><br>
          </div>
          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          Many inorganic nanoparticles are prepared and their behaviors
          in living systems are investigated. Yet, common electrolytes
          such as NaCl are left out of this campaign. The underlying
          assumption is that electrolyte nanoparticles will quickly
          dissolve in water and behave similarly as their constituent
          salts. Herein, this preconception is challenged. The study
          shows that NaCl nanoparticles (SCNPs) but not salts are highly
          toxic to cancer cells. This is because SCNPs enter cells
          through endocytosis, bypassing cell regulations on ion
          transport. When dissolved inside cancer cells, SCNPs cause a
          surge of osmolarity and rapid cell lysis. Interestingly,
          normal cells are much more resistant to the treatment due to
          their relatively low sodium levels. Unlike conventional
          chemotherapeutics, SCNPs cause immunogenic cell death or ICD.
          In vivo studies show that SCNPs not only kill cancer cells,
          but also boost an anticancer immunity. The discovery opens up
          a new perspective on nanoparticle&#8208;based therapeutics.<br>

          </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
          The invention provides a synthetic method of water-soluble
          monodisperse large-size spherical silver nanoparticles. The
          synthetic method comprises the following steps that (1) a
          sodium citrate solution, a sodium chloride solution, a silver
          nitrate solution and an ascorbic acid solution are prepared;
          (2) ascorbic acid is added into boiling water, the mixed
          solution of the sodium citrate solution, the sodium chloride
          solution and the silver nitrate solution is rapidly added into
          the boiling water which contains the ascorbic acid and
          refluxed and cooled to obtain a spherical silver nanoparticle
          solution; (3) the spherical silver nanoparticle solution is
          added into ultrapure water for mixing and stirring, and a
          silver ammonia complex solution and a re-prepared ascorbic
          acid solution are sequentially added; and (4) stirring and
          reacting are carried out at the normal temperature to obtain
          the monodisperse large-size spherical silver nanoparticle
          solution, and after centrifuging and concentrating are carried
          out, the nanoparticle solution is dispersed into the sodium
          citrate solution for storage. According to the synthetic
          method, the ascorbic acid is adopted for reducing silver
          ammonia complex to grow and prepare monodisperse spherical
          silver nanoparticles, the operation is simple, and the
          high-quality water-soluble monodisperse large-size spherical

          <br>
          ...Al Walaa wal Baraa is Kafirophobia. It's an obligatory
          doctrine of hatred directed towards kafirs and our way of
          life. Abdul-Latif ibn Abdur-Rahman Rahimullah, an authority in
          Sharia law, said, "It is not possible for someone to realize
          Tawheed [monotheism - the doctrine that Allah is the only God]
          and act upon it, and yet not be hostile against the mushrikeen
          [wrong worshippers]. So anyone who isn't hostile against the
          mushrikeen, then it cannot be said that he acts upon Tawheed
          nor that he realizes it" (ad-Durar as-Saniyyah 8/167).<br>
          <br>
          By the way, ad-Durar as-Saniyyah is an authoritative Salafist
          collection. It establishes that al Walaa wal Baraa is official
          Islamic teaching beyond a shadow of a doubt, and that
          hostility against the kafir is normative Islam, rather than
          some strange aberration.<br>
          <br>
          In other words, al Walaa wal Baraa, an essential doctrine of
          Islam, is the opposite of the Golden Rule.<br>
          <br>
          It's Kafirophobia, the reverse of what Islamophobia is said to
          be.<br>
          <br>
          Al Walaa wal Baraa is also the reverse of the modern Western
          concepts of tolerance, and of celebration of diversity.<br>
          <br>
          In other words, Islam is inherently intolerant of any ideology
          other than its own. Islam celebrates uniformity and
          compliance...<br>

          It is ironic for Parliamentarians to even consider banning
          Islamophobia, which is undefined, theoretical, nebulous, and
          unofficial.<br>
          <br>
          Yet Parliamentarians are patently disregarding that Islam
          contains a doctrine that is intolerant and discriminatory.
          This doctrine, furthermore, is 'ESSENTIAL 'within Islam. That
          is, it is, unlike "Islamophobia," CLEARLY DEFINED, LEGALLY
          BINDING, PRECISE and OFFICIAL. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Al Walaa wal Baraa’ – (Allegiance and
          Disassociation) is an Islamic doctrine that is very similar to
          apartheid.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Al Walaa wal Baraa’ is an 'essential
          doctrine' (usul ud-deen). ‘Essential’ means that all Muslims
          must believe and practice al Walaa wal Baraa as a condition of
          being admitted to paradise. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Al Walaa wal Baraa’ is a highly developed,
          well-supported and canonical part of Islam approved by the
          consensus of Islamic jurists.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Al Walaa wal Baraa’ is legally binding and
          obligatory upon all Muslims.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Al Walaa wal Baraa’ is precisely defined
          by Islamic jurists and is not a nebulous idea<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Al Walaa wal Baraa’ is an official Islamic
          doctrine and considered the second most important doctrine in
          Islam.<br>
          <br>
          Definition of ‘Al Walaa wal Baraa’ from Islamic sources:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from The Islamic Concept of al-Walaa'
          wal-Baraa' by Khalid El-Gharib: "to show enmity to those who
          show enmity to Allaah and His Messenger.” (i.e. Muslims are to
          visibly demonstrate their enmity towards the kufaar -
          non-Muslims)<br>

          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from a lecture given by Sheikh Abdullah
          al-Faisal (H.A.): "The implication of al-Baraa is that one
          HATES for the sake of Allah (SWT)…Al-Baraa means to recognize
          who your enemies are and to HATE them and EXTERMINATE them in
          their Endeavour to get rid of your Deen, al-Islam…Al-Baraa is
          to HATE the people who propagate Baatil (falsehood)—the Muslim
          should HATE them and (at least desire to) KILL them when the
          time comes."&nbsp; (i.e. the hatred of Muslims toward the
          kufaar is for the purpose of ethnic cleansing)<br>

          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from Ahmad Sirhindi (1564-1624): "The
          honour of Islam lies in insulting kufr and kafirs. One who
          respects the kafirs dishonours the Muslims... The real purpose
          of levying jiziya on them is to humiliate them to such an
          extent that they may not be able to dress well and to live in
          grandeur. They should constantly remain terrified and
          trembling. It is intended to hold them under contempt and to
          uphold the honour and might of Islam." (letter No. 163)<br>

          Germany trying to pass new laws that if you disparage the IPCC
          or prevent a response by words to a "climate catastrophe" you
          should be fined a years wages and sent to prison. This pushed
          by the solar panel industry in concert with the German
          government. The laws will re-direct you to climate friendly
          behavior, which, wait for it, includes buying solar panels and
          if you speak out against this, you should go to prison. Baltic

              On Mere Assumption And Lacks Empirical Verification</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Fundamental Tenets of the CO2 Greenhouse Effect Hypothesis
          aren't supported by real-world, observed evidence.<br>
          <br>
          Scientists insist the CO2 greenhouse effect is built on
          assumption and lacks empirical support<br>
          <br>
          In a new paper, Kennedy and Hodzic, 2019 summarize the lack of
          real-world, observational support for the claim CO2 molecules
          elicit planetary heating in the process of explicating their
          postion that water vapor is the gas that dominates the Earth’s
          greenhouse effect.<br>
          <br>
          They point out that the “critical assumption” that CO2
          molecules reduce outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) to warm the
          Earth’s surface “lacks empirical confirmation.”<br>
          <br>
          A graphic of OLR variability (Figure 1) from the paper
          demonstrates that “none” of the variation can be attributed to
          CO2’s influence.<br>
          <br>
          Kennedy and Hodzic sum up their skepticism about CO2’s
          greenhouse effect influence by saying 1) “the effect of any
          increases in [CO2’s] concentration can only be theoretically
          inferred”; 2) other than by correlation or curve-fitting,
          there is no&nbsp; “direct verification possible for the
          greenhouse effect of CO2”; and 3) there is no realized “clear
          spectral signal available showing significantly reduced OLR
          from increasing CO2.”<br>
          <br>
          In other words, the specific greenhouse effect warming
          properties of CO2 have not been validated scientifically.<br>

          German public broadcaster Deutschlandfunk on December 25,
          2019:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Climate scientist Johan Rockström thinks
          the declaration of a climate emergency is justified.<br>
          <br>
          Rockström (Potsdam Institute Director):<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The declaration of a “climate emergency”
          would make it possible to make really big decisions. …such as
          making things possible that are necessary but have not been
          considered realistic.“<br>
          <br>
          This reminds in the diction of 24 March 1933, at that time the
          law was officially called: “Law to remedy the distress of the
          people and the Reich” and it served to abolish the Republic.
          Isn’t anyone suspicious?<br>

              Vaccine Which It Says Can Shed and Cause Immunosuppression</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Merck has received the FDA's fast-tracked approval of a live,
          genetically modified Ebola vaccine which, according to its
          vaccine insert, can cause a novel new form of Ebola-type
          infection, resulting in immunosuppression and possible
          shedding of live virus to others.<br>
          <br>
          On Dec. 20th, 2019, Merck announced it received FDA approval
          for an Ebola vaccine which contains the virus known as
          recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus–Zaire Ebola virus
          (rVSV-ZEBOV), and will be marketed under the name ERVEBO.<br>
          <br>
          The rVSV-ZEBOV is a live, replication-competent virus,
          produced with the same African green monkey derived Vero cell
          line Merck used to create the Rotateq vaccine targeting
          rotavirus infections. The Vero cell line has been previously
          identified to carry at least two surreptitious simian
          endogenous retroviruses whose significant risks to human
          health have not yet been formally evaluated. <br>
          <br>
          VSV-ZEBOV is produced through genetic modification, combining
          the vesicular stomatitis virus (which on its own can cause
          flu-like illness in humans) in which the gene for native
          envelope glycoprotein (P03522) is replaced with that from the
          Ebola virus (P87666), Kikwit 1995 Zaire strain.<br>
          <br>
          In its recent press release, Merck acknowledged that the
          vaccine may result in the shedding of RNAs from the live virus
          in the blood, saliva, urine, and fluid from the skin of the
          vaccinated, and could result in the theoretical transmission
          of the vaccine virus to others (based on previous RT-PCR
          testing). The vaccine insert also states: <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “ Transmission of vaccine virus is a
          theoretical possibility. Vaccine virus RNA has been detected
          in blood, saliva, or urine for up to 14 days after
          vaccination. The duration of shedding is not known; however,
          samples taken 28 days after vaccination tested negative.
          Vaccine virus RNA has been detected in fluid from skin
          vesicles that appeared after vaccination.” <br>
          <br>
          The clinical studies conducted on the vaccine included safety
          assessments, noting serious adverse effects which included
          life-threatening anaphylaxis. Another particularly concerning
          adverse effect of the ERVEBO vaccine was identified after
          white blood cell counts were assessed in 697 subjects: <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Decreases in lymphocytes were reported in
          up to 85% of subjects and decreases in neutrophils were
          reported in up to 43% of subjects. No associated infections
          were reported.”<br>
          <br>
          Considering the fact that Ebola virus infection causes the
          death of lymphocytes1 and neutrophils,2 the vaccine appears to
          induce the very same type of immunosuppressive effects that
          are associated with morbidity and mortality from the disease
          it is attempting to prevent. <br>
          <br>
          Moreover, according to Merck, the vaccine may interfere with
          laboratory tests intended to identify Ebola infection:&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Interference with Laboratory Tests<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following vaccination with ERVEBO,
          individuals may test positive for anti-Ebola glycoprotein (GP)
          antibody and/or Ebola GP nucleic acid or antigens.”<br>
          <br>
          In summary, the vaccine may:<br>
          <br>
          1) produce widespread RNA virus infection within the tissues
          of those vaccinated<br>
          <br>
          2) may shed and infect others <br>
          <br>
          3) produce immunosuppressive effects consistent with Ebola
          infection<br>
          <br>
          4) produce immune effects that may prevent laboratory tests
          from discerning wild-type Ebola infection from vaccine-strain
          Ebola infection <br>
          <br>

          <br>
          In 1952, Dr. Gilbert V. Levin invented a rapid, highly
          sensitive method to detect microbial contamination of water
          and food. In 1958, he obtained a NASA contract to develop the
          method to seek extraterrestrial life. The method was selected
          in 1969 for use on NASA’s 1976 Viking Mission to Mars... At
          both landing sites, some 4,000 miles apart, the LR returned
          evidence of living microorganisms...<br>

          Low levels of testosterone can come with glaring symptoms such
          as erectile dysfunction and reduced bone mass. Before opting
          for hormone replacement therapy and facing the risk of serious
          side effects, here are five science-backed ways to optimize

          <br>
          In collaboration with Japanese vocalist, Yantara Jiro, we
          imaged a short vocal melody to assess how quickly the
          CymaScope's water membrane is able to follow changes in the
          pitch of musical sounds. The water has a natural hysteresis,
          thus, it takes a finite time for the water molecules to take
          up new wavelet placements in response to a new set of imposed
          frequencies.<br>
          <br>
          This effect can be seen during the moments of transition as
          Yantara changes his vocal pitch during progress of the melody.
          The color was added as an experiment in which each musical
          note was allocated with a specific color.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Piano notes made visible for the first time</b><br>
          Shannon Novak, a New Zealand-born fine artist, commissioned us
          to image 12 piano notes as inspiration for a series of 12
          musical canvases. We decided to image the notes in video mode
          because when we observed the 'A1' note we discovered,
          surprisingly, that the energy envelope changes over time as
          the string's harmonics mix in the piano's wooden bridge.
          Instead of the envelope being fairly stable, as we had
          imagined, the harmonics actually cause the CymaGlyphs to be
          wonderfully dynamic. Our ears can easily detect the changes in
          the harmonics and the CymaScope now reveals them--probably a
          first in acoustic physics.<br>
          <br>
          Capturing the dynamics was only possible with HD video but
          taming the dynamics of the piano's first strike, followed by
          the short plateau and long decay phase, was tricky...<br>

          The software tonoscope is a full featured and mathematically
          accurate Tonoscope emulator. It lets you create Chladni
          frequency patterns without the expense of traditional hardware
          needed for plate vibration research. This program is great for
          science, art, and spiritual exploration. Explore well known
          frequencies visually such as ancient Solfeggio tones, OM,
          notes on the piano, natural earth frequencies, crop circle
          frequencies, and more.<br>

          See the actual geometry of music for the first time on
          iPad&nbsp; iPhone, Android smartphone or tablet. The CymaScope
          app is the world’s first app to make the geometry of piano
          sounds and music visible. The imagery you will see is not a
          computer simulation; all the beautiful imagery in the app was
          created on a physical CymaScope then stored in digital memory
          for you to enjoy.<br>
          Keep the CymaScope app in your pocket at all times on iPhone
          or Android smartphone or if you prefer a larger screen size
          use iPad or an Android-powered tablet. For more information

              of deuterium-depleted drinking water </b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Scientists in China are reporting development of a less
          expensive, more eco-friendly method for making
          deuterium-depleted drinking water, citing studies suggesting
          that it may be a more healthful form of water. Their report
          appears in ACS' bi-weekly journal Industrial &amp; Engineering
          Chemistry Research.<br>
          <br>
          Changgong Meng and Feng Huang note that natural water, widely
          known as H2O, actually is a mixture of H2O and tiny amounts of
          D2O -- about 150 parts per million (ppm), or a few drops of
          D2O in every quart of water. Deuterium-depleted water usually
          contains about 125 ppm. The "D" is deuterium, an isotope or
          variant form of hydrogen often termed "heavy hydrogen." They
          cite accumulating evidence that water with high levels of
          deuterium may have adverse health effects on animals and
          plants, while deuterium-depleted water may be useful in
          treatment of certain diseases. Existing ways of removing
          deuterium from water tend to be expensive, inefficient, or
          environmentally harmful.<br>
          <br>
          They describe a new method that helps overcome these problems,
          and could be the basis for the first industrial-scale
          production of deuterium-depleted water. It involves a platinum
          catalyst that quickly and efficiently removes deuterium from
          water using a combination of cold and hot temperatures. In
          laboratory-scale tests, the new technique reduced the amount
          of deuterium in water from about 145 parts per million to 125
          parts per million. The resulting water is suitable for
          drinking, the scientists say, and could be produced in large
          quantities at economical cost.<br>

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>A study of the utilization of dual-temperature catalytic
          exchange between water and hydrogen for the production of
          deuterium-depleted water is presented. We use a novel catalyst
          with excellent physical properties for the hot tower of the
          isotopic exchange. The deuterium-depleted water obtained from
          the experiment is in agreement with the theoretical
          consideration on deuterium content at 80 °C when &#955; is about
          1.5. The deuterium-depleted water with 126.3 ppm D2O is gained
          when &#955; is about 2 under 80 °C. This kind of water can be used
          as ordinary drinking water and in cosmetic and hygiene
          products.<b><br>

          <b>&nbsp;</b><br>
          Researchers at BRI have noticed a number of problems related
          to the current theory of precession. While VLBI, laser ranging
          and other related technologies do a good job at determining
          the earth’s orientation, the sun’s movement through space has
          not been coordinated with these findings resulting in
          unintentional bias of precession inputs. In examining the
          phenomenon of the precession of the equinox (which was the
          original impetus for the development of lunisolar precession
          theory) we have found that a moving solar system model is a
          simpler way to reproduce the same observable without any of
          the problems associated with current precession theory.
          Indeed, elliptical orbit equations have been found to be a
          better predictor of precession rates than Newcomb’s formula,
          showing far greater accuracy over the last hundred years.
          Moreover, a moving solar system model appears to solve a
          number of solar system formation theory problems including the
          sun’s lack of angular momentum. For these reasons, BRI has
          concluded our sun is most likely part of a long cycle binary
          system...<br>
          <br>
          While there is no obvious visible companion star to our Sun,
          there could be a dark binary, such as a brown dwarf or
          possibly a relatively small black hole, either of which might
          be very difficult to detect, without accurate and lengthy
          analysis.<br>
          <br>
          There is also the possibility that our sun might be in a
          binary or complex gravitational relationship with one of
          several nearby “visible” stars. This scenario may require
          thinking beyond standard Newtonian dynamics to embrace MOND or
          MOG or some similar theory (that suggests that the constant of
          G might be stronger between stellar objects than between
          planetary objects within the solar system). There could be
          many types of unknown and unidentified masses that might cause
          our solar system to curve through space, including the local
          stellar cluster and even the galactic center to some small
          degree, each producing some small effect within the total
          precession observable. Consequently, at this point our work is
          primarily focused on understanding the precession observable
          and its nuances as the likely signature of our solar system’s
          angular velocity around some common center of mass. We believe
          that this approach of analyzing the precession observable (the
          sun’s motion relative to the fixed stars as seen from earth)
          will provide valuable and helpful data regarding the sun’s
          most likely stellar companion (if one exists).<br>
          <br>
          In summary, beyond direct detection – one way to determine if
          we are in a binary or multiple star system is to see if the
          Sun is curving through space. To us on Earth that means we
          should experience a gradual “changing orientation to inertial
          space.” Such a phenomenon is observed as the precession of the
          equinox...<b><br>

              4X greater efficiency with new lithium-sulphur design</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>Imagine having access to a battery, which has the
          potential to power your phone for five continuous days, or
          enable an electric vehicle to drive more than 1000km without
          needing to “refuel”.<br>
          <br>
          Monash University researchers are on the brink of
          commercialising the world’s most efficient lithium-sulphur
          (Li-S) battery, which could outperform current market leaders
          by more than four times, and power Australia and other global
          markets well into the future.<br>
          <br>
          Dr Mahdokht Shaibani from Monash University’s Department of
          Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering led an international
          research team that developed an ultra-high capacity Li-S
          battery that has better performance and less environmental
          impact than current lithium-ion products.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers have an approved filed patent (PCT/AU
          2019/051239) for their manufacturing process, and prototype
          cells have been successfully fabricated by German R&amp;D
          partners Fraunhofer Institute for Material and Beam
          Technology.<br>
          <br>
          Some of the world’s largest manufacturers of lithium batteries
          in China and Europe have expressed interest in upscaling
          production, with further testing to take place in Australia in
          early 2020.<br>
          <br>
          The study was published in Science Advances on Saturday, 4
          January 2020 – the first research on Li-S batteries to feature
          in this prestigious international publication.<br>
          <br>
          Professor Mainak Majumder said this development was a
          breakthrough for Australian industry and could transform the
          way phones, cars, computers and solar grids are manufactured
          in the future.<br>
          <br>
          “Successful fabrication and implementation of Li-S batteries
          in cars and grids will capture a more significant part of the
          estimated $213 billion value chain of Australian lithium, and
          will revolutionise the Australian vehicle market and provide
          all Australians with a cleaner and more reliable energy
          market,” Professor Majumder said.<br>
          <br>
          “Our research team has received more than $2.5 million in
          funding from government and international industry partners to
          trial this battery technology in cars and grids from this
          year, which we’re most excited about.”<br>
          <br>
          Using the same materials in standard lithium-ion batteries,
          researchers reconfigured the design of sulphur cathodes so
          they could accommodate higher stress loads without a drop in
          overall capacity or performance.<br>
          <br>
          Inspired by unique bridging architecture first recorded in
          processing detergent powders in the 1970s, the team engineered
          a method that created bonds between particles to accommodate
          stress and deliver a level of stability not seen in any
          battery to date.<br>
          <br>
          Attractive performance, along with lower manufacturing costs,
          abundant supply of material, ease of processing and reduced
          environmental footprint make this new battery design
          attractive for future real-world applications, according to
          Associate Professor Matthew Hill.<br>
          <br>
          “This approach not only favours high performance metrics and
          long cycle life, but is also simple and extremely low-cost to
          manufacture, using water-based processes, and can lead to
          significant reductions in environmentally hazardous waste,”
          Associate Professor Hill said.<br>

              stable cycling of ultrahigh-loading sulfur cathodes in

          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>Lithium-sulfur batteries can displace lithium-ion by
          delivering higher specific energy. Presently, however, the
          superior energy performance fades rapidly when the sulfur
          electrode is loaded to the required levels—5 to 10 mg cm&#8722;2—
          due to substantial volume change of lithiation/delithiation
          and the resultant stresses. Inspired by the classical
          approaches in particle agglomeration theories, we found an
          approach that places minimum amounts of a high-modulus binder
          between neighboring particles, leaving increased space for
          material expansion and ion diffusion. These expansion-tolerant
          electrodes with loadings up to 15 mg cm&#8722;2 yield high
          gravimetric (&gt;1200 mA·hour g&#8722;1) and areal (19 mA·hour cm&#8722;2)
          capacities. The cells are stable for more than 200 cycles,
          unprecedented in such thick cathodes, with Coulombic
          efficiency above 99%...<br>
          <br>
          <b>Fabrication and characterization of thick sulfur cathodes</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Inspired by the classical approaches in particle agglomeration
          process, we report a critically adapted slurry and electrode
          fabrication approach, which is still in-line with conventional
          electrode-making processes. We fabricated four types of thick
          sulfur cathodes with identical compositions [70% colloidal
          sulfur (Sigma-Aldrich), 20% C, and 10% CMC] yet using
          different slurry preparation methods as explained in Table 1.
          For cathodes A and B, we mixed all the ingredients at once for
          48 hours, followed by addition of deionized (DI) water to make
          the slurry. In cathode A, we added water to the mixture in a
          controlled manner to moderately wet the CMC particles and
          obtain a castable paste. The required amount of water for this
          cathode was found to be one-third of the amount required for
          full solubility of CMC in water at room temperature. For
          cathode B, we set the amount of water added to the dry mixture
          of S/C/CMC to be equal to the amount that satisfies the
          solubility limit of CMC (20 mg ml&#8722;1).<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand, we prepared cathodes C and D based on the
          most common mixing method for fabrication of LIB electrodes,
          which is also adapted in the literature for Li-S cathodes:
          mixing of active material and conductive agent, both in powder
          form, to establish a homogeneous distribution of the
          conductive agent, followed by blending in the predissolved
          binder solution to provide the required adhesion between
          particle/particle and particle/current collector. In cathodes
          C and D, the predissolved binders are solutions of 20 mgCMC
          mlwater&#8722;1 and 20 mgCMC mlcross-linking solution&#8722;1,
          respectively. The mixtures are continuously mixed for 48 hours
          to ensure good dispersion...<br>

          Today WikiLeaks releases more internal documents from the OPCW
          regarding the investigation into the alleged chemical attack
          in Douma in April 2018.<br>
          <br>
          One of the documents is an e-mail exchange dated 27 and 28
          February between members of the fact finding mission (FFM)
          deployed to Douma and the senior officials of the OPCW. It
          includes an e-mail from Sebastien Braha, Chief of Cabinet at
          the OPCW, where he instructs that an engineering report from
          Ian Henderson should be removed from the secure registry of
          the organisation:<br>
          <br>
          “Please get this document out of DRA [Documents Registry
          Archive]... And please remove all traces, if any, of its
          delivery/storage/whatever in DRA”.<br>
          <br>
          The main finding of Henderson, who inspected the sites in
          Douma and two cylinders that were found on the site of the
          alleged attack, was that they were more likely manually placed
          there than dropped from a plane or helicopter from
          considerable heights. His findings were omitted from the
          official final OPCW report on the Douma incident.<br>
          <br>
          Another document released today is minutes from a meeting on 6
          June 2018 where four staff members of the OPCW had discussions
          with “three Toxicologists/Clinical pharmacologists, one
          bioanalytical and toxicological chemist” (all specialists in
          chemical weapons, according to the minutes).<br>
          <br>
          The purpose of this meeting was two-fold. The first objective
          was<br>
          <br>
          “To solicit expert advice on the value of exhuming suspected
          victims of the alleged chemical attack in Douma on 7 April
          2018”. According to the minutes, the OPCW team was advised by
          the experts that there would be little use in conducting
          exhumations. The second point was “To elicit expert opinions
          from the forensic toxicologists regarding the observed and
          reported symptoms of the alleged victims.”<br>
          <br>
          More specifically,<br>
          <br>
          “...whether the symptoms observed in victims were consistent
          with exposure to chlorine or other reactive chlorine gas.”<br>
          <br>
          According to the minutes leaked today: “With respect to the
          consistency of the observed and reported symptoms of the
          alleged victims with possible exposure to chlorine gas or
          similar, the experts were conclusive in their statements that
          there was no correlation between symptoms and chlorine
          exposure”.<br>
          <br>
          The OPCW team members wrote that the key “take-away message”
          from the meeting was<br>
          <br>
          “that the symptoms observed were inconsistent with exposure to
          chlorine and no other obvious candidate chemical causing the
          symptoms could be identified”.<br>
          <br>
          The third document is a copy of OPCW e-mail exchanges from 20
          to 28 August 2018 discussing the meeting with the
          toxicologists.<br>
          <br>
          The fourth document is an e-mail exchange from the end of July
          2018 where it is stated that the eight OPCW inspectors
          deployed to Douma during the fact finding mission (except one,
          a paramedic) should be excluded from discussions on the
          project.<br>

            <b>by Jennifer Chu </b><br>

          <br>
          Within the electromagnetic middle ground between microwaves
          and visible light lies terahertz radiation, and the promise of
          “T-ray vision.”<br>
          <br>
          Terahertz waves have frequencies higher than microwaves and
          lower than infrared and visible light. Where optical light is
          blocked by most materials, terahertz waves can pass straight
          through, similar to microwaves. If they were fashioned into
          lasers, terahertz waves might enable “T-ray vision,” with the
          ability to see through clothing, book covers, and other thin
          materials. Such technology could produce crisp,
          higher-resolution images than microwaves, and be far safer
          than X-rays.<br>
          <br>
          The reason we don’t see T-ray machines in, for instance,
          airport security lines and medical imaging facilities is that
          producing terahertz radiation requires very large, bulky
          setups or devices, many operating at ultracold temperatures,
          that produce terahertz radiation at a single frequency — not
          very useful, given that a wide range of frequencies is
          required to penetrate various materials.<br>
          <br>
          Now researchers from MIT, Harvard University, and the U.S.
          Army have built a compact device, the size of a shoebox, that
          works at room temperature to produce a terahertz laser whose
          frequency they can tune over a wide range. The device is built
          from commercial, off-the-shelf parts and is designed to
          generate terahertz waves by spinning up the energy of
          molecules in nitrous oxide, or, as it’s more commonly known,
          laughing gas.<br>
          <br>
          Steven Johnson, professor of mathematics at MIT, says that in
          addition to T-ray vision, terahertz waves can be used as a
          form of wireless communication, carrying information at a
          higher bandwidth than radar, for instance, and doing so across
          distances that scientists can now tune using the group’s
          device.<br>
          <br>
          “By tuning the terahertz frequency, you can choose how far the
          waves can travel through air before they are absorbed, from
          meters to kilometers, which gives precise control over who can
          ‘hear’ your terahertz communications or ‘see’ your terahertz
          radar,” Johnson says. “Much like changing the dial on your
          radio, the ability to easily tune a terahertz source is
          crucial to opening up new applications in wireless
          communications, radar, and spectroscopy.”<br>
          <br>
          Johnson and his colleagues have published their results today
          in the journal Science. Co-authors include MIT postdoc Fan
          Wang, along with Paul Chevalier, Arman Amirzhan, Marco
          Piccardo, and Federico Capasso of Harvard University, and
          Henry Everitt of the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development
          Command Aviation and Missile Center...<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;in the 1980s, Everitt found that he was able to produce
          terahertz waves in his laboratory using a gas laser that was
          much smaller than traditional devices, at pressures far higher
          than the models said was possible. This discrepancy was never
          fully explained, and work on terahertz gas lasers fell by the
          wayside in favor of other approaches.<br>
          <br>
          A few years ago, Everitt mentioned this theoretical mystery to
          Johnson when the two were collaborating on other work as part
          of MIT’s Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies. Together with
          Everitt, Johnson and Wang took up the challenge, and
          ultimately formulated a new mathematical theory to describe
          the behavior of a gas in a molecular gas laser cavity. The
          theory also successfully explained how terahertz waves could
          be emitted, even from very small, high-pressure cavities.<br>
          <br>
          Johnson says that while gas molecules can vibrate at multiple
          frequencies and rotational rates in response to an infrared
          pump, previous theories discounted many of these vibrational
          states and assumed instead that a handful of vibrations were
          what ultimately mattered in producing a terahertz wave. If a
          cavity were too small, previous theories suggested that
          molecules vibrating in response to an incoming infrared laser
          would collide more often with each other, releasing their
          energy rather than building it up further to spin and produce
          terahertz.<br>
          <br>
          Instead, the new model tracked thousands of relevant
          vibrational and rotational states among millions of groups of
          molecules within a single cavity, using new computational
          tricks to make such a large problem tractable on a laptop
          computer. It then analyzed how those molecules would react to
          incoming infrared light, depending on their position and
          direction within the cavity.<br>
          <br>
          “We found that when you include all these other vibrational
          states that people had been throwing out, they give you a
          buffer,” Johnson says. “In simpler models, the molecules are
          rotating, but when they bang into other molecules they lose
          everything. Once you include all these other states, that
          doesn’t happen anymore. These collisions can transfer energy
          to other vibrational states, and sort of give you more
          breathing room to keep rotating and keep making terahertz
          waves.”<br>
          <br>
          Laughing, dialed up<br>
          Once the team found that their new model accurately predicted
          what Everitt observed decades ago, they collaborated with
          Capasso’s group at Harvard to design a new type of compact
          terahertz generator by combining the model with new gases and
          a new type of infrared laser.<br>
          <br>
          For the infrared source, the researchers used a quantum
          cascade laser, or QCL — a more recent type of laser that is
          compact and also tunable.<br>
          <br>
          “You can turn a dial, and it changes the frequency of the
          input laser, and the hope was that we could use that to change
          the frequency of the terahertz coming out,” Johnson says.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers teamed up with Capasso, a pioneer in the
          development of QCLs, who provided a laser that produced a
          range of power that their theory predicted would work with a
          cavity the size of a pen (about 1/1,000 the size of a
          conventional cavity). The researchers then looked for a gas to
          spin up.<br>
          <br>
          The team searched through libraries of gases to identify those
          that were known to rotate in a certain way in response to
          infrared light, eventually landing on nitrous oxide, or
          laughing gas, as an ideal and accessible candidate for their
          experiment.<br>
          <br>
          They ordered laboratory-grade nitrous oxide, which they pumped
          into a pen-sized cavity. When they sent infrared light from
          the QCL into the cavity, they found they could produce a
          terahertz laser. As they tuned the QCL, the frequency of
          terahertz waves also shifted, across a wide range.<br>
          <br>
          “These demonstrations confirm the universal concept of a
          terahertz molecular laser source which can be broadly tunable
          across its entire rotational states when pumped by a
          continuously tunable QCL,” Wang says.<br>
          <br>
          Since these initial experiments, the researchers have extended
          their mathematical model to include a variety of other gas
          molecules, such as carbon monoxide and ammonia, providing
          scientists with a menu of different terahertz generation
          options with different frequencies and tuning ranges, paired
          with a QCL matched to each gas. The group’s theoretical tools
          also enable scientists to tailor the cavity design to
          different applications. They are now pushing toward more
          focused beams and higher powers, with commercial development
          on the horizon...<br>

          BOSTON, Dec. 2, 2019 — Researchers have created a new
          terahertz radiation emitter with coveted frequency adjustment
          capability. The compact source could enable the development of
          futuristic communications, security, biomedical, and
          astronomical imaging systems...<br>
          <br>
          Everitt, alongside Steven Johnson’s group at MIT,
          theoretically calculated that terahertz waves could be emitted
          with high efficiency from gas molecules held within cavities
          much smaller than those currently used on the optically pumped
          far-infrared (OPFIR) laser — one of the earliest sources of
          terahertz radiation. Like all traditional terahertz sources,
          the OPFIR was inefficient with limited tunability. But, guided
          by the theoretical calculations, Capasso’s team was able to
          use the QCL to dramatically increase the terahertz tuning
          range of a nitrous oxide OPFIR laser.<br>
          <br>
          “The same laser is now widely tunable,” Capasso said. “It’s a
          fantastic marriage between two existing lasers.” <br>
          <br>
          In initial experiments with the shoebox-size QCL pumped
          molecular laser (QPML), the researchers demonstrated that the
          terahertz output could be tuned to produce 29 direct lasing
          transitions between 0.251 and 0.955 THz...<br>

              induced by fluoride: An in vivo evidence</b><br>
            <b>Chhavi Sharma, et al.</b><br>
          </div>
          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b><b>Background:</b> Curcumin (Cur), an active ingredient of
          turmeric is known to have multiple activities, including an
          antioxidant property and has been suggested to be useful in
          treatment of several neurological diseases.<br>
          <b>Objective:</b> To investigate the neuroprotective effects
          of Cur to mitigate the effect of the Fluoride (F) induced
          neurotoxicity in mice brain using the histological and the
          biochemical parameters.<br>
          <b>Materials and Methods:</b> Exposure of mice (30 days old
          male) to F (120 ppm) daily for 30 days.<br>
          <b>Result and Discussion:</b> Treatment with the F causes an
          increase in lipid peroxidation (LPO) and also increase in the
          neurodegenerative cells in the hippocampal sub-regions.
          Interestingly, co-treatment with Cur (30 mg/kg BW) with F (120
          ppm) for 30 days results in significant decreases in LPO with
          a concomitant decrease in neurodegeneration as compared with
          those treated with F alone.<br>
          <b>Conclusion:</b> Our study reveals that Cur is useful in
          ameliorating degenerative effects of F in mice brain... Our
          study thus demonstrate that daily single dose of 120 ppm F
          result in highly significant increases in the LPO as well as
          neurodegenerative changes in neuron cell bodies of selected
          hippocampal regions. Supplementation with curcumin
          significantly reduce the toxic effect of F to near normal
          level by augmenting the antioxidant defense through its
          scavenging property and provide an evidence of having
          therapeutic role against oxidative stress mediated
          neurodegeneration.<br>

              Prevent Cancer Discovered in Our Cells </b><br>

          <b><br>
          </b>Could lead to better treatments, spare patients ones that
          won’t work.<br>
          <br>
          Scientists at the University of Virginia School of Medicine
          have discovered a strange new organelle inside our cells that
          helps to prevent cancer by ensuring that genetic material is
          sorted correctly as cells divide.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers have connected problems with the organelle to
          a subset of breast cancer tumors that make lots of mistakes
          when segregating chromosomes. Excitingly, they found their
          analysis offered a new way for doctors to sort patient tumors
          as they choose therapies. They hope these insights will allow
          doctors to better personalize treatments to best benefit
          patients – sparing up to 40 percent of patients with breast
          cancer, for example, a taxing treatment that won’t be
          effective.<br>
          <br>
          “Some percentage of women get chemotherapy drugs for breast
          cancer that are not very effective. They are poisoned, in pain
          and their hair falls out, so if it isn’t curing their disease,
          then that’s tragic,” said researcher P. Todd Stukenberg, PhD,
          of UVA’s Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics and
          the UVA Cancer Center. “One of our goals is to develop new
          tests to determine whether a patient will respond to a
          chemotherapeutic treatment, so they can find an effective
          treatment right away.”<br>
          <br>
          <b>The Disappearing Organelle</b><br>
          The organelle Stukenberg and his team have discovered is
          essential but ephemeral. It forms only when needed to ensure
          chromosomes are sorted correctly and disappears when its work
          is done. That’s one reason scientists haven’t discovered it
          before now. Another reason is its mind-bending nature:
          Stukenberg likens it to a droplet of liquid that condenses
          within other liquid. “That was the big wow moment, when I saw
          that on the microscope,” he said.<br>
          <br>
          These droplets act as mixing bowls, concentrating certain
          cellular ingredients to allow biochemical reactions to occur
          in a specific location. “What’s exciting is that cells have
          this new organelle and certain things will be recruited into
          it and other things will be excluded,” Stukenberg said. “The
          cells enrich things inside the droplet and, all of a sudden,
          new biochemical reactions appear only in that location. It’s
          amazing.”<br>
          <br>
          It’s tempting to think of the droplet like oil in water, but
          it’s really the opposite of that. Oil is hydrophobic – it
          repels water. This new organelle, however, is more
          sophisticated. “It’s more of a gel, where cellular components
          can still go in and out but it contains binding sites that
          concentrate a small set of the cells contents,” Stukenberg
          explained. “Our data suggests this concentration of proteins
          is really important. I can get complex biochemical reactions
          to occur inside a droplet that I’ve been failing to
          reconstitute in a test tube for years. This is the secret
          sauce I’ve been missing.”<br>
          <br>
          While it’s been known for about eight years that cells make
          such droplets for other processes, but it was unknown that
          they make them on chromosomes during cell division. Stukenberg
          believes these droplets are very common and more important
          than previously realized. “I think this is a general
          paradigm,” he said. “Cells are using these non-membranous
          organelles to regulate much of their work.”<br>
          <br>
          <b>Better Cancer Treatments</b><b><br>
          </b>In addition to helping us understand mitosis – how cells
          divide – Stukenberg’s new discovery also sheds light on cancer
          and how it occurs. The organelle’s main function is to fix
          mistakes in tiny “microtubules” that pull apart chromosomes
          when cells are dividing. That ensures each cell winds up with
          the correct genetic material. In cancer, though, this repair
          process is defective, which can drive cancer cells to get more
          aggressive.<br>
          <br>
          He has also developed tests to measure the amount of
          chromosome mis-segregation in tumors, and he hopes that this
          might allow doctors to pick the proper treatment to give
          cancer patients. “We have a way to identify the tumors where
          the cells are mis-segregating chromosomes at a higher rate,”
          he said. “My hope is to identify the patients where treatments
          such as paclitaxel are going to the most effective.”<br>
          <br>
          Having looked at breast cancer already, he next plans to
          examine the strange organelle’s role in colorectal cancer.<br>

            <i>Researchers to wire up pens for 2,000 pigs and generate
              an electric field they believe can kill germs</i><br>
            <i>A farm in central China that previously conducted the

            <b>by Stephen Chen</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Scientists are planning a high-voltage electricity experiment
          at a farm in southwestern China to create cleaner conditions
          for animals and explore whether doing so could help halt the
          African swine fever<br>
          pandemic.<br>
          <br>
          Cables will be installed around pens housing about 2,000 pigs
          to create an electric field – an invisible force surrounding
          an electric charge – which the scientists believe will purify
          the air. They aim to test whether a method already believed to
          improve animal welfare can restrict the spread of the
          pandemic, which has decimated China’s hog herd.<br>
          <br>
          The experiment will be conducted at a medium-sized hog farm in
          Chengdu, in China’s largest pig-rearing province,
          Sichuan.&nbsp; Led by Professor Liu Binjiang, a government
          scientist in northeastern China, it was inspired by Liu’s work
          on a national “electro culture” programme that has been shown
          to benefit crops by using a combination of electric field and
          artificial lighting to stimulate plant growth and reduce
          diseases.<br>
          <br>
          This time, Liu and collaborators will generate a static
          electric field of 50 kilovolts – more than 400 times the
          voltage in a standard US household plug.<br>
          <br>
          They believe the high-voltage discharges could break down
          chemicals such as ammonia that generate unpleasant odours,
          reduce biological aerosol by 50 to 90 per cent, kill germs and
          generate negatively charged particles in the air that bind to
          air-polluting chemicals and make them harmless.<br>
          <br>
          Despite the high voltage, the volume of electrons in the cable
          will be extremely low, at about 1 microampere, producing an
          electric field that would not be harmful to animals or staff,
          according to the researchers.<br>
          <br>
          “The air quality [for the pigs] should improve when the device
          is powered up,” Liu said. “Electricity is one of the many ways
          to improve living conditions for farm animals. We have a long
          to-do list.”<br>
          <br>
          When the high-voltage electricity was used to improve air
          quality at a farm in central China’s Hubei – one of the
          provinces hit worst by African swine fever – none of its pigs
          died from the virus, according to Liu.<br>
          <br>
          Electrifying pig farms to create force fields that scrub the
          air of deadly viruses could be the next big breakthrough China
          needs to restrict the spread of ASF.<br>
          <br>
          It had been deployed to enhance animal welfare and prevent
          airborne diseases such as foot and mouth, but the lack of
          African swine fever cases was a surprise. It led the team to
          hypothesise that the electric field had caused a change in the
          environment that prevented the virus thriving.<br>
          <br>
          The deadly African swine fever pandemic has tended to spread
          more easily among pigs living in dirty, unhealthy conditions,
          according to some studies.<br>

          </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
          The utility model relates to an electric purifying aseptic
          detoxicating device for a livestock and poultry house, which
          can purify air and kill pathogenic microorganisms in the air
          and on the object surfaces in the livestock and poultry house
          at any time, and is characterized in that the electrode net
          which consists of a main supporting insulator, an auxiliary
          supporting insulator, a high voltage electrode wire and an
          ozone generating assembly, and is suspended above the inner
          space of the livestock and poultry house is supplied with
          power through a direct high voltage power supply which is
          controlled by a time controller. Therefore, a space direct
          corona electric field is formed by the electrode net, the
          ground surface of the livestock and poultry house and the
          building structural surfaces, and meanwhile, the electrode net
          discharges electric power into the air and produces high
          energy charged particles and ozone. The space direct corona
          electric field, the high energy charged particle and ozone
          simultaneously purify and sterilize the dust carrying germ and
          virus, flying foam in the air and pathogenic microorganisms on
          the surfaces of solid and liquid medium in the livestock and
          poultry house.<br>

          <div align="center"><b>Spiders go ballooning on electric
              fields</b><br>
            <b>by Erica Morley</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>The aerodynamic capabilities of spiders have intrigued
          scientists for hundreds of years. Charles Darwin himself mused
          over how hundreds of the creatures managed to alight on the
          Beagle on a calm day out at sea and later take-off from the
          ship with great speeds on windless day.<br>
          <br>
          Scientists have attributed the flying behaviour of these
          wingless arthropods to 'ballooning', where spiders can be
          carried thousands of miles by releasing trails of silk that
          propel them up and out on the wind.<br>
          <br>
          However, the fact that ballooning has been observed when there
          is no wind to speak of, when skies are overcast and even in
          rainy conditions, begs the question - how do spiders take off
          with low levels of aerodynamic drag?<br>
          <br>
          Biologists from the University of Bristol believe they have
          found the answer.<br>
          <br>
          "Many spiders balloon using multiple strands of silk that
          splay out in a fan-like shape, which suggests that there must
          be a repelling electrostatic force involved," explains lead
          researcher Dr Erica Morley, an expert in sensory biophysics.<br>
          <br>
          "Current theories fail to predict patterns in spider
          ballooning using wind alone as the driver. Why is it that some
          days there are large numbers that take to the air, while other
          days no spiders will attempt to balloon at all? We wanted to
          find out whether there were other external forces as well as
          aerodynamic drag that could trigger ballooning and what
          sensory system they might use to detect this stimulus."<br>
          <br>
          The solution to the mystery could lie in the Atmospheric
          Potential Gradient (APG), a global electric circuit that is
          always present in the atmosphere. APGs and the electric fields
          (e-fields) surrounding all matter can be detected by insects.
          For example, bumblebees can detect e-fields arising between
          themselves and flowers, and honeybees can use their charge to
          communicate with the hive.<br>
          <br>
          Spider silk has long been known as an effective electric
          insulator, but until now, it wasn't known that spiders could
          detect and respond to e-fields in a similar way to bees.<br>
          <br>
          In their study, the findings of which appear today in the
          journal Current Biology, Bristol's researchers exposed
          Linyphiid spiders to lab-controlled e-fields that were
          quantitatively equivalent to those found in the atmosphere.
          They noticed that switching the e-field on and off caused the
          spider to move upwards (on) or downwards (off), proving that
          spiders can become airborne in the absence of wind when
          subjected to electric fields.<br>
          <br>
          Dr Morley added: "Previously, drag forces from wind or
          thermals were thought responsible for this mode of dispersal,
          but we show that electric fields, at strengths found in the
          atmosphere, can trigger ballooning and provide lift in the
          absence of any air movement. This means that electric fields
          as well as drag could provide the forces needed for spider
          ballooning dispersal in nature."<br>
          <br>
          The findings have applications beyond the world of arthropods.
          Aerial dispersal is a crucial biological process for many
          caterpillars and spider-mites as well. An improved
          understanding of the mechanisms behind dispersal are important
          for global ecology as they can lead to better descriptions of
          population dynamics, species distributions and ecological
          resilience.<br>
          <br>
          There is, however, more work to be done. Dr Morley said: "The
          next step will involve looking to see whether other animals
          also detect and use electric fields in ballooning. We also
          hope to carry out further investigations into the physical
          properties of ballooning silk and carry out ballooning studies
          in the field."<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>Industrial activities have a detrimental impact on the
          environment and health when high concentrations of pollutants
          are released. Phytoremediation is a natural method of
          utilizing plants to remove contaminants from the soil. The
          goal of this study was to investigate the ability of Cannabis
          sativa L. to sustainably grow and remediate abandoned coal
          mine land soils in Pennsylvania. In this study, six different
          varieties of industrial hemp (Fedora 17, Felina 32, Ferimon,
          Futura 75, Santhica 27, and USO 31) were grown on two
          different contaminated soil types and two commercial soils
          (Miracle-Gro Potting Mix and PRO-MIX HP Mycorrhizae High
          Porosity Grower Mix). Plants growing in all soil types were
          exposed to two environmental conditions (outside and in the
          greenhouse). Seed germination response and plant height
          indicated no significant differences among all hemp varieties
          grown in different soils, however on an average, the height of
          the plants grown in the greenhouse exceeded that of the plants
          grown outdoors. In addition, heavy metal analysis of Arsenic,
          Lead, Nickel, Mercury, and Cadmium was performed. The
          concentration of Nickel was 2.54 times greater in the leaves
          of hemp grown in mine land soil outdoors when compared to
          greenhouse conditions. No differences were found between
          expression of heavy metal transporter genes. Secondary
          metabolite analysis of floral buds from hemp grown in mine
          land soil displayed a significant increase in the total
          Cannabidiol content (2.16%, 2.58%) when compared to
          Miracle-Gro control soil (1.08%, 1.6%) for outdoors and in the
          greenhouse, respectively. Molecular analysis using qRT-PCR
          indicated an 18-fold increase in the expression of the
          cannabidiolic acid synthase gene in plants grown on mine land
          soil. The data indicates a high tolerance to heavy metals as
          indicated from the physiological and metabolites analysis.<br>
          <br>
          Depletion of the ozone layer and global warming are two of the
          biggest issues at hand due to the release of toxic pollutants
          into the environment [1]. Inorganic pollutants include heavy
          metals such as Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Mg, Mo, and Ni, which are
          necessary for plant growth but are detrimental to the
          environment at high concentrations in the soil. Leaching of
          these metals into surrounding areas through rainwater runoff
          poses a dangerous environmental and health risk [2]. Metals
          with an unknown biological purpose such as Cd, Cr, Pb, Co, Ag,
          Se, and Hg can also become accumulated and in high amounts be
          toxic [3]. Phytoremediation is a natural, cost-effective
          process in which plants are used to remove unsafe compounds
          from the soil [4], [5]. Many plants have been studied and
          deemed effective at removing toxins from the soil. However,
          only a small number of those plants have numerous beneficial
          applications outside of phytoremediation. Methods of
          extraction and disposal of these plants have not been well
          defined [2], [6].<br>
          <br>
          Industrial hemp has been reported to be a hyperaccumulator
          [2], [7], [8], [9]. A previous study confirmed metal
          accumulation in both hemp roots and above ground tissues
          without noticeable changes in plant growth and morphology.
          However, the mechanism of accumulation remained unexplained
          [8]. Significantly, hemp’s short growing cycle, decreased need
          for pesticides, and low plant maintenance makes it an ideal
          candidate for phytoremediation studies [10].<br>
          <br>
          The purpose of this study was to explore the potential of
          industrial hemp as an eco-friendly way to remediate abandoned
          mine land soils in Pennsylvania. To do that, physiological
          parameters such as seed germination, plant height, and
          days-to-flowering were examined. In addition, uptake of heavy
          metals such as Arsenic, Lead, Nickel, Mercury, and Cadmium,
          changes in soil pH, and total cannabinoid content were
          examined in six different varieties of industrial hemp (Fedora
          17, Felina 32, Ferimon, Futura 75, Santhica 27, and USO 31)
          grown on two contaminated soil types and two commercial soil
          types both outdoors and in the greenhouse. Additionally, this
          study presents a detailed review on the possible mechanisms of
          metal uptake...<br>

            <b>Schachtsiek J, et al.</b><br>
          </div>
          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>The plant Cannabis sativa contains a number of
          psychoactive chemical compounds, the cannabinoids, which
          possess a significant pharmaceutical potential. Recently, the
          usage of Cannabis for medicinal purposes was legalized in many
          countries. Thus, the study on the influence of different
          cannabinoids in combination with other Cannabis-derived
          compounds with respect to the treatment of various diseases
          becomes increasingly important. Besides the production of
          distinct cannabinoids in a heterologous host, like tobacco or
          yeast, transgenic Cannabis plants would be a suitable
          alternative to modify and therefore optimize the cannabinoid
          profile. This perspective highlights the current efforts on
          Cannabis cell culture systems, in vitro propagation, and
          transformation of the plant and reveals the resulting
          opportunities concerning biotechnological production of
          cannabinoids. Furthermore, alternative platform organisms for
          the heterologous production of cannabinoids, like tobacco, are
          considered and evaluated.<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>Fiber hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is a sustainable and high
          yielding industrial crop that can help to meet the high global
          demand for fibers. Hemp can be grown for fiber, seeds, and/or
          for dual purpose in a wide range of geographic zones and
          climates. Currently the main hemp producing regions in the
          world are China, Europe, and Canada. The number of new
          cultivars developed for each of these regions has gradually
          increased, with each region producing its own typical hemp
          cultivars for different purposes. In this article, the state
          of the art of fiber hemp breeding programs in Europe, China,
          and Canada are reviewed. The breeding strategies and tools
          used in the breeding of hemp cultivars are discussed. We also
          provide an overview of genetic diversity in hemp for different
          traits. In addition, the current knowledge of the main
          breeding goals for fiber hemp, which are an improvement of
          fiber quality and fiber yield, breeding for specific
          cannabinoid profiles, control of flowering behavior, male
          flowering control, and breeding of cultivars for specific
          environments are evaluated. Lastly, we discuss the inestimable
          value of next generation technologies to breed new hemp
          cultivars that are suitable for a biobased economy.<br>

          <b>ABSTRACT</b><b><br>
          </b>Flowering is a crucial phase in hemp cultivation. It
          influences both stem and seed yield. A uniform and short
          flowering duration in hemp is desirable, because it favors
          uniform crop development. Moreover, flowering is often taken
          as a reference point for harvesting, and very long durations
          of flowering might mislead the operator in judging the proper
          time for mowing. In this article, a large dataset of flowering
          time and duration for different monoecious and dioecious
          varieties was studied and the effect of sowing time and
          genotype on flowering duration is discussed. Minimal flowering
          duration was observed when the time from emergence to
          flowering was short. This, was related however, to low yields.
          Dynamics of flowering was accurately described by a
          bi-logistic curve that indicates the presence of two
          underlying logistic processes.<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>Landfill leachate is one of the major sources of
          pollutions discharged into the environment. It is composed
          from a complex mixture of chemicals and handling typically
          involves treatment either on-site or at a wastewater treatment
          plants but phytoremediation is a promising method. The aim of
          this work was to evaluate the potential of agronomic plant
          species with high annual biomass yield (Cannabis sativa L.)
          for toxicity removal from landfill leachate. Raw leachate
          collected from the pond of untreated leachate at sanitary
          landfill in Czech Republic was used in the study. The hemp
          cultivation experiments were performed in the beginning of
          2017 under laboratory conditions using three hemp cultivars
          registered in the European Union: Tiborszállási (Hungary),
          Bialobrzeska (Poland) and Monoica (Hungary). The seeds were
          used for modified standard mustard germination test. The
          germination of hemp cultivars was tested using the hydroponics
          medium supplemented with leachate 25, 50, 75, 90 and 100%. The
          control seeds were growing on untreated nutrient medium under
          the same condition. The nature of germination of seeds was
          studied. Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded
          that the tested samples of leachate were toxic for hemp
          cultivars (C. sativa L.). Growth inhibition (%) at the studied
          samples ranged from &#8722;6.48 to 75.78%.<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) was used to examine its
          capability as a renewable resource to decontaminate heavy
          metal polluted soils. The influence of heavy metals on the
          fibre quality was of special interest. Determination of heavy
          metal content was carried out by means of atomic absorption
          spectroscopy (AAS). Four different parts of the plant were
          examined: seeds, leaves, fibres and hurds. In each case, the
          concentration relation was Ni&gt;Pb&gt;Cd. However, the heavy
          metal accumulation in the different parts of the plant was
          extremely different. All parts of hemp plants contain heavy
          metals and this is why their use as a commercially utilisable
          plant material is limited. We found that the highest
          concentrations of all examined metals were accumulated in the
          leaves. In this field trial, hemp showed a phytoremediation
          potential of 126 g Cd (ha vegetation period)&#8722;1. We tested the
          fibre quality by measuring the pure fibre content of the stems
          and the fibre properties after mechanical separation. In
          addition, the fibre fineness was examined using airflow
          systems and image analysis. The strength was measured by
          testing single fibre bundles with a free clamping distance of
          3.2 mm using a universal testing device. Finally, we compared
          the results from the stems and fibres from trials on heavy
          metal polluted ground with hemp stems and fibres from
          non-polluted ground. Since there was no comparable unpolluted
          area near the polluted one, reference values were taken from
          an area quite far away and subsequently with a different soil
          composition and also exposure to different meteorological
          conditions. Thus, the observed differences are only partially
          caused by the heavy metal contamination.<br>

          </b>The effects of different cadmium concentrations [17 mg(Cd)
          kg&#8722;1(soil) and 72 mg(Cd) kg&#8722; 1(soil)] on Cannabis sativa L.
          growth and photosynthesis were examined. Hemp roots showed a
          high tolerance to Cd, i.e. more than 800 mg(Cd) kg&#8722;1(d.m.) in
          roots had no major effect on hemp growth, whereas in leaves
          and stems concentrations of 50 – 100 mg(Cd) kg&#8722;1(d.m.) had a
          strong effect on plant viability and vitality. For control of
          heavy metal uptake and xylem loading in hemp roots, the soil
          pH plays a central role. Photosynthetic performance and
          regulation of light energy consumption were analysed using
          chlorophyll fluorescence analysis. Seasonal changes in
          photosynthetic performance were visible in control plants and
          plants growing on soil with 17 mg(Cd) kg&#8722;1(soil). Energy
          distribution in photosystem 2 is regulated in low and high
          energy phases that allow optimal use of light and protect
          photosystem 2 from overexcitation, respectively.
          Photosynthesis and energy dissipation were negatively
          influenced by 72 mg(Cd) kg&#8722;1(soil). Cd had detrimental effects
          on chlorophyll synthesis, water splitting apparatus, reaction
          centre, antenna and energy distribution of PS 2. Under
          moderate cadmium concentrations, i.e. 17 mg(Cd) kg&#8722;1(soil),
          hemp could preserve growth as well as the photosynthesis
          apparatus, and long-term acclimation to chronically Cd stress
          occurred.<br>

          significantly decreases breakage and distortion. Delta-wing
          shaped center spacers and flow enhancing, teardrop-shaped
          outer spacers further increase durability by providing
          improved support for the disks while minimizing the
          disturbance of the natural flow of fluids. Use of endplates
          with heavy outer rims results in turbines with greater
          gyroscopic effect and greater mass for kinetic energy storage.
          A disk-directed inlet valve and focused inlet nozzle system
          increases efficiency by directing flows to the individual
          disks valve in a low friction containment case. The directed
          flow tuned inlet nozzle system further increases efficiency.
          Coating the inner case of the turbine's enclosure with Teflon
          or similar materials reduces friction and further improves
          efficiency.<br>

          ...Shurshakov also revealed that scientists from the Institute
          of Biomedical Problems have come up with a solution to
          radically improve radiation protection in the living quarters
          on board the Russian module of the ISS. The ingenious
          on-the-fly solution features a protective curtain filled with
          wet wipes.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The napkins are saturated to 70-80 percent
          water, and protect well against radiation. They are used by
          cosmonauts for hygiene, but since there is a huge supply of
          them aboard the ISS, we took advantage of this,” he said.
          According to the official, installing this ‘wet wipe curtain’
          reduced radiation doses in one of the Russian module’s cabins
          by as much as 30-40 percent...<br>
