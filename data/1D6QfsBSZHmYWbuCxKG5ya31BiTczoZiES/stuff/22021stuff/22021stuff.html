                  </font></b><font color="#000000">In this article, we
                  aim to develop a political economy of mass hysteria.
                  Using the background of COVID-19, we study past mass
                  hysteria. Negative information which is spread through
                  mass media repetitively can affect public health
                  negatively in the form of nocebo effects and mass
                  hysteria. We argue that mass and digital media in
                  connection with the state may have had adverse
                  consequences during the COVID-19 crisis. The resulting
                  collective hysteria may have contributed to policy
                  errors by governments not in line with health
                  recommendations. While mass hysteria can occur in
                  societies with a minimal state, we show that there
                  exist certain self-corrective mechanisms and limits to
                  the harm inflicted, such as sacrosanct private
                  property rights. However, mass hysteria can be
                  exacerbated and self-reinforcing when the negative
                  information comes from an authoritative source, when
                  the media are politicized, and social networks make
                  the negative information omnipresent. We conclude that
                  the negative long-term effects of mass hysteria are
                  exacerbated by the size of the state.<br>

                  psychiatrist and medical legal expert Dr. Mark
                  McDonald, the true public health crisis is not
                  COVID-19 itself; rather, it’s the fear of the
                  infection, which has “morphed and evolved into a form
                  of mass delusional psychosis”<br>
                  Many enter a state of hysteria when they see an
                  unmasked person, even if they look perfectly healthy
                  and clearly are not suffering from any kind of
                  respiratory issue. This is a highly irrational state
                  that has no basis in reality<br>
                  Delusion is defined as believing something that
                  doesn’t conform with reality<br>
                  There are serious concerns about the lasting effects
                  this widespread insanity will have on children as they
                  grow up. One of the worst traumas children suffer as a
                  result of all this fearmongering is the idea that they
                  may kill their parents or grandparents simply by being
                  around them<br>
                  Treating the children’s trauma in therapy is not going
                  to be enough, as parents and other adults are the ones
                  creating the trauma by their own exaggerated fear
                  response. To heal a generation of traumatized
                  children, we must first address the psychosis of the
                  adult population...<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Instead of facing reality, the
                  delusional person would rather live in their world of
                  make-believe. But in order to keep faking reality,
                  they’ll have to make sure that everyone else around
                  them also pretends to live in their imaginary world.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In simpler words, the delusional
                  person rejects reality. And in this rejection of
                  reality, others have to play along with how they view
                  the world, otherwise, their world will not make sense
                  to them. It’s why the delusional person will get angry
                  when they face someone who doesn’t conform to their
                  world view …<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s one of the reasons why you’re
                  seeing so many people who’d happily approve the
                  silencing of any medical experts whose views
                  contradict the WHO or CDC guidelines. ‘Obey the
                  rules!’ becomes more important than questioning if the
                  rules were legitimate to begin with.”...<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “There was never a medical crisis.
                  There were always enough resources to deal with the
                  people who were sick … Many resources were in fact
                  turned away … The question then, for me, became,
                  ‘What’s the real crisis? What are people really
                  suffering from?’<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It became clear to me, very
                  quickly, within the first two or three weeks in March
                  [2020], that it was fear. Since then … the fear … has
                  morphed and evolved, not just into a ‘I’m worried, I’m
                  scared so I need to stay home,’ but an actual belief
                  that is against reality — because the definition of
                  delusion is something you believe that doesn’t conform
                  with reality.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They believe that they are going to
                  die — no matter what age, no matter what state of
                  health they’re in — if they don’t leave their house
                  with a mask and gloves on every day and run from
                  [other] human beings. That’s delusional psychosis.
                  It’s false, it’s wrong, it’s not backed up by
                  evidence. And many, many Americans are living that and
                  believing that.”...<br>

                  ...This is not hidden; it is open and exposed, but the
                  people have ignored the blatant nature of this
                  conspiracy to take over humanity, and instead have as
                  expected by their masters, acquiesced to every command
                  given. After all this tyranny levied against this
                  society, they now beg for crumbs from the very scum
                  that has enslaved them. This collective and pathetic
                  response can result in nothing less than mass
                  enslavement.<br>
                  In the face of this obvious and extreme immoral
                  injustice against all Americans, the people clamor for
                  redress by petitioning those falsely claiming
                  authority instead of relying on self and the inherent
                  right to live free. This is akin to asking your master
                  to be your slave, and expecting him to voluntarily
                  comply. This attitude is not only meaningless; it
                  actually emboldens your oppressor, and strengthens his
                  position over you.&nbsp; Weakness in the face of
                  tyranny can only bring more tyranny.<br>
                  To understand how the total domination over the people
                  by the state occurred only requires one to accept
                  reality. The population at large has accepted to date
                  almost every controlling measure demanded by those
                  that claim power over them.<br>
                  We are straying away from our roots on a dangerous
                  road from which there will be no turning back. And the
                  good and bad news is that we are the last generation
                  that can truly do something about it.<br>
                  We no longer know how to live without refrigerators,
                  without cars, without phones or without supermarkets.<br>
                  What will you do tomorrow if you simply are unable to

                    et al.<br>
                  </font></b><font color="#000000">In this article, we
                  aim to develop a political economy of mass hysteria.
                  Using the background of COVID-19, we study past mass
                  hysteria. Negative information which is spread through
                  mass media repetitively can affect public health
                  negatively in the form of nocebo effects and mass
                  hysteria. We argue that mass and digital media in
                  connection with the state may have had adverse
                  consequences during the COVID-19 crisis. The resulting
                  collective hysteria may have contributed to policy
                  errors by governments not in line with health
                  recommendations. While mass hysteria can occur in
                  societies with a minimal state, we show that there
                  exist certain self-corrective mechanisms and limits to
                  the harm inflicted, such as sacrosanct private
                  property rights. However, mass hysteria can be
                  exacerbated and self-reinforcing when the negative
                  information comes from an authoritative source, when
                  the media are politicized, and social networks make
                  the negative information omnipresent. We conclude that
                  the negative long-term effects of mass hysteria are
                  exacerbated by the size of the state.<br>

                    Is Suffering From “Mass Delusional Psychosis”<br>
                  </font></b><font color="#000000">According to
                  psychiatrist and medical legal expert Dr. Mark
                  McDonald, the true public health crisis is not
                  COVID-19 itself; rather, it’s the fear of the
                  infection, which has “morphed and evolved into a form
                  of mass delusional psychosis”<br>
                  Many enter a state of hysteria when they see an
                  unmasked person, even if they look perfectly healthy
                  and clearly are not suffering from any kind of
                  respiratory issue. This is a highly irrational state
                  that has no basis in reality<br>
                  Delusion is defined as believing something that
                  doesn’t conform with reality<br>
                  There are serious concerns about the lasting effects
                  this widespread insanity will have on children as they
                  grow up. One of the worst traumas children suffer as a
                  result of all this fearmongering is the idea that they
                  may kill their parents or grandparents simply by being
                  around them<br>
                  Treating the children’s trauma in therapy is not going
                  to be enough, as parents and other adults are the ones
                  creating the trauma by their own exaggerated fear
                  response. To heal a generation of traumatized
                  children, we must first address the psychosis of the
                  adult population...<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Instead of facing reality, the
                  delusional person would rather live in their world of
                  make-believe. But in order to keep faking reality,
                  they’ll have to make sure that everyone else around
                  them also pretends to live in their imaginary world.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In simpler words, the delusional
                  person rejects reality. And in this rejection of
                  reality, others have to play along with how they view
                  the world, otherwise, their world will not make sense
                  to them. It’s why the delusional person will get angry
                  when they face someone who doesn’t conform to their
                  world view …<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s one of the reasons why you’re
                  seeing so many people who’d happily approve the
                  silencing of any medical experts whose views
                  contradict the WHO or CDC guidelines. ‘Obey the
                  rules!’ becomes more important than questioning if the
                  rules were legitimate to begin with.”...<br>

                  There were always enough resources to deal with the
                  people who were sick … Many resources were in fact
                  turned away … The question then, for me, became,
                  ‘What’s the real crisis? What are people really
                  suffering from?’<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It became clear to me, very
                  quickly, within the first two or three weeks in March
                  [2020], that it was fear. Since then … the fear … has
                  morphed and evolved, not just into a ‘I’m worried, I’m
                  scared so I need to stay home,’ but an actual belief
                  that is against reality — because the definition of
                  delusion is something you believe that doesn’t conform
                  with reality.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They believe that they are going to
                  die — no matter what age, no matter what state of
                  health they’re in — if they don’t leave their house
                  with a mask and gloves on every day and run from
                  [other] human beings. That’s delusional psychosis.
                  It’s false, it’s wrong, it’s not backed up by
                  evidence. And many, many Americans are living that and
                  believing that.”...<br>

                  hidden; it is open and exposed, but the people have
                  ignored the blatant nature of this conspiracy to take
                  over humanity, and instead have as expected by their
                  masters, acquiesced to every command given. After all
                  this tyranny levied against this society, they now beg
                  for crumbs from the very scum that has enslaved them.
                  This collective and pathetic response can result in
                  nothing less than mass enslavement.<br>
                  In the face of this obvious and extreme immoral
                  injustice against all Americans, the people clamor for
                  redress by petitioning those falsely claiming
                  authority instead of relying on self and the inherent
                  right to live free. This is akin to asking your master
                  to be your slave, and expecting him to voluntarily
                  comply. This attitude is not only meaningless; it
                  actually emboldens your oppressor, and strengthens his
                  position over you.&nbsp; Weakness in the face of
                  tyranny can only bring more tyranny.<br>
                  To understand how the total domination over the people
                  by the state occurred only requires one to accept
                  reality. The population at large has accepted to date
                  almost every controlling measure demanded by those
                  that claim power over them.<br>
                  We are straying away from our roots on a dangerous
                  road from which there will be no turning back. And the
                  good and bad news is that we are the last generation
                  that can truly do something about it.<br>
                  We no longer know how to live without refrigerators,
                  without cars, without phones or without supermarkets.<br>

                  zoonotic virus, meaning that it can spread between
                  animals and people. Fruit bats, also called flying
                  foxes, are the animal reservoir for NiV in nature.
                  Nipah virus is also known to cause illness in pigs and
                  people. Infection with NiV is associated with
                  encephalitis (swelling of the brain) and can cause
                  mild to severe illness and even death. Outbreaks occur
                  almost annually in parts of Asia, primarily Bangladesh
                  and India.<br>
                  Nipah virus infection can be prevented by avoiding
                  exposure to sick pigs and bats in areas where the
                  virus is present, and not drinking raw date palm sap
                  which can be contaminated by an infected bat. <br>

                    and weight through ‘Weight to energy conversion
                    technology’ (WTECT). According to a company

                  </font></b><font color="#000000">The WTECT system is a
                  type of suspension system, using the reactive force to
                  generate additional torque, to facilitate the wheel
                  rotation. It comprises two mechanisms: the external
                  spring mechanism and the internal drive. The
                  action/reaction force caused by weight compresses the
                  springs in the upper section of the wheel and
                  decompresses in the lower section. Using the center as
                  the pivot, this converts energy, reduces the
                  frictional force in the opposite direction, and
                  facilitates the rotation. Using 10kg active weight,
                  the mechanism is shown to generate a moment ranging
                  from 7.3Nm to 7.8Nm.</font><b><font color="#000000"><br>

                  isolates sperm from raw semen by applying an acoustic
                  field at a 30° angle to the flow direction. The
                  acoustic forces direct and push high-quality sperm out
                  of the mainstream, across the microchannel, and
                  isolate them in a sperate outlet, leaving the general

                  </font></b><font color="#000000">Male infertility is a
                  global reproductive issue, several clinical approaches
                  have been developed to tackle it, but their
                  effectiveness is limited by the labour-intensive and
                  time-consuming sperm selection procedures used. Here,
                  we present an automated, acoustic based
                  continuous-flow method capable of selecting high
                  quality sperm with considerably improved motility and
                  DNA integrity compared to the initial raw bull semen.
                  The acoustic field translates larger sperm and guides
                  highly motile sperm across the channel width. The
                  result is the selection of sperm with over 50% and 60%
                  improvement in vitality and progressive motility and
                  more than 38% improvement in DNA integrity,
                  respectively, while providing a clinically relevant
                  volume and selected sperm number for the performance
                  of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic
                  sperm injection (ICSI) by selecting over 60 000 sperm
                  in under an hour.</font><b><br>

              </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COVID-19 “vaccines” do not impart
              immunity or inhibit transmissibility of the disease. In
              other words, they are not designed to keep you from
              getting sick with SARS-CoV-2; they only are supposed to
              lessen your infection symptoms if or when you get
              infected. As such, these products do not meet the medical
              definition of a vaccine<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of February 4, 2021, the U.S.
              Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has
              received 12,697 injury reports following COVID-19
              vaccination and 653 deaths<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; University of Oxford, which is
              collaborating on a COVID-19 vaccine with AstraZeneca, is
              now enrolling children between the ages of 6 years and 17
              years and 8 months in their U.K. vaccine trial<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moderna started testing its RNA-based
              gene therapy on American children between the ages of 12
              and 17 in December 2020, and the first Pfizer trials
              involving adolescents began in mid-October 2020. In China,
              Sinovac and SinoPharm trials have been enrolling children
              as young as 3<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children do not need a COVID-19 vaccine
              as they are at extremely low risk of severe COVID-19 and
              are not a significant vector of infection<br>

              </b><br>
              ...The National Institute of Health's grant AI23946-08
              issued to Dr. Ralph Baric at the University of North
              Carolina at Chapel Hill (officially classified as
              affiliated with Dr. Anthony Fauci's NIAID by at least
              2003) began the work on, "synthetically altering the
              Coronaviridae (the coronavirus family) for the express
              purpose of general research, pathogenic enhancement,
              detection, manipulation, and potential therapeutic
              interventions targeting the same."<br>
              As early as May 21, 2000, Dr. Baric and UNC sought to
              patent critical sections of the coronavirus family for
              their commercial benefit.<br>
              In one of the several papers derived from work sponsored
              by this grant, Dr. Baric published what he reported to be
              the full length cDNA of SARS CoV in which it was clearly
              stated that SAR CoV was based on a composite of DNA
              segments...<br>
              .. On April 19, 2002, the Spring before the first SARS
              outbreak in Asia - Christopher M. Curtis, Boyd Yount, and
              Ralph Baric - filed an application for U.S. Patent
              7,279,372 for a method of producing recombinant
              coronavirus.<br>
              In the first public record of the claims, they sought to
              patent a means of producing, "an infectious, replication
              defective, coronavirus."<br>
              This work was supported by the NIH grant referenced above
              and GM63228...<br>
              In short, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
              was involved in the funding of amplifying the infectious
              nature of coronavirus between 1999 and 2002 before SARS
              was ever detected in humans. <br>
              This legality did not deter CDC in their efforts.<br>
              Their application, updated in 2007, ultimately issued as
              U.S. Patent 7,220,852 and constrained anyone not licensed
              by their patent from manipulating SARS CoV, developing
              tests or kits to measure SARS coronavirus in humans or
              working with their patented virus for therapeutic use.<br>
              Work associated with this virus by their select

                Pentagon Video</b><b><br>
              </b>According to a startling Pentagon video obtained by
              The Intercept, the future of global cities will be an
              amalgam of the settings of "Escape from New York" and
              "Robocop" — with dashes of the "Warriors" and "Divergent"
              thrown in. It will be a world of Robert Kaplan-esque urban
              hellscapes — brutal and anarchic supercities filled with
              gangs of youth-gone-wild, a restive underclass, criminal
              syndicates, and bands of malicious hackers. <br>
              At least that's the scenario outlined in "Megacities:
              Urban Future, the Emerging Complexity," a five-minute
              video that has been used at the Pentagon's Joint Special
              Operations University. All that stands between the coming
              chaos and the good people of Lagos and Dhaka (or maybe
              even New York City) is the U.S. Army, according to the

              </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
              </b>Effective communication about medical
              countermeasures—including drugs, devices and biologics—is
              often critical in emergency situations. Such
              communication, however, does not just happen. It must be
              planned and prepared for. One mechanism to develop
              communication strategies is through the use of prospective
              scenarios, which allow readers the opportunity to rehearse
              responses while also weighing the implications of their
              actions. This article describes the development of such a
              scenario: The SPARS Pandemic 2025-2028. Steps in this
              process included deciding on a timeframe, identifying
              likely critical uncertainties, and then using this
              framework to construct a storyline covering both the
              response and recovery phases of a fictional emergency
              event. Lessons learned from the scenario development and
              how the scenario can be used to improve communication are
              also discussed.<br>

              Since that time thousands have recovered from illness
              using this substance and now many physicians and
              scientists are saying it is powerfully effective for many
              applications.<br>
              The documentary explores the history, safety, and efficacy
              of the universal antidote and provides interviews with
              physicians and people who have used it.<br>

              </b>"... Fauci says the test is useless when it’s run at
              35 cycles or higher. The FDA says run the test up to 40
              cycles, in order to determine whether the virus is there.
              This is the crime in a nutshell... here are two chunks of
              evidence for what I’ve written above. First, we have a CDC
              quote on the FDA website, in a document titled [3] [3a]
              [3b]: “CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time
              RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel For Emergency Use Only.” See pdf
              page 38 (doc page 37).<br>
              FDA: “…a specimen is considered positive for 2019-nCoV
              [virus] if all 2019-nCoV marker (N1, N2) cycle threshold
              growth curves cross the threshold line within 40.00 cycles
              ([less than] 40.00 Ct).”...<br>

              Propulsion System that utilizes fluid induction. There are
              several advantages of doing this specially in conjunction

                  </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scientists
                  harness solar power to produce clean hydrogen from
                  biomass <br>
                </b>A team of scientists at the University of Cambridge
                has developed a way of using solar power to generate a
                fuel that is both sustainable and relatively cheap to
                produce. It’s using natural light to generate hydrogen
                from biomass.<br>
                One of the challenges facing modern society is what it
                does with its waste products. As natural resources
                decline in abundance, using waste for energy is becoming
                more pressing for both governments and business.<br>
                Biomass has been a source of heat and energy since the
                beginning of recorded history.&nbsp; The planet’s oil
                reserves are derived from ancient biomass which has been
                subjected to high pressures and temperatures over
                millions of years. Lignocellulose is the main component
                of plant biomass and up to now its conversion into
                hydrogen has only been achieved through a gasification
                process which uses high temperatures to decompose it
                fully.&nbsp; <br>
                Dr Moritz Kuehnel, from the Department of Chemistry at
                the University of Cambridge, joint lead author on a new
                research paper published in Nature Energy, says:<br>
                "Lignocellulose is nature's equivalent to armoured
                concrete. It consists of strong, highly crystalline
                cellulose fibres, that are interwoven with lignin and
                hemicellulose which act as a glue. This rigid structure
                has evolved to give plants and trees mechanical
                stability and protect them from degradation, and makes
                chemical utilisation of lignocellulose so challenging."<br>
                The new technology relies on a simple photocatalytic
                conversion process. Catalytic nanoparticles are added to
                alkaline water in which the biomass is suspended. This
                is then placed in front of a light in the lab which
                mimics solar light. The solution is ideal for absorbing
                this light and converting the biomass into gaseous
                hydrogen which can then be collected from the headspace.
                The hydrogen is free of fuel-cell inhibitors, such as
                carbon monoxide, which allows it to be used for power.<br>
                The nanoparticle is able to absorb energy from solar
                light and use it to undertake complex chemical
                reactions. In this case, it rearranges the atoms in the
                water and biomass to form hydrogen fuel and other
                organic chemicals, such as formic acid and carbonate.<br>
                Joint lead author, Dr David Wakerley, also of the
                Department of Chemistry, says:<br>
                “There’s a lot of chemical energy stored in raw biomass,
                but it’s unrefined, so you can’t expect it to work in
                complicated machinery, such as a car engine. Our system
                is able to convert the long, messy structures that make
                up biomass into hydrogen gas, which is much more useful.
                We have specifically designed a combination of catalyst
                and solution that allows this transformation to occur
                using sunlight as a source of energy. With this in place
                we can simply add organic matter to the system and then,
                provided it’s a sunny day, produce hydrogen fuel.”<br>
                The team used different types of biomass in their
                experiments. Pieces of wood, paper and leaves were
                placed in test tubes and exposed to solar light. The
                biomass didn’t require any processing beforehand.<br>
                The technology was developed in the Christian Doppler
                Laboratory for Sustainable SynGas Chemistry at the
                University of Cambridge. The head of the laboratory, Dr.
                Erwin Reisner, adds:<br>
                “Our sunlight-powered technology is exciting as it
                enables the production of clean hydrogen from
                unprocessed biomass under ambient conditions. We see it
                as a new and viable alternative to high temperature
                gasification and other renewable means of hydrogen
                production.<br>
                Future development can be envisioned at any scale, from
                small scale devices for off-grid applications to
                industrial-scale plants, and we are currently exploring
                a range of potential commercial options."<br>

                </b>Lignocellulose is Earth’s most abundant form of
                biomass and its valorization to H2 is a key objective
                for the generation of renewable fuels. Solar-driven
                photocatalytic reforming of lignocellulose to H2 at
                ambient temperature offers a sustainable route towards
                this goal, but this reaction is currently limited to
                noble-metal-containing systems that operate with low
                activity under ultraviolet light. Here, we report the
                light-driven photoreforming of cellulose, hemicellulose
                and lignin to H2 using semiconducting cadmium sulfide
                quantum dots in alkaline aqueous solution. We show that
                basic conditions cause these dots to become coated with
                oxide/hydroxide in situ, presenting a strategy to
                improve their photocatalytic performance. The system
                operates under visible light, is stable beyond six days
                and is even able to reform unprocessed lignocellulose,
                such as wood and paper, under solar irradiation at room
                temperature, presenting an inexpensive route to drive
                aqueous proton reduction to H2 through waste biomass
                oxidation.<br>

                </b>The present invention provides a method of producing
                hydrogen, the method comprising the step of exposing a
                photocatalyst to visible and/or ultraviolet light in the
                presence of an organic substrate, wherein the
                photocatalyst has a semiconductor core having an oxide-
                and/or hydroxide-functionalised surface, thereby to
                generate hydrogen from the organic substrate, and the
                hydrogen is optionally collected. The photocatalyst
                semiconductor core may be CdS having oxide- and/or
                hydroxide-functionality at its surface (CdS|CdOx). The
                organic substrate typically contains a component having
                a molecular weight of 50 or more, such as 500 or more.<br>

                      TU/e have developed a plasma-powered mini-plant
                      that produces cheap fertilizer using only sun,
                      water and air.<br>
                      Using state-of-the-art plasma technology to make
                      cheap fertilizer for small farmers. It may sound
                      like magic, but it has now become reality.
                      Researchers at Eindhoven University of Technology
                      (TU/e) have built a small plasma-powered plant
                      that produces nitrogen-based liquid fertilizer
                      only using sun, water and air. “The plant is easy
                      to set up, sustainable and very efficient”, says
                      TU/e researcher Fausto Gallucci, who together with
                      partners in Africa, Germany and Portugal has done
                      successful tests of the device in Uganda. “We now
                      want to bring the mini-plant to the market, so
                      that it becomes available to farmers around the
                      world”...<br>
                      Professor Gallucci explains: “Our mini-plant uses
                      plasma technology. Plasma, as you know, is the
                      fourth state of matter and consists of ionized
                      atoms and molecules. You may be familiar with it
                      from lightning or neon signs, which both consist
                      of plasma”.<br>
                      The plasma used in the fertilizer plant is
                      non-thermal: while the electrons that drive the
                      reaction reach extremely high temperatures, the
                      gas that surrounds can stay relatively cool. This
                      of course saves energy.<br>
                      It makes plasma technology an attractive
                      alternative to the traditional way of producing
                      nitrogen, the so-called Haber–Bosch process, which
                      requires both high pressure and high temperatures.
                      It is estimated that the Haber-Bosch process
                      consumes 1 to 2 percent of the world total energy,
                      emitting some 300 million tons of CO2 every year
                      into the air...<br>
                      Gallucci and his partners have started a TU/e
                      spin-off 4th State Technologies to bring the
                      mini-plant to the market...<br>

                      the 15 to 30 degree mark of "past center". It does
                      work, and it does have forward propulsion, but the
                      Trolley and framework is much too heavy to be
                      propelled by this drive. Using a rubber band as a
                      "tow strap" it will easily "tow" forward, but not
                      backward. I am not taking the time right now to
                      attempt to measure thrust, I am estimating around
                      4 to 8 oz of forward thrust with approximately 2
                      oz of reversion. More than adequate for a small
                      "toy" inertial propulsion device (might be a
                      market for that as an erector set kit) but not

                        from renowned University of Hamburg researcher
                        Roland Wiesendanger concludes the Wuhan
                        Institute of Virology was the “cause” of
                        COVID-19.<br>
                        The February study argues against two prevailing
                        theories that COVID-19 was transmitted to humans
                        either via a wet market or a lab accident.<br>
                        “To date, there is no scientifically based
                        rigorous evidence for either mentioned
                        theories,” Wiesendanger, a three-time recipient
                        of the prestigious European Research Council
                        grant.<br>
                        Wiesendanger’s 105-page report continues,
                        asking: “is the current global crisis actually
                        the result of a coincidence in nature – a
                        coincidental mutation of a coronavirus a bat
                        with the assistance of an intermediate host – or
                        the result of a Scientist carelessness when
                        carrying out the project is high-risk research
                        with global pandemic potential?”<br>
                        To answer the question, Wiesendanger cites 600
                        incontrovertible facts to bolster his theory
                        that “the number and the quality of evidence
                        clearly indicate a laboratory accident at the
                        Wuhan Institute of Virology.”..<br>

                    "The findings were made possible with ancient New

                      Summary</font></font></b><font color="#660000"><font
                    color="#000000"><br>
                    The Perendev motor is claimed to be in the repel
                    mode for proper operation. We question this claim
                    with results of our own experiments. After watching
                    the Perendev video numerout times, we notice that
                    the clam shells in the video more or less just fall
                    right in to the rotor group. We also notice that
                    jacking the clam shells away from the rotor group
                    causes a jerking or pulsing action of the clam shell
                    group as if it is in attraction to the rotor group.
                    From our experiments, I cannot get the clam shell
                    group to close in on the rotors very easily in the
                    repel mode. There is no jerking when the shells
                    leave the rotor group either. They just push apart
                    rapidly in one smooth action. Now, when we setup the
                    unit in the attraction mode we get the same looking
                    results as the Perendev video. But, our unit does
                    not rotate with the measurements we are presently
                    using. Our stator group is not built correctly. The
                    hole spacings are incorrect. We would like to pass
                    on a experiment we have had success with using a
                    track we built. Thjs seems to show the correct
                    measurements needed for a trial run of the motor in
                    attraction. Because of health insurance premiums and
                    being retired on a fixed income, we are taxed out
                    here to build the new stator group with different
                    hole spacings for now. Perhaps someone out there can
                    give it a try. The rotor group holes should be .875
                    in diameter with 0.4375 spacings. This would give a
                    measurement of 1.3125 from center to center of each
                    rotor bore. The stator group holes should be .875 in
                    diameter with .875 spacings. This would give a
                    measurement of 1.750 from center to center of each
                    stator bore. Your rotor group will have to be large
                    enough in diameter to support 30 degree angles using
                    a bore depth of 1.500. A large rotor diameter will
                    have to be used with 30 degree angles at the
                    required depth because of interference problems that
                    arise between bores. Then build the stators to match
                    the rotor group. You must use a magnet length of at
                    least 1.500 in the rotor and stator groups. Longer
                    would be preferred. If you don't, it will fail. You
                    can stack magnets to obtain this minimum length. If
                    you use a shorter length of magnets, shields around
                    the magnets MUST be used. Shields can also be used
                    with the minimum required length of magnets also,
                    which would help by isolating the repel field away
                    from the squeezed flux in the rotor group. The
                    magnets will be setup in the attraction mode from
                    stator to rotor. Such as: All South poles out in the
                    rotor and all north poles out in the stator.
                    IMPORTANT!!!!!!! PUT MAGNETS IN EVERY HOLE IN ROTOR
                    GROUP. SKIP EVERY OTHER HOLE IN STATOR GROUP. There
                    are very important reasons holes are skipped in the
                    stator group. This gives a relaxation time for rotor
                    magnets. It allows the rotor group to be more
                    directional. It weakens flux attraction from
                    previous magnets just passed. We made a board track
                    here to test these measurements and it works very
                    well. The question is....Will it work in a Perendev
                    design without using PFI? I don't know. We hope
                    maybe someone out there will try, and let us know
                    your results. UPDATE: Some do not understand the
                    Perendev method. I will try to explain. A large
                    magnet size may help me get my point accross. Lets
                    take a couple of regular cylinder magnets of say: 2"
                    diameter X 3" long. The flux comes straight out the
                    end of the magnet and curves back to the Bloch wall
                    (some to the other pole) in a mushroom pattern. The
                    exact center of the magnet pole end face is the
                    strongest magnetic flux point on the face of the
                    magnet and slightly weakens to the edges of the face
                    (because of vortex spin). Now, if we wrap the end of
                    the magnet (not the face) with ferrite or of the
                    equivalent this weakens the flux effect in the
                    surroundinh mushroom flux area of the magnet pole.
                    THEN we can angle the magnet and have a differential
                    flux reading (because of angle) to a attracting or
                    repelling magnet. The angle closest to another
                    magnet will be stronger than the wide angle of the
                    magnet. This will not be as effective if we don't
                    surround the magnet with ferrite. The magnetic flux
                    field is contracted and absorbed (not weakened)
                    using this method. The effect is more noticeably
                    seen with larger diameter magnets using angles (more
                    distance across the face). Magnetic flux can extend
                    out from a magnet pole further than you may think in
                    a distorted manner. But the ferrite pulls and
                    contracts the field inwards in a more uniform manner
                    so that a difference in flux density can be seen
                    from one side of the magnet face to the other when
                    angled. When you set this up in a Perendev design,
                    you got yourself one powerful motor. (Plus the
                    magnets will last in the attraction mode) So, don't
                    think about shielding when it comes to magnets.
                    Think about how you can conform and contract the
                    flux field in a more predictable uniform manner
                    using ferrite. Then you will have a good magnetic
                    flux differential across the face when the magnet is
                    angled. After all, flux differential (strong on one
                    side and weaker on the other side) across a magnetic
                    face is all that is required to make a good track or
                    engine. This can all be seen using magnetic film." </font></font><b><font

                      <br>
                    </font></b><font color="#000000">In Part 1 of this
                    article I discussed the catalyst spark which ignited
                    this Fourth Turning and the seemingly delayed
                    regeneracy. In Part 2 I pondered possible Grey
                    Champion prophet generation leaders who could arise
                    during the regeneracy. In Part 3 I will focus on the
                    economic channel of distress which is likely to be
                    the primary driving force in the next phase of this
                    Crisis.<br>
                    <br>
                    There are very few people left on this earth who
                    lived through the last Fourth Turning (1929 – 1946).
                    The passing of older generations is a key component
                    in the recurring cycles which propel the world
                    through the seemingly chaotic episodes that paint
                    portraits on the canvas of history. The current
                    alignment of generations is driving this Crisis and
                    will continue to give impetus to the future
                    direction of this Fourth Turning. The alignment
                    during a Fourth Turning is always the same: Old
                    Artists (Silent) die, Prophets (Boomers) enter
                    elderhood, Nomads (Gen X) enter midlife, Heroes
                    (Millennials) enter young adulthood—and a new
                    generation of child Artists (Gen Y) is born. This is
                    an era in which America’s institutional life is torn
                    down and rebuilt from the ground up—always in
                    response to a perceived threat to the nation’s very
                    survival.<br>
                    <br>
                    For those who understand the theory, there is the
                    potential for impatience and anticipating dire
                    circumstances before the mood of the country turns
                    in response to the 2nd or 3rd perilous incident
                    after the initial catalyst. Neil Howe anticipates
                    the climax of this Crisis arriving in the 2022 to
                    2025 time frame, with the final resolution happening
                    between 2026 and 2029. Any acceleration in these
                    time frames would likely be catastrophic, bloody,
                    and possibly tragic for mankind. As presented by
                    Strauss and Howe, this Crisis will continue to be
                    driven by the core elements of debt, civic decay,
                    and global disorder, with the volcanic eruption
                    traveling along channels of distress and aggravating
                    problems ignored, neglected, or denied for the last
                    thirty years. Let’s examine the channels of distress
                    which will surely sway the direction of this
                    Crisis...</font><b><font color="#000000"><br>

                    </font></b><font color="#000000">There is a strong
                    consensus that modern humans originated in Africa
                    and moved out to colonize the world approximately 50
                    000 years ago. During the process of expansion,
                    variability was lost, creating a linear gradient of
                    decreasing diversity with increasing distance from
                    Africa. However, the exact way in which this loss
                    occurred remains somewhat unclear: did it involve
                    one, a few or a continuous series of population
                    bottlenecks? We addressed this by analysing a large
                    published dataset of 783 microsatellite loci
                    genotyped in 53 worldwide populations, using the
                    program ‘Bottleneck’. Immediately following a sharp
                    population decline, rare alleles are lost faster
                    than heterozygosity, creating a transient excess of
                    heterozygosity relative to allele number, a feature
                    that is used by Bottleneck to infer historical
                    events. We find evidence of two primary events, one
                    ‘out of Africa’ and one placed around the Bering
                    Strait, where an ancient land bridge allowed passage
                    into the Americas. These findings agree well with
                    the regions of the world where the largest founder
                    events might have been expected, but contrast with
                    the apparently smooth gradient of variability that
                    is revealed when current heterozygosity is plotted
                    against distance from Africa.</font><br>

                Coronavirus Strain Was Artificially Engineered<br>
                <br>
              </b>Czech Microbiologist Soňa Peková has claimed in an
              interview that the coronavirus strain which caused the 2nd
              and the 3rd wave was artificially engineered. According to
              her, the COVID-19 vaccine may not work for the British
              coronavirus mutation, and that it is not certain what the
              vaccine will do in five to ten years. She also admitted
              that she would not be vaccinated.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
              Czech Microbiologist Soňa Peková Claims 2nd And 3rd Wave
              Coronavirus Strain Was Artificially Engineered<br>
              <br>
              The Czech microbiologist Soňa Peková said in an interview
              for Reflex and reported by the Czech edition of
              CNN:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
              “I don’t think the vaccine may work. It was developed
              against something that no longer exists here. Some say
              that his vaccine will work for the British strain, but I
              dare to doubt it.”<br>
              <br>
              “This is mainly based on how many significant mutations
              this British strain carries and how much heterogeneity
              (sequence diversity) exists between strains. Vaccines that
              already exist may have a problem with the strains that are
              currently circulating here.”<br>
              <br>
              She understands that pharmaceutical companies are bleeding
              a lot and need a return investment. She also said that
              there is not enough experience in medicine with
              genetically modified vaccines in such a revolutionary
              design as coronavirus vaccines.<br>
              <br>
              “We do not know their long-term safety profile. I would
              not be afraid of so many immediate effects, but those that
              can occur in five to ten years. If someone is thirty, it
              can be a risk. I won’t get vaccinated, “said the
              microbiologist.<br>
              <br>
              According to her, what has circulated and is circulating
              in autumn and winter are other strains, other viruses that
              are not descendants of the spring (virus).<br>
              <br>
              According to her, each wave was caused by a different, new
              virus and have nothing to do with the spring (virus),
              which has disappeared. And the British mutation is already
              the fourth strain in a row.<br>
              <br>
              “The spring virus was the first, the second in September,
              the third in December and the new one, the British, is the
              fourth. I would almost exaggerate to say that it was
              SARS-CoV-2 in the spring, SARS-CoV-3 in September, and
              SARS-CoV-4 in December until now.”<br>
              <br>
              “And the British mutation should be called SARS-CoV-5.
              Each wave behaves clinically a little differently, the
              virus has a different genome, a different program,
              according to which it is written, “Peková specified.<br>
              <br>
              “If the second or third wave came from the first, we would
              see the mutations that the virus picked up over time in
              the viruses of the second and third waves. But this is not
              the case. I have no idea where they came from, “Peková
              said.<br>
              <br>
              “But it’s something else. And I don’t know where the cave
              they are flying from is, “the microbiologist pointed out,
              adding that the viruses are artificially modified
              according to her.<br>
              <br>
              “My message has not changed since the spring: Find the
              cave from which it flies, close it, close its employees
              and its management. Many say we should prepare for another
              pandemic. My God, by no means. This must not set a
              precedent, “Peková said in an interview.<br>
              <br>
              At the same time, she added that the virus does not behave
              at all the way natural isolates behave.<br>
              <br>
              “It goes beyond everything we’ve ever seen. It’s from a
              bat and it’s modified to infect humans,” Peková said.<br>
              <br>
              “Let’s just be vigilant, let’s continue to test and
              objectify what exactly is happening at a given moment,”
              the microbiologist emphasized.<br>
              <br>
              As reported by GreatGameIndia last year, Chinese officials
              deleted 300 studies of Batwoman Shi Zhengli from the top
              secret Wuhan lab linked to the origins of COVID-19.
              Details of more than 300 studies, including many
              investigating diseases that pass from animals to humans
              are no longer available.<br>
              <br>
              Last year a Beijing-based media group Caixin published a
              shocking report that the Hubei Provincial Health and
              Medical Commission ordered the destruction of Coronavirus
              samples.<br>
              <br>
              Five years ago, Italian state owned media Company, Rai –
              Radiotelevisione Italiana, exposed these Chinese
              experiments on viruses.<br>
              <br>
              The video, which was broadcast in November, 2015, showed
              how Chinese scientists were conducting biological
              experiments on a SARS connected virus believed to be
              Coronavirus, derived from bats and mice, asking whether it
              was worth the risk in order to be able to modify the virus
              for compatibility with human organisms.<br>
              <br>
              The person who covered-up this biological experiments and
              orchestrated the myth of the natural origin of COVID-19 is
              Peter Daszak.<br>
              <br>
              The President of EcoHealth Alliance, Peter Daszak is the
              one who orchestrated the myth that COVID-19 is natural in
              origin.<br>

                obituary<br>
              </b><br>
              Coronaviruses are notorious for ADE reactions, where
              antibody presence potentiates the infection instead of
              protecting against it. Using that as a bioweapon is stupid
              because you will score "own goals" on your own people and
              there is no way to control that. As a result biological
              weapons generally are dumb; poison gas and such don't have
              this risk since it does not propagate but any disease
              does.<br>
              <br>
              The poster child for ADE in coronaviruses was an attempted
              vaccine for a feline coronavirus that often made cats very
              sick. The vaccine killed every one of them in the test
              when they were later exposed, wildly potentiating the
              infection.<br>
              <br>
              Read that again folks: NOT ONE VACCINATED CAT SURVIVED A
              CHALLENGE WITH THE ACTUAL VIRUS.<br>
              <br>
              Ordinary vaccines we have lots of experience with, such as
              measles, the flu shot, mumps and similar do not carry a
              risk beyond that of natural infection and cannot be
              weaponized because they produce the exact same antibody
              response as a natural infection. If you have had either
              the measles or the shot you will have antibodies but an
              antibody test will not tell you which since they're not
              distinguishable.<br>
              <br>
              I suspected from the start that due to the way these mRNA
              shots work -- they are not actually a vaccine at all in
              that they do not "mimic" natural infection but rather
              cause your cells to produce the spike protein that the
              virus has and that elicits an immune response -- that the
              antibodies produced by those jabs would be distinct and
              distinguishable from natural infection.<br>
              <br>
              All of the so-called "experts" who worked to develop these
              and the firms involved knew damn well this was the case
              when they started developing them -- and did it anyway.<br>
              <br>
              Now we have hard, scientific confirmation of that and it's
              very bad.<br>
              <br>
              In fact it's potentially nation-ending bad.<br>
              <br>
              An adversary that develops a virus (e.g. another
              modified/mutated bat virus, for example) that selectively
              targets ADE in people with the specific antibodies from
              vaccination, which are distinct from natural infection,
              could easily kill every single person who was vaccinated
              and not harm or only make mildly sick those who either had
              Covid-19 naturally or who were uninfected and
              unvaccinated.<br>
              <br>
              The nightmare scenario that has always driven bioweapons
              research is the push to discover some genetically distinct
              means of targeting a bioweapon such that it only kills
              your adversary and leaves everyone else alone. It's even
              worse for your adversary if your side gets and transmits
              it but doesn't get sick. This has never been found despite
              diligent effort in the past; all attempts to find such a
              distinct vulnerability have failed, showing reactivity
              across the board and thus strongly suggesting that if that
              "thing" was completed and got out it would kill
              indiscriminately. That you cannot stop a virus from
              circulating (even isolated islands eventually got hit by
              the 1918 pandemic flu!) means that releasing a virus or
              bacteria that nobody on "your" side has been sensitized to
              yet doesn't help because when (not if) the sensitizing
              agent gets into your population all your people die too.<br>
              <br>
              This has now, for the first time in human history, been
              changed by the idiotic actions of our governments and
              pharmaceutical companies in that we are now tagging people
              for death by the literal millions and they will die if an
              adversary is able to develop a virus that targets those
              specific antibodies.<br>
              <br>
              Of course, said adversary will not deploy the tagging via
              said shots in their population and thus their people will
              not be attacked and killed. Since it takes an actual jab
              of a needle to be sensitized absent intentional action
              there is no risk to the adversary's population or troops.<br>
              <br>
              I give the odds of an adversary (remember, we're talking
              nations here with nearly unlimited resources and plenty of
              smart people) figuring out how to selectively target
              Covid-19 vaccination antibodies at 50% or better within
              the next five years.<br>
              <br>
              If they succeed every single person who took one of the
              vaccines that produces a distinguishable antibody dies.<br>
              <br>
              You can bet your last nickel they're working on it right
              now.<br>
              <br>
              What happens if they succeed and we forcibly vaccinated
              our children and anyone who wishes to have a "normal" life
              back? The entire procreation-capable stock of people in
              the United States will die and so will America.<br>
              <br>
              That risk is wildly beyond the boundaries of sanity to
              have ever been accepted and it was deliberately concealed
              from the people -- not just here, but throughout the
              Western World.<br>
              <br>
              It's clearly not enough for certain ghouls to have
              destroyed a full year of most school-age children's
              education; now they propose to risk literally
              extinguishing all of their lives and thus the future
              generations they would be able to create down the road.<br>
              <br>
              I pray I'm wrong.<br>
              <br>
              Unfortunately I know that I'm not -- there are plenty of
              people, both terrorists and evil nation-states that would
              love to unleash something like this on those they hate,
              they will work on this problem and if they discover a way
              to exploit it they will do so.<br>
              <br>
              The use of any "vaccine" that does not produce an
              identical antibody to natural infection must be halted
              immediately and never done again. We cannot do anything
              for the people already stabbed but we can eliminate the
              incentive to develop such a weapon by not having any
              material percentage of the productive and young population
              able to be targeted.<br>
              <br>
              The option to cancel the risk of self-destruction of our
              nation and many others will expire within weeks...<br>

                    Abstract<br>
                  </font></b><font color="#000000">Thermoelectric
                  generators (TEGs) are an excellent candidate for
                  powering wearable electronics and the “Internet of
                  Things,” due to their capability of directly
                  converting heat to electrical energy. Here, we report
                  a high-performance wearable TEG with superior
                  stretchability, self-healability, recyclability, and
                  Lego-like reconfigurability, by combining modular
                  thermoelectric chips, dynamic covalent polyimine, and
                  flowable liquid-metal electrical wiring in a
                  mechanical architecture design of “soft
                  motherboard-rigid plugin modules.” A record-high
                  open-circuit voltage among flexible TEGs is achieved,
                  reaching 1 V/cm2 at a temperature difference of 95 K.
                  Furthermore, this TEG is integrated with a
                  wavelength-selective metamaterial film on the cold
                  side, leading to greatly improved device performance
                  under solar irradiation, which is critically important
                  for wearable energy harvesting during outdoor
                  activities. The optimal properties and design concepts
                  of TEGs reported here can pave the way for delivering
                  the next-generation high-performance, adaptable,
                  customizable, durable, economical, and eco-friendly
                  energy-harvesting devices with wide applications...</font><b><font

                    Device design and fabrication<br>
                  </font></b><font color="#000000">The TEG is composed
                  of modular thermoelectric chips, liquid metal as
                  electrical wiring, and dynamic covalent thermoset
                  polyimine as both the substrate and encapsulation for
                  liquid-metal wiring (Fig. 1A). Polyimine can be
                  synthesized by cross-linking three commercially
                  available compounds, terephthalaldehyde,
                  3,3′-diamino-N-methyldipropylamine, and
                  tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (fig. S1) (29, 35, 36). To
                  fabricate the thermoelectric chips, we deposited thin
                  film Bi and Sb chalcogenides onto polyimide films
                  using a thermal evaporator, serving as the n-type legs
                  and p-type legs, respectively (fig. S2). The sizes of
                  n-type legs and p-type legs were determined by a power
                  conversion efficiency optimization process (note S1
                  and table S1). To improve crystallinity and
                  performance, we then treated the thermoelectric films
                  at 320°C for 26 min in argon atmosphere. Then, Au-Ge
                  electrodes were deposited using a thermal evaporator
                  to form connections between n-type legs and p-type
                  legs, which finishes the fabrication of thermoelectric
                  chips (figs. S2 and S3A). The process of assembling
                  modular thermoelectric chips into TEGs is
                  schematically described in Fig. 1A. It started with
                  laser-cutting a polyimine substrate to create slots
                  (fig. S3B), followed by screen-printing patterned
                  liquid-metal electrical wirings (figs. S3C and S4).
                  Then, the modular thermoelectric chips were inserted
                  into the slots of the polyimine substrate, and a small
                  amount of the polyimine solution [terephthalaldehyde +
                  3,3′-diamino-N-methyldipropylamine +
                  tris(2-aminoethyl)amine in methanol] was applied to
                  bond the thermoelectric chips with the substrate and
                  to encapsulate the liquid-metal wiring...</font><b><font

                  "coronavirus" spread across the globe, somewhat
                  further than the virus that sparked the panic. In
                  SARS- and Other Coronaviruses: Laboratory Protocols,
                  expert researchers examine these devastating viruses
                  through detailed laboratory protocols. Chapters deal
                  with such subjects as detection and discovery of
                  coronaviruses by nucleic acid and antibody-based
                  approaches, virus isolation, propagation and
                  titration, virus purification, structure analysis by
                  electron cryomicroscopy, expression and
                  crystallization of viral proteins, raising antibodies
                  against viral proteins, manipulation of the
                  coronavirus genome, and descriptions of how to
                  investigate aspects of the cell surface for
                  coronavirus receptors. Composed in the highly
                  successful Methods in Molecular Biology™ series
                  format, each chapter contains a brief introduction,
                  step-by-step methods, a list of necessary materials,
                  and a Notes section which shares tips on

                  </font></b><font color="#000000">1.The voluntary
                  consent of the human subject is absolutely
                  essential.&nbsp; This means that the person involved
                  should have legal capacity to give consent; should be
                  so situated as to be able to exercise free power of
                  choice, without the intervention of any element of
                  force, fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching, or other
                  ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should
                  have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the
                  elements of the subject matter involved, as to enable
                  him to make an understanding and enlightened decision.
                  This latter element requires that, before the
                  acceptance of an affirmative decision by the
                  experimental subject, there should be made known to
                  him the nature, duration, and purpose of the
                  experiment; the method and means by which it is to be
                  conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonably
                  to be expected; and the effects upon his health or
                  person, which may possibly come from his participation
                  in the experiment.&nbsp; The duty and responsibility
                  for ascertaining the quality of the consent rests upon
                  each individual who initiates, directs or engages in
                  the experiment. It is a personal duty and
                  responsibility which may not be delegated to another
                  with impunity.&nbsp; 2.The experiment should be such
                  as to yield fruitful results for the good of society,
                  unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and
                  not random and unnecessary in nature.&nbsp; 3.The
                  experiment should be so designed and based on the
                  results of animal experimentation and a knowledge of
                  the natural history of the disease or other problem
                  under study, that the anticipated results will justify
                  the performance of the experiment.&nbsp; 4.The
                  experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all
                  unnecessary physical and mental suffering and
                  injury.&nbsp; 5.No experiment should be conducted,
                  where there is an apriori reason to believe that death
                  or disabling injury will occur; except, perhaps, in
                  those experiments where the experimental physicians
                  also serve as subjects.&nbsp; 6.The degree of risk to
                  be taken should never exceed that determined by the
                  humanitarian importance of the problem to be solved by
                  the experiment.&nbsp; 7.Proper preparations should be
                  made and adequate facilities provided to protect the
                  experimental subject against even remote possibilities
                  of injury, disability, or death.&nbsp; 8.The
                  experiment should be conducted only by scientifically
                  qualified persons. The highest degree of skill and
                  care should be required through all stages of the
                  experiment of those who conduct or engage in the
                  experiment.&nbsp; 9.During the course of the
                  experiment, the human subject should be at liberty to
                  bring the experiment to an end, if he has reached the
                  physical or mental state, where continuation of the
                  experiment seemed to him to be impossible.&nbsp; <br>
                  10.During the course of the experiment, the scientist
                  in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment
                  at any stage, if he has probable cause to believe, in
                  the exercise of the good faith, superior skill and
                  careful judgement required of him, that a continuation
                  of the experiment is likely to result in injury,
                  disability, or death to the experimental
                  subject.&nbsp; "Trials of War Criminals before the

                  “Every statement I put on Instagram was sourced from a
                  government database, from peer-reviewed publications
                  and from carefully confirmed news stories. None of my
                  posts were false. Facebook, the pharmaceutical
                  industry and its captive regulators use the term
                  ‘vaccine misinformation’ as a euphemism for any
                  factual assertion that departs from official
                  pronouncements about vaccine health and safety,
                  whether true or not. This kind of censorship is
                  counterproductive if our objective is a safe and
                  effective vaccine supply.<br>
                  <br>
                  “The pharmaceutical industry is hastily creating
                  vaccines using taxpayer money and untested
                  technologies. These include a rash of risky new
                  products that are exempt from liability, from
                  long-term safety testing and that have not received
                  FDA approval. Emergency Use Authorization is a mass
                  population scientific experiment. If it has any prayer
                  of working, it will require extraordinary scrutiny
                  from the press and the public.<br>
                  <br>
                  “Instead, the mainstream media and social media giants
                  are imposing a totalitarian censorship to prevent
                  public health advocates, like myself, from voicing
                  concerns and from engaging in civil informed debate in
                  the public square. They are punishing, shaming,
                  vilifying, gaslighting and abolishing individuals who
                  report their own vaccine injuries.<br>
                  <br>

                DeSantis Tells Biden: “Go Fuck Yourself”</b><b><br>
              </b>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Wednesday did not
              mince words on a congested conference call with Biden and
              federal health authorities who are seeking to prohibit
              domestic travel to and from the Sunshine State. DeSantis
              and Biden exchanged salvos of biting barbs after the
              criminal president said the federal government had
              authority to “restrict movement” of the people.,,<br>
              “Florida absolutely will not comply,” DeSantis repeated.
              “Instituting a travel ban or restriction of movement would
              be a gross example of federal overreach with no grounding
              in law or science. We have Covid-19 in check, and you’re
              trying to exert unlawful authority over our state and its
              people,” he chided Biden.<br>
              Biden then tacitly threatened to withhold federal funding
              and to deny Florida access to Covid-19 vaccinations.<br>
              “C’mon, man, Florida needs our help, and you need
              vaccines, which are hard to come by, isn’t that right, Dr.
              Fauci,” Biden said.<br>
              The “Deep State” doctor replied in the affirmative,
              telling DeSantis that he expects the prevalence of the UK
              variant to double or triple every week to 10 days.<br>
              “Governor, do you want to be responsible for reinfecting
              the nation? Truth is, we don’t even know how effective
              current vaccines are against the UK strain.”<br>
              DeSantis told Dr. Fauci he trusted his own state health
              authorities over financially incentivized federal
              officials.<br>
              “How much do you stand to earn from these vaccines, Dr.
              Fauci? And, Joe, if you continue with this course of
              action, I will authorize the state National Guard to
              protect the movement of Floridians,” DeSantis said.<br>
              “Address me as Mr. President or President Biden,” Biden
              said.<br>
              “I will not, and you can go fuck yourself,” DeSantis said
              before hanging up.<br>

                Spike Protein in Moderna, Pfizer Vaccines Cause Blood
                Clots, Brain Inflammation and Heart Attacks?</b><b><br>
              </b><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Lyn
                Redwood</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              Dr. J. Patrick Whelan, a pediatric rheumatologist, warned
              the FDA in December that mRNA vaccines could cause
              microvascular injury to the brain, heart, liver and
              kidneys in ways not assessed in safety trials...<br>
              Specifically, Whelan was concerned that the new mRNA
              vaccine technology utilized by Pfizer and Moderna has “the
              potential to cause microvascular injury (inflammation and
              small blood clots called microthrombi) to the brain,
              heart, liver and kidneys in ways that were not assessed in
              the safety trials.”<br>
              While Whelan did not dispute the vaccines’ potential to
              quickly arrest the spread of the virus (assuming that the
              vaccines prove to actually prevent transmission — also not
              assessed in the clinical trials), he cautioned that “it
              would be vastly worse if hundreds of millions of people
              were to suffer long-lasting or even permanent damage to
              their brain or heart microvasculature as a result of
              failing to appreciate in the short-term an unintended
              effect of full-length spike protein-based vaccines on
              other organs.”<br>
              Unfortunately, Whelan’s concerns were not acknowledged,
              and the agency instead relied on the limited clinical
              trial data...<br>

                acid from synthetic oil</b><br>
              In this video we will be working with the previously made
              pyrolysis oil to make the pyrolysis oil more usable we
              need to get rid of the acidic compounds that were formed
              during the pyrolysis process. Therefore we perform a
              simple extraction with sodium hydroxide and regenerate the
              naphthenic acids by reacting the sodium slats formed in
              the extraction with hydrochloric acid<br>

                COVID-19 ‘Vaccines’ May Destroy the Lives of Millions
                --&nbsp; Judy Mikovits</b><b><br>
              </b><b>Story at-a-glance</b><br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The COVID-19 vaccine really isn’t a
              vaccine in the medical definition of a vaccine. It’s more
              accurately an experimental gene therapy that could
              prematurely kill large amounts of the population and
              disable exponentially more. Since mRNA normally rapidly
              degrades, it must be complexed with lipids or polymers.
              COVID-19 vaccines use PEGylated lipid nanoparticles, and
              PEG is known to cause anaphylaxis. Free mRNA can signal
              danger to your immune system and drive inflammatory
              diseases. As such, injecting synthetic thermostable mRNA
              (mRNA that is resistant to breaking down) is highly
              problematic as it can fuel chronic, long-term
              inflammation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many commonly reported
              side effects from the COVID-19 gene therapy “vaccines”
              appear to be caused by brain inflammation. &nbsp;&nbsp;
              Anyone with an inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid
              arthritis, Parkinson's disease or chronic Lyme and those
              with acquired immune deficiency/dysfunction from any
              microbial pathogen, brain trauma or environmental toxin
              are at high risk of dying from COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.<br>

              ..."The Pais Effect comprises the generation of extremely
              high electromagnetic energy fluxes (and hence high local
              energy densities) generated by controlled motion of
              electrically charged matter (from solid to plasma states)
              subjected to accelerated vibration and/or accelerated
              spin, via rapid acceleration transients.<br>
              <br>
              Such high energy EM radiation can locally interact with
              the Vacuum Energy State (VES) - the VES being the Fifth
              State of Matter (Fifth Essence - Quintessence), in other

              The War Zone spoke with Carl Willis, a nuclear engineer
              and reactor supervisor at the University of New Mexico who
              also serves as Senior Research Engineer for Verus
              Research, a company that is working on an advanced dense
              plasma focus fusion neutron source for the Army, a
              technology Willis says Verus does not view as "a
              competitive approach to a fusion power plant, or a
              competitor in any meaningful sense toward anything Dr.
              Pais is working on for that matter."<br>
              <br>
              According to Willis, Dr. Pais's most recent work
              represents "a classic case of pathological science."
              Willis says the literature for the plasma compression
              fusion device contains invented jargon, nonsensical
              statements, weak or absent evidence of an informed
              theoretical basis, an "overabundance of nebulous
              adjectives and adverbs instead of meaningful quantities in
              technical writing," and "lots of statements made in
              passing that seem to contradict basic and accepted
              physics."<br>
              <br>
              Willis says that Dr. Pais "references subjects that have
              consistently been plagued with pathological science and
              popular misunderstanding for decades, such as vacuum
              energy.&nbsp; It's hard not to suspect he's either
              drinking the kool-aid himself, or just chumming the waters
              for the kind of people who do." <br>
              <br>
              Still, even Willis notes that "this case is mildly unusual
              in that the author has a Ph. D. and is employed by the
              government, his patents are assigned to the government,
              and the paper is slated to appear in a rather widely-read
              IEEE outlet.&nbsp; However, these facts in no way temper
              my view that this is all basically nonsense--it just
              raises additional questions about the cui bono of this
              particular case."...<br>

                Plasma Compression Fusion Device—Enabling Nuclear Fusion
                Ignition</b><b><br>
              </b><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Salvatore
                Cezar Pais</b><b><br>
              </b><b>Abstract:</b><br>
              The plasma compression fusion device (PCFD) generates the
              energy gain by plasma compression-induced nuclear fusion.
              This concept has the capability of maximizing the product
              of plasma pressure and energy confinement time to maximize
              the energy gain, and thus give rise to fusion ignition
              conditions. The preferred embodiment of this original
              concept uses a hollow cross-duct configuration of circular
              cross section in which the concentrated magnetic energy
              flux from two pairs of opposing curved-headed
              counter-spinning conical structures (possibly made from an
              alloy of tungsten with high capacitance) whose outer
              surfaces are electrically charged compresses a gaseous
              mixture of fusion fuel into a plasma, heated to extreme
              temperatures and pressures. The generated high-intensity
              electromagnetic (EM) radiation heats the plasma and the
              produced magnetic fields confine it in between the
              counter-spinning conical structures, named the dynamic
              fusors (four of them-smoothly curved apex sections
              opposing each other in pairs). The dynamic fusors can be
              assemblies of electrified grids and toroidal magnetic
              coils, arranged within a conical structure whose outer
              surface is electrically charged. The cross-duct inner
              surface surrounding the plasma core region is also
              electrically charged and vibrated in an accelerated mode
              to minimize the flux of plasma particles (including
              neutrals) from impacting the PCFD surfaces and initiating
              a plasma quench. The fusion fuel (preferably deuterium
              gas) is introduced into the plasma core through the
              counterspinning conical structures, namely, injected
              through orifices in the dynamic fusor heads. There is
              envisioned another even more compact version of this
              concept, which uses accelerated vibration in a linear-duct
              configuration (using two counterspinning dynamic fusors
              only) and would best be suited for fusion power generation
              on aircraft, or main battle tanks. The concept uses
              controlled motion of electrically charged matter through
              accelerated vibration and/or accelerated spin subjected to
              smooth, yet rapid acceleration transients, to generate
              extremely high-energy/high-intensity EM radiation (fields
              of high-energy photons) which not only confines the plasma
              but also greatly compresses itso as to produce a high
              power density plasma burn, leading to ignition. The PCFD
              concept can produce power in the gigawatt to terawatt
              range (and higher) with input power in the kilowatt to
              megawatt range and can possibly lead to ignition
              (selfsustained) plasma burn. Several important practical
              engineering and operational issues with operating a device
              such as the PCFD are discussed.<br>

              also a closed system test at the end of the video. Weight
              is 1.6 pounds. In the test video you can see the positive
              power supply wire tense up which is addressed in this
              video. Power supply wire that connects directly to
              drive/cylinder responsible for all movement of 1.6 pounds
              is just a single 16 gauge speaker wire. Once in space this
              will provide constant acceleration in one direction in a
              vacuum using only electricity. No gases needed as in an
              ion thruster and a lot more force. Positive power only.
              Negative wire end is hanging far away from supply and is
              taped off in test at the end. Hissing is inside power
              supply tube at connectors and would not push 1.6 pounds.
              Now that I know cylinder design is just to allow charge to
              flow out the back so power wire can tense up and cause
              forward&nbsp; movement without any detrimental effect from
              equal and opposite reaction in a closed system I will be
              working on power wire configurations to get the most
              force. In test at end wall wart connected to Variac to
              provide power to just the power supply itself had no part
              in producing forward only movement in previous test and
              does not have any effect in test at the end of this video.<br>

                      from low-temperature environmental heat via
                      thermoelectric generators (TEG) is a versatile and
                      maintenance-free solution for large-scale waste
                      heat recovery and supplying renewable energy to a
                      growing number of devices in the Internet of
                      Things (IoT) that require an independent wireless
                      power supply. A prerequisite for market
                      competitiveness, however, is the cost-effective
                      and scalable manufacturing of these TEGs. Our
                      approach is to print the devices using printable
                      thermoelectric polymers and composite materials.
                      We present a mass-producible potentially low-cost
                      fully screen printed flexible origami TEG. Through
                      a unique two-step folding technique, we produce a
                      mechanically stable 3D cuboidal device from a 2D
                      layout printed on a thin flexible substrate using
                      thermoelectric inks based on PEDOT nanowires and a
                      TiS2:Hexylamine-complex material. We realize a
                      device architecture with a high thermocouple
                      density of 190 per cm² by using the thin substrate
                      as electrical insulation between the
                      thermoelectric elements resulting in a high-power
                      output of 47.8 µWcm−² from a 30 K temperature
                      difference. The device properties are adjustable
                      via the print layout, specifically, the thermal
                      impedance of the TEGs can be tuned over several
                      orders of magnitudes allowing thermal impedance
                      matching to any given heat source. We demonstrate
                      a wireless energy-harvesting application by
                      powering an autonomous weather sensor comprising a
                      Bluetooth module and a power management system.<br>

                      referred to as Industry 4.0), companies are aiming
                      towards energy-efficient production processes.
                      This transition requires billions of sensor nodes,
                      which need to be powered. A similar trend is
                      observed with the growing Internet of Things
                      (IoT)1. Again, billions of small electronic units
                      need to be powered, many of them not connected to
                      a grid. To avoid adverse effects on global energy
                      consumption, these autonomous devices need to be
                      powered by green energy2,3. It is therefore
                      crucial to develop sustainable energy technologies
                      alongside the innovations of digitization to power
                      its hardware by harvesting renewable energies...<br>

                      manufacturing (AM) is a recent growing technology,
                      which is currently implemented for different
                      application fields, from rapid prototyping to
                      cost-effective manufacturing of industrial

                      thermoelectric materials offer synergies with AM
                      and can be integrated into 3D printed
                      thermoelectric generators (TEGs). In this work, we
                      have formulated an Ag2Se-based n-type printable
                      thermoelectric (TE) ink with a high
                      figure-of-merit of ∼1 at room temperature. Three
                      scaffolds with different shapes have been printed
                      using 3D printing. The developed ink as n-type
                      legs and commercially available PEDOT as p-type
                      legs were then painted on the 3D printed scaffolds
                      to fabricate three TEGs with a different number of
                      legs and shapes. The performance of the TEGs was
                      studied for different temperature differences
                      between ΔT = 10 and 70 K. Power output (Pmax)

                      River’s postulates were proposed by Thomas M.
                      River in 1973 to establish the role of a specific
                      virus as the cause of a specific disease. They are
                      modifications of Koch’s postulates. They are as
                      follows:<br>
                      <br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The viral agent must be found
                      either in the host’s (animal or plant) body fluids
                      at the time of disease or in cells showing lesions
                      specific to that disease.<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The host material with the
                      viral agent used to inoculate the healthy host
                      (test organism) must be free of any other
                      microorganism.<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The viral agent obtained from
                      the infected host must produce the specific
                      disease in a suitable healthy host, and/or provide
                      evidence of infection by inducing the formation of
                      antibodies specific to that agent.<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar material (viral
                      particle) from the newly infected host (test
                      organism) must be isolated and capable of
                      transmitting the specific disease to other healthy
                      hosts.<br>
                      <br>
                      Whichever set of postulates is used, SARS-CoV-2
                      fails the test. Dr. Andrew Kaufman does a great
                      job explaining why in this video. The coronavirus
                      SARS-CoV-2 (allegedly causing the disease
                      COVID-19) has not been shown to be present only in
                      sick people and not in healthy ones. The virus has
                      never been isolated, which must be done with
                      proper equipment such as electron microscopes and
                      which cannot be achieved through CT scans (as the
                      Chinese were using) and the flawed PCR test. The
                      January 24th 2020 study published in the New
                      England Journal of Medicine entitled A Novel
                      Coronavirus from Patients with Pneumonia in China,
                      2019 describes how the scientists arrived at the
                      idea of COVID-19: they took lung fluid samples and
                      extracted RNA from them using the PCR test. It
                      admits that the coronavirus failed Koch’s
                      postulates:<br>
                      <br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Further development of
                      accurate and rapid methods to identify unknown
                      respiratory pathogens is still needed … our study
                      does not fulfill Koch’s postulates.”<br>

                      stitched together using genomic database sequences
                      (some viral, some not). It has never been properly
                      purified and isolated so that it could be
                      sequenced from end-to-end once derived from living
                      tissue; instead, it’s just digitally assembled
                      from a computer database. In this paper, the CDC
                      scientists state they took just 37 base pairs from
                      a genome of 30,000 base pairs which means that
                      about 0.001% of the viral sequence is derived from
                      actual living samples or real bodily tissue. In
                      other words, they took these 37 segments and put
                      them into a computer program, which filled in the
                      rest of the base pairs. This computer-generation

                      In this article In June Study CDC Scientists Make
                      2 COVID Admissions that Destroy Official Narrative
                      I reveal how the CDC admitted in their paper that
                      they extrapolated their make-believe virus. Here
                      is the quote:<br>
                      <br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Whole-Genome Sequencing<br>
                      <br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We designed 37 pairs of nested
                      PCRs spanning the genome on the basis of the
                      coronavirus reference sequence (GenBank accession
                      no. NC045512). We extracted nucleic acid from
                      isolates and amplified by using the 37 individual
                      nested PCRs.”<br>
                      <br>
                      Another way to say this is that the “virus” has
                      been constructed using a technique called de novo
                      assembly which is a method for constructing
                      genomes from a large number of (short or long) DNA
                      fragments, with no a priori knowledge of the
                      correct sequence or order of those fragments. You

                      an “In Silico” Virus<br>
                      <br>
                      The original Corman-Drosten paper admits they used
                      a theoretical virus sequence for all their work
                      and calculations. They, like the CDC and every
                      government and agency, claim this is only because
                      no isolate was ever available. I wonder if any of
                      these scientists every asked WHY the isolate has
                      never been available?<br>
                      <br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “In the present case of
                      2019-nCoV, virus isolates or samples from infected
                      patients have so far not become available to the
                      international public health community.”<br>

                      Corman-Drosten paper was published entitled

                      the molecular and methodological level:
                      consequences for false positive results. It
                      highlights how the authors used in silico or
                      theoretical sequences from computer banks, not
                      real isolated samples from infected people. “In
                      silico” is pseudo-Latin for “theoretical”; in
                      plain English, synonyms for theoretical are
                      “imaginary” and “make-believe.”<br>
                      <br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The first and major issue is
                      that the novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (in the
                      publication named 2019-nCoV and in February 2020
                      named SARS-CoV-2 by an international consortium of
                      virus experts) is based on in silico (theoretical)
                      sequences, supplied by a laboratory in China,
                      because at the time neither control material of
                      infectious (“live”) or inactivated SARS-CoV-2 nor
                      isolated genomic RNA of the virus was available to
                      the authors. To date no validation has been
                      performed by the authorship based on isolated
                      SARS-CoV-2 viruses or full length RNA thereof.<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless these in silico
                      sequences were used to develop a RT-PCR test
                      methodology to identify the aforesaid virus. This
                      model was based on the assumption that the novel
                      virus is very similar to SARS-CoV from 2003
                      (Hereafter named SARS-CoV-1) as both are
                      beta-coronaviruses … in short, a design relying
                      merely on close genetic relatives does not fulfill
                      the aim for a “robust diagnostic test” as cross
                      reactivity and therefore false-positive results
                      will inevitably occur. Validation was only done in
                      regards to in silico (theoretical) sequences and
                      within the laboratory-setting, and not as required
                      for in-vitro diagnostics with isolated genomic
                      viral RNA. This very fact hasn’t changed even
                      after 10 months of introduction of the test into
                      routine diagnostics.”<br>

                      Leader, who questioned the UK MHRA (Medicines and
                      Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) whether a
                      real isolated virus was used to make the COVID vax
                      (read more about the COVID vaccine which is not a
                      vaccine here). Leader found that the WHO protocols
                      that Pfizer used to produce the mRNA do not appear
                      to identify any nucleotide sequences that are
                      unique to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Leader asked if
                      the “virus” was actually a computer generated
                      genomic sequence, and ultimately the MHRA

                      health journal Salud published a great article in
                      November 2020 entitled “Frauds and falsehoods in
                      the medical field” where it exposes the lack of
                      evidence not only for the isolation of SARS-CoV-2,
                      but also for the isolation of other past
                      coronaviruses (unofficial translation here). The
                      scam runs deep. Jon Rappoport has done great work
                      exposing how the exact same scam blueprint was
                      played out in the 1980s (with Fauci in charge,
                      leading the fraud) when scientists asserted there
                      was a new virus called HIV, and it was causing
                      AIDS. The COVID scamdemic greatly mimics other
                      historical fake pandemics such as the 1976 swine
                      flu pandemic. The article is Salud states:<br>
                      <br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The genetic sequences used in
                      PCRs to detect suspected SARS-CoV-2 and to
                      diagnose cases of illness and death attributed to
                      Covid-19 are present in dozens of sequences of the
                      human genome itself and in those of about a
                      hundred microbes. And that includes the initiators
                      or primers, the most extensive fragments taken at
                      random from their supposed “genome” and even the
                      so-called “target genes” allegedly specific to the
                      “new coronavirus”. The test is worthless and all
                      “positive” results obtained so far should be
                      scientifically invalidated and communicated to
                      those affected; and if they are deceased, to their
                      relatives. Stephen Bustin, one of the world’s
                      leading experts on PCR, in fact says that under
                      certain conditions anyone can test positive!<br>
                      <br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been warning you since
                      March [2020 – Ed.]: you cannot have specific tests
                      for a virus without knowing the components of the
                      virus you are trying to detect. And the components
                      cannot be known without having previously
                      isolated/purified that virus. Since then we
                      continue to accumulate evidence that no one has
                      isolated SARS-CoV-2 and, more importantly, that it
                      can never be isolated … In this report we are
                      going to add the results of a particular research
                      we have done from the data published on the
                      alleged SARS-CoV-2 and on the protocols endorsed
                      by the WHO for the use of RT-PCR as well as the
                      data corresponding to the rest of the “human
                      coronaviruses”. And the conclusions are extremely
                      serious: none of the seven “human coronaviruses”
                      have actually been isolated and all the sequences
                      of the primers of their respective PCRs as well as
                      those of a large number of fragments of their
                      supposed genomes are found in different areas of
                      the human genome and in genomes of bacteria and
                      archaea …”<br>
                      <br>
                      Their report analyzed human coronaviruses 229E
                      (said to have been isolated in 1965), OC43 (in
                      1967), SARS-CoV (in 2003), NL63 (in 2004), HKU1
                      (in 2005) and MERS-CoV (in 2012). And just to
                      repeat in case you missed it: they discovered the
                      alleged sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are found in both
                      humans and bacteria! This means all the various in
                      silico models of SARS-CoV-2 contain existing human
                      genetic sequences, so it is little wonder that
                      people test positive when the primer or standard
                      being tested against contains human sequences.<br>

                      all start? Chinese scientists took lung fluid
                      samples and claimed they had discovered a novel or
                      new virus. The Gates-Rockefeller WHO backed them
                      up. In the WHO’s Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCov
                      Situation Report 1, they state:<br>
                      <br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The Chinese authorities
                      identified a new type of coronavirus, which was
                      isolated on 7 January 2020……On 12 January 2020,
                      China shared the genetic sequence of the novel
                      coronavirus for countries to use in developing
                      specific diagnostic kits.”<br>
                      <br>
                      With the evidence presented above, the WHO’s
                      assertions and claims are utterly baseless. They
                      constitute outright fraud. The world has been shut
                      down over a lie – a coldly calculated, carefully
                      curated lie – that was simulated and war-gamed for
                      decades in advance. The COVID cult is an
                      irrational superstition based on nothing but in
                      silico, theoretical, make-believe viral sequences.
                      Yet, the real-world consequences for millions who
                      have been thrown into stress, despair, poverty,
                      joblessness, alcoholism and suicide is anything

                      against those tissues, causing inflammation that
                      can lead to blood clot formation... a
                      recently-infected patient who is subject to
                      covid-19 vaccination is likely to suffer from
                      autoimmune attacks along the ACE-2 receptors
                      present in the heart, and in the microvasculature
                      of the brain, liver and kidney. The risk is
                      doubled because two shots are required.<br>
                      It is a well documented fact that SARS-CoV-2, the
                      Wuhan coronavirus, readily targets humans through
                      the vascular endothelium. The virus is known to
                      enter into endothelial cells through the ACE-2
                      receptor on the endothelium. Because of this
                      unique gain-of-function, one of the medical
                      emergencies that may occur in covid-19 patients is
                      thromboembolic complications (formation of a blood
                      clot inside a blood vessel). If viral antigens are
                      present in the endothelial lining of blood
                      vessels, then the vaccine will cause an
                      antigen-specific immune response that attacks
                      those precious tissues, potentially causing
                      cardiovascular events. The research warns that the
                      vaccine is “almost certain to do damage to the
                      vascular endothelium,” especially in the elderly.
                      This vaccine-induced endothelial inflammation is
                      “certain to cause blood clot formation with the
                      potential for major thromboembolic complications
                      in a subset of such patients,” he warns....<br>

                      the evolutio of SARS-CoV-2 in the immune
                      population, we co-incubated authentic virus with a
                      highly neutralizing plasma from a COVID-19
                      convalescent patient. The plasma fully neutralized
                      the virus for 7 passages, but after 45 days, the
                      deletion of F140 in the spike N-terminal domain
                      (NTD) N3 loop led to partial breakthrough. At day
                      73, an E484K substitution in the receptor-binding
                      domain (RBD) occurred, followed at day 80 by an
                      insertion in the NTD N5 loop containing a new
                      glycan sequon, which generated a variant
                      completely resistant to plasma neutralization.
                      Computational modeling predicts that the deletion
                      and insertion in loops N3 and N5 prevent binding
                      of neutralizing antibodies. The recent emergence
                      in the United Kingdom and South Africa of natural
                      variants with similar changes suggests that
                      SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to escape an
                      effective immune response and that vaccines and
                      antibodies able to control emerging variants
                      should be developed.<br>

                            commercially available nickel foam. Paired

                            time-saving methods to synthesize active and
                            stable oxygen evolving catalysts is of great
                            significance to hydrogen production from
                            water electrolysis, which however remains a
                            grand challenge. Here we report a one-step
                            approach to grow highly porous S-doped Ni/Fe
                            (oxy)hydroxide catalysts on Ni foam in
                            several minutes under room temperature. This
                            ultrafast method effectively engineers the
                            surface of Ni foam into a rough S-doped
                            Ni/Fe (oxy)hydroxide layer, which has
                            multiple levels of porosity and good
                            hydrophilic features and exhibits
                            extraordinary oxygen evolution reaction
                            (OER) performance in both alkaline salty
                            water and seawater electrolytes.
                            Specifically, the S-doped Ni/Fe
                            (oxy)hydroxide catalyst requires low
                            overpotentials of 300 and 398 mV to deliver
                            current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm−2,
                            respectively, when directly used as an OER
                            catalyst in alkaline natural seawater
                            electrolyte. Using this OER catalyst
                            together with an efficient hydrogen
                            evolution reaction catalyst, we have
                            achieved the commercially demanded current
                            densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm−2 at low
                            voltages of 1.837 and 1.951 V, respectively,
                            for overall alkaline seawater electrolysis
                            at room temperature with very good
                            durability. This work affords a
                            cost-efficient surface engineering method to
                            steer commercial Ni foam into robust OER
                            catalysts for seawater electrolysis, which
                            has important implications for both the
                            hydrogen economy and environmental
                            remediation.</font></font></font><b><font

                      </font><font color="#000000">Have you ever
                        wondered what happened to the 56 men who signed
                        the Declaration of Independence?<br>
                        Five signers were captured by the British as
                        traitors, and tortured before they died. Twelve
                        had their homes ransacked and burned. Two lost
                        their sons in the revolutionary army, another
                        had two sons captured. Nine of the 56 fought and
                        died from wounds or hardships of the
                        revolutionary war.<br>
                        They signed and they pledged their lives, their
                        fortunes, and their sacred honor.<br>
                        What kind of men were they? Twenty-four were
                        lawyers and jurists. Eleven were merchants, nine
                        were farmers and large plantation owners, men of
                        means, well educated. But they signed the
                        Declaration of Independence knowing full well
                        that the penalty would be death if they were
                        captured.<br>
                        Carter Braxton of Virginia, a wealthy planter
                        and trader, saw his ships swept from the seas by
                        the British Navy. He sold his home and
                        properties to pay his debts, and died in rags.<br>
                        Thomas McKeam was so hounded by the British that
                        he was forced to move his family almost
                        constantly. He served in the Congress without
                        pay, and his family was kept in hiding. His
                        possessions were taken from him, and poverty was
                        his reward.<br>
                        Vandals or soldiers or both, looted the
                        properties of Ellery, Clymer, Hall, Walton,
                        Gwinnett, Heyward, Ruttledge, and Middleton.<br>
                        At the battle of Yorktown, Thomas Nelson Jr.,
                        noted that the British General Cornwallis had
                        taken over the Nelson home for his headquarters.
                        The owner quietly urged General George
                        Washington to open fire. The home was destroyed,
                        and Nelson died bankrupt.<br>
                        Francis Lewis had his home and properties
                        destroyed. The enemy jailed his wife, and she
                        died within a few months.<br>
                        John Hart was driven from his wife’s bedside as
                        she was dying. Their 13 children fled for their
                        lives. His fields and his gristmill were laid to
                        waste. For more than a year he lived in forests
                        and caves, returning home to find his wife dead
                        and his children vanished. A few weeks later he
                        died from exhaustion and a broken heart. Norris
                        and Livingston suffered similar fates.<br>
                        Such were the stories and sacrifices of the
                        American Revolution. These were not wild eyed,
                        rabble-rousing ruffians. They were soft-spoken
                        men of means and education. They had security,
                        but they valued liberty more. Standing tall,
                        straight, and unwavering, they pledged: “For the
                        support of this declaration, with firm reliance
                        on the protection of the divine providence, we
                        mutually pledge to each other, our lives, our
                        fortunes, and our sacred honor.”<br>

              since they source their results from other search engines,

                is a solid Google Translate alternative that seems to
                give great results. Like Google Translate, DeepL allows

                pro version is unlimited). The user interface is good

              We’ll examine the best private search engines for 2020,
              how to keep your data safe when searching, and also some
              search engines to avoid.<br>
              <br>
              Search engines may help you find what you’re looking for,
              but it often comes at a price: your privacy.<br>
              <br>
              Most of the big search engines today are essentially data
              collection tools for advertising companies. Collecting
              your private data helps these companies to make money with
              targeted ads, which is a booming industry. Unless you are
              using a private search engine, your data is ending up in
              the hands of third parties and you are the product.<br>

                    Examination of Some Facts Related to Mass
                    Vaccination<br>
                  </b>The case of Israel, leading the world by far in
                  the mass vaccination contest, doesn’t leave much
                  maneuvering room for skeptics. Since Israel launched
                  its vast vaccination campaign in December, it has been
                  witnessing an exponential rise in COVID-19 cases and
                  deaths. By now, the British Mutant has become Israel’s
                  dominant COVID strain. Israel’s health system is on
                  the brink of collapse.<br>
                  In my article Guinea Pigs United I pointed out that
                  the rise in cases and deaths correlates with the
                  distribution of vaccines. In Israel, the Orthodox
                  Jewish communities that were vaccinated en masse saw
                  COVID cases rise 16-fold, while Israeli Arabs who at
                  large refrained from vaccination saw numbers of COVID
                  cases dropping sharply.<br>
                  But Israel is not alone. Some other states have
                  followed a similar path and their situation is
                  becoming as catastrophic as the crisis we witness in
                  the Jewish State...<br>

                    Analysis Proves That SARS-CoV-2 Is Laboratory
                    Derived<br>
                  </b>"...“The starting probability for origin of
                  SARS-CoV-2 was set with the zoonotic or natural
                  hypothesis at 98.8% likelihood with the laboratory
                  origin hypothesis set at 1.2%. ” However, through a
                  comprehensive and detailed Bayesian analysis of 26
                  publicly released evidence (including “furin cleavage
                  site “, etc.), the conclusion is that the probability
                  of the SARS-CoV-2 originating in the laboratory is as
                  high as 99.8%, i.e. “beyond a reasonable doubt that
                  SARS-CoV-2<br>
                  is not a natural zoonosis but instead is laboratory
                  derived”...."<br>

                  <b> </b><br>
                  <b> </b>Scientists have reported finding some success
                  in using low intensity, focused ultrasound to
                  'jumpstart' parts of the brains of people in coma-like
                  conditions, reawakening certain functions in patients
                  who had previously been in a "minimally conscious
                  state" (MCS).<br>
                  <br>
                  The method uses ultrasound stimulation to excite the
                  neurons in the thalamus, a processing hub for the
                  whole brain, and a region that's known to be weaker
                  after a coma. Two 10-minute treatment sessions were
                  given to three MCS patients, with a week between each
                  session....<br>
