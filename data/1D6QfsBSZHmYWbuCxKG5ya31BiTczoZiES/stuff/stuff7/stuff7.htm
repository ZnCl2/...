            From the Air </b><br>
        </big><br>
        <i>Ben Franklin invented it 223 years ago. Now we’re finding
          overlooked possibilities in the electrostatic motor.</i><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>By C. P. GILMORE / PS Executive Editor and WILLIAM j.
        HAWKINS / PS Electronics Editor.</b><br>
      <br>
      Would you believe an electric motor made almost entirely of
      plastic? That can run on power transmitted through open air? And
      sneak free electricity right out of the earth’s electrical field?<br>
      <br>
      At the University of West Virginia we saw a laboratory full of
      such exotic devices spinning, humming, and buzzing away like a
      swarm of bees. They are electrostatic motors, run by charges
      similar to those that make your hair stand on end when you comb it
      on a cold winter’s day.<br>
      <br>
      Today, we use electromagnetic motors almost exclusively. But
      electrostatics have a lot of overlooked advantages. They’re far
      lighter per horsepower than electromagnetics, can run at extremely
      high speeds, and are incredibly simple and foolproof in
      construction.<br>
      <br>
      “And, in principle,” maintains Dr. Oleg Jefimenko, “they can do
      any- thing electromagnetic motors can do, and some things they can
      do better.”<br>
      <br>
      Jewel-like plastic motors. Jefimenko puts on an impressive
      demonstration. He showed us motors that run on the voltage
      developed when you hold them in your hands and scuff across a
      carpet, and other heavier, more powerful ones that could do real
      work. Up on the roof of the University’s physics building in a
      blowing snowstorm, he connected an electrostatic motor to a
      specially designed earth-field antenna. It twirled merrily from
      electric power drawn out of thin air.<br>
      <br>
      These remarkable machines are almost unknown today. Yet the
      world’s first electric motor was an electrostatic. It was invented
      in 1748 by Benjamin Franklin.<br>
      <br>
      Franklin’s motor took advantage of the fact that like charges
      repel, unlike ones attract. He rigged a wagonwheel-size,
      horizontally mounted device with 30 glass spokes. On the end of
      each spoke was a brass thimble. Two oppositely charged Leyden
      jars—high-voltage capacitors —were so placed that the thimbles on
      the rotating spokes barely missed the knobs on the jars (see
      photo).<br>
      <br>
      As a thimble passed close to a jar, a spark leaped from knob to
      thimble. That deposited a like charge on the thimble, so they
      repelled each other. Then, as the thimble approached the
      oppositely charged jar, it was attracted. As it passed this second
      jar, a spark jumped again, depositing a new charge, and the whole
      repulsion-attraction cycle began again.<br>
      <br>
      In 1870, the German physicist J. C. Poggendorff built a motor so
      simple it’s hard to see what makes it work. The entire motor, as
      pictured here, is a plastic disk (Poggendorff used glass) and two
      electrodes. The elec- trodes set up what physicists call a corona
      discharge; their sharp edges ionize air molecules that come in
      contact with them. These charged particles floating through the
      air charge the surface of the plastic disk nearby. Then the
      attraction-repulsion routine that Franklin used takes place.<br>
      <br>
      A few papers on electrostatic motors have trickled out of the
      laboratories in recent years. But nobody really showed much
      interest until Dr. Jefimenko came on the scene.<br>
      <br>
      The Russian-born physicist was attending a class at the University
      of Gottingen one day shortly after World War II when the lecturer,
      a Prof. R. W. Pohl, displayed two yard-square metal plates mounted
      on the end of a pole. He stuck the device outside and flipped it
      180 degrees. A galvanometer hooked to the plates jumped sharply.<br>
      <br>
      “I could never forget that demonstration,” said Jefimenko. “And I
      wondered why, if there is electricity in the air, you couldn’t use
      it to light a bulb or something.”<br>
      <br>
      Electricity everywhere. The earth’s electrical field has been
      known for centuries. Lightning and St. Elmo’s fire are the most
      dramatic manifestations of atmospheric electricity. But the field
      doesn’t exist just in the vicinity of these events; it’s
      everywhere.<br>
      <br>
      The earth is an electrical conductor. So is the ionosphere, the
      layer of ionized gas about 70 kilometers over our heads. The air
      between is a rather poor insulator. Some mechanism not yet
      explained constantly pumps large quantities of charged particles
      into the air. The charged particles cause the electrical field
      that Jefimenko saw demonstrated. Although it varies widely,
      strength of the field averages 120v per meter.<br>
      <br>
      You can measure this voltage with an earth-field antenna—a wire
      with a sharp point at the top to start a corona, or with a bit of
      radioactive material that ionizes the air in its immediate
      vicinity. Near the earth, voltage is proportional to altitude; on
      an average day you might measure 1,200 volts with a 10-meter
      antenna.<br>
      <br>
      Over the past few years, aided by graduate-student Henry
      Fischbach-Nazario, Jefimenko designed advanced corona motors. With
      David K. Walker, he experimented with electret motors. An electret
      is an insulator with a permanent electrostatic charge. It produces
      a permanent electric field in the surrounding space, just as a
      magnet produces a permanent magnetic field. And like a magnet, it
      can be used to build a motor.<br>
      <br>
      Jefimenko chose the electrostatic motor for his project because
      the earth-field antennas develop extremely high-voltage
      low-current power; and—unlike the electromagnetic motor—that’s
      exactly what it needs.<br>
      <br>
      The climactic experiment. On the night of Sept. 29, 1970,
      Jefimenko and Walker strolled into an empty parking lot, and hiked
      a 24-foot pole painted day-glow orange into the sky. On the pole’s
      end was a bit of radioactive material in a capsule connected to a
      wire. The experimenters hooked an electret motor to the antenna,
      and, as Jefimenko describes it, “the energy of the earth’s
      electrical field was converted into continuous mechanical motion.”<br>
      <br>
      Two months later, they successfully operated a corona motor from
      electricity in the air.<br>
      <br>
      Any future in it? Whether the earth’s electrical field will ever
      be an important source of power is open to question. There are
      millions—perhaps billions—of kilowatts of electrical energy
      flowing into the earth constantly. Jefimenko thinks that
      earth-field antennas could be built to extract viable amounts of
      it.<br>
      <br>
      But whether or not we tap this energy source, the electrostatic
      motor could become important on its own.<br>
      <br>
      In space or aviation, its extreme light weight could be crucial.
      Jefimenko estimates that corona motors could deliver one
      horsepower for each three pounds of weight.<br>
      <br>
      They’d be valuable in laboratories where even the weakest magnetic
      field could upset an experiment.<br>
      <br>
      Suspended on air bearings, they’d make good gyroscopes.<br>
      <br>
      In a particularly spectacular experiment, Jefimenko turned on a
      Van de Graaff generator—a device that creates a very-high-voltage
      field. About a yard away he placed a sharp-pointed corona antenna
      and connected it to an electrostatic motor. The rotor began to
      spin. The current was flowing from the generator through the air
      to where it was being picked up by the antenna.<br>
      <br>
      The stunt had a serious purpose: The earth’s field is greatest on
      mountaintops. Jefimenko would like to set up a large antenna in
      such a spot, then aim an ultraviolet laser beam at a receiving
      site miles away at ground level. The laser beam would ionize the
      air, creating an invisible conductor through apparently empty
      space.<br>
      <br>
      To be sure, many difficulties exist; and no one knows for sure
      whether we’ll ever get useful amounts of power out of the air. But
      with thinking like that, Jefimenko’s a hard man to ignore.<br>

      In 1971, William Doyle Sr., Project Financier, asked Ieuan Thomas
      to hand write an explanation of his Fuelless Self-Powering
      Negative Electricity Generator Systems for the new Canadian Chief
      of Defense Staff in Ottawa, and to also write a “self-analysis”
      explaining Ieuan's commercial motivations and ambitions for the
      technology.<br>
      <br>
      This data DVD contains this commentary, which has never before
      been seen by the public, together with Thomas' sketches of the
      technical principles and geometry of the machine. These “hand
      notes” were drawn by Ieuan Thomas at the Lord Elgin Hotel in
      Ottawa at a meeting with William Doyle Sr.&nbsp; Present were his
      friend Don Forseyth&nbsp; who was a highly decorated WWII Canadian
      Air Force war hero and the newly appointed first Chief of the
      Canadian Air Force “Air Material Command” in Ottawa, Arthur (Art)
      Ball, Commander Canadian Navy, and later First Canadian High
      Commissioner to Australia, and Lsyle Kohler who was a former
      Canadian Army Serviceman in (WWII) and life long Senior Canadian
      Government Official in Ottawa.<br>
      <br>
      Also enclosed is extensive correspondence since 2005 tracking the
      offering of this technology to the United States through various
      high ranking political figures, including the late U.S. Senator
      Ted Stevens of Alaska, who was most interested (see below).&nbsp;
      Stevens was one of the most powerful Congressmen of his
      generation, and William Doyle Jr. had a secure back channel
      connection with him.<br>
      <br>
      Correspondence to ex-President Clinton, Hillary Clinton, President
      G.W. Bush, President Obama, Al Gore, then California Governor
      Schwarzenegger, and many other high ranking political, business,
      media and Government figures is also included, together with
      overtures to Virgin owner Sir Richard Branson through his London
      Radio office.<br>
      <br>
      The extensive correspondence (some private) from William Doyle Jr.
      reveals many additional details of the whole cold energy process.<br>
      <br>
      According to Willian Doyle Jr., this final design of the Zero Fuel
      Engine System was basically an upgraded design modification and
      adaptation of Vicktor Schaubergers' Repulsine Vacuum Motor which
      had been brought to Toronto by Vicktor Schauberger, under
      Operation Paperclip Project Silverbug.&nbsp; This project was
      ongoing by Order of two U.S. Presidents (both Truman and
      Eisenhower) circa 1944-1961 in both the U.S. at Wright Patterson
      AFB in Ohio, in Texas, and in Canada at AVRO aka the A. V. Roe
      Aircraft Company, where the Lancaster Bombers were built during
      WWII. <br>
      <br>
      AVRO's design arm, Designex Ltd., was headed by the nominal
      figurehead, the late Englishman John Frost. The top Nazi
      'Paperclip' scientists were also in residence at AVRO, including
      General Hans Kammler, Dr. Richard Miethe, the Horten brothers and
      Viktor Schauberger, with their original documentation on flying
      discs from wartime Nazi Germany. However these early discs were
      powered by a chemical process. The American scientist T. Townsend
      Brown was the de facto Black Projects Director.<br>
      <br>
      In 1958 A.V. Roe Canada was ranked as the third largest
      corporation in Canada by capitalization, and Designex was then
      Canada's original high-tech engineering think tank and specialty
      engineer leasing services group.<br>
      <br>
      A cohort of fifty specialist engineers of the Designex team, under
      the leadership of Ieuan Thomas and Dr. 'Bert' England, utilizing
      their knowledge and some modified materiel acquired on the
      Canadian anti-gravity (gravitics) disc program (Project Silverbug
      606A), developed this Fuelless Self-Powering Negative Electricity
      Generator System.&nbsp; From 1961 through 1970, the Designex
      Private Venture Group, in various incarnations, demonstrated these
      Cold Heat Engine Systems to the Engineering and Energy community
      in Toronto.<br>
      <br>
      The leading scientists in New Engine Design had originally
      stumbled upon a band of 'Low Frequency Induction Effect' at Lucas
      &amp; Arthur Meat Packers, while working on 'electro-vacuum and
      brine induction chambers' for curing hams (see the DVD).<br>
      <br>
      This led them on their search for an Energy Regain System and
      finally the Holy Grail of Science, Cold Heat Engine Systems-Zero
      Fuel Electric Generators were perfected.<br>
      <br>
      The startling final series of discoveries were made in the private
      Aero Engine Design Systems Laboratory of Designex Ltd. in Toronto,
      which was independently researching a Zero Fuel Engine System for
      the Project Y and Y2 AVRO VZ-9A Air Car aka Project SilverBug 606A
      in the U.S (in America this project was designated WS AV 7055
      according to Doyle's sources). <br>
      <br>
      Note: none of these models should be confused with the Avrocar, an
      unstable fan powered saucer that is the staple of many
      documentaries and much publicity and which could barely lift off
      the ground.<br>
      <br>
      A demonstration model of the power generator that was developed
      produced at least 150,000 BTU output for every 10,000 BTU input,
      and ran cold (see the video.)&nbsp; Later models generated massive
      ongoing electrical output without drawing any outside power of any
      type other than from the ambient vacuum.<br>
      <br>
      The process was termed a “modification to conventional system of
      expanding a refrigeration cycle,” and utilized carbon dioxide (as
      opposed to steam). Each cold heat engine system was activated with
      outside electric power and refrigeration gas pressure in the
      manufacturing process, and once the gas achieved 'the state of
      equilibrium of gas' each system was sealed for its working
      lifetime. The life of the permanent magnets involved was estimated
      to be 300 to 400 years.<br>
      <br>
      These final systems bear a striking resemblance to modern
      closed-system pressurized refrigeration systems. In essence the
      inventor team adapted the reversible cycle of Sadi Carnot and
      Tesla's Fuelless Electricity Generator ideas with internal Coanda
      vortex gas management systems to drive their magnetic turbine
      secured by magnetic bearings in cold conditions while generating
      electricity of infinite cycles.&nbsp; The engineering and design
      team had perfected this application of magnetic structures in
      pressurized non-magnetic ceramic containment cooling chambers,
      where the electricity was generated.<br>
      <br>
      Detractors derided this cold power as “Supernatural Electricity”
      aka “Satan's Energy.”<br>
      <br>
      This all began in 1955, just before the death of Albert Einstein,
      and is still kept secret from the American public.<br>
      <br>
      At that time, manned aircraft were being replaced by missiles over
      the North Pole, and Silverbug, with an endless power source, could
      have been the solution to eliminate downrange in-air refueling and
      assure that man was kept in the cockpit rather than on the
      ground.&nbsp; Originally this invention was to be the Zero Fuel
      Engine for an upgraded VZ-9A Prototype which was never built
      because Project Y leader John Frost was unable to persuade
      Lockheed to make an offer to Designex Ltd. for this discovery.<br>
      <br>
      In any event the Ieuan Thomas 'Engine System' evolved again over
      time and became a stand alone Zero-Fuel Electric Generator.<br>
      <br>
      Big Oil, (Imperial Oil aka Exxon, and Consumers Gas) refused to
      make any cash offers after six years of testing, and the
      scientists refused to just give it away. In parallel, a back
      channel contact with U.S. President Reagan relayed to William
      Doyle Sr. that Big Oil was to remain firmly in place and
      unchallenged by alternate power sources till the oil ran
      out.&nbsp; Indeed it was U.S. President Eisenhower under Big Oil
      pressure who had strong-armed Canadian Premier Diefenbaker into
      canceling the project, with promises of Canada becoming the next
      Saudi Arabia by virtue of the Athabasca Oil Sands, the largest
      known reservoir of crude bitumen in the world.<br>
      <br>
      In May 1963 Project Director Ieuan Thomas’ emissary Terry Maloney
      P. Eng. from Designex Ltd. of Toronto met with JFK and they
      discussed everything going on at the Laboratory on Richmond Street
      West in Toronto and it was agreed that President Kennedy would
      visit the Designex Laboratory in Toronto in December 1963 or an
      alternate date later in January 1964 to accommodate any emergency
      changes to the President Kennedys’ busy schedule.&nbsp; The rest
      is history.<br>
      <br>
      In 1969, Lockheed took the Avro Air Car 'Project Y and Y2' (USA
      Project Silverbug) away to the United States after spending
      approximately $5 million dollars and securing many great ideas
      like Jump-Jet Technology, and Atmospheric Collapsing Technologies
      and Fan-Jet Down Thrusting technologies found on later jets like
      the Harrier Series and on up to the latest JFX. The Bomarc
      Missile, the Velvet Glove Missile and the solid fuels for the
      Polaris Missile all had their genesis with these expatriate
      British scientists in Toronto.&nbsp; All traces of the Avro Black
      Projects programs were eliminated after the migration of the
      projects to the U.S.<br>
      <br>
      The Thomas group planned to commercially develop and produce these
      Fuelless Self-Powering Negative Electricity Generator Systems,
      with William Doyle Sr. in charge of arranging outside
      financing.&nbsp; However, the financing never materialized, and in
      1972 after Doyle's Cadillac exploded into flames, almost killing
      his wife, the project was mothballed, and in 1973 the historical
      film was made very quietly for the future. The film was released
      publicly for the first time in 2010 by Energetic Productions Inc.,
      producers of the “Energy from the VacuumTM” Science Series of
      documentary films.<br>
      <br>
      In March 2005, with oil at $50 a barrel, the pre-arranged trigger
      point was reached to re-stimulate U.S. interest in the technology,
      so William Doyle Jr., son of the original financier William Doyle
      Sr, who died in 1981, broke silence, and contacted a number of
      public figures including U.S. Senator Ted Stevens.<br>
      <br>
      Senator Stevens, incidentally, was later convicted eight days
      before his re-election&nbsp; on seven trumped up felony charges
      (charges later dismissed in 2009), and lost his Senate seat in
      2008.&nbsp; He died in a 2010 Alaskan floatplane mishap for which
      the NTSB could find “no definitive cause.”<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Republican Congressman Curt Weldon's career also suffered
      terminal collateral damage from fallout from Project Silverbug,
      whose technological secrets, including the Designex invented
      liquefied precursor atmospheric collapsing propulsion process, had
      been purposely leaked to the Russians (see Mitrokhin Archives).<br>
      <br>
      William Doyle Jr., son of the original Designex financier, was
      also enmeshed in some spurious legal issues for a while.<br>
      <br>
      In the documents and drawings on this DVD, Ieuan Thomas reaches
      out from the grave to share his vision of the world that is as
      possible today as it was decades ago when he wrote down these
      technical observations and notes.<br>
      <br>
      It is even possible that there may be enough information amongst
      these papers, the correspondence, and in the Iuean Thomas
      interview, for those 'skilled in the art' and adequately financed
      to replicate the cold energy process.<br>
      <br>
      Disclaimer: the exact architecture of the foregoing narrative
      rests primarily on the recollections of William Doyle Jr., who
      makes the following observations:<br>
      <br>
      “Some wealthy family that already reads your publications should
      buy-up what we have in Cold Storage up here, from the
      Designex-AVRO Collaboration that carried on into the Energetics
      Limited and Entrain Systems Limited years.”<br>
      <br>
      “As I have explained before, there is a small community of
      sentinel safe-keepers, my task is to establish a consensus and
      keep everybody sweet during the physical transfer of everything in
      storage, and afterward too. With money almost free today, it's the
      lowest price Transformational Electricity Generator we know of
      that is still out of captivity at this writing (2012).” <br>
      <br>
      “The whole Suite of Technologies including Two (2) different
      Working Engines, Component Parts and Experiment Records are still
      For Sale.”<br>
      <br>
      “No photograph was ever taken in the Cold Storage Location. Given
      who Ieuan Thomas was, and his knowledge of Surveillance
      Satellites, which were being launched almost every month for
      years, and Ieuan's primary need for secrecy, it must be apparent
      by now considerable thought and preparation went into this Cold
      Storage Site location and Facility.”<br>
      <br>
      Note: the existence of this hardware has not been independently
      verified<br>
      <br>
      In this wide-ranging 1973 interview with the late Chief Engineer
      Ieuan Thomas filmed by award winning filmmaker Daniel Izzard, he
      tells the story of the development of the Zero-Fuel Engine System
      and the Cold Heat Engine. Designex Inc. were a leading aerospace
      design firm in Toronto at the time, and it was they that developed
      this Zero-Fuel Engine System for the 12-Ton Silverbug anti-gravity
      craft being built at AVRO Canada in Toronto under the supervision
      of the American T. Townsend Brown and with the assistance of some
      of the Project Paperclip Nazi scientists.<br>

      William Doyle Jr. writes about the Film: New Prospects for
      Survival (aka Cold Heat from Canada)<br>
      <br>
      This writer is a Canadian national [DOB 18/03/42 ] who was first
      introduced to this Subject in September 1957 at fifteen years of
      age.<br>
      <br>
      In the summer of 1960 (when I was 18) and again in the summer of
      1961, (just after AVRO officially shut down) I worked a summer job
      at Designex as the “office boy” at a time when Designex Limited
      was the exclusive Design Engineering Services and Contract
      Personnel Provider to the A. V. Roe Aircraft Manufacturing Company
      aka AVRO Canada, under an arrangement between Designex owner and
      president Ieuan Thomas and my late father, who in 1959 became the
      “exclusive outside financing provider” to Designex Ltd., where he
      provided the services of a “Factor.”<br>
      <br>
      Ieuan Thomas came from a village in Wales, and he was a “Hero” of
      WWII among RAF and Allied Air Crews. He earned his Engineering
      degree through an “apprenticeship program” rather than attending a
      University, and during WWII he played a significant role on
      British Air Fields in “crash rescue” and “rapid repair” of both
      “bombers” and “fighters”. (Everyone at Designex was a WWII War
      Veteran.)<br>

      <br>
      After the War he learned the Engineering Business, and he could
      estimate work-jobs, cost them out and bring combinations of
      specialists together to get things done quickly during
      emergencies. By 1950 he was one of the best known “go getters” in
      the U.K. Commercial Engineering and Aero Engineering Field and he
      was superbly connected at Whitehall (a road where most of the UK
      Central Government is located) and with MI5 and MI6. <br>
      <br>
      This all came together when he was selected to head-up Designex
      Limited and emigrate to Canada with his wife and children, and
      provide Contract Design Engineering Services and Research work
      with the Owners of the A. V. Roe Aircraft Company to “Operation
      Paperclip Project Silverbug”..<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center">Ieuan was “briefed in” on “Operation
        Paperclip-Project Silverbug” in England, and his duties and
        responsibilities were explained as only the British can lay out
        plans to the smallest details. Mr. Thomas was a “Compliance
        Officer” for MI6 and he took the Oath and “Signed” the “Official
        Secrets Act” in both the U.K. and Canada.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Due to the fact that it was decided to keep all the “Deep Black
      Research” “available to be re-exported back to the UK ” he was
      made the Private Owner of any and all new Technologies and Patents
      which the Designex Private Venture Group came up with.<br>
      <br>
      From 1953 through to 1961 when all the Black Projects at AVRO were
      terminated Designex was involved in two major “Private Venture
      Projects” which were financed by Designex and belonged to
      Designex.<br>
      <br>
      The first project was the Designex “Solid Fuels Project” and&nbsp;
      in 1958 or 1959 this “Solid Fuels Project” was so successful that
      the U.S. Government and the U.S. Navy bought it and these new
      “Solid Fuels” became the “Solid Propulsive Fuels” used in the
      Polaris Missile Systems which revolutionized Submarine Warfare and
      Provided America with its’ first Stealth Technologies because with
      these new “Solid Fuels” Missiles could be fired “without liquid
      oxygen” while submerged and making way, rather than surfacing to
      fire, which was the first application of “Stealth Technologies”.<br>
      <br>
      The second “Private Venture Project” was originally named “Zero
      Fuels Engine Project” and after 1961 when all the Projects were
      “Terminated” that name was changed to “Cold Heat Engine Systems”
      because it was thought, at that time, that this name was less
      threatening to the Texas based Petrochemical Fossil Fuels &amp;
      Nuclear Electricity Cabal.<br>
      <br>
      The Cold Heat Engine Apparatus to which Ralph Long (See: Film on
      DVD ) refers was a “Proof Of Principle” model. (See Photograph.)<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      “I am very happy to have the secrecy over. The cold heat engine
      invention took a heavy toll on my family—financially and
      personally. So, I am glad to have it out in the open at
      last....One of the large oil companies also threatened my family,
      but my father would not put a name to which one it was—although he
      knew
      absolutely.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      —Judith Thomas (daughter of the inventor)<br>
      August 1968<br>
      <br>
      Designex Inc. Chief Engineer Ieuan Thomas inspects their Fuelless
      Self-PoweringNegative Electricity Generator System installed in
      the basement of their offices at 49 Merton Street, Toronto, Canada<br>
      <br>
      There were Two ( 2 ) Engine Systems Built for Security Reasons:<br>
      <br>
      The first “Zero Fuel Engine System” was the “Operative” one I have
      described elsewhere which employed an aircraft axial compressor,
      CO2 Gas and pulsed Low Frequency Induction to cause CO2 Gas to
      “explode-without-combustion” and “force-vector rotate and counter
      rotate” a specially conditioned set of permanent magnets, creating
      rotating electromagnetic fields which are themselves subjected to
      third vector “electromagnetic fields” pulsed from a third powerful
      electromagnet built into the floor-plate of the turbine cylinder
      housing inside a machine system I have described above.<br>
      <br>
      The original ‘Self-Powering Electricity Generator System’ ran on
      Negative Energy: “Ran Cold” and drew-in its’ excess energy from
      the available ambient by “Uncurling and&nbsp; Magnetic Gating Sub
      Space Electricity into the Systems Circuits to power its load, and
      the loads of Accommodating Systems with “Over Unity Electricity”
      always available from the active ether (Broken Symmetry 1957).<br>
      <br>
      Then there was the “Second Engine System” which was built as their
      “Proof of Principle” System for testing and Patent purposes.<br>
      <br>
      Outsiders, (perfect strangers with security clearances), would be
      sent or invited to Designex on Richmond St. West to “measure” this
      “machine,” so it was built with off-the-shelf commercially
      available components, and they employed a “piston type compressor”
      and R22 aka Dupont Freon Gas, and copper tubing and off the shelf
      cooling coils which attracted no unusual attention to the
      components of this “Bench Apparatus” because what this system was
      doing defied the First &amp; Second Laws of Thermodynamics, but
      without revealing any of their precious secrets and without any
      “Turbine Cylinder Housing” and without any “Specially Conditioned
      Permanent Magnets” being “Counter-Rotated” and so on as I have
      above described with precision.<br>
      <br>
      Ieuan Thomas called this procedure “redundancy in depth.” Pleas
      notice that in the Film on DVD Ieuan never once mentions AVRO, the
      A. V. Roe Aircraft Company or any person involved with those
      “Black Projects” and indeed the only technical name mentioned was
      Ralph Long who was a wonderful man and WWII Veteran who was never
      involved in any aspect of the Black Projects out at AVRO. (See:
      Historical Interview.)<br>
      <br>
      Ieuan lived and died with his sense of loyalty to “The Crown”
      intact, and never approached stepping “over the line.” He was not
      free to openly discuss his own proprietary technology and he did
      not. He and all the others were tormented by the knowledge that
      they had “Obsoleted” Fossil Fuels and Nuclear Electricity but they
      were honour bound not to speak by bonds far stronger than chains
      and an iron neck-collar.<br>
      <br>
      My father was highly connected in post-war Ottawa and many of my
      fathers’ friends who had returned to Ottawa after War Service in
      WWII (Europe) and who held High Government and Military Positions
      helped Ieuan Thomas over the years as a favor to my dad. It’s
      called the ‘Old Boy Network.’ But even the existence of these
      “machines” is still repressed at this very moment by the Texas Oil
      &amp; Nuclear Oligarchs and their Canadian Operatives in Politics
      and Business.<br>
      <br>
      So, when you don’t hear about a “Fuelless Self-Powering
      Electricity Generator” purposely designed and built to power all
      the “Unconventional Aircraft Under Development at AVRO” in those
      words, please know that those are the words Ieuan Thomas always
      used among his peers, but he was “sworn to secrecy” and he never
      told a soul who wasn’t security cleared, or a member of my
      father's inner circle who were Security Cleared.<br>
      <br>
      My father and I required “Zero Security Clearances” because we
      were both covered under the “Owners Agreement” that Ieuan Thomas
      and Designex Limited had with all the other Parties which included
      all the Security Agencies and Organizations..<br>
      <br>
      But if you listen carefully, and watch it two or three times and
      remember that this was filmed in 1973 you’ll see right through
      what’s not said by listening carefully to what is said.<br>
      <br>
      “Please allow me to share this rare Polaroid photo of the actual
      “Zero Fuel Engine System,” aka “Cold Heat Engine System,” taken by
      my father at the property at Merton Street in Toronto, Canada on
      the day of the “Merton Street Incident” writes William Doyle Jr.,
      whose father was the exclusive outside financier for Designex Inc.<br>
      <br>
      At some time in the future, when you have expressed an interest in
      this “Incident” I’ll share the blow-by-blow interplays that
      episode with you. This episode is a Movie in itself.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      I arrived there (at the Merton Street location ) at about 2 PM,
      and witnessed the Toronto Hydro Supervisor, red-faced and angry,
      sending for a huge flat-bed truck and a Work Crew, who arrived and
      confronted my father, Ieuan Thomas and Gordon Reilly and six other
      Designex Senior Scientists, before removing the Hydro Power Meter,
      Fuse Box and All Toronto Hydro Wiring into and out of that
      Building, in a futile attempt to shut-off all “electricity” and
      “Electricity Use Inside the Building,” which did not happen.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The lights, radio, refrigerator and other electric appliances kept
      right on working, and this enraged the Toronto Hydro Supervisor
      because Dr. “Bert” England and Ian Taws were making jokes about
      their inability to “Shut Off The Electricity” and told them all
      that this “Machine” was the equivalent of a small “Niagara Falls”
      Power Source.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It took several hours for the Toronto Hydro to Cut Down the new
      Concrete Hydro Utility Pole and remove all the wiring and Toronto
      Hydro Apparatus from that building, and it was getting dark as
      that Flat Bed Truck drove away with the Concrete Pole and
      everything else which had connected the Toronto Hydro Power Source
      to the Building on Merton Street. This was “Street Theatre” worthy
      of&nbsp; a Movie with Robert Redford, Meryl Streep, Tom Cruise and
      Clint Eastwood.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      At that time, Ontario Premier Bill Davis was the Premier Of
      Ontario, and Gordon Reilly’s younger brother was the Minister of
      Commerce in the Conservative Cabinet of Ontario Premier Bill
      Davis. It was quite a “Power Conflict.” Gordon Reilly was a
      Multi-Millionaire Real Estate Developer who was also a Member of
      the Granite Club.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The Toronto Hydro had responded to a complaint from the National
      Cash Register Corporation which was located several long blocks
      east of the “Subject Building” which was located on the South side
      of Merton Street while the National Cash Register Offices were on
      the North Side of Merton Street.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The complaints were based on “static electricity shocks” received
      by several of the women students who were attending Classes on how
      to “Operate Cash Registers.”<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      We all felt very sympathetic. Even Dr. “Bert” England had no idea
      about how to control these unexpected consequences, or even be
      sure that these electric phenomena were connected to his conjuring
      up “Negative Radiant Energy” via this Machine Apparatus you see
      here in this photo.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      They (the men from Designex) had removed the Furnace (it was
      August) and installed the machine where the furnace had been,
      under the chimney.”<br>

      <b> </b><br>
      Most of the time we ignore simple solutions dismissing them as too
      simplistic. But often we can achieve immeasurable amount of
      success with simple and practical solutions. We might think about
      the shape of wings and speed of airplanes but we don’t give much
      thought to an airplane’s wings in terms of reducing fuel and
      carbon emissions by making changes to those wings. But someone was
      looking at airplane’s wings and thinking of clean and green
      energy. If we make tiny holes in plane’s wing they can reduce
      airline fuel intake by up to 40 per cent. A team of British
      scientists are relying upon the same principle that applies when
      you blow across the top of a bottle to make a sound.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Duncan Lockerby who is associated with the University of
      Warwick and also the project leader, explained that placing tens
      or even hundreds of thousands of tiny holes on the surface of a
      plane’s wing should considerably diminish mid-flight haul. This
      will lead towards the reduction of fuel bills and carbon emissions
      by up to 20 per cent. It seemed that the team had accidentally
      chanced upon this experiment. According to Dr Duncan Lockerby,
      “This has come as a bit of a surprise to all of us in the
      aerodynamics community. It was discovered, essentially, by
      waggling a piece of wing from side to side in a wind tunnel.”
      Others are in agreement with what British scientists are
      implementing in their project. Simon Crook, who is a senior
      manager for aerospace and defense at the Engineering and Physical
      Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), agreed that the breakthrough
      could be instrumental in drastically reducing the environmental
      cost of flying.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Duncan Lockerby elaborates how this is possible. He says,
      “Around half the drag a plane experiences is the result of skin
      friction, so anything that reduces that will deliver big savings
      in fuel use.” He also admitted that the research team was still
      grappling with the exact phenomenon that how it happens but that
      early test results from wind tunnels have been encouraging. The
      team is also preparing prototypes. These prototypes will help the
      team to have a better understanding of the process. They are
      making it certain with the help of prototypes that no major
      structural changes will be required in the aircraft with
      perforated wings.<br>
      <br>
      Lockerby clarifies that the innovation is based on the Helmholtz
      resonance principle. According to the Helmholtz resonance
      principle when air is forced into a cavity, the pressure inside
      increases. Once the external force that forces the air into the
      cavity disappears, the higher-pressure air inside will flow out.
      However, this surge of air flowing out will tend to
      over-compensate, due to the inertia of the air in the neck, and
      the cavity will be left at a pressure slightly lower than the
      outside, causing air to be drawn back in. This process repeats
      with the magnitude of the pressure changes decreasing each time
      (Wikipedia) . When we blow over a bottletop the air is forced into
      a cavity it increases the pressure and force the air out of the
      space. This whole exercise produces an oscillation. The research
      team is expecting the same result by piercing the plane’s wings
      with numerous holes with chambers underneath. They think that an
      additional layer of air can be created around the wings that limit
      drag.<br>
      <br>
      Airbus is taking keen interest in the project and expect that the
      new perforated wings could be ready for trials by 2012. EPSRC is
      quite hopeful that this technology will not be useful for
      aircrafts only but it could be successfully applied to reduce the
      fuels of cars, boats and trains too.<br>

      <br>
      An alembic is a distilling device that is used by alchemists to
      purify, separate and transform the elements. The P.E.A.K. Alembic
      ™ is a phase modulated, quadrature transform device that differs
      from a distiller in the following manner:<br>
      <br>
      1. A distiller uses an electrical circuit to heat water. The
      Alembic utilizes a proprietary Algorithm of Transformation™ and a
      perfected sound (Great Diesis Wave™) to cavitate water. In a
      distiller the water expands and boils. In the alembic it implodes.<br>
      <br>
      2. In the distiller, a positive and negative are shorted on a
      metal plate that heats up and boils the water. In the Alembic, two
      24K gold waveguides are separated by the water, which must become
      the conduit of its own transformation by choosing to resolve the
      differential between the real and imaginary phases of the
      perfected universal white sound. A distiller operates with a
      positive and negative circuit. The Alembic utilizes two positives.<br>
      <br>
      3. In a distiller, the water molecules go over together as steam.
      In the Alembic, the molecules are disassembled, rearranged and
      reassembled into vapourized molecular bonds that hold the memory
      of the experience of transformation.<br>
      <br>
      4. Water from a distiller is dead water. Water from the Alembic is
      not only alive, but indeed ressurected with the resources required
      for transformation...acknowledging the need for change - active
      pursuit - releasing resistance - removing unwholesomeness -
      gathering dedicated support and taking the step to the next
      highest level.<br>
      <br>
      5. Distilled water is not totally pure. Water from the Alembic
      exceeds the capability of any known test to find impurities.
      Purity is the essence of holiness and, as such, the resultant
      distillate stands as a standard of reference for perfection,
      perserverance, faith, and growth...moving to the next highest
      level of order.<b><br>

      </i><br>
      Automatous structures are either existing and newly generated.
      When configuring a "new automata", it's necessary to provide it
      with an initial environment - akin to an "incubator" - within
      which to gain presence through recursive iteration. Once the
      automata becomes stable and reasonably self-sufficient, a portion
      of the vector flow is tapped and infused into some external
      implement which acts as a "host" or "carrier". The portion of
      automata "remaining behind" in its initial generative environment
      acts as a temporal reference for the "deployed" portion, thus
      serving in a very basic, quantum role while the exogenous sample
      starts to become both interactive and adaptive.<br>
      <br>
      Another good term for this "automatous incubator" would be a
      "clocking mechanism", as it serves as the synchronising reference
      for the external manifestations of the automata it embodies. This
      is a critical function during the formative phases of generated
      automata, and calculated manipulation of the clock can be used to
      foster the progressive independence of the outward population
      ("population" in a microcosmic sense here, referring to each
      constituent element of the automata, where the macrocosmic
      manifestation would be that of a singular, collective automatous
      "organism"). Ultimately, there comes the crucial point when the
      synchronous "bonds" are released, and the applied automata
      existing "out here" is set entirely free to grow, adapt and
      propagate on its own as a "free agent".<br>
      <br>
      Until recently, the best technological example of an automatous
      "incubator" was a sapphire spindle. It is a small-but-heavy
      device, configured as a 3-port sapphire-loaded cavity resonator.
      Port 1 is used for the infusion of a time standard, port 2 serves
      as the clock output and port 3 is used for manipulation of the
      environment. Referred to as the "shoebox" because of its
      resemblance to the same (though substantially heavier!), it is
      essentially a "whispering gallery" of total internal reflection.
      Originally, these were developed for gravity wave research, but
      can also represent optimal automatous clocks because of their
      non-linearity and almost-momentary time-base. Until recently, the
      whispering gallery mode of the sapphire spindle provided the most
      accurate emulation of toroidal space that can be achieved
      morphologically in this set of dimensions. In this mode and
      manner, it served as a "model world" for the genesis of "new"
      automata - and it was in a far more manageable form factor than
      the whispering galleries of ancient times! (For a definition of
      "whispering gallery" see
      www.gravity.uwa.edu.au/publ/GWG_publ.html.<br>
      <br>
      However, having completed all of the necessary mathematics and
      preparations required to perform the entire process within a
      digital environment, and after gaining access to the amazing
      Vector Farm ™ ultracomputer, we have essentially been able to
      convert the entire clocking mechanism over into a purely digital
      algorithmic world. We call our new automatous clock the Great
      Diesis Chronoldek ™, and we use it for harmonization and
      optimization in HRT and for the production of i-drops...our
      algorithmically transformed water.<br>
      <br>
      The Chronoldek operates at the pulse rate of the Great Dieis, a
      universal time code common to all life. This universal rhythm not
      only unifies the various frequencies of each individual, but can
      also resolve any or all groupings of individuals. It connects all
      of the subparts of an individual, as well as each individual one
      to another. Converted to frequency, this ratio provides a
      universal fundamental for all periodic wave phenomena such as
      gravity, sound, light, and chronology. In other words, it is a
      number that ties us all together as whole number ratios of the
      Great Diesis and allows therapies based on enhancing what's right
      rather than fixing what's wrong.<br>
      <br>
      As a ratio, the GD resolves the differential between the absolute
      perfection of spiritual potential and the relative manifestation
      of actual physical reality, best expressed in music theory.
      Western music scales are conveniently "tempered" to make the
      octave double in frequency with each progression for ease of use,
      but the natural octave of the Universal Rhythm does not exactly do
      so…it comes up short by a small fraction known in music theory as
      the Great Diesis…a small ratio mathematically expressed as
      125:128.<br>
      <br>
      As a time-based ratio, the Great Diesis allows for smooth
      transition between the temporal and spectral domains and resolves
      differentials between analog and digital vector processing. All
      human action takes place in the temporal domain of relative time.
      However, all of the possible outcomes of such action are concealed
      within the spectral domain of frequency or relative vibration. The
      Great Diesis facilitates transformation and provides a bridge
      between domains for our work.<br>
      <br>
      Transformant™ is water that has been algorithmically transformed
      with a person's breath using a futuristic Alembic. Rather than
      charging the water with an outside source, Transformant™ is
      required to become the agent of its own transformation. In the
      same way that a person is transformed by harmonic resolution with
      headphones, the same signals are delivered to two 24 carat gold
      waveguides suspended inside a reaction chamber filled with water.
      The water must resolve the difference by acknowledging the need to
      change. It then has to give up resistance, purify itself and step
      out to it's next highest state as vapor. Consuming this vapor is
      the near equivalent of completing the journey yourself, because
      your personal automata have already fulfilled the requirements.
      This can provide all of the resources necessary for personal
      transformation, except your active pursuit and our dedicated
      support. Pursuit is up to you. We provide the support.<br>
      <br>
      Each of these provide users with enhanced and optimized personal
      automata which can assist in reaching the next highest level of
      order. This change can be something as simple as a shift of mood
      all the way up to the ultimate transformation from material
      creature to spiritual essence, a process called allasso.<br>

      </div>
      <b>&nbsp;</b><br>
      Using a material found in Silly Putty and surgical tubing, a group
      of researchers have developed a new way to make lithium-ion
      batteries that will last three times longer between charges
      compared to the current industry standard.<br>
      <br>
      Using a material found in Silly Putty and surgical tubing, a group
      of researchers at the University of California, Riverside Bourns
      College of Engineering have developed a new way to make
      lithium-ion batteries that will last three times longer between
      charges compared to the current industry standard.<br>
      <br>
      The team created silicon dioxide (SiO2) nanotube anodes for
      lithium-ion batteries and found they had over three times as much
      energy storage capacity as the carbon-based anodes currently being
      used. This has significant implications for industries including
      electronics and electric vehicles, which are always trying to
      squeeze longer discharges out of batteries.<br>
      <br>
      "We are taking the same material used in kids' toys and medical
      devices and even fast food and using it to create next generation
      battery materials," said Zachary Favors, the lead author of a
      just-published paper on the research.<br>
      <br>
      The paper, "Stable Cycling of SiO2 Nanotubes as High-Performance
      Anodes for Lithium-Ion Batteries," was published online in the
      journal Nature Scientific Reports.<br>
      <br>
      It was co-authored by Cengiz S. Ozkan, a mechanical engineering
      professor, Mihrimah Ozkan, an electrical engineering professor,
      and several of their current and former graduate students: Wei
      Wang, Hamed Hosseinni Bay, Aaron George and Favors.<br>
      <br>
      The team originally focused on silicon dioxide because it is an
      extremely abundant compound, environmentally friendly, non-toxic,
      and found in many other products.<br>
      <br>
      Silicon dioxide has previously been used as an anode material in
      lithium ion batteries, but the ability to synthesize the material
      into highly uniform exotic nanostructures with high energy density
      and long cycle life has been limited.<br>
      <br>
      There key finding was that the silicon dioxide nanotubes are
      extremely stable in batteries, which is important because it means
      a longer lifespan. Specifically, SiO2 nanotube anodes were cycled
      100 times without any loss in energy storage capability and the
      authors are highly confident that they could be cycled hundreds
      more times.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers are now focused on developed methods to scale up
      production of the SiO2 nanotubes in hopes they could become a
      commercially viable product.<br>

      Herein, SiO2 nanotubes have been fabricated via a facile two step
      hard-template growth method and evaluated as an anode for Li-ion
      batteries. SiO2 nanotubes exhibit a highly stable reversible
      capacity of 1266 mAhg-1 after 100 cycles with negligible capacity
      fading. SiO2 NT anodes experience a capacity increase throughout
      the first 80 cycles through Si phase growth via SiO2 reduction.
      The hollow morphology of the SiO2 nanotubes accommodates the large
      volume expansion experienced by Si-based anodes during lithiation
      and promotes preservation of the solid electrolyte interphase
      layer. The thin walls of the SiO2 nanotubes allow for effective
      reduction in Li-ion diffusion path distance and, thus, afford a
      favorable rate cyclability. The high aspect ratio character of
      these nanotubes allow for a relatively scalable fabrication method
      of nanoscale SiO2-based anodes.<br>

      </b><b> </b>A substance found in tomatoes relieves impairment of
      blood vessels, which may explain why people who eat a
      Mediterranean diet have a notably reduced incidence of
      cardiovascular disease, according to a study.<br>
      <br>
      A supplement of lycopene, a powerful antioxidant which is 10 times
      more potent than vitamin E, improved and normalised function of
      the endothelium (the inner lining of blood vessels) in volunteers
      with cardiovascular disease, researchers from the University of
      Cambridge found.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Joseph Cheriyan, consultant clinical pharmacologist at
      Addenbrooke's hospital and associate lecturer at the University of
      Cambridge, said: "There's a wealth of research that suggests the
      Mediterranean diet – which includes lycopene found in tomatoes and
      other fruit as a component – is good for our cardiovascular
      health. But so far, it's been a mystery what the underlying
      mechanisms could be."<br>
      <br>
      For the study, funded and sponsored by Cambridge University
      Hospitals NHS foundation trust, and published in the online
      scientific journal Plos One on Monday, researchers gave 36
      cardiovascular disease patients, who were all on statins but had
      impaired function of the endothelium, and 36 healthy volunteers
      either Ateronon (an off-the-shelf supplement containing 7mg of
      lycopene) or a placebo treatment. Endothelial function predicts
      future events, so having a healthy endothelium is an important
      factor in preventing the evolution of heart disease.&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It was conducted as a double blind trial, which meant that neither
      study participants nor the researchers knew which treatment was
      being provided.<br>
      <br>
      They found that the lycopene supplement worked in the patients,
      improving the widening of the blood vessels by 53% after placebo
      correction, but not in the healthy volunteers. Constriction of the
      blood vessels is one of the key factors that can lead to heart
      attack and stroke. The supplement had no effect on blood pressure,
      arterial stiffness or levels of lipids.<br>
      <br>
      Lycopene is found in tomatoes and its potency appears to be
      enhanced when it is consumed pureed, in ketchup or in the presence
      of olive oil. It is also found in other fruit and vegetables, such
      as grapefruit, watermelon, asparagus and carrots.<br>
      <br>
      Cheriyan said the results reinforced the need for a healthy diet

      quite clearly that lycopene improves the function of blood vessels
      in cardiovascular disease patients," he said.<br>
      <br>
      "A daily 'tomato pill' is not a substitute for other treatments,
      but may provide added benefits when taken alongside other
      medication." He said much larger trials were needed to establish
      whether lycopene did reduce heart disease.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the
      British Heart Foundation, says: "Impaired endothelial function is
      a known predictor of increased risk of future heart disease.
      Further work is needed to understand whether the beneficial
      effects seen in this small study translate into clinical benefit
      for at-risk patients."<br>

      <b> </b>If you don’t like fruit and veg but want to look after
      your heart, scientists may have come up with the answer. <br>
      <br>
      They have created a ‘tomato pill’ that is bursting with lycopene,
      the compound credited with many health benefits of the
      Mediterranean diet.<br>
      <br>
      A single Ateronon pill contains as much lycopene – the pigment
      that gives tomatoes their rich, red colour – as more than 2lb of
      the fruit. <br>
      Breakthrough: A single Ateronon pill contains as much lycopene -
      the pigment that gives tomatoes their rich, red colour - as more
      than 2lb of the fruit<br>

      Breakthrough: A single Ateronon pill contains as much lycopene -
      the pigment that gives tomatoes their rich, red colour - as more
      than 2lb of the fruit<br>
      <br>
      Now, Cambridge University research has shown the supplement
      improves blood vessel health in survivors of heart attacks and
      people with angina and other cardiac problems.<br>
      <br>
      In those who took the £1-a-day pill once a day for two months,
      vital cells that line the inside of blood vessels became
      healthier.<br>
      <br>
      These endothelial cells are key to keeping blood moving through
      the body – and to warding off future heart attacks and strokes. <br>
      <br>
      In those who took the lycopene, blood vessels were able to open
      more than 50 per cent wider by the end of the study, improving
      blood flow.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      By the end of the study, the blood cell lining of the heart
      patients worked almost as well as that of healthy people.<br>
      <br>
      Importantly, the improvement was seen despite the volunteers being
      on blood pressure pills, statins and other tablets designed to
      improve heart health, the journal PLOS ONE reports.<br>
      <br>
      No effect was seen on the blood vessels of people who were
      otherwise healthy.<br>
      <br>
      The pill, which can be bought on the high street and was created
      by scientists working for a Cambridge University spin-out company,
      didn’t affect blood pressure or the flexibility of the arteries.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers on the blood vessel study, who aren’t connected to
      the manufacturer, said that despite the improvement seen, more
      longer-term studies are needed to show that taking Ateronon cuts
      the risk of heart attacks and strokes.<br>

      improves blood vessel health in survivors of heart attacks and
      people with angina and other cardiac problems<br>
      <br>
      However, as lycopene is especially potent when mixed with olive
      oil, the finding could help explain by a Mediterranean-style seems
      so good for health.<br>
      <br>
      Researcher Dr Joseph Cheriyan, of Cambridge University and the
      city’s Addenbrooke’s Hospital, said: ‘There's a wealth of research
      that suggests that the Mediterranean diet - which includes
      lycopene found in tomatoes and other fruit as a component - is
      good for our cardiovascular health.<br>
      <br>
      ‘But so far, it's been a mystery what the underlying mechanisms
      could be.<br>
      <br>
      ‘We've shown quite clearly that lycopene improves the function of
      blood vessels in cardiovascular disease patients. It reinforces
      the need for a healthy diet in people at risk from heart disease
      and stroke.<br>
      <br>
      ‘A daily 'tomato pill' is not a substitute for other treatments,
      but may provide added benefits when taken alongside other
      medication.’<br>
      <br>
      The British Heart Foundation, which helped fund the study, said
      that more work was needed to see if the benefits seen lead to
      actual improvement to heart health.<br>
      <br>
      Other research has credited lycopene with a host of health
      benefits from warding off prostate cancer to boosting sperm
      concentration.<br>

        <b> </b><br>
        <b> By Elizabeth Cohen, Senior Medical Correspondent</b></div>
      <br>
      <br>
      (CNN) -- Kyle Rhodes loves to consider the possibilities: He could
      sport a long, full Viking beard, or maybe grow a mullet like his
      favorite 1980s hockey players. Or he could get something nice and
      clean like George Clooney's signature 1990s Caesar haircut.<br>
      <br>
      They're all choices he's never had before -- he was diagnosed with
      alopecia areata at age 2, and the hair on his head started falling
      out in patches. By 18, he'd lost all the hair on his head and
      body.<br>
      <br>
      One day his doctor at Yale University had a thought: Since Rhodes'
      hair loss was caused by an autoimmune disease, why not try a
      treatment used for another autoimmune disorder? He chose the drug
      Xeljanz, which is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
      <br>
      Eight months later, Rhodes had a full head of hair. His eyebrows
      and eyelashes grew back, as did the rest of the hair on his body.<br>
      <br>
      "I was ecstatic," said his dermatologist, Dr. Brett King. "I was
      truly overjoyed for him."<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><b><i>Kyle Rhodes had a full head of hair
            after eight months when he began using an arthritis drug to
            treat his alopecia areata.</i></b><br>
        <br>
      </div>
      <div align="center"><i><img alt="" src="xeljanz.jpg" height="169"
            width="300"></i><br>
      </div>
      <i> </i><br>
      King is also cautiously optimistic for the 6.5 million others who
      suffer from alopecia acreata and who also may be able to benefit
      from the drug.<br>
      <br>
      He said he would like to try it out on more patients soon.<br>
      <br>
      But Dr. George Cotsarelis isn't so sure that's a good idea. Some
      people who've taken Xeljanz have died from infections such as
      tuberculosis, and others face an increased risk of cancer,
      according to the drugmaker's website.<br>
      <br>
      "This drug really can have some nasty side effects," said
      Cotsarelis, chairman of dermatology at the University of
      Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine. "You really have to
      decide how much risk you want to (take)."<br>
      <br>
      King said he hopes to make a cream form of Xeljanz so that a
      patient can use it right at the source of hair loss rather than
      taking a pill and exposing the whole body to the drug.<br>
      <br>
      Neither doctor said he believes the drug will work for the common
      kind of baldness that comes with age. Cotsarelis was adamant about
      it because male pattern baldness isn't related to the immune
      system.<br>
      <br>
      But King said he thinks conducting more research is worth a try.<br>
      <br>
      "To not imagine it would be crazy," he said. "The possibility
      should be imagined and should be investigated."<br>
      <br>
      It's not clear whether someone with hair loss would have to keep
      taking the drug for life. Rhodes said he continues to take it not
      so much for his full head of hair but because the drug has helped
      his psoriasis, which gives him painful dry, bleeding skin. His
      doctor recently upped the dosage to six pills a day in the hopes
      of making an even bigger dent against the disease.<br>
      <br>
      Rhodes said he's had no side effects and he's not scared to take
      the pill since he's used other potentially dangerous drugs before
      to combat his skin diseases.<br>
      <br>
      What might make him stop taking it is cost. Xeljanz is a new,
      expensive drug. Without insurance it can cost $25,000 a year,
      according to King.<br>
      <br>
      Rhodes said his insurance pays for most of the cost. Pfizer, the
      company that makes the drug, agreed to give him a discount card
      that takes care of his $600 per month copayment, so for now he can
      afford it and enjoy a full head of hair.<br>
      <br>
      "I find myself a lot of times just playing with it," he said.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      XELJANZ may cause serious side effects, including:<br>
      <br>
      Serious infections.<br>
      <br>
      XELJANZ can lower the ability of your immune system to fight
      infections. Some people have serious infections while taking
      XELJANZ, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by
      bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body.
      Some people have died from these infections. Your healthcare
      provider should test you for TB before starting XELJANZ, and
      monitor you closely for signs and symptoms of TB infection during
      treatment. You should not start taking XELJANZ if you have any
      kind of infection unless your healthcare provider tells you it is
      okay.<br>
      <br>
      Before starting XELJANZ, tell your healthcare provider if you:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; think you have an infection or have symptoms of
      an infection, such as fever, sweating, or chills; muscle aches;
      cough; shortness of breath; blood in phlegm; weight loss; warm,
      red, or painful skin or sores on your body; diarrhea or stomach
      pain; burning when you urinate or urinating more often than
      normal; or feeling very tired<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are being treated for an infection<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get a lot of infections or have infections that
      keep coming back<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have diabetes, HIV, or a weak immune system.
      People with these conditions have a higher chance for infections<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have TB, or have been in close contact with
      someone with TB<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; live or have lived in, or have traveled to
      certain parts of the country (such as the Ohio and Mississippi
      River valleys and the Southwest) where there is an increased
      chance for getting certain kinds of fungal infections
      (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis). These
      infections may happen or become more severe if you use XELJANZ.
      Ask your healthcare provider if you do not know if you have lived
      in an area where these infections are common<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have or have had hepatitis B or C<br>
      <br>
      After starting XELJANZ, call your healthcare provider right away
      if you have any symptoms of an infection. XELJANZ can make you
      more likely to get infections or make worse any infection that you
      have.<br>
      <br>
      Cancer and immune system problems.<br>
      <br>
      XELJANZ may increase your risk of certain cancers by changing the
      way your immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancers,
      including skin cancers, have happened in patients taking XELJANZ.
      Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any type of
      cancer.<br>
      <br>
      Some people who have taken XELJANZ with certain other medicines to
      prevent kidney transplant rejection have had a problem with
      certain white blood cells growing out of control (Epstein Barr
      Virus—associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder).<br>
      <br>
      Tears (perforation) in the stomach or intestines.<br>
      <br>
      Some people taking XELJANZ get tears in their stomach or
      intestine. This happens most often in people who also take
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or
      methotrexate. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have
      fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away, and a change in
      your bowel habits.<br>
      <br>
      Changes in certain lab test results.<br>
      <br>
      Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before you start
      receiving XELJANZ, and while you take XELJANZ, to check for the
      following side effects:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changes in lymphocyte counts. Lymphocytes are
      white blood cells that help the body fight off infections.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; low neutrophil counts. Neutrophils are white
      blood cells that help the body fight off infections.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; low red blood cell count. This may mean that
      you have anemia, which may make you feel weak and tired.<br>
      <br>
      Your healthcare provider should routinely check certain liver
      tests.<br>
      <br>
      You should not receive XELJANZ if your lymphocyte count,
      neutrophil count, or red blood cell count is too low or your liver
      tests are too high. Your healthcare provider may stop your XELJANZ
      treatment for a period of time if needed because of changes in
      these blood test results.<br>
      <br>
      Your healthcare provider should do blood tests to check your
      cholesterol levels 4-8 weeks after you start XELJANZ, and as
      needed after that.<br>
      <br>
      What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking XELJANZ?<br>
      <br>
      XELJANZ may not be right for you. Before taking XELJANZ, tell your
      healthcare provider if you:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have an infection<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have liver problems<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have kidney problems<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have any stomach area (abdominal) pain or been
      diagnosed with diverticulitis (inflammation in parts of the large
      intestine) or ulcers in your stomach or intestines<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have had a reaction to tofacitinib or any of
      the ingredients in XELJANZ<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have recently received or are scheduled to
      receive a vaccine. People taking XELJANZ should not receive live
      vaccines but can receive non-live vaccines<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have any other medical conditions<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plan to become pregnant or are pregnant. It is
      not known if XELJANZ will harm an unborn baby<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pregnancy Registry: Pfizer has a registry for
      pregnant women who take XELJANZ. The purpose of this registry is
      to check the health of the pregnant mother and her baby. If you
      are pregnant or become pregnant while taking XELJANZ, talk to your
      healthcare provider about how you can join this pregnancy registry
      or you may contact the registry at 1-877-311-8972 to enroll<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plan to breastfeed or are breastfeeding<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell your healthcare provider about all of the
      medicines you take, especially any other medicines to treat your
      rheumatoid arthritis. You should not take tocilizumab (Actemra®),
      etanercept (Enbrel®), adalimumab (Humira®), infliximab
      (Remicade®), rituximab (Rituxan®), abatacept (Orencia®), anakinra
      (Kineret®), certolizumab pegol (Cimzia®), golimumab (Simponi®),
      azathioprine, cyclosporine, or other immunosuppressive drugs while
      you are taking XELJANZ. Taking XELJANZ with these medicines may
      increase your risk of infection.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking
      medicines that affect the way certain liver enzymes work. Ask your
      healthcare provider if you are not sure if your medicine is one of
      these.<br>
      <br>
      What are other possible side effects of XELJANZ?<br>
      <br>
      XELJANZ may cause serious side effects, including hepatitis B or C
      activation infection in people who carry the virus in their blood.
      If you are a carrier of the hepatitis B or C virus (viruses that
      affect the liver), the virus may become active while you use
      XELJANZ. Tell your healthcare provider if you have the following
      symptoms of a possible hepatitis B or C infection: feeling very
      tired, skin or eyes look yellow, little or no appetite, vomiting,
      clay-colored bowel movements, fevers, chills, stomach discomfort,
      muscle aches, dark urine, or skin rash.<br>
      <br>
      Common side effects of XELJANZ include upper respiratory tract
      infections (common cold, sinus infections), headache, diarrhea,
      and nasal congestion, sore throat, and runny nose
      (nasopharyngitis).<br>
      <br>
      These are not all of the possible side effects of XELJANZ. Please
      see the Prescribing Information, including boxed warning and
      Medication Guide, for additional information and complete details
      about XELJANZ.<br>
      <br>
      What is XELJANZ?<br>
      <br>
      XELJANZ is a prescription medicine called a Janus kinase (JAK)
      inhibitor. XELJANZ is used to treat adults with moderately to
      severely active rheumatoid arthritis in which methotrexate did not
      work well.<br>
      <br>
      It is not known if XELJANZ is safe and effective in people with
      hepatitis B or C.<br>
      XELJANZ is not for people with severe liver problems.<br>
      It is not known if XELJANZ is safe and effective in children.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Pumpkin Seed Oil Found To Help Reverse
          Balding</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      (Case Adams)&nbsp; Researchers from the Republic of Korea's Pusan
      National University have confirmed that pumpkin seed oil increases
      hair growth among balding men.<br>
      <br>
      The medical researchers tested the pumpkin seed oil on 76 male
      patients with moderate androgenic alopecia – male pattern hair
      loss. None of the patients had tried any previous medication,
      supplement or topical therapy for at least three months prior to
      the beginning of the study. The researchers recruited 90 patients,
      but excluded those with high liver enzyme levels.<br>
      <br>
      The patients were divided into two groups and half were given a
      placebo. The treatment consisted of giving the patients 400
      milligrams of the pumpkin seed oil per day in capsules. They were
      given two capsules before breakfast and two capsules before
      dinner.<br>
      <br>
      After three months and at the end of the study at six months the
      patients were assessed using blinded practitioner analysis, and
      given a point score, which ranged from -3 (greatly decreased) to
      +3 (greatly increased).<br>
      <br>
      Each scalp was also photographed using phototrichography – which
      is a polarizing technology, allowing the hair loss region to be
      targeted and measured from the center.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers also conducted hair counts using two different
      lenses. In addition, the patients rated their own hair gain using
      the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).<br>
      <br>
      In the photographic analysis, the researchers found that 44% of
      the group taking the pumpkin seed oil slightly or moderately
      improved hair growth, while 51% were unchanged and 2.7% - actually
      just one patient – had slightly more baldness at the end of the
      six months.<br>
      <br>
      In comparison, among the placebo group, 28% had increased baldness
      and 64% were unchanged, while only 7.7% were slightly or
      moderately improved in hair growth.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center">&nbsp;<img alt="" src="hair.png" height="299"
          width="601"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      In the phototrichographic analysis, the pumpkin seed oil group had
      significantly higher hair counts – over three times more. The
      pumpkin seed oil group saw 30-40% increased hair counts while the
      placebo group showed 5-10% more hair count on average.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers found the treatment to be safe, with only one
      report of mild stomach upset during the trial.<br>
      <br>
      This contrasts greatly with conventional medical treatments such
      as topical minoxidil and oral finasteride. The latter has resulted
      in adverse effects including erectile dysfunction and gynecomastia
      – the enlargement of the male breasts. Meanwhile, side effects of
      minoxidil include scalp itchiness and scaling.<br>
      <br>
      As a result of side effects and lack of success, many men
      discontinue treatment of these drugs. A study from UCLA found that
      many finasteride users stopped their treatment shortly after
      starting. The study, which surveyed 1,261 patients, found that
      only a confirmed 414 patients (32%) continued their treatment past
      one year, while 297 definitely stopped taking the treatment
      between three and 15 months. The research concluded:<br>
      <br>
      "A total of 414 men continued to take the medication, but only 211
      returned detailed questionnaires. A small percentage of this group
      felt that they grew hair. The remaining patients noted poor
      results."<br>
      <br>
      Other research has found pumpkin seed oil can inhibit the 5-alpha
      reductase enzyme - implicated in slowing and stopping hair growth.
      This enzyme is involved in steroid conversion, including
      aldosterone, testosterone, cortisol and others.<br>
      <br>
      With regard to alopecia, 5-alpha reductase is involved with the
      conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) which is
      one of the central mechanisms involved in alopecia. High
      dihydrotestosterone levels produces damage among the hair
      follicles. This causes the hair to thin until the follicle goes
      into dormancy. At this point, there is complete hair loss at the
      follicle.<br>
      <br>
      About 95% of hair loss is due to this mechanism - androgenic
      alopecia.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Pumpkin seed oil (PSO) has been shown to block the action of
      5-alpha reductase and to have antiandrogenic effects on rats. This
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was designed to
      investigate the efficacy and tolerability of PSO for treatment of
      hair growth in male patients with mild to moderate androgenetic
      alopecia (AGA). 76 male patients with AGA received 400 mg of PSO
      per day or a placebo for 24 weeks. Change over time in scalp hair
      growth was evaluated by four outcomes: assessment of standardized
      clinical photographs by a blinded investigator; patient
      self-assessment scores; scalp hair thickness; and scalp hair
      counts. Reports of adverse events were collected throughout the
      study. After 24 weeks of treatment, self-rated improvement score
      and self-rated satisfaction scores in the PSO-treated group were
      higher than in the placebo group (P = 0.013, 0.003). The
      PSO-treated group had more hair after treatment than at baseline,
      compared to the placebo group (P &lt; 0.001). Mean hair count
      increases of 40% were observed in PSO-treated men at 24 weeks,
      whereas increases of 10% were observed in placebo-treated men (P
      &lt; 0.001). Adverse effects were not different in the two groups.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>1. Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is the most common cause of hair loss
      in men and affects up to 70% of men in later life and especially
      those aged over 50 years [1–3]. Genetic factors and androgens
      primarily underlie the pathogenesis of AGA. Hair follicles become
      gradually miniaturized and spend less time in the active phase
      (the anagen phase) and more time in the resting phase (the telogen
      phase) of hair growth [4]. Furthermore, it is known that
      dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is a major player in the process [5].<br>
      <br>
      Topical minoxidil and oral finasteride have been approved by the
      FDA for the treatment of AGA, but only about 30% of patients
      persist with medication over a year in private practice [6–8].
      Oral finasteride was found to decrease libido and ejaculate volume
      or cause erectile dysfunction, whereas topical minoxidil can cause
      scaling and itching of the scalp. Due to these adverse effects,
      patients seem to be drawn to alternative treatments with fewer
      side effects. In this context, many natural products have been
      tested as potential alternative therapies for hair loss. Some
      products, such as green tea and saw palmetto, have demonstrated
      therapeutic potential for the treatment of AGA and benign
      prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) via the inhibition of 5a-reductase
      activity [9, 10]. Pumpkin seed oil (PSO) has also been reported to
      be an effective treatment for symptomatic BPH [11]. Its actions
      have been suggested to be due to phytosterols, which are known to
      inhibit 5a-reductase and to have antiandrogenic effects in rats
      [12]. However the effects of PSO on AGA have not been established.
      We hypothesized that PSO is an effective, safe agent for the
      treatment of men with AGA, and thus we evaluated the efficacy and
      tolerability of PSO for treatment of hair growth in male patients
      with mild to moderate AGA.<br>

      </b><br>
      To our knowledge, this is the first randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy and
      tolerability of PSO in men with mild to moderate AGA. This study
      shows that PSO supplement during 24 weeks has a positive anabolic
      efect on hair growth and that this is due to the possible efects
      of 5-reductase inhibition in patients with mild to moderate male
      pattern hair loss.<br>
      <br>
      AGA is the most common type of hair loss to affect both males and
      females after puberty. Although AGA is not a serious health
      problem, there is a strong demand for treatment and prevention due
      to the high level of interest people have in personal appearance
      in modern society. It is well known that finasteride and minoxidil
      are effective treatments for androgenetic alopecia and both have
      been approved by the FDA for this purpose, but some patients do
      not like taking medicine in the long term, because of possible
      side effects. For example, finasteride can decrease libido and
      ejaculate volume or cause erectile dysfunction, whereas minoxidil
      can cause scaling and itching of the scalp [6, 7].<br>
      <br>
      Herbal therapies have been used to treat baldness since ancient
      times in the Ayurveda, Chinese, and Unani traditional medicinal
      systems [4]. Natural products, such as grape seed and rosemary
      oil, have been shown to be possible alternative treatments for AGA
      due to improved scalp blood flow [16, 17]. Several studies have
      reported that the polyphenols in green tea might be useful for
      treating AGA by inhibiting 5a-reductase activity [9, 10]. Cuscuta
      reflexa exhibited hair growth promotion via 5a-reductase
      inhibitory effect and this herbal extract was highlighted as a
      potential treatment for hair loss [18]. Soymetide-4 was one of the
      herbal product-suppressing alopecia and ginseng (Panax ginseng)
      was also used for scalp treatment limiting hair loss with
      anti-inflammatory and blood circulation effect [19, 20]. Eclipta
      alba extract and Zizyphus jujuba essential oil showed possibility
      of alternative treatment of alopecia [21, 22].<br>
      <br>
      Saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) has been used as a natural treatment
      for androgenetic alopecia and has a similar mechanism [23].
      Interestingly, in a recent study, it was found that 38% of males
      with AGA which received Serenoa repens at 320 mg every day for 24
      months showed increased hair growth. The authors concluded that it
      could be used as an alternative treatment for mild to moderate AGA
      and that it is more effective than finasteride in this respect
      [24]. PSO is rich in beneficial nutrients, such as essential fatty
      acids, ß-carotenes, lutein, ?- and ß-tocopherols, and phytosterols
      [25]. It has been reported in several animal studies that PSO
      inhibits testosterone-induced hyperplasia of the prostate and
      suggested that PSO may be beneficial for the management of BPH
      [10, 24]. Another study confirmed that the intake of PSO at 320
      mg/day over 12 months is clinically safe and effective as a
      complementary treatment for BPH [11]. Although the action
      mechanism is still unclear, previous animal studies have suggested
      that PSO may inhibit 5a-reductase, which produces DHT from
      testosterone [11, 12, 26].<br>
      <br>
      Our study has some limitations, which include a lack of
      histological confirmation of the action mechanism of PSO. In
      addition, DHT and prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels were not
      measured for identification of mechanism of PSO; therefore we
      could not explain the exact action of PSO on AGA patients.
      However, the simplified International Index of Erectile Function
      (IIEF-5) was surveyed at baseline and 24 weeks because of
      identification of changes of libido and no significant intergroup
      differences were observed (data not shown, P = 0.774). The final
      limitation is degree of accuracy when assessing changes of hair by
      phototrichography, even though hair analysis was performed with
      confirmation of recorded target area in baseline. Nevertheless,
      our results have a value because current study was conducted based
      on the randomized controlled trials which evaluated hair changes
      using photographs as well as phototrichography.<br>
      <br>
      Despite of these limitations, this double-blinded study did
      involve 76 subjects and, to the best of the authors' knowledge, is
      the first study to examine the long-term efficacy of PSO on AGA.
      The study shows that PSO could improve AGA and that it should be
      considered a potential alternative treatment. However, replication
      will be needed in order to confirm the results of this first-stage
      study and additional studies are required to elucidate the
      mechanism responsible for the positive effects of PSO on AGA.<br>

      like a lot of other conditioners I've used in the past." "The
      shampoo and conditioner combined have left my hair feeling softer
      and easier to manage." "This product moisturizes my hair and
      scalp, leaving it soft and smooth. I also noticed that when I put
      color on my hair, it often leaves it dry and brittle, but when I
      use this conditioner it smoothes the follicle down making it
      easier to brush and style." "The conditioner doesn't make my hair
      too soft or too flat, like a lot of conditioners can do. It also

      </b><b>Regenerator for vision of human eye&nbsp; </b><b><br>
      </b>&nbsp;<br>
      Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REIN HANS HELMUT <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Abstract --</b> The regenerator is in the form of a helmet
      placed over the head and containing cylindrical permanent magnets
      positioned on the front of the head directly in front of the eyes,
      and on the back of the head directly in front of the cortex. The
      permanent magnets have two or more poles, and are magnetically
      screened on the side facing away from the body. The magnets are
      contained in adjustable holders adaptable to the size and shape of
      the head. The helmet consists of a ring and one or more straps.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Description</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a device for regenerating the vision of
      the eye, characterized in that it comprises a helmet-like shape to
      be placed on the head, and that in this form permanent magnets are
      mounted, their positions on the head and front right under the
      nose and on the head back are right in front of the visual cortex.<br>
      <br>
      The state of the medical school and the medical research takes as
      a given that the vision of the human eye changes over the course
      of a life and that this change is a unbeeinflussbarer and
      irreversible process.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the well-known medical technology focused on
      correcting the instantaneous optical conditions in the eyes of
      people.<br>
      This is done in a known manner by the use of corrective lenses,
      either in the form of glasses or a contact lens.<br>
      <br>
      A newer type of correction is the removal of layers or otherwise
      correcting the cornea with fine mechanical means or laser tools to
      produce by a change in shape of the corneal surface optimal
      optical conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Such surgical refractive power corrections to the cornea have been
      described in protection applications, for example in U.S. Patent
      No. 47 29 372, U.S. Patent 47 18 418, WO 87/05 496 and EP 01 51
      869<br>
      <br>
      With all these surgical procedures, the known risks of scarring,
      cataract, side effects of anesthetics and irregular course of the
      healing process are connected.<br>
      Do not remove the causes of Sehfähigkeits-change, but correct
      their consequences.<br>
      <br>
      Published patent application DE 41 31 361 A1 describes a method
      for changing the vision of the eye in which the cornea no surgical
      intervention, but UV radiation is exposed to an excimer laser,
      which continue to exert radiation pattern, imaging optics and
      fixing a transformative effect on the cornea.<br>
      <br>
      This one arisen mismatch between corneal curvature and distance to
      the retina is corrected, but does not eliminate the cause of the
      emergence of this mismatch.<br>
      Utility Model Application G 90 11 254.7 describes a Therapeutic
      glasses, whose job it is to heal through constant magnetic
      stimulation of neural areas near the eyes a number of eye
      diseases.<br>
      <br>
      This also nearsightedness and farsightedness are enumerated among
      many diseases that are treated by a magnetic excitation of the
      points A or C.<br>
      All points mentioned there are outside of the eye sockets on the
      nasal bone (A) and directly below the eyes (C) The other
      stimulation points are point D in mid-brow and point B at the
      outer end of the eye socket.<br>
      <br>
      A targeted regeneration of eye-vitreous body is therefore not
      intended and can not be reached.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, the application speaks regarding Far-sightedness and
      not of healing but of treatment.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Task</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention has for its object to provide a device by
      means of the application of the visual acuity of the eyes is
      regenerated without surgical intervention and without the
      necessity of wearing a pair of spectacles or contact lenses.<br>
      <br>
      Under regeneration of vision is understood here that the generally
      taken-for uninfluenceable deterioration of vision of the eye,
      which in advancing age is getting stronger, be reversed and the
      previously existing vision is restored.<br>
      <br>
      As a deeper cause for the so-called age-related Sehfähigkeits
      deterioration by environmental causes disability of the body's
      mechanisms have been identified for&nbsp; regeneration and
      maintenance conservation of light diffraction ability of the
      eye-glass body.<br>
      <br>
      The object of the inventive device, therefore, is to enable the
      body's regeneration mechanisms in the position of this light
      diffraction ability of the eye vitreous restore and maintain.<br>
      <br>
      The treatment of the eye to regenerate the vision to be carried
      out without the need for an inpatient hospital stay and without
      risks and side effects.<br>
      <br>
      You should continue with no changes to the device and without
      changes to the application s mode, and without additional cost to
      the patient or user at any time be repeatable even after several
      years, for example if a more prolonged high environmental burden
      to the patient or user this requires.<br>
      Solution of the problem<br>
      <br>
      To achieve the object, the invention proposes a device for
      regenerating the vision of the eyes before which consists of a
      helmet-like shape to be placed on the head, are attached in which
      permanent magnets whose positions on the head-front directly in
      front of the eyes and on the head back are right in front of the
      visual cortex.<br>
      The invention is based on the finding that the cornea and the lens
      are not the only places in the eye, which concentrate the incident
      light by refraction such that the focal point of its rays is on
      the retinal surface.<br>
      <br>
      Rather, the eye-glass body, achieved through its gel-like mass,
      the light rays of the retina, an additional correction function,
      which is that light rays undergo diffraction in different
      thickness and therefore reach the retinal surface differentiated
      than has hitherto been assumed.<br>
      <br>
      It was further recognized that these light diffraction needs
      within the eye-glass body of an inhomogeneous structure of the
      vitreous body and a complex neural control, which in turn is very
      sensitive to external influences.<br>
      <br>
      Obviously particularly stable charging and poling conditions when
      the gel particles in the glass body and the cells around the glass
      bodies are decisive for the continued maintenance of said glass
      body function.<br>
      <br>
      This charge and Polungsverhältnisse are mainly disturbed by the
      myriad of alternating electromagnetic fields emanating from
      domestic electrical installations, radio and television.<br>
      <br>
      It has been shown in long series of experiments, surprisingly,
      that it is possible by the selective action of a particular steady
      magnetic field directly on the eye-glass body and the visual
      cortex located at the back of the head, to enable the body's own
      regeneration mechanism in the situation, the negative effects of
      these electromagnetic alternating fields to eliminate and thus the
      original and natural vision conditions of the eye, to restore it.<br>
      <br>
      This regeneration process the longer it takes, the more the poling
      and charge ratios were disrupted in and around the eye-glass body
      and could not regenerate.<br>
      As any rule of thumb it can be assumed that the body needs the
      targeted permanent magnet treatment for a period of 6-12 months to
      compensate for the negative effects of alternating field stress of
      20 years.<br>
      <br>
      The treatment must take during this period about 5 times each 4
      minutes per day.<br>
      <br>
      The simultaneous treatment of vitreous body and visual cortex has
      been found to be time-shortening, ie, a treatment of the vitreous
      alone would take twice as long.<br>
      To solve the problem, therefore, the invention proposes a device
      for regenerating the vision of the eyes, which consists of a
      helmet-like shape to be placed on the head, are attached in which
      permanent magnets whose positions on the head-front directly in
      front of the eyes and on the head back are right in front of the
      visual cortex.<br>
      <br>
      The helmet-like shape can be made as a closed or open form, or
      consisting of a solid, containing the mountings for the permanent
      magnets, anatomically advantageous shaped ring and one or more,
      above the head extending and adjustable straps.<br>
      <br>
      The permanent magnets are advantageously mounted in holders, which
      in adaptation to different head sizes and head shapes their exact
      positioning in front of the eyes, respectively, before the visual
      cortex allow.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the holders of the permanent magnets are
      advantageously designed so that the permanent magnets can be
      approximated on the head-front to eye contact and closer to the
      head back up to head contact.<br>
      <br>
      The strength of the permanent magnets used in the present
      invention is defined with a remanence Br between 135 mT and 295 mT
      and an energy product (BH) max. between 3 and 16 kJ/m.sup.3
      kJ/m.sup.3.<br>
      <br>
      The device is equipped with a timer, the expiry of which the
      necessary treatment time of about 4 minutes signaled acoustically.<br>
      <br>
      Another embodiment provides an automatic way abandonment of the
      permanent magnets of the eyes after the treatment period.<br>
      Other claims relate to the shape and size as well as the polarity
      of the permanent magnets, as well as adjustment facilities and a
      safety strap serving on the helmet-like shape.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The advantages achieved by the invention are compared with all
      surgical procedures in the elimination of health risks associated
      with these and the lower cost.<br>
      <br>
      To non-surgically erwirkten correcting deformations of the cornea,
      the invention offers the advantage of lower costs as well as the
      advantage of the restoration of the original, natural visual
      conditions by regeneration of the glass body function of the eye,
      without making any artificial adjustments to the actually
      non-correction-requiring cornea.<br>
      <br>
      Compared with therapeutically acceptable glasses are the
      advantages in elimination of wearing such glasses, as the
      inevitably heavy glasses in professional and private life often
      seem distracting, and in the safer effect due to the eradication
      of the root causes of the deterioration of eyesight.<br>
      Compared to other therapeutic applications of permanent magnetic
      fields and other known treatment methods of the eyes are the
      advantages of targeted agents on the regeneration of light
      diffraction ability of the eye-glass body treatment without any
      side effect, harmful misapplication or over-dosage danger.<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>You can’t see, smell or taste them – but over the last few
      years silver nanoparticles have been added to our food supply (and
      medications) at an alarming rate. Like me, I’m sure you’re
      wondering why would food producers – and the pharmaceutical
      industry – place silver in their products?<br>
      <br>
      Consuming silver nanoparticles is a bad idea. These particles are
      sprayed onto produce – as a pesticide – and incorporated into food
      packaging to extend shelf life, due to their antimicrobial
      properties. But, scientific research warns us that the uptake of
      these tiny particles can cause cellular damage, kidney disorders,
      stomach upset, headaches, fatigue and skin irritation.<br>
      Nanoparticles causes premature aging<br>
      <br>
      Researchers have demonstrated the devastating effects of silver
      nanoparticles on cell survival, and the integrity of the
      mitochondria.<br>
      <br>
      Animals treated with silver nanoparticles exhibited reduced
      cognitive/motor functions and altered cellular structures in the
      brain. And, just to be clear, many scientific studies suggest that
      chronic exposure to silver nanoparticles can damage brain
      function. With all the pollution in our environment – should we
      really allow this technology to invade our food supply?<br>
      <br>
      More research reveals an alarming toxic trend<br>
      <br>
      Further data shows silver nanoparticles induce toxicity in neurons
      with the resulting dysfunction of physiological function. These
      particles, once digested, get distributed inside the brain, heart,
      and blood – which can result in cardiac arrhythmia, slower blood
      flow and impaired motor skills.<br>
      <br>
      Observations, in laboratory animals, have shown that the uptake of
      these particles – in the digestive track – can change the terrain.
      The digestive track harbors beneficial bacteria along with
      pathogenic bacteria. Silver nanoparticles can wipe out the ‘good
      bacteria’ along with toxic ones.<br>
      <br>
      Naturally, if you disturb the healthy balance of bacteria, within
      our gut, you comprise the immune system – setting the stage for
      degenerative disease.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists detect nanoparticles on fruit<br>
      <br>
      Scientists developed a new method for detecting silver
      nanoparticles in food during a study published in the Journal of
      Agricultural and Food Chemistry. This method was able to identify
      and measure relatively small amounts of these nanoparticles, in
      pears, according to Mengshi Lin, Ph.D. – study author and
      associate professor of food science at the University of Missouri.<br>
      <br>
      The pears were immersed in a silver nanoparticle solution, similar
      to a pesticide application, and then washed and rinsed repeatedly.
      Four days after the treatment and rinsing, the silver
      nanoparticles were still attached to the skin and some even
      penetrated the skin to reach the pear pulp.<br>
      <br>
      Many food packing materials incorporate silver nanoparticles to
      prolong the shelf life of packaged foods. The nano material has
      been known to transfer to the food – inside the package. I guess,
      after reading this, you’ll feel even better about eating fresh
      (unprocessed) food – as much as possible.<br>
      <br>
      Nanoparticles can become airborne easily due to their size and
      mass. When inhaled, nanoparticles can go deeper into the lungs
      reaching more sensitive areas. These particles can inflame the
      lungs – which must work harder in attempts to remove the foreign
      particles.<br>
      <br>
      The only known protection from nanoparticle toxins<br>
      <br>
      It takes an incredibly small amount of this substance to cause
      health problems. In fact, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      is on record saying that nanoparticles pose safety issues –
      because they significantly alter bioavailability properties of
      food, which alter how much your body can absorb a substance. This
      means it affects the amount of nutrients you absorb and the amount
      of toxins that can enter a cell.<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, companies aren’t required to label or test nano
      materials in the food they sell you or the packing they put it in.
      To counter the ever increasing amount of nanoparticles in food –
      you have to look for whole foods, which aren’t commercially
      packaged. Apples, carrots, dark leafy greens and so on are healthy
      choices.<br>
      <br>
      Buy local (whenever possible) – since foods that are transported
      long distances are often treated with nanosilver particles to keep
      them looking ‘fresh’. Organic produce is less likely to be treated
      with nanoparticles. Plus, we know that organic farming techniques
      avoid the use of sewage sludge fertilizer – which can be tainted
      with nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      Thankfully, the world is changing and people are waking up to the
      truth about toxic food, medicine and personal care products. Vote
      with your dollars and be part of the solution.<br>

      Think of it as softness blended with strength: One research team
      has genetically engineered a silkworm that spins cocoons composed
      of about 95 percent silkworm proteins and 5 percent spider silk
      proteins. The composite silk is significantly stronger than
      regular silkworm silk and, researchers hope, as easy to produce in
      large quantities as regular silk.<br>
      <br>
      The research team reported on their results from two genetically
      engineered silkworms in this week’s issue of the journal
      Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.<br>
      <br>
      Spider silk’s strength, lightness and flexibility make it an
      appealing material for sutures, artificial ligaments and tendons,
      bulletproof vests and more. So far, however, nobody has been able
      to harvest enough spider silk for practical use.<br>
      <br>
      One problem is that people can’t farm spiders. The animals are
      territorial and, if kept in close quarters, have a tendency to eat
      each other. To get spider silk without cannibalizing spiders,
      several research teams have engineered cells and even goats to
      produce spider silk proteins. But that leads to a problem: how to
      spin that protein into large quantities of silken threads.<br>
      <br>
      “All of those platforms allow for protein production, but then
      they have to find a way to transform those proteins to fibers,”
      said Donald Jarvis, a biologist at the University of Wyoming who
      led the research on the silkworm-spider blend.<br>
      <br>
      Jarvis decided to recruit some docile natural silk-spinners to
      help him. “It seemed to me that the silkworm was the way to go
      because they naturally spin fibers,” he told InnovationNewsDaily.<br>
      <br>
      Silkworms create large, fluffy cocoons, and for centuries people
      have grown them and harvested their silken wrappings to weave into
      fabric. Jarvis’ research team introduced a synthetic spider silk
      gene into silkworms’ silk-spinning glands. The gene included
      portions that code for elasticity and strength, and it was
      sandwiched between pieces of silkworm genetic material, which
      created a composite fiber that mixed the inserted gene’s material
      with the silkworm’s own product.<br>
      <br>
      Jarvis’ team isn’t the first to get silkworms to spin part-spider
      silk, but it is the first to create a fiber significantly stronger
      than silkworm silk alone. The best fiber they created is about 48
      percent stronger than regular silk and has about 61 percent the
      overall strength of dragline spider silk, which is the strongest
      silk that spiders make, said Randolph Lewis, a biologist at Utah
      State University who worked on the new composite. Spiders use
      dragline silk for the frameworks of their webs and for catching
      themselves when they fall, and it’s the type of silk that
      scientists are most eager to reproduce. <br>
      <br>
      Though the new fiber isn’t as strong as 100 percent spider silk,
      it’s stronger than steel, Lewis said.<br>
      <br>
      The team is now working on creating genetically engineered
      silkworms that can spin silk with a higher percentage of spider
      material, Jarvis said. That should mean an even stronger material
      that comes closer to mimicking spider draglines.<br>

          Photos provided by Dr. Vladislav Rogozov <br>
          <br>
          So here are the facts: it happened during 6th Soviet Antarctic
          Expedition at Novolazarevskaya Station. The patient was the
          only physician on station, so the assistant was a mechanic. It
          was on April 30, 1961. The operation took 2 hours. He
          positioned himself so that he could see his own body using a
          mirror when doing the surgery - he made a 12 cm cut through
          which he found the appendix. After 5 days the doctor felt
          good, and after 7 days he removed the wires which had been
          used to sew up the body. His name: Leonid Rogozov. He
          published a short note about this in the Soviet Antarctic
          Expedition Information Bulletin, no. 37, pp. 42-44, 1962.<br>
          <br>
          The above information was provided a while ago by Alex
          Zaitsev, the Russian exchange scientist and friend that I
          wintered with at Pole in 1977. When the bulletins were
          translated into English, they were compiled in volumes of ten
          issues; numbers 31-40 were put in Volume 4, so the English
          reference for Dr. Rogozov's note is Rogozov KI:
          Self-operation. Soviet Antarctic Expedition Information
          Bulletin 4:223, 1964, and here is my copy.<br>

          (the Shirmacher Oasis) in Queen Maud Land, 50 miles inland
          from the ice edge. It was closed for a bit in 1992...but more
          recently it is more commonly known as Novo...the blue ice
          runway also used by tourist operations is a few miles to the
          southwest.<br>

          Rogozov, became ill on 29 April. He came to the decision to
          make the operation on 30 April at 22 hours and 15 minutes.
          Rogozov, using mirror began operation, which lasted 2 hours.
          Equipment used in the operation was normal, performed in the
          semi-sitting position. The operation was carried out under
          local anesthesia. Assisting the doctor doctor was the
          Meteorologist and Chief Engineer Mechanic. On 7 May the
          patient was satisfied and removed the stitches...<br>

      <h2 class="title icon" align="center"><small>Free Will May Just Be
          the Brain's 'Background Noise,' Scientists Say</small> </h2>
      <b>It's a question that has plagued philosophers and scientists
        for thousands of years: Is free will an illusion?</b> <br>
      <br>
      Now, a new study suggests that free will may arise from a hidden
      signal buried in the "background noise" of chaotic electrical
      activity in the brain, and that this activity occurs almost a
      second before people consciously decide to do something.<br>
      <br>
      Though "purposeful intentions, desires and goals drive our
      decisions in a linear cause-and-effect kind of way, our finding
      shows that our decisions are also influenced by neural noise
      within any given moment," study co-author Jesse Bengson, a
      neuroscientist at the University of California, Davis, wrote in an
      email to Live Science. "This random firing, or noise, may even be
      the carrier upon which our consciousness rides, in the same way
      that radio static is used to carry a radio station."<br>
      <br>
      This background noise may allow people to respond creatively to
      novel situations, and it may even give human behavior the "flavor
      of free will," Bengson said.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Predetermined or random</b><br>
      <br>
      Sir Isaac Newton's laws of classical mechanics suggested the
      universe was deterministic, with an inevitable effect for every
      cause. By Newtonian logic, a "freely" made decision is completely
      predetermined by the actions that precede it.<br>
      <br>
      But quantum physics revealed that subatomic particles' behavior is
      inherently unpredictable. As a result, physical forces like
      gravity and electromagnetism can't completely dictate the future
      based on past events, thus leaving a tiny window for free will to
      operate through the random behavior of subatomic particles.<br>
      <br>
      Still, many philosophers doubted that the random behavior of
      miniscule particles could translate to free will, because quantum
      effects don't hold much sway at larger scales.<br>
      <br>
      Experiments performed in the 1970s also raised doubts about human
      volition. Those studies, conducted by the late neuroscientist
      Benjamin Libet, revealed that the region of the brain that plans
      and executes movement, called the motor cortex, fired prior to
      people's decision to press a button, suggesting this part of the
      brain "makes up its mind" before peoples' conscious decision
      making kicks in.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hidden signal?</b><br>
      <br>
      To understand more about conscious decision making, Bengson's team
      used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure the brain waves of 19
      undergraduates as they looked at a screen and were cued to make a
      random decision about whether to look right or left.<br>
      <br>
      When people made their decision, a characteristic signal
      registered that choice as a wave of electrical activity that
      spread across specific brain regions.<br>
      <br>
      But in a fascinating twist, other electrical activity emanating
      from the back of the head predicted people's decisions up to 800
      milliseconds before the signature of conscious decision making
      emerged.<br>
      <br>
      This brain activity wasn't strictly a signal at all — it was
      "noise," part of the brain's omnipresent and seemingly random
      electrical firing. In fact, neuroscientists usually consider this
      background noise meaningless and subtract it when trying to figure
      out the brain response to a specific task, said Rick Addante, a
      neuroscientist at the University of Texas at Dallas who was not
      involved in the research.<br>
      <br>
      In other words, some hidden signal in the background noise of the
      brain seemed to determine people's conscious decisions before they
      made them.<br>
      <br>
      "That's what's wild about it; it's not all noise," Addante told
      Live Science. "The question then becomes, what is it, and what is
      the informationthat it contains?"<br>
      <br>
      <b>Open question</b><br>
      <br>
      The new study doesn't prove or disprove free will, Addante said.<br>
      <br>
      "If there's something else occurring before our conscious
      awareness that's contributing to our decision, that raises the
      question about the extent of our free will," Addante said. On the
      other hand, the findings might open the door to free will by
      suggesting it rides on, but isn't quite the same as, the random
      background noise in our brains, he said.<br>
      <br>
      But Ali Mazaheri, a neuroscientist at the University of Amsterdam
      in the Netherlands, sees the results as a blow to true free will.<br>
      <br>
      The findings suggest that previous biases in the firing of the
      brain's sensory processing systems add up, leading people to
      decisions that the conscious brain later follows, said Mazaheri,
      who was not involved in the study.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Useful illusion?</b><br>
      <br>
      But if free will is an illusion, why does it feel so real?<br>
      <br>
      Though that's still a mystery, one theory is that life would be
      too depressing without the illusion of choice, making it hard for
      humans to survive and reproduce.<br>
      <br>
      "The idea is that you have the illusion of free will as an
      artifact to be able to get through life," Mazaheri told Live
      Science.<br>
