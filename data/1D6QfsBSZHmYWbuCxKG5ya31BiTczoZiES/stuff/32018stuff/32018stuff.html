          name comes from a Latin word for "standfast". He is a
          mechanical engineering and computer science double major at
          the University of San Diego, interested in sustainable
          technology. He has started a recycling movement in his native
          country of Russia, which became the largest
          electronics-recycling center in Moscow. Upon moving to
          California, he became interested in solving the problem of
          water drought. Konstantin invented a device that could solve
          the pressing issue of the scarcity of pure water. After
          success building a working prototype, he is working on
          implementing an entire system of sustainable and renewable
          water supply systems. As Vice President of an Engineers
          Without Borders chapter, he often travels to third world
          countries to work on engineering projects that benefit people
          living there.</font></font><b><font color="#990000"><font

          to turn sand into soil. Even more exciting – they believe they
          have solved the problem! <br>
          <br>
          Listen to Ole talk us through the concept behind turning
          deserts and sand dunes green. How their technology could
          change the face of the planet, and solve parts of the global
          environmental problem. Presenting the game-changing concept at

          Ole Morten has an extensive background in R&amp;D and is

          actress Brigitte Bardot has spoken out against the state of
          her country, saying that Islamists are "practically
          everywhere" and that France should not resemble Algeria.<br>
          <br>
          Speaking to the French weekly Valeurs Actuelles, Bardot said
          that France is not what it once was. "I have been brought up
          in honor, patriotism, love and respect for my country, and
          when I see what it has become, I feel desperate," she said.<br>
          <br>
          The 83-year-old also said that it is "unacceptable” to see
          burqas become commonplace in France, and Islamists are
          "practically everywhere."<br>
          <br>
          "I did not fight against French Algeria to accept an Algerian
          France, I do not touch the culture, the identity and the
          customs of others, let's not touch mine," Bardot said.<br>
          <br>
          The former actress didn't mince her words when it came to her
          thoughts on the European Union either. "We have to get out of
          it,” she said. Bardot added that she is a supporter of
          right-wing National Front politician Marine Le Pen, who has
          also spoken out against France's membership in the EU. She
          went on to note her affinity for former French Prime Minister
          Francois Fillon, who she described as a "good guy."<br>
          <br>
          Born in 1934, Bardot was one of the best-known sex symbols of
          the 1950s and 1960s. She retired from the entertainment
          industry in 1973, after starring in 47 films. She has
          established herself as an animal rights activist in recent
          years. She recently wrote a book, 'Répliques et Piques,'
          embracing a collection of quotations and aphorisms.</font></font><b><font

      <font color="#990000"><font color="#000000">What you need to know
          about 5G Death Towers: 5G Towers have 300ft spoke copper
          wheels that span out under ground aimed at altering Earth's
          Natural Frequency, working in conjunction with Space Fence
          above at top of sky dome which is a city atop in the Firmament
          (Atlantis) which is run by Tesla Free Energy, while below we
          are charged for electricity. During the Antediluvian Age
          Atlantis ran on a higher frequency level, to which is why 5G
          (5th Age, Age of Aquarius, The Golden Age of Saturn / Satan)
          is being implemented. They are terraforming the planet (plane)
          to accommodate Atlantis and its occupants (Apollyon the
          Destroyer with its accompanying squadron of Demonic filth).
          They are looking to reverse the polarity, which will make
          humanity and animals very sick, to which humanity will be
          seeking alternative medicinal measures to cure their sickness
          caused by 5G radiation. The NWO Beast System will introduce a
          cure, where one can become as gods (Transhumanism). This where
          they will claim sickness as a thing of the pass. Once you
          accept the mark of the beast showing your allegiance to Satan,
          your DNA will change from double strand DNA to that of a
          Triple Helix, turning you into a machine and your
          consciousness uploaded to Satan's One Hive Mind (Sky Net),
          which is housed in Atlantis above in Firmament, thus Satan
          being called the “Prince of the Air’. God dwells in the hearts
          of man not within a machine, hence if you take the mark of the
          beast you will completely severe any relationship you may have
          had with God, thus terminating any chances of Salvation. For
          whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will
          lose his life for Jesus sake shall find it. <br>

      <b><br>
      </b>440hz vs 432 hz - Though it defies all logical explanation, it
      appears that our ancient ancestors living in Sumeria 6,000 years
      ago were “gifted” by “sky-visitors” with certain information that
      could only be verified by present-day technology. #432Hz What is
      this information? It is the explanation of how frequency reveals
      mechanical movements found throughout the universe, how certain
      harmonics contain keys and codes to unlock the very process of
      creation, and how one particular math system reveals the very
      matrix of existence. Is this information new? No it is not. It has
      been laying dormant in our geometry, in our system of keeping
      time, in the way we measure our world, and in certain symbols we
      find all around us but have lost the connection to their true
      meaning. <b><br>

      GOT A SELFIE OUT TO THE INTERNET. This image, which appears black
      was posted as taken in a dark cell by an IBM engineer. The picture
      malfunctioned because the cell was too dark, but a critical piece
      of information was embedded in the Exif data, the coordinates to
      Diego Garcia, where the picture was taken. And it's real, this is
      NOT a hoax. The coordinates in the picture indicate that the photo
      was taken within 3 miles of what Google officially gives for Diego
      Garcia. It is NOT EXACTLY what comes up on Google. It is off a
      couple miles, so NO ONE GOOGLED THIS, thus helping to confirm it's

          transmit secret messages between trees, triggering them to
          share nutrients and water with those in need.</i><i><br>
        </i><br>
        <b>by Sara Burrows</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Like humans, trees are extremely social creatures, utterly
      dependent on each other for their survival. And, as it is with us,
      communication is key.<br>
      <br>
      After scientists discovered pine tree roots could transfer carbon
      to other pine tree roots in a lab, ecology professor Suzanne
      Simard set out to figure out how they did it.<br>
      <br>
      What she discovered was a vast tangled web of hair-like mushroom
      roots — an information super highway allowing trees to communicate
      important messages to other members of their species and related
      species, such that the forest behaves as “a single organism.”<br>
      <br>
      The idea that trees could share information underground was
      controversial. Some of Simard’s colleagues thought she was crazy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Experiment<br>
        <br>
      </b>Having trouble finding research funding, she eventually set
      out to conduct the experiments herself, planting 240 birch, fir
      and cedar trees in a Canadian forest.<br>
      <br>
      She covered the seedlings with plastic bags and filled them with
      various types of carbon gas.<br>
      <br>
      An hour later she took the bags off, ran her Geiger counter over
      their leaves and heard “the most beautiful sound,” she says in the
      Ted Talk embedded below:<br>
      <br>
      “Crrrrr… It was the sound of Birch talking to Fir,” she said.
      “Birch was saying, ‘hey, can I help you? And Fir was saying yeah,
      can you send me some of your carbon? Somebody threw a shade cloth
      over me.”<br>
      <br>
      She also scanned the cedar’s leaves, and as she suspected —
      silence. The cedar was in its own world. It was not connected into
      the fungal web linking birches and firs.<br>
      <br>
      The birch and fir were in a “lively two-way conversation,” Simard
      says<br>
      <br>
      When the fir was shaded by the birch in summer, the birch sent
      more carbon to it. When the birch was leafless in the winter, the
      fir sent more carbon to it.<br>
      <br>
      The two trees were totally interdependent, Simard discovered,
      “like yin and yang.”<br>
      <br>
      That’s when Simard knew she was onto something big… In the past,
      we assumed trees were competing with each other for carbon,
      sunlight, water and nutrients. But Simard’s work showed us trees
      were also cooperators.<br>
      <br>
      They communicate by sending mysterious chemical and hormonal
      signals to each other via the mycelium, to determine which trees
      need more carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon, and which trees
      have some to spare, sending the elements back and forth to each
      other until the entire forest is balanced.<br>
      <br>
      “The web is so dense there can be hundreds of kilometers of
      mycelium under a single foot step,” Simard says.<br>
      <br>
      The mycelium web connects mother trees with baby trees, allowing
      them to feed their young.<br>
      <br>
      A single mother tree can provide nourishment for hundreds of
      smaller trees in the under-story of her branches, she says.<br>
      <br>
      Mother trees even recognize their kin, sending them more mycelium
      and carbon annd reducing their own root size to make room for
      their babies.<br>
      <br>
      This new understanding of tree communication had Simard worried
      about the implications of clear-cutting.<br>
      <br>
      When mother trees are injured or dying, they send their wisdom
      onto the next generation. They can’t do this is if they are all
      wiped out at once.<br>
      <br>
      “You can take out one or two hub trees, but there comes a tipping
      point, if you take out one too many, the whole system collapses,”
      she says.<br>
      <br>
      Often clear-cut forests are replanted with only one or two
      species. “These simplified forests lack complexity making them
      vulnerable to infection and bugs.”<br>
      <br>
      To ensure the survival of the planet’s lungs at a time when they
      are most crucial, Simard suggests four simple solutions to end the
      damage caused by clear cutting :<br>
      <br>
      1. Get out in the forest more — this in and of itself will remind
      us how interdependent we are on this ecosystem.<br>
      2. Save old growth forests as repositories of genes, mother trees
      and mycelium networks.<br>
      3. Where we do cut, save the “legacy” trees so they can pass on
      important information to the next generation.<br>
      4. Regenerate cut patches with diverse native species<br>

      Researchers examining 44 samples of 30 different vaccines found

      animal vaccine.<br>

      “The quantity of foreign bodies detected and, in some cases, their

      “In most circumstances, the combinations detected are very odd as
      they have no technical use, cannot be found in any material
      handbook and look like the result of the random formation
      occurring, for example, when waste is burnt. In any case, whatever

          Fukushima Disaster</b><br>
        <b>By Yoichi Shimatsu</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>One of the anomalies from the Fukushima nuclear disaster is
      that releases of radioactive isotopes throughout the Pacific Basin
      are far greater in quantity than what’s indicated on the ground in
      northeast Japan. Reaching across the western region of North
      America, into the Rockies some 10,000 km distant from Japan, the
      wildlife count of aquatic species, birds and insects has been
      plummeting since March 2011...<br>
      <b>&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;Sea-dumping doomed the Americas<br>
        &nbsp; </b><br>
      ...To spare itself the burden of an effective containment program,
      Japan has been waging a “soft” nuclear war against its Pacific
      neighbors. Over the past seven years, I have suggested that boring
      tunnels into the hard-rock Abukuma Plateau is a proven method for
      water storage, as done under Kanto region rivers in lieu of new
      dams, but the government apparently prefers overseas dumping as a
      type of passive-aggressive vengeance...<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Inexorably, as casualties mount and the economic damage spirals
      out of control, public anger will squarely put the blame not only
      on TEPCO and the deceitful Japanese political elite but also on
      the cowardly sold-out American and Canadian governments. Their
      ultimate responsibility, however, is the direct role of the US and
      Canada in supporting Japan’s rogue nuclear-weapons program, which
      lies at the heart of the 311 disaster(s).<br>
      <b>&nbsp;<br>
        Weapons-grade Plutonium unloosed<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
      </b>On this 7th anniversary of the Fukushima triple disaster, a
      video on Japanese N-weapons production in the Greater Fukushima
      region, produced by French environmental filmmaker Phillippe
      Carillo and myself, based on the disturbing findings from my dozen
      research visits into the 20-30 km nuclear exclusion zone is being
      released here at rense.com. Here the key points are summarized:<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      First, the meltdowns at three civilian reactors and related fires
      at the TEPCO Fukushima No.1 nuclear plant were not the only
      sources of radioactivity releases. As dangerous as it turned out
      to be, including the explosion of the weapons-related mixed-oxide
      (MOX) fuel rods inside the Toshiba-Westinghouse Reactor 3, the
      rate of isotope releases solely from Fukushima plant cannot
      account for the grandeur of scale of contaminated seawater and
      marine-layer moisture that’s been hitting the American shores.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;Second, a much greater amount of highly enriched plutonium
      was released from separate nuclear disasters that occurred at four
      nuclear-warhead production sites:<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;- an underground lab inside the compound of the seaside
      Haramachi coal-fired plant operated by the Tohoku Electric Power
      Company, less than six km north of Fukushima No.1;<br>
      &nbsp;- the TEPCO Thermal (oil-fueled) power plant in Hirono,
      about 4 km south of the Fukushima No.2 nuclear plant in the Iwaki
      district;<br>
      &nbsp;- a yet-uncovered lab or processing center inside the
      Fukushima No.1 compound; and<br>
      &nbsp;- a military nuclear-weapons test site in Kitakami, near its
      namesake mountain range, in Iwate Prefecture, north of Fukushima
      and Miyagi prefectures.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;In addition, steady releases of heavy water have flowed out
      of a suspected tritium-extraction facility inside the hollow
      structure of the Kido Dam, in the hills west of Hirono town.
      According to local residents, there are several other sensitive
      sites in the eastern Abukuma Plateau, making the Greater Fukushima
      nuclear complex one of the largest and the most-advanced warhead
      production site in the world.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It might be noted here, though unmentioned in the video, that the
      military-focused nuclear program will soon be resuming at the Oma
      nuclear plant on the northern tip of Honshu, near the Misawa USAF
      base and within sight of Hakodate, Hokkaido, across the Tsugaru
      Strait. The remote area has no major city in the vicinity for the
      marketing of electricity. One of the ramifications of secret
      weapons development by Japan is that it compels North Korea to
      amass a deterrence capability, and unless the Japanese program is
      officially exposed and dismantled, Northeast Asia will continue to
      be a center of nuclear-weapons confrontation between at least five
      countries...<br>
      <b><br>
        Secret Underground Nuke Labs<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
      </b>Headquartered in neighboring Miyagi Prefecture the Tohoku
      Electric Power Company (a regional utility company unrelated to
      TEPCO) burns North Korean coal at its Haramachi thermal plant.
      Curiously, none of that enormous power supply is delivered to the
      nearby city of Soma or to Miyagi communities across the provincial
      border. All of its 20,000kW output is allocated to the TEPCO
      Fukushima No.1 nuclear plant or used on-site for indeterminate
      purposes. Why does a large-scale conventional power plant have to
      be dedicated to powering a nuclear plant along with its own
      massive energy consumption?<br>
      &nbsp;<b><br>
      </b>This question is the key to unlocking the secret vault of
      nuclear-weapons production. As exposed by my April 2011 interview
      with a parliamentarian who was trained in nuclear engineering, the
      earthquake-caused collapse of the power-transmission line from
      Haramachi resulted in the outage that knocked out the computers
      controlling the Fukushima No.1 facility, the first falling domino
      that led to the meltdowns.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Enormous amounts of continuous power are required for the new
      GE-Hitachi “global laser extraction” system employing
      gasification, electromagnetic charging and laser-separation of
      enriched plutonium from spent fuel rods. This novel process defies
      the traditional view that Pu cannot be separated from the uranium
      content in mixed-oxide rods, thereby enabling vast arsenals of
      hydrogen bombs to now be rapidly produced from nuclear waste from
      civilian power plants. Research and full-on production were being
      conducted in secret at the three secret underground labs:
      Haramachi, Hirono and somewhere underground at the Fukushima No.1
      site...<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Deadly Fallout across Minami-Soma<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
      </b>The Japanese government claimed that the Fukushima nuclear
      disaster took only a single life, the death of a nuclear worker.
      This grotesque deception was perpetrated to prevent an
      international investigation under the nuclear Non-Proliferation
      Treaty (NPT).<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      At least 1,000 nuclear-weapons technicians and Self-Defense Force
      soldiers were killed inside the flooded Haramachi lab with no
      chance of escape or rescue due to the intense nuclear releases.
      Outdoors in the surrounding Minami-Soma district, high
      radioactivity levels forced the pullout of police rescue teams,
      abandoning many thousands of local villagers to die of a
      combination of radioactive fallout and freezing temperatures...<br>
      <b><br>
        J-Village cover-up<br>
      </b><br>
      ...On another bike journey into the surrounding farmlands, I saw
      daisies bigger than my two hands put together and gladiolus stems
      twice my height, indicating genetic mutations causing gigantism
      over many generations.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Despite a massive security presence around the TEPCO oil-fueled
      thermal plant, and being berated once and expelled by
      plainclothesmen with the secret nuclear security force, I managed
      on several occasions into slip into the J-village soccer stadium
      site, where the Fukushima workers were housed. To my astonishment,
      most of the young works coming off-duty told be that their entire
      workforce was assigned to clearing nuclear waste out of the Hirono
      thermal plant, which confirmed the first old-timer’s claim that
      this was a secret nuclear production site, which means of course
      for N-weaponry...<br>

      </div>
      <b><br>
        Introduction<br>
        <br>
      </b>Oxytocin is a hormone released from anterior pituitary gland
      in animals as well as human beings. This hormone is protein in
      nature and it is transported through blood from the site of
      release to the site of action. Physiologically this hormone is
      important for milk let down as it causes contraction of smooth
      muscle cells surrounding the milk producing cells called as
      alveoli and also helpful in birth as it causes contraction of
      smooth muscles of uterus to expel the fetus outside the body of
      the mother.<br>
      <b><br>
        Misuse of oxytocin by farmers<br>
        <br>
      </b>In Pakistan, unfortunately oxytocin is being used blindly by
      farmers living in villages for milk let down in their animals
      without knowing its harmful effects on their animals. Farmers are
      using oxytocin injection before milking almost twice a day in
      cattle and buffaloes for this purpose. The purpose of using
      oxytocin injection in their animals by the farmers is to get more
      milk and hence, to get more profit after selling more milk to
      people but they don’t know its harmful effects on animals. The
      farmers are using oxytocin without the veterinarian’s advice and
      the purchase of oxytocin does not require any prescription and is
      easily available even on a general store of villages. It is widely
      being used in the dairy industry despite there being a ban on its
      sale, except by a prescription from a registered medical
      practitioner.<b><br>
        <br>
        Harmful effects of oxytocin misuse on animals<br>
        <br>
      </b>The use of oxytocin in animals in unethical because the use
      for milk let down is painful to animlas as the action of hormone
      causes the uterus of the cattle to contract, causing immense pain.
      Oxytocin is banned under Section 12 of the Prevention of Cruelty
      to Animals Act (1960), the Food and Consumable Substances
      Adulteration Act and the Drug Control Laws cannot be sold without
      a prescription from a registered medical practitioner. The law
      clearly bans the “introducing (of) any substance into the female
      organ of a milch animal with the object of drawing off from the
      animal any secretion of milk.” However, this drug is mostly used
      on cattle through direct injection.<br>
      <br>
      Not only this drug makes cows barren sooner but also lowers the
      lifespan of the animal, thus causing economic loss to the owner in
      the long run. The frequent use of oxytocin in animals also cause
      decreased birth rate, low quality of milk produced and animals
      culled earlier. Medical experts have pointed out that use of the
      sustained use of drug can cause hormonal imbalance in animals and
      harms the reproductive system of animals, reducing their lifespan.
      Oxytocin use for milk let down also increases the chances of
      mastitis (locally called as saroo) because sustained use for milk
      let down may cause damage to milk synthesizing cells.<b><br>
        <br>
        Humans are at risk<br>
        <br>
      </b>There are many adverse effects on humans due to consmption of
      milk obtained from animals subjected to oxytocin injections.
      Medical experts have pointed out that use of the drug can cause
      hormonal imbalance in humans. Due to hormonal imbalances created
      by exogenous source of hormones like oxytocin in milk and dairy
      products, the age at which girls attain menarche has come down
      drastically from 16 years of age to 10 years of age. Boys have
      been diagnosed with gynaecomastia (breast enlargement). It is very
      harmful for humans who unwittingly are made to consume an
      artificially created hormone. Humans face all the harmful effects
      of this drug. Children are most susceptible to its effects and it
      is known to have caused imbalanced hearing and weak eyesight.
      Common symptoms are exhaustion and loss of energy pregnant women
      should avoid milk that may have been adulterated with oxytocin
      because use of such milk by the pregnant women may lead to
      abortion and babies may born with deformities and low resistance
      levels. Use of such milk also increases the risk of haemorrhage in
      mothers after birth. Individual women may be hypersensitive to
      oxytocin and it can inhibit breastfeeding. Oxytocin seriously
      affects the growth of hormones especially in females because of
      which minor girls attain early puberty. After oxytocin is injected
      into the cow, and the milk produced is consumed immediately by
      pregnant women, then there is the likelihood of abortion but if
      milk is boiled properly prior to use then this can be avoided.<b><br>
        <br>
        Suggestions<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>I really hope you understand this.<br>
      <br>
      It is not a fantasy. It isn’t science fiction. It isn’t satire.<b><br>
        <br>
      </b>It is Brave New World, but not the Huxley novel. It’s
      happening now.<br>
      <br>
      It’s a published study that appears on the website of the
      prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the
      United States of America.<br>
      <br>
      The title of the study is, “Oxytocin-enforced norm compliance
      reduces xenophobic outgroup rejection.” (Reference: Proc Natl Acad
      Sci U S A. 2017 Aug 29;114(35):9314-9319.)<br>
      <br>
      Xenophobia is defined as: “fear or hatred of foreigners, people
      from different cultures, or strangers.” (Dictionary.com)<br>
      <br>
      Oxytocin, the chemical used in this study, is described by Medical
      News Today: “Widely referred to as the love hormone, oxytocin has
      also been dubbed the hug hormone, cuddle chemical, moral molecule,
      and the bliss hormone due to its effects on behavior, including
      its role in love and in female reproductive biological functions
      in reproduction.”<br>
      <br>
      “Oxytocin is a hormone that is made in the brain, in the
      hypothalamus. It is transported to, and secreted by, the pituitary
      gland, which is located at the base of the brain.”<br>
      <br>
      The published study details a successful attempt at chemical mind
      control. The goal is making people more “happy and friendly” about
      mass migration, by changing their hormonal response toward
      migrants.<br>
      <br>
      Nothing in the study cites inherent migration problems, such as
      increased violent crime, back-breaking financial pressure on
      government budgets, and the eroding of local cultures. It’s all
      about shifting feeling and reaction toward waves of immigrants.<br>
      <br>
      Here are extensive quotes from the new study:<br>
      <br>
      “Here we report the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled
      experiment showing that enhanced activity of the oxytocin system
      paired with charitable social cues [programming] can help counter
      the effects of xenophobia by fostering altruism toward refugees.
      These findings suggest that the combination of oxytocin and
      peer-derived altruistic norms [social cues] reduces outgroup
      rejection [toward migrants] even in the most selfish and
      xenophobic individuals, and thereby would be expected to increase
      the ease by which people adapt to rapidly changing social
      ecosystems [mass immigration].”<br>
      <br>
      “…we tested the propensity of 183 Caucasian participants to make
      donations to people in need, half of whom were refugees (outgroup)
      and half of whom were natives (ingroup). Participants scoring low
      on xenophobic attitudes [showing they already accept mass
      immigration] exhibited an altruistic preference for the outgroup,
      which further increased after nasal delivery of the neuropeptide
      oxytocin. In contrast, participants with higher levels of
      xenophobia generally failed to exhibit enhanced altruism toward
      the outgroup. This tendency was only countered by pairing oxytocin
      with peer-derived altruistic norms [social-programming cues],
      resulting in a 74% increase in refugee-directed donations.
      Collectively, these findings reveal the underlying sociobiological
      conditions associated with outgroup-directed altruism by showing
      that charitable social cues co-occurring with enhanced activity of
      the oxytocin system reduce the effects of xenophobia by
      facilitating prosocial behavior toward refugees.”<br>
      <br>
      The truly disturbing and mind-boggling aspect of this study is:
      many people would accept it as a reasonable way to “solve” the
      migrant crisis.<br>
      <br>
      Forget about the actual effects of immigration. They’re
      irrelevant. Instead, focus on re-shaping people’s minds, through
      chemical intervention combined with social programming.<br>
      <br>
      The authors of the mind-control study are basically saying, “If
      you have a problem with mass immigration, the problem has nothing
      to do with facts. It only has to do with your hormone system.
      Basically, you have a deficit of oxytocin.”<br>
      <br>
      I have written many articles about the effects of philosophic
      materialism, including its conclusion that humans are merely
      biological machines and, therefore, can be manipulated at will by
      “those in charge.”<br>
      <br>
      Free will? A delusion. Individual choice? Unacceptable. Humans are
      inherently programmed in every respect, and badly programmed at
      that. The central flaws must be fixed. Humans must be reconfigured
      so they automatically respond to stimuli in new ways. ‘More humane
      ways.’<br>
      <br>
      Lost in this study, as well, are the effects of dosing with
      oxytocin on a person’s overall hormone system. You don’t suddenly
      ramp up one hormone without changing levels of
      others—testosterone, for example. But who cares, when the social
      and political goal must be attained? If men become more passive in
      the process, why not?<br>
      <br>
      Perhaps that notion will be the formation of the next study.
      “Let’s cut testosterone and see what happens. How much of it do we
      need to reduce before men just lie around and play with toys and
      dolls?”<br>
      <br>
      Interestingly enough, the authors of the study never considered
      dosing male immigrants of military age with the oxytocin “love
      hormone.” Heaven forbid. That would be “interfering in their
      culture.”<br>
      <br>
      That’s called a clue.<br>
      <br>
      In Brave New World, Huxley included every kind of programming he
      could imagine: genetically controlled, synthetic, motherless,
      incubator pregnancy and birth, during which extensive mind control
      was applied; consequent separation of classes of humans, relative
      to their assigned work and social relations; elimination of the
      traditional family; erasure of all hostile impulses; societal
      norms constructed to encourage physical pleasure as the highest
      ideal; and a “miracle drug,” Soma, ready at hand to dispel the
      depression and doubt that might somehow creep through and survive
      the massive programming. The “inevitable outcome?” EVERYONE WILL
      BE HAPPY.<br>
      <br>
      In one stage or another, all these strategies are now being pushed
      forward toward a Technocratic future.<br>
      <br>
      With Utopian justice for all.<br>
      <br>
      Again, the proposition on which this lunacy is based is: freedom
      does not exist. It was always an illusion. Humans have never been
      anything more than programmed bio-machines. Therefore, ANY level
      and degree of re-programming is justified.<br>
      <br>
      Objections to this crusade are merely part of the illusion that
      freedom is real.<br>
      <br>
      However, freedom IS real. How individuals view it and what they do
      with it is an entirely different matter. If they see it as nothing
      more than choosing between a vacation in Disney World and Las
      Vegas, choosing between reruns of CSI and Matlock, then Brave New
      World will seem like a minor change.<br>
      <br>
      Conceiving, realizing, and experiencing freedom as a vast space
      and a vast platform for individual action—creative action,
      meaningful action—THAT is a prerequisite for the survival of life
      as we know it.<br>
      <br>
      The life we hold dear.<br>
      <br>
      Who defines “meaningful action?”<br>
      <br>
      You do.<b><br>

        Significance<br>
        <br>
      </b>In the midst of rapid globalization, the peaceful coexistence
      of cultures requires a deeper understanding of the forces that
      compel prosocial behavior and thwart xenophobia. Yet, the
      conditions promoting such outgroup-directed altruism have not been
      determined. Here we report the results of a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled experiment showing that enhanced activity of
      the oxytocin system paired with charitable social cues can help
      counter the effects of xenophobia by fostering altruism toward
      refugees. These findings suggest that the combination of oxytocin
      and peer-derived altruistic norms reduces outgroup rejection even
      in the most selfish and xenophobic individuals, and thereby would
      be expected to increase the ease by which people adapt to rapidly
      changing social ecosystems.<b><br>
        <br>
        Abstract<br>
        <br>
      </b>Never before have individuals had to adapt to social
      environments defined by such magnitudes of ethnic diversity and
      cultural differentiation. However, neurobiological evidence
      informing about strategies to reduce xenophobic sentiment and
      foster altruistic cooperation with outsiders is scarce. In a
      series of experiments settled in the context of the current
      refugee crisis, we tested the propensity of 183 Caucasian
      participants to make donations to people in need, half of whom
      were refugees (outgroup) and half of whom were natives (ingroup).
      Participants scoring low on xenophobic attitudes exhibited an
      altruistic preference for the outgroup, which further increased
      after nasal delivery of the neuropeptide oxytocin. In contrast,
      participants with higher levels of xenophobia generally failed to
      exhibit enhanced altruism toward the outgroup. This tendency was
      only countered by pairing oxytocin with peer-derived altruistic
      norms, resulting in a 74% increase in refugee-directed donations.
      Collectively, these findings reveal the underlying sociobiological
      conditions associated with outgroup-directed altruism by showing
      that charitable social cues co-occurring with enhanced activity of
      the oxytocin system reduce the effects of xenophobia by
      facilitating prosocial behavior toward refugees.<br>

          long-term changes in behavior</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>In a landmark study, researchers at St. Joseph’s Healthcare
      Hamilton and McMaster University have found that providing
      clinical (low) doses of penicillin to pregnant mice and their
      offspring results in long-term behavioural changes.<br>
      <br>
      These changes include elevated levels of aggression and lower
      levels of anxiety, accompanied by characteristic neurochemical
      changes in the brain and an imbalance in their gut microbes.
      Giving these mice a lactobacillus strain of bacteria helped to
      prevent these effects.<br>
      <br>
      The study was published in Nature Communications and was funded by
      the United States Office of Naval Research.<br>
      <br>
      “In this paper, we report that low-dose penicillin taken late in
      pregnancy and in early life of mice offspring, changes behaviour
      and the balance of microbes in the gut. While these studies have
      been performed in mice, they point to popular increasing concerns
      about the long-term effects of antibiotics,” says Dr. John
      Bienenstock, Director of the Brain-Body Institute at St. Joseph’s
      Healthcare Hamilton and Distinguished Professor at McMaster
      University. “Furthermore, our results suggest that a probiotic
      might be effective in preventing the detrimental effects of the
      penicillin.”<br>
      <br>
      Other studies have shown that large doses of broad-spectrum
      antibiotics in adult animals can affect behaviour. But there
      haven’t been previous studies that have tested the effects of
      clinical doses of a commonly-used, narrow-spectrum antibiotic such
      as penicillin on gut bacteria and behaviour.<br>
      <br>
      “There are almost no babies in North America that haven’t received
      a course of antibiotics in their first year of life,” says Dr.
      Bienenstock. “Antibiotics aren’t only prescribed, but they’re also
      found in meat and dairy products. If mothers are passing along the
      effects of these drugs to their as yet unborn children or<br>
      children after birth, this raises further questions about the
      long-term effects of our society’s consumption of antibiotics.”<br>
      <br>
      A previous study in 2014 raised similar concerns after finding
      that giving clinical doses of penicillin to mice in late pregnancy
      and early life led to a state of vulnerability to dietary
      induction of obesity.<br>
      <br>
      The research team will follow up their studies by analyzing the
      effects of penicillin on the offspring, if given only to the
      pregnant mothers. They also plan on investigating the efficacy of
      different types of potentially-beneficial bacteria in protecting
      offspring against the behavioural changes that result from
      antibiotic usage.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Brain mechanisms that give The Iceman
          unusual resistance to cold</b><br>
        <i><b>The findings suggest that his method could be relevant for
            management of some autoimmune and psychiatric disorders</b></i><i><br>
        </i></div>
      <br>
      Dutch adventurer Wim Hof is known as "The Iceman" for good reason.
      Hof established several world records for prolonged resistance to
      cold exposure, an ability he attributes to a self-developed set of
      techniques of breathing and meditation -- known as the Wim Hof
      Method -- that have been covered by the BBC, CNN, National
      Geographic and other global media outlets. Yet, how his brain
      responds during cold exposure and what brain mechanisms may endow
      him with this resistance have not been studied -- until now.<br>
      <br>
      Wayne State University School of Medicine professors Otto Muzik,
      Ph.D., and Vaibhav Diwadkar, Ph.D., changed that. Their
      publication, "Brain Over Body: A study on the willful regulation
      of autonomic function during cold exposure," published in the
      journal NeuroImage, is the first to study how The Iceman's brain
      responds during experimentally controlled whole-body cold
      exposure. These investigations are part of the scientists' series
      of seminal studies launched in 2014 on how the human brain
      responds to thermoregulatory challenges. The results document
      compelling brain processes in The Iceman and present intriguing
      possibilities for how his techniques might exert positive effects
      related to disorders of the immune system and even psychiatry.<br>
      <br>
      Over three days, Muzik and Diwadkar studied Hof's brain and body
      functions using two distinct imaging techniques -- including
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study his brain
      and positron emission tomography (PET) to study his body. During
      the studies, Hof wore a specifically designed whole-body suit the
      researchers could infuse with temperature-controlled water while
      the imaging data were acquired in order to relate changes in his
      biology to cold exposure.<br>
      <br>
      The Iceman's results when compared to a group of healthy
      comparison participants were startling.<br>
      <br>
      Practice of the Wim Hof Method made Hof's skin temperature
      relatively invariant to cold exposure, a finding the researchers
      attributed to his increased sympathetic innervation and glucose
      consumption in intercostal muscle revealed by PET imaging. The
      method appeared to allow him to generate heat that dissipates to
      lung tissue and warms circulating blood in the pulmonary
      capillaries.<br>
      <br>
      "The willful regulation of skin temperature -- and, by
      implication, core body temperature, even when the body is being
      stressed with cold -- is an unusual occurrence and may explain his
      resistance to frostbite," said Muzik, professor of pediatrics, of
      neurology and of radiology.<br>
      <br>
      "From our previous studies, we expected The Iceman to show
      significant brain activations in a region known as the anterior
      insula, where the brain's higher thermoregulatory centers are
      located. However, we observed more substantial differences in an
      area called periaqueductal gray matter, located in the upper
      brainstem. This area is associated with brain mechanisms for the
      control of sensory pain and is thought to implement this control
      through the release of opioids and cannabinoids," Muzik added.<br>
      <br>
      These last set of results are striking -- not only for what they
      reveal about The Iceman, but even more so for the implications of
      the relevance of the Wim Hof Method for behavioral and physical
      health. The researchers hypothesize that by generating a
      stress-induced analgesic response in periaqueductal gray matter,
      the Wim Hof Method may promote the spontaneous release of opioids
      and cannabinoids in the brain. This effect has the potential to
      create a feeling of well-being, mood control and reduced anxiety.<br>
      <br>
      "The practice of the Wim Hof Method may lead to tonic changes in
      autonomous brain mechanisms, a speculation that has implications
      for managing medical conditions ranging from diseases of the
      immune system to more intriguingly psychiatric conditions such as
      mood and anxiety disorders," said Diwadkar, professor of
      psychiatry and behavioral neurosciences. "We are in the process of
      implementing interventional studies that will evaluate these
      questions using behavioral and biological assessments. These
      possibilities are too intriguing to ignore."<br>
      <br>
      "It is not mysterious to imagine that what we practice can change
      our physiology. The goal of our research is to ascertain the
      mechanisms underlying these changes using objective and scientific
      analyses, and to evaluate their relevance for medicine," Muzik
      added.<b><br>

      </b>We report the first characterization study of commercial
      prototype carbon nanotube (CNT) membranes consisting of
      sub–1.27-nm-diameter CNTs traversing a large-area nonporous
      polysulfone film. The membranes show rejection of NaCl and MgSO4
      at higher ionic strengths than have previously been reported in
      CNT membranes, and specific size selectivity for analytes with
      diameters below 1.24 nm. The CNTs used in the membranes were arc
      discharge nanotubes with inner diameters of 0.67 to 1.27 nm. Water
      flow through the membranes was 1000 times higher than predicted by
      Hagen-Poiseuille flow, in agreement with previous CNT membrane
      studies. Ideal gas selectivity was found to deviate significantly
      from that predicted by both viscous and Knudsen flow, suggesting
      that surface diffusion effects may begin to dominate gas
      selectivity at this size scale.<br>

        Abstract</b> -- Direct evidence of complex prebiotic chemistry
      from a water-rich world in the outer solar system is provided by
      the 4.5-billion-year-old halite crystals hosted in the Zag and
      Monahans (1998) meteorites. This study offers the first
      comprehensive organic analysis of the soluble and insoluble
      organic compounds found in the millimeter-sized halite crystals
      containing brine inclusions and sheds light on the nature and
      activity of aqueous fluids on a primitive parent body. Associated
      with these trapped brines are organic compounds exhibiting wide
      chemical variations representing organic precursors,
      intermediates, and reaction products that make up life’s precursor
      molecules such as amino acids. The organic compounds also contain
      a mixture of C-, O-, and N-bearing macromolecular carbon materials
      exhibiting a wide range of structural order, as well as aromatic,
      ketone, imine, and/or imidazole compounds. The enrichment in 15N
      is comparable to the organic matter in pristine Renazzo-type
      carbonaceous chondrites, which reflects the sources of
      interstellar 15N, such as ammonia and amino acids. The amino acid
      content of the Zag halite deviates from the meteorite matrix,
      supporting an exogenic origin of the halite, and therefore, the
      Zag meteorite contains organics synthesized on two distinct parent
      bodies. Our study suggests that the asteroidal parent body where
      the halite precipitated, potentially asteroid 1 Ceres, shows
      evidence for a complex combination of biologically and
      prebiologically relevant molecules.<b><br>

      <div align="center"><b>New Method for Culturing Cheaper Stem Cells</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>A new combination of chemical compounds could lead the way to
      more cost-effective stem cell cultures.<br>
      <br>
      Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can infinitely self-renew and
      develop into all major cell types in the body, making them
      important for organ repair and replacement. But culturing them in
      large quantities can be expensive. Now, scientists at Japan’s
      Kyoto University, with colleagues in India and Iran, have
      developed a more cost-effective culture by using a new combination
      of chemical compounds.<br>
      <br>
      Current culture systems need to contain components that can
      sustain hPSC self-renewal while preventing them from
      differentiating into other cell types. Of these components,
      genetically engineered growth factors produced in bacteria or
      animal cells, are particularly expensive.<br>
      <br>
      The new culture was able to support and maintain the long-term
      renewal of hPSCs without the need for expensive growth factors.<br>
      <br>
      Kouichi Hasegawa of Kyoto University’s Institute for Integrated
      Cell-Material Sciences (iCeMS) and his team developed their ‘AKIT’
      culture using three chemical compounds: 1–azakenpaullone (AK),
      ID-8 (I), and tacrolimus (T).<br>
      <br>
      1–azakenpaullone supported hPSC self-renewal, but also induced
      their differentiation into other cells. To turn off the
      differentiation, the team added ID-8. This compound, however, also
      leads to partial cell growth arrest, so a third compound,
      tacrolimus, was finally added to counter this effect.<br>
      <br>
      The survival and growth rates of some hPSC cell lines were
      slightly lower in the AKIT medium than in other culture media. But
      its key advantage lies in the simplicity and low cost of its
      preparation, which is five to ten times cheaper than any currently
      available hPSC culture medium.<br>
      <br>
      “This improved method of culturing may thus facilitate the
      large-scale, quality-controlled and cost-effective translation of
      hPSC culture practices to clinical and drug-screening
      applications,” say the researchers in their study published in the
      journal Nature Biomedical Engineering. (<br>

          in Plasma</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>A KAIST team identified the basic principle of electric wind
      in plasma. This finding will contribute to developing technology
      in various applications of plasma, including fluid control
      technology.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Wonho Choe from the Department of Physics and his team
      identified the main principle of neutral gas flow in plasma, known
      as ‘electric wind’, in collaboration with Professor Se Youn Moon’s
      team at Chonbuk National University.<br>
      <br>
      Electric wind in plasma is a well-known consequence of
      interactions arising from collisions between charged particles
      (electrons or ions) and neutral particles. It refers to the flow
      of neutral gas that occurs when charged particles accelerate and
      collide with a neutral gas. <br>
      <br>
      This is a way to create air movement without mechanical movement,
      such as fan wings, and it is gaining interest as a next-generation
      technology to replace existing fans. However, there was no
      experimental evidence of the cause.<br>
      <br>
      To identify the cause, the team used atmospheric pressure plasma.
      As a result, the team succeeded in identifying streamer
      propagation and space charge drift from electrohydrodynamic (EHD)
      force in a qualitative manner.<br>
      <br>
      According to the team, streamer propagation has very little effect
      on electric wind, but space charge drift that follows streamer
      propagation and collapse was the main cause of electric wind.<br>
      <br>
      The team also identified that electrons, instead of negatively
      charged ions, were key components of electric wind generation in
      certain plasmas.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, electric wind with the highest speed of 4 m/s was
      created in a helium jet plasma, which is one fourth the speed of a
      typhoon. These results indicate that the study could provide basic
      principles to effectively control the speed of electric wind.<br>

      <div align="center"> &nbsp;<b>Russians Develop Process to Replace
          Chlorine in Water Purification</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Specialists of Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic
      University (SPbPU), participant of the Project 5-100, developed a
      unique equipment for complex water purification which can improve
      or in some cases replace the process of disinfection with
      chlorine.<br>
      <br>
      The developed equipment is an electrolysis unit producing an
      innovative reagent of sodium ferrate. Ani Petkova, chief
      researcher of the Laboratory "Mechatronics" of SPbPU, explained
      that sodium ferrate is capable of decomposing many toxic chemicals
      into low-toxic products, as well as destroying microorganisms,
      providing the disinfectant effect.<br>
      <br>
      According to the researchers of Polytechnic University, unlike
      chlorine, forming harmful residual organochlorine compounds, the
      new reagent does not form toxic substances in the process of water
      purification.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists believe that the use of the developed equipment will
      significantly reduce the cost of the water treatment process. "To
      disinfect 1 liter of drinking water in summer, only 0.5 gram of
      sodium ferrate is required instead of 4.5 gram of chlorine. In the
      cold season, 0.2 gram of ferrate will be needed instead of 2 gram
      of chlorine," calculated Ani Petkova. She added that the necessary
      dose of reagent is reduced approximately to 10 times.<br>
      <br>
      Scientist mentioned the developed equipment can be used both for
      the drinking water preparation and for disinfection of industrial
      and domestic wastewater.<br>
      <br>
      This is one of the most actual area of ferrate usage due to the
      requirement of chlorine absence in most wastewaters. "The water
      drained into natural water reservoirs can't be treated with
      chlorine, as it has a long-term effect and forms toxic compounds
      while interacting with organic matter in rivers and water
      reservoirs. There is no such problem with ferrate, as it reacts
      quickly and decomposes to non-toxic products, which allows
      draining the treated water into natural water reservoirs," Ani
      Petkova noted. Tests conducted by SPbPU scientists also
      demonstrated that ferrate can neutralize chlorine in the water,
      which was already purified.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, specialists of Polytechnic University conducted the
      tests at the landfill of hazardous wastes "Krasny Bor" (Leningrad
      region) . The results showed that sodium ferrate is able to cope
      with serious contaminants such as oil products and their
      derivatives, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur-containing substances,
      cyanides, ammonia, heavy metals and other pollutants in industrial
      wastewater and reservoirs.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists believe that the equipment can be useful for the
      countries with a developed sewage system, as well as regions
      requiring local treatment of drinking and wastewater. "It seems
      that China may be interested in such development. Chinese experts
      are actively engaged in research of disinfecting properties of
      sodium ferrate," said Ani Petkova. "The reason is periodic
      unpleasant odor in the coastal areas, where salt water is actively
      used for domestic purposes. It enters the drains and causes the
      release of sulfur-containing substances. The use of sodium ferrate
      can possibly solve this problem," the scientist added.<br>
      <br>
      She also noted that the reagent can be useful in emergency
      situations. "In such cases, when certain groups of the population
      temporarily have no source of drinking water, and water from
      natural sources should be previously disinfected. For such
      situations, a mobile unit can be developed that produces a ferrate
      at the site where this group of people is located," the researcher
      added.<br>
      <br>
      Polytechnic University is a participant in the Academic Excellence
      Project (Project 5-100). Within the framework of Project 5-100,
      multidisciplinary polytechnical knowledge is created,
      science-intensive and advanced production technologies at the
      world level. The University actively develops conceptual solutions
      for the organization of business processes of the entire life
      cycle of the product in modern industries, radically increasing

      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>
      <div align="center"><i>To build more aerodynamic machines,
          researchers are drawing inspiration from an unlikely source:
          the ocean.</i><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>A team of evolutionary biologists and engineers at Harvard
      University, in collaboration with colleagues from the University
      of South Carolina, have shed light on a decades-old mystery about
      sharkskin and, in the process, demonstrated a new, bioinspired
      structure that could improve the aerodynamic performance of
      planes, wind turbines, drones and cars...<br>
      <br>
      “The skin of sharks is covered by thousands and thousands of small
      scales, or denticles, which vary in shape and size around the
      body,” said George Lauder, the Henry Bryant Bigelow Professor of
      Ichthyology and Professor of Biology in the Department of
      Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, and co-author of the
      research. “We know a lot about the structure of these denticles —
      which are very similar to human teeth — but the function has been
      debated.”<br>
      <br>
      Most research has focused on the drag reducing properties of
      denticles but Lauder and his team wondered if there was more to
      the story.<br>
      <br>
      “We asked, what if instead of mainly reducing drag, these
      particular shapes were actually better suited for increasing
      lift,” said Mehdi Saadat, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard and
      co-first author of the study. Saadat holds a joint appointment in
      Mechanical Engineering at the University of South Carolina. <br>
      <br>
      To help test that hypothesis, the researchers collaborated with a
      team of engineers from the Harvard John A. Paulson School of
      Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). For inspiration, they
      turned to the shortfin mako, the fastest shark in the world. The
      mako’s denticles have three raised ridges, like a trident. Using
      micro-CT scanning, the team imaged and modeled the denticles in
      three dimensions. Next, they 3-D printed the shapes on the surface
      of a wing with a curved aerodynamic cross-section, known as an
      airfoil.<br>
      <br>
      “Airfoils are a primary component of all aerial devices,” said
      August Domel, a Ph.D. student at Harvard and co-first author of
      the paper. “We wanted to test these structures on airfoils as a
      way of measuring their effect on lift and drag for applications in
      the design of various aerial devices such as drones, airplanes,
      and wind turbines.”<br>
      <br>
      The researchers tested 20 different configurations of denticle
      sizes, rows and row positions on airfoils inside a water flow
      tank. They found that in addition to reducing drag, the
      denticle-shaped structures significantly increased lift, acting as
      high-powered, low-profile vortex generators...<br>

          That Cause Cavities and Gum Disease</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Evidence suggests that sipping wine may be good for your colon
      and heart, possibly because of the beverage's abundant and
      structurally diverse polyphenols. Now researchers report in ACS'
      Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry that wine polyphenols
      might also be good for your oral health.<br>
      <br>
      Traditionally, some health benefits of polyphenols have been
      attributed to the fact that these compounds are antioxidants,
      meaning they likely protect the body from harm caused by free
      radicals. However, recent work indicates polyphenols might also
      promote health by actively interacting with bacteria in the gut.
      That makes sense because plants and fruits produce polyphenols to
      ward off infection by harmful bacteria and other pathogens. M.
      Victoria Moreno-Arribas and colleagues wanted to know whether wine
      and grape polyphenols would also protect teeth and gums, and how
      this could work on a molecular level.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers checked out the effect of two red wine
      polyphenols, as well as commercially available grape seed and red
      wine extracts, on bacteria that stick to teeth and gums and cause
      dental plaque, cavities and periodontal disease. Working with
      cells that model gum tissue, they found that the two wine
      polyphenols in isolation -- caffeic and p-coumaric acids -- were
      generally better than the total wine extracts at cutting back on
      the bacteria's ability to stick to the cells. When combined with
      the Streptococcus dentisani, which is believed to be an oral
      probiotic, the polyphenols were even better at fending off the
      pathogenic bacteria. The researchers also showed that metabolites
      formed when digestion of the polyphenols begins in the mouth might
      be responsible for some of these effects.<br>

      Several benefits have been described for red wine polyphenols and
      probiotic strains in the promotion of colonic metabolism and
      health. On the contrary, knowledge about their role in the
      management of oral health is still scarce. In this work, the
      antiadhesive capacity of selected red wine polyphenols and
      oenological extracts against the oral pathogens Porphyromonas
      gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus mutans in
      an in vitro model of human gingival fibroblasts has been explored
      as well as their complementary action with the candidate oral
      probiotic Streptococcus dentisani. Results highlighted the
      antiadhesive capacity of caffeic and p-coumaric acids as well as
      grape seed and red wine oenological extracts. Both, caffeic and
      p-coumaric acids increased their inhibition potential against S.
      mutans adhesion when combined with S. dentisani. Additionally,
      UHPLC–MS/MS analysis demonstrated the oral metabolism of wine

      Windows recovery CDs tells RT <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Recycling advocate Eric Lundgren, who was sentenced to 15
      months in prison for making free Windows recovery discs, told RT
      that he will use his appeal to continue fighting against planned
      obsolescence by Microsoft and others.<br>
      <br>
      “I was very, very shocked when I was given a prison sentence for
      extending the lifecycle of electronics, practicing recycling and
      trying to empower people,” Lundgren said of the one year and three
      months conviction handed to him by a Florida court earlier in
      February.<br>
      <br>
      Lundgren was found guilty of “conspiracy and copyright
      infringement” after burning 28,000 copies of recovery discs for
      Windows back in 2016, despite the fact that the CDs, which had
      absolutely no retail value, were seized by the authorities. He was
      also slapped with a $50,000 fine but luckily avoided repaying
      $420,000 that Microsoft sought in restitution for lost sales.<br>

        COSMETIC COMPOSITION CONTAINING NATURAL FULLERENE AND METHOD FOR
        MANUFACTURING THE SAME<br>
        <br>
      </b>The present invention relates to a cosmetic composition, which
      contains a natural fullerene, and a method for manufacturing same.
      The present invention provides a cosmetic composition containing a
      natural fullerene, which is extracted from a shungite mineral. In
      addition, the present invention comprises: a process of preparing
      a natural fullerene; and a process of mixing the natural fullerene
      with a base of a cosmetic composition. The process of preparing a
      natural fullerene comprises: a first step of pulverizing a
      shungite mineral containing a carbon component; a second step of
      extracting and separating a carbon component from the pulverized
      shungite mineral; and a third step of heat-treating the separated
      carbon component at a temperature of 850 to 3,000°C in a boron
      atmosphere. According to the present invention, a natural
      fullerene is extracted from a shungite mineral with a high
      extraction rate, with a less ash component, and with a hollow
      structure (porosity) to the maximum extent possible. Accordingly,
      the present invention has strong anti-oxidant and bactericidal
      properties and simultaneously, is capable of reducing an activity
      of active oxygen and melanin, and has the effects of anti-aging,
      anti-wrinkle, atopic treatment and prevention and wound healing as
      well as a high productivity and an economic efficiency...<b><br>
        <br>
      </b>Regarding the production of fullerene as described above,
      fullerene is generally synthesized and produced artificially by
      arc discharge or continuous combustion, using carbon black or
      graphite as a raw material. However, such an artificial synthesis
      method has a problem that the cost of the fullerene itself is very
      high and the productivity is low because of the cost of the raw
      material such as carbon black or complicated production process.<br>
      <br>
      Further, in the production of fullerene, there is a method of
      extracting and producing from natural minerals. Most natural
      minerals (ores) that exist in the natural world contain carbon
      components in addition to inorganic substances such as silicon
      compounds (silicon compounds such as silicates). And some natural
      minerals contain fullerenes or similar fullerenes of similar
      structure. A method of extracting and producing fullerene from
      such natural minerals by using an electrochemical method and a
      polar solvent extraction method has been attempted. For example,
      Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 7-315987 discloses a
      method for producing carbon thin film by extracting fullerene from
      clay minerals.<br>
      <br>
      However, the conventional electrochemical method and polar solvent
      extraction method have a problem that the hollow structure of
      fullerene is destroyed. As a result, the physical and chemical
      properties derived from the hollow structure of fullerene are
      poor.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the conventional method has a problem that the
      extraction efficiency of the carbon component (fullerene)
      contained in natural minerals is low, resulting in poor
      productivity and economical efficiency. Particularly, in order to
      maximize the characteristics of fullerene, a hollow structure
      (porosity), which is a structural characteristic of fullerene
      itself, must be maximally ensured and, at the same time,
      impurities such as ash components must be minimized. .<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, it is somewhat difficult to apply fullerene prepared
      by a conventional method to a cosmetic composition. That is, the
      artificial fullerene synthesized from carbon black or graphite as
      a raw material has a very high unit cost as described above, which
      increases the price of cosmetics when applied to a cosmetic
      composition. Natural fullerene prepared by an electrochemical
      method and a polar solvent extraction method has a poor hollow
      structure (porosity) and many impurities such as ash components.
      Accordingly, there is a problem in that when applied to a cosmetic
      composition, antioxidative properties, bactericidal properties,
      and carrier functions, which are derived from the specific
      structure of fullerene, are poor.<br>

      </b>Specifically, the present invention extracts natural
      fullerenes from specific minerals, has a high extraction ratio,
      few ash components, has a maximum hollow structure (porosity),
      exhibits excellent antioxidative, bactericidal and carrier

      placed after heated debate generated by research published by a

      had produced a strain of H5N1 which was able to go airborne, thus
      greatly enhancing its ability to spread. Fouchier focused on the
      transmission of the disease among ferrets, which are the lab

      <div align="center"><b>Wine Polyphenols Could Fend Off Bacteria
          That Cause Cavities and Gum Disease</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Evidence suggests that sipping wine may be good for your colon
      and heart, possibly because of the beverage's abundant and
      structurally diverse polyphenols. Now researchers report in ACS'
      Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry that wine polyphenols
      might also be good for your oral health.<br>
      <br>
      Traditionally, some health benefits of polyphenols have been
      attributed to the fact that these compounds are antioxidants,
      meaning they likely protect the body from harm caused by free
      radicals. However, recent work indicates polyphenols might also
      promote health by actively interacting with bacteria in the gut.
      That makes sense because plants and fruits produce polyphenols to
      ward off infection by harmful bacteria and other pathogens. M.
      Victoria Moreno-Arribas and colleagues wanted to know whether wine
      and grape polyphenols would also protect teeth and gums, and how
      this could work on a molecular level.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers checked out the effect of two red wine
      polyphenols, as well as commercially available grape seed and red
      wine extracts, on bacteria that stick to teeth and gums and cause
      dental plaque, cavities and periodontal disease. Working with
      cells that model gum tissue, they found that the two wine
      polyphenols in isolation -- caffeic and p-coumaric acids -- were
      generally better than the total wine extracts at cutting back on
      the bacteria's ability to stick to the cells. When combined with
      the Streptococcus dentisani, which is believed to be an oral
      probiotic, the polyphenols were even better at fending off the
      pathogenic bacteria. The researchers also showed that metabolites
      formed when digestion of the polyphenols begins in the mouth might
      be responsible for some of these effects.<b><br>

      Several benefits have been described for red wine polyphenols and
      probiotic strains in the promotion of colonic metabolism and
      health. On the contrary, knowledge about their role in the
      management of oral health is still scarce. In this work, the
      antiadhesive capacity of selected red wine polyphenols and
      oenological extracts against the oral pathogens Porphyromonas
      gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus mutans in
      an in vitro model of human gingival fibroblasts has been explored
      as well as their complementary action with the candidate oral
      probiotic Streptococcus dentisani. Results highlighted the
      antiadhesive capacity of caffeic and p-coumaric acids as well as
      grape seed and red wine oenological extracts. Both, caffeic and
      p-coumaric acids increased their inhibition potential against S.
      mutans adhesion when combined with S. dentisani. Additionally,
      UHPLC–MS/MS analysis demonstrated the oral metabolism of wine
      phenolics due to both, cellular and bacterial activity.<b><br>

          disease</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The CDC pledges “To base all public health decisions on the
      highest quality scientific data, openly and objectively derived.”
      But Peter Doshi argues that in the case of influenza vaccinations
      and their marketing, this is not so.<br>
      <br>
      Promotion of influenza vaccines is one of the most visible and
      aggressive public health policies today. Twenty years ago, in
      1990, 32 million doses of influenza vaccine were available in the
      United States. Today around 135 million doses of influenza vaccine
      annually enter the US market, with vaccinations administered in
      drug stores, supermarkets—even some drive-throughs. This enormous
      growth has not been fueled by popular demand but instead by a
      public health campaign that delivers a straightforward,
      who-in-their-right-mind-could-possibly-disagree message: influenza
      is a serious disease, we are all at risk of complications from
      influenza, the flu shot is virtually risk free, and vaccination
      saves lives. Through this lens, the lack of influenza vaccine
      availability for all 315 million US citizens seems to border on
      the unethical. Yet across the country, mandatory influenza
      vaccination policies have cropped up, particularly in healthcare
      facilities,1 precisely because not everyone wants the vaccination,
      and compulsion appears the only way to achieve high vaccination
      rates.2 Closer examination of influenza vaccine policies shows
      that although proponents employ the rhetoric of science, the
      studies underlying the policy are often of low quality, and do not
      substantiate officials’ claims. The vaccine might be less
      beneficial and less safe than has been claimed, and the threat of
      influenza appears overstated.<br>
      Now we are all “at risk” of serious complications...<br>

      A process is provided for the recovery of useful products,
      including fertilizers and nutritional supplements, from the
      organic matter and minerals contained in seawater and other
      brines. The dissolved organic carbon-based chemicals and suspended
      particulate carbon-based organic matter are co-precipitated
      together with the contained magnesium and/or calcium, along with
      incidental trace minerals, entrained water and water of hydration.
      Caustic soda (NaOH) and other alkali base or alkaline earth bases
      and/or carbon dioxide (CO2) are added to the brine until pH of
      10.75 to 11.0 is achieved. The settled or non-dry filtered or
      centrifuged precipitate is utilized as a slurry and the
      supernatant brine is discarded.<br>

      <b>Summary</b><br>
      <br>
      Restoring adult stem cell function provides an exciting approach
      for rejuvenating the aging brain. However, molecular mechanisms
      mediating neurogenic rejuvenation remain elusive. Here we report
      that the enzyme ten eleven translocation methylcytosine
      dioxygenase 2 (Tet2), which catalyzes the production of
      5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), rescues age-related decline in
      adult neurogenesis and enhances cognition in mice. We detected a
      decrease in Tet2 expression and 5hmC levels in the aged
      hippocampus associated with adult neurogenesis. Mimicking an aged
      condition in young adults by abrogating Tet2 expression within the
      hippocampal neurogenic niche, or adult neural stem cells,
      decreased neurogenesis and impaired learning and memory. In a
      heterochronic parabiosis rejuvenation model, hippocampal Tet2
      expression was restored. Overexpressing Tet2 in the hippocampal
      neurogenic niche of mature adults increased 5hmC associated with
      neurogenic processes, offset the precipitous age-related decline
      in neurogenesis, and enhanced learning and memory. Our data
      identify Tet2 as a key molecular mediator of neurogenic
      rejuvenation.<br>

      In his discussion with Cathy Newman on Channel 4, clinical
      psychologist Jordan Peterson showed that there is no difference
      between men and women in intelligence. However, Muhammad claimed
      that women are far less intelligent than men. Do intelligence
      tests thus prove that Muhammad's claims were false? David Wood
      discusses the issue.<br>
