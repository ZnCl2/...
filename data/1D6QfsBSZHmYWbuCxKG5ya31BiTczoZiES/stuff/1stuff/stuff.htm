      <div align="center"><big><b>Spinning CDs to clean sewage water</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      Audio CDs, all the rage in the '90s, seem increasingly obsolete in
      a world of MP3 files and iPods, leaving many music lovers with the
      question of what to do with their extensive compact disk
      collections.<br>
      While you could turn your old disks into a work of avant-garde
      art, researchers in Taiwan have come up with a more practical
      application: breaking down sewage. The team will present its new
      wastewater treatment device at the Optical Society's (OSA) Annual
      Meeting, Frontiers in Optics
      &lt;http://www.frontiersinoptics.com&gt; (FiO) 2013, being held
      Oct. 6-10 in Orlando, Fla.<br>
      <br>
      "Optical disks are cheap, readily available, and very commonly
      used," says Din Ping Tsai, a physicist at National Taiwan
      University. Close to 20 billion disks are already manufactured
      annually, the researchers note, so using old disks for water
      treatment might even be a way to cut down on waste.<br>
      <br>
      Tsai and his colleagues from National Taiwan University, National
      Applied Research Laboratories in Taiwan, and the Research Center
      for Applied Sciences in Taiwan used the large surface area of
      optical disks as a platform to grow tiny, upright zinc oxide
      nanorods about a thousandth the width of a human hair. Zinc oxide
      is an inexpensive semiconductor that can function as a
      photocatalyst, breaking apart organic molecules like the
      pollutants in sewage when illuminated with UV light.<br>
      <br>
      While other researchers have experimented with using zinc oxide to
      degrade organic pollutants, Tsai's team is the first to grow the
      photocatalyst on an optical disk.<br>
      <br>
      Because the disks are durable and able to spin quickly,
      contaminated water that drips onto the device spreads out in a
      thin film that light can&nbsp; easily pass through, speeding up
      the degradation process.<br>
      <br>
      The Taiwanese team's complete wastewater treatment device is
      approximately one cubic foot in volume. In addition to the zinc
      oxide-coated optical disk, the device consists of a UV light
      source and a system that recirculates the water to further break
      down the pollutants.<br>
      <br>
      The research team tested the reactor with a solution of methyl
      orange dye, a model organic compound often used to evaluate the
      speed of photocatalytic reactions. After treating a half-liter
      solution of dye for 60 minutes, they found that over 95 percent of
      the contaminants had been broken down. The device can treat 150 mL
      of waste water per minute, the researchers say.<br>
      <br>
      The spinning disk reactor is small, consumes little power, and
      processes contaminated water more efficiently than other
      photocatalytic wastewater treatment methods, Tsai says. The device
      could be used on a small scale to clean water contaminated with
      domestic sewage, urban run-off, industrial effluents, and farm
      waste.<br>
      <br>
      Going forward, the team is also working on ways to increase the
      efficiency of the reactor, and Tsai estimates that the system
      could soon be improved to work even faster, perhaps by creating
      layers of stacked<br>
      disks.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      <i>A new alloy with unique properties can convert heat directly
        into electricity, according to researchers at the University of
        Minnesota. The&nbsp; alloy, a multiferroic composite of nickel,
        cobalt, manganese and tin, can be either non-magnetic and highly
        magnetic, depending on its temperature.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      The new alloy — Ni45Co5Mn40Sn10 — undergoes a reversible phase
      transformation, in which one type of solid turns into another type
      of solid when the temperature changes, according to a news release
      from the University of Minnesota.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, the alloy goes from being non-magnetic to highly
      magnetized. The temperature only needs to be raised a small amount
      for this to happen.<br>
      <br>
      When the warmed alloy is placed near a permanent magnet, like a
      rare-earth magnet, the alloy's magnetic force increases suddenly
      and dramatically. <br>
      <br>
      This produces a current in a surrounding coil, according to the
      researchers, led by aerospace engineering professor Richard James.
      Watch a piece of the alloy leap over to a permanent magnet in the
      video clip below.<br>
      <br>
      A process called hysteresis causes some of the heat energy to be
      lost, but this new alloy has a low hysteresis, the researchers
      say. Because of this, it could be used to convert waste heat
      energy into large amounts of electricity.<br>
      <br>
      One obvious use for this material would be in the exhaust pipes of
      vehicles. Several automakers are already working on heat transfer
      devices that can convert a car's hot exhaust into usable
      electricity; General <br>
      <br>
      Motors is using alloys called skutterudites, which are
      cobalt-arsenide materials doped with rare earths.<br>
      <br>
      In the lab, University of Minnesota researchers show how a new
      multiferroic material they created begins as a non-magnetic
      material then suddenly becomes strongly magnetic as the piece of
      copper below is heated a small amount.<br>
      <br>
      When this happens, it jumps over to a permanent magnet. This
      demonstration represents the direct conversion of heat to kinetic
      energy.<br>

      batteries, so heat-capture devices made of the new multiferroic
      compound could be placed near the magnets.<br>
      <br>
      The material could also be used in power plants or even ocean
      thermal energy generators, the researchers said.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      University of Minnesota engineering researchers in the College of
      Science and Engineering have recently discovered a new alloy
      material that converts heat directly into electricity. This
      revolutionary energy&nbsp; conversion method is in the early
      stages of development, but it could have wide-sweeping impact on
      creating environmentally friendly electricity from waste heat
      sources.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers say the material could potentially be used to capture
      waste heat from a car's exhaust that would heat the material and
      produce electricity for charging the battery in a hybrid car.
      Other possible future uses include capturing rejected heat from
      industrial and power plants or temperature differences in the
      ocean to create electricity. The research team is looking into
      possible commercialization of the technology.<br>
      <br>
      "This research is very promising because it presents an entirely
      new method for energy conversion that's never been done before,"
      said University of Minnesota aerospace engineering and mechanics
      professor&nbsp; Richard James, who led the research team."It's
      also the ultimate 'green' way to create electricity because it
      uses waste heat to create electricity with no carbon dioxide."<br>
      <br>
      To create the material, the research team combined elements at the
      atomic level to create a new multiferroic alloy, Ni45Co5Mn40Sn10.
      Multiferroic materials combine unusual elastic, magnetic and
      electric properties. The alloy Ni45Co5Mn40Sn10 achieves
      multiferroism by undergoing a highly reversible phase
      transformation where one solid turns into another solid. <br>
      <br>
      During this phase transformation the alloy undergoes changes in
      its magnetic properties that are exploited in the energy
      conversion device.<br>
      <br>
      During a small-scale demonstration in a University of Minnesota
      lab, the new material created by the researchers begins as a
      non-magnetic material, then suddenly becomes strongly magnetic
      when the temperature is raised a small amount. When this happens,
      the material absorbs heat and spontaneously produces electricity
      in a surrounding coil. Some of this heat energy is lost in a
      process called hysteresis. A critical discovery of the team is a
      systematic way to minimize hysteresis in phase transformations.
      The team's research was recently published in the first issue of
      the new scientific journal Advanced Energy Materials.<br>
      <br>

      magnetic when heated: http://z.umn.edu/conversionvideo.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to Professor James, other members of the research team
      include University of Minnesota aerospace engineering and
      mechanics post-doctoral researchers Vijay Srivastava and Kanwal
      Bhatti, and Ph.D. student Yintao Song. The team is also working
      with University of Minnesota chemical engineering and materials
      science professor Christopher Leighton to create a thin film of
      the material that could be used, for example, to convert some of
      the waste heat from computers into electricity.<br>
      <br>
      "This research crosses all boundaries of science and engineering,"
      James said. "It includes engineering, physics, materials,
      chemistry, mathematics and more. It has required all of us within
      the university's College of Science and Engineering to work
      together to think in new ways."<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We demonstrate a new method for the direct conversion of heat to
      electricity using the recently discovered multiferroic alloy,
      Ni45Co5Mn40Sn101. This alloy undergoes a low hysteresis,
      reversible martensitic phase transformation from a nonmagnetic
      martensite phase to a strongly ferromagnetic austenite phase upon
      heating. When biased by a suitably placed permanent magnet,
      heating through the phase transformation causes a sudden increase
      of the magnetic moment to a large value. As a consequence of
      Faraday’s law of induction, this drives a current in a surrounding
      circuit. Theory predicts that under optimal conditions the
      performance compares favorably with the best thermoelectrics.
      Because of the low hysteresis of the alloy, a promising area of
      application of this concept appears to be energy conversion at
      small ?T, suggesting a possible route to the conversion of the
      vast amounts of energy stored on earth at small temperature
      difference. We postulate other new methods for the direct
      conversion of heat to electricity suggested by the underlying
      theory.<br>

      It is possible to create steam within seconds by focusing sunlight
      on nanoparticles mixed into water, according to new research.<br>
      <br>
      That observation, reported Monday by scientists at Rice University
      in Texas, suggests myriad applications in places that lack
      electricity or burnable fuels. A sun-powered boiler could
      desalinate sea water, distill alcohol, sterilize medical equipment
      and perform other useful tasks.<br>
      <br>
      “We can build a portable, compact steam generator that depends
      only on sunlight for input. It is something that could really be
      good in remote or resource-limited locations,” said Naomi J.
      Halas, an engineer and physicist at Rice who ran the experiment.<br>
      <br>
      Whether the rig she and her colleagues describe would work on an
      industrial scale is unknown. If it does, it could mark an advance
      for solar-powered energy more generally.<br>
      <br>
      “We will see how far it can ultimately go. There are certainly
      places and situations where it would be valuable to generate
      steam,” said Paul S. Weiss, editor of the American Chemical
      Society’s journal ACS Nano, which published the paper online in
      advance of the journal’s December print publication.<br>
      <br>
      The experiment is more evidence that nanoscale devices — in this
      case, beads one-tenth the diameter of a human hair — behave in
      ways different from bigger objects.<br>
      <br>
      In the apparatus designed by the Rice team, steam forms in a
      vessel of water long before the water becomes warm to the touch.
      It is, in effect, possible to turn a container of water into steam
      before it gets hot enough to boil.<br>
      <br>
      “There is a disconnect between what happens when we heat a pot of
      water and what happens when we put nanoparticles in that water,”
      said Weiss, who is a chemist and director of the California
      Nanosystems Institute at UCLA.<br>
      <br>
      “This is a novel proposed application of nanoparticles,” said A.
      Paul Alivisatos, director of the Lawrence Berkeley National
      Laboratory and a nanotechnology expert. “I think it is very
      interesting and will stimulate a lot of others to think about the
      heating of water with sunlight.”<br>
      <br>
      In the Rice experiment, the researchers stirred a small amount of
      nanoparticles into water and put the mixture into a glass vessel.
      They then focused sunlight on the mixture with a lens.<br>
      <br>
      The nanoparticles — either carbon or gold-coated silicon dioxide
      beads — have a diameter shorter than the wavelength of visible
      light. That allows them to absorb most of a wave of light’s
      energy. If they had been larger, the particles would have
      scattered much of the light.<br>
      <br>
      In the focused light, a nanoparticle rapidly becomes hot enough to
      vaporize the layer of water around it. It then becomes enveloped
      in a bubble of steam. That, in turn, insulates it from the mass of
      water that, an instant before the steam formed, was bathing and
      cooling it.<br>
      <br>
      Insulated in that fashion, the particle heats up further and forms
      more steam. It eventually becomes buoyant enough to rise. As it
      floats toward the surface, it hits and merges with other bubbles.
      At the surface, the nanoparticles-in-bubbles release their steam
      into the air. They then sink back toward the bottom of the vessel.
      When they encounter the focused light, the process begins again.
      All of this occurs within seconds.<br>
      <br>
      In all, about 80 percent of the light energy a nanoparticle
      absorbs goes into making steam, and only 20 percent is “lost” in
      heating the water. <br>
      <br>
      This is far different from creating steam in a tea kettle. There,
      all the water must reach boiling temperature before an appreciable
      number of water molecules fly into the air as steam.<br>
      <br>
      The phenomenon is such that it is possible to put the vessel
      containing the water-and-nanoparticle soup into an ice bath, focus
      light on it and make steam.<br>
      <br>
      “It shows you could make steam in an arctic environment,” Halas
      said. “There might be some interesting applications there.”<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus can also separate mixtures of water and other
      substances into their components — the process known as
      distillation — more completely than is usually possible. For
      example, with normal distillation of a water-and-alcohol mixture,
      it isn’t possible to get more than 95 percent pure alcohol. Using
      nanoparticles to create the steam, 99 percent alcohol can be
      collected.<br>
      <br>
      Halas said the nanoparticles are not expensive to make and,
      because they act essentially as catalysts, are not used up. A
      nanoparticle steam generator could be used over and over. And, as
      James Watt and other 18th-century inventors showed, if you can
      generate steam easily, you can create an industrial revolution.<br>
      <br>
      The research is being funded in part by the Bill &amp; Melinda
      Gates Foundation in the hope it might prove useful to developing
      countries. <br>
      <br>
      Halas and her team recently spent three days in Seattle
      demonstrating the apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      “Luckily,” she said, “it was sunny.”<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Injecting Life-Saving Oxygen Into a Vein</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>June 27, 2012 — Patients unable to breathe because of acute
      lung failure or an obstructed airway need another way to get
      oxygen to their blood -- and fast -- to avoid cardiac arrest and
      brain injury. A team led by <br>
      researchers at Boston Children's Hospital has designed tiny,
      gas-filled microparticles that can be injected directly into the
      bloodstream to quickly oxygenate the blood.<br>
      <br>
      The microparticles consist of a single layer of lipids (fatty
      molecules) that surround a tiny pocket of oxygen gas, and are
      delivered in a liquid solution. In a cover article in the June 27
      issue of Science Translational <br>
      Medicine, John Kheir, MD, of the Department of Cardiology at
      Boston Children's Hospital, and colleagues report that an infusion
      of these microparticles into animals with low blood oxygen levels
      restored blood oxygen saturation to near-normal levels, within
      seconds.<br>
      <br>
      When the trachea was completely blocked -- a more dangerous "real
      world" scenario -- the infusion kept the animals alive for 15
      minutes without a single breath, and reduced the incidence of
      cardiac arrest and organ <br>
      injury.<br>
      <br>
      The microparticle solutions are portable and could stabilize
      patients in emergency situations, buying time for paramedics,
      emergency clinicians or intensive care clinicians to more safely
      place a breathing tube or perform other life-saving therapies,
      says Kheir.<br>
      <br>
      "This is a short-term oxygen substitute -- a way to safely inject
      oxygen gas to support patients during a critical few minutes," he
      says. <br>
      <br>
      "Eventually, this could be stored in syringes on every code cart
      in a hospital, ambulance or transport helicopter to help stabilize
      patients who are having difficulty breathing."<br>
      <br>
      The microparticles would likely only be administered for a short
      time, between 15 and 30 minutes, because they are carried in fluid
      that would overload the blood if used for longer periods, Kheir
      says.<br>
      <br>
      Kheir also notes that the particles are different from blood
      substitutes, which carry oxygen but are not useful when the lungs
      are unable to oxygenate them. Instead, the microparticles are
      designed for situations in which the lungs are completely
      incapacitated.<br>
      <br>
      Kheir began investigating the idea of injectable oxygen in 2006,
      after caring for a little girl who sustained a severe brain injury
      resulting from a severe pneumonia that caused bleeding into her
      lungs and severely low oxygen levels. Despite the team's best
      efforts, she died before they could place her on a heart-lung
      machine. Frustrated by this, Kheir formed a team to search for
      another way to deliver oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      "Some of the most convincing experiments were the early ones," he
      says. "We drew each other's blood, mixed it in a test tube with
      the microparticles, and watched blue blood turn immediately red,
      right before our eyes."<br>
      <br>
      Over the years, Kheir and his team have tested various
      concentrations and sizes of the microparticles to optimize their
      effectiveness and to make them safe for injection. "The effort was
      truly multidisciplinary," says Kheir. "It took chemical engineers,
      particle scientists and medical doctors to get the mix just
      right."<br>
      <br>
      In the studies reported in the paper, they used a device called a
      sonicator, which uses high-intensity sound waves to mix the oxygen
      and lipids together. The process traps oxygen gas inside particles
      averaging 2 to 4 micrometers in size (not visible without a
      microscope). The resulting solution, with oxygen gas making up 70
      percent of the volume, mixed efficiently with human blood.<br>
      <br>
      "One of the keys to the success of the project was the ability to
      administer a concentrated amount of oxygen gas in a small amount
      of liquid," Kheir says. "The suspension carries three to four
      times the oxygen content of our own red blood cells."<br>
      <br>
      Intravenous administration of oxygen gas was tried in the early
      1900s, but these attempts failed to oxygenate the blood and often
      caused dangerous gas embolisms.<br>
      <br>
      "We have engineered around this problem by packaging the gas into
      small, deformable particles," Kheir explains. "They dramatically
      increase the surface area for gas exchange and are able to squeeze
      through capillaries where free gas would get stuck."<br>
      <br>
      The study was funded by three awards from the Technology
      Development Fund at Boston Children's Hospital Boston and a U.S.
      Department of Defense Basic Research Award to Kheir.<br>

      a patient in an effective amount to increase in oxygen
      concentration in the patient's blood, and/or one or more tissues
      or organs.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
      <b>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] This present invention relates to compositions and methods
      for gas perfusion of tissues, and especially delivery of an
      effective amount of oxygen to a patient to alleviate or prevent
      ischemic injury.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] Every human cell requires a constant supply of oxygen to
      maintain cellular structure and homeostasis. This supply is
      primarily provided by hemoglobin, which carries inspired oxygen
      from the pulmonary capillaries to the tissues. In cases where a
      patient's lungs are unable to transfer adequate amounts of oxygen
      to circulating erythrocytes, severe hypoxia results and can
      quickly lead to severe organ injury and death.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Restoration of blood oxygen tension is paramount to
      resuscitation of the majority of pathophysiologic states. Some
      clinical states, such as lung injury, airway obstruction, and
      intracardiac mixing, exhibit hypoxemia and desaturation refractory
      to medical efforts to restore levels of oxygen saturation
      sufficient to limit ischemic injury. Ischemic injury may take
      place within minutes or seconds of insufficient oxygen delivery. <br>
      <br>
      In these conditions, low oxygen tension can result in end-organ
      dysfunction, failure, and mortality. The ability to augment
      oxygenation quickly and non-invasively would have dramatic
      implications on the morbidity and mortality from acute hypoxia, in
      addition to a number of other clinical situations.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Conventional attempts to restore oxygen levels in patients
      utilize supportive therapy of the patient's respiratory system,
      most commonly by way of mechanical ventilation. However, patients
      with lung injury, comprising a significant population of intensive
      care unit patients, have difficulty exchanging oxygen across a
      damaged alveolar unit. This requires clinicians to increase
      ventilator pressures, often causing further lung injury and
      systemic inflammation. Significant morbidity and mortality has
      been associated with ventilator induced lung injury, and
      barotrauma to the lungs is often necessitated by inadequate
      systemic oxygen delivery. The ability to non-invasively supplement
      even small percentages of oxygen delivery may significantly reduce
      the morbidity of mechanical ventilation.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Furthermore, emergency efforts to deliver oxygen to a
      patient are often inadequate and/or require too long to take
      effect, either due to lack of an adequate airway or overwhelming
      lung injury. This results in irreversible injury to the brain and
      other organs. Initiation of rescue therapy in these patients is
      burdensome and time consuming, and is available only at a limited
      number of specialized health care centers. <br>
      <br>
      There remains a need to quickly deliver oxygen directly to the
      blood of patients, thereby preventing or minimizing irreversible
      injury due to hypoxemia.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Therefore it is an object of the invention to provide
      improved methods for delivering oxygen to patients, tissues or
      organs.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] It is yet a further object of the invention to provide
      improved compositions for delivering oxygen to patients, tissues
      or organs.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] It is a still further object of the invention to provide
      improved methods for producing compositions for delivering oxygen
      to patients, tissues or organs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0011] Compositions containing a carrier and microbubbles
      encapsulating one or more gases, preferably oxygen, and methods
      for making and using the compositions are described herein. The
      microbubbles contain a lipid envelope formed of at least one base
      lipid and at least one emulsifying agent. The compositions may be
      administered to a patient to quickly deliver large amounts of
      oxygen to the patient's blood supply or directly to a tissue in
      need of oxygen. The compositions may be administered via injection
      or as a continuous infusion. The compositions contain a
      concentrated microbubble suspension, where the suspension contains
      at least 40 mL oxygen/dL suspension. The microbubbles are
      preferably less than 20 microns in diameter, more preferably less
      than 15 microns in diameter. The microbubbles described herein may
      be administered to a patient in an effective amount to increase
      the oxygen concentration in the patient's blood, and/or one or
      more tissues or organs, preferably in an amount effective to
      prevent or alleviate ischemic injury. The microbubbles may be

      Physicists have discovered a jewel-like geometric object that
      dramatically simplifies calculations of particle interactions and
      challenges the notion that space and time are fundamental
      components of reality.<br>
      <br>
      “This is completely new and very much simpler than anything that
      has been done before,” said Andrew Hodges, a mathematical
      physicist at Oxford University who has been following the work.<br>
      <br>
      The revelation that particle interactions, the most basic events
      in nature, may be consequences of geometry significantly advances
      a decades-long effort to reformulate quantum field theory, the
      body of laws describing elementary particles and their
      interactions. Interactions that were previously calculated with
      mathematical formulas thousands of terms long can now be described
      by computing the volume of the corresponding jewel-like
      “amplituhedron,” which yields an equivalent one-term expression.<br>
      <br>
      “The degree of efficiency is mind-boggling,” said Jacob Bourjaily,
      a theoretical physicist at Harvard University and one of the
      researchers who developed the new idea. “You can easily do, on
      paper, computations that were infeasible even with a computer
      before.”<br>
      <br>
      The new geometric version of quantum field theory could also
      facilitate the search for a theory of quantum gravity that would
      seamlessly connect the large- and small-scale pictures of the
      universe. Attempts thus far to incorporate gravity into the laws
      of physics at the quantum scale have run up against nonsensical
      infinities and deep paradoxes. The amplituhedron, or a similar
      geometric object, could help by removing two deeply rooted
      principles of physics: locality and unitarity.<br>
      <br>
      “Both are hard-wired in the usual way we think about things,” said
      Nima Arkani-Hamed, a professor of physics at the Institute for
      Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., and the lead author of the new
      work, which he is presenting in talks and in a forthcoming paper.
      “Both are suspect.”<br>
      <br>
      Locality is the notion that particles can interact only from
      adjoining positions in space and time. And unitarity holds that
      the probabilities of all possible outcomes of a quantum mechanical
      interaction must add up to one. The concepts are the central
      pillars of quantum field theory in its original form, but in
      certain situations involving gravity, both break down, suggesting
      neither is a fundamental aspect of nature.<br>
      <br>
      In keeping with this idea, the new geometric approach to particle
      interactions removes locality and unitarity from its starting
      assumptions. <br>
      <br>
      The amplituhedron is not built out of space-time and
      probabilities; these properties merely arise as consequences of
      the jewel’s geometry. The usual picture of space and time, and
      particles moving around in them, is a construct.<br>
      <br>
      “It’s a better formulation that makes you think about everything
      in a completely different way,” said David Skinner, a theoretical
      physicist at Cambridge University.<br>
      <br>
      The amplituhedron itself does not describe gravity. But
      Arkani-Hamed and his collaborators think there might be a related
      geometric object that does. Its properties would make it clear why
      particles appear to exist, and why they appear to move in three
      dimensions of space and to change over time.<br>
      <br>
      Because “we know that ultimately, we need to find a theory that
      doesn’t have” unitarity and locality, Bourjaily said, “it’s a
      starting point to ultimately describing a quantum theory of
      gravity.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Clunky Machinery</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The amplituhedron looks like an intricate, multifaceted jewel in
      higher dimensions. Encoded in its volume are the most basic
      features of reality that can be calculated, “scattering
      amplitudes,” which represent the likelihood that a certain set of
      particles will turn into certain other particles upon colliding.
      These numbers are what particle physicists calculate and test to
      high precision at particle accelerators like the Large Hadron
      Collider in Switzerland.<br>
      <br>
      The iconic 20th century physicist Richard Feynman invented a
      method for calculating probabilities of particle interactions
      using depictions of all the different ways an interaction could
      occur. Examples of “Feynman diagrams” were included on a 2005
      postage stamp honoring Feynman.<br>

      The iconic 20th century physicist Richard Feynman invented a
      method for calculating probabilities of particle interactions
      using depictions of all the different ways an interaction could
      occur. Examples of “Feynman diagrams” were included on a 2005
      postage stamp honoring Feynman.<br>
      <br>
      The 60-year-old method for calculating scattering amplitudes — a
      major innovation at the time — was pioneered by the Nobel
      Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman. He sketched line drawings
      of all the ways a scattering process could occur and then summed
      the likelihoods of the different drawings. The simplest Feynman
      diagrams look like trees: The particles involved in a collision
      come together like roots, and the particles that result shoot out
      like branches. More complicated diagrams have loops, where
      colliding particles turn into unobservable “virtual particles”
      that interact with each other before branching out as real final
      products. There are diagrams with one loop, two loops, three loops
      and so on — increasingly baroque iterations of the scattering
      process that contribute progressively less to its total amplitude.
      Virtual particles are never observed in nature, but they were
      considered mathematically necessary for unitarity — the
      requirement that probabilities sum to one.<br>
      <br>
      “The number of Feynman diagrams is so explosively large that even
      computations of really simple processes weren’t done until the age
      of computers,” Bourjaily said. A seemingly simple event, such as
      two subatomic particles called gluons colliding to produce four
      less energetic gluons (which happens billions of times a second
      during collisions at the Large Hadron Collider), involves 220
      diagrams, which collectively contribute thousands of terms to the
      calculation of the scattering amplitude.<br>
      <br>
      In 1986, it became apparent that Feynman’s apparatus was a Rube
      Goldberg machine.<br>
      <br>
      To prepare for the construction of the Superconducting Super
      Collider in Texas (a project that was later canceled), theorists
      wanted to calculate the scattering amplitudes of known particle
      interactions to establish a background against which interesting
      or exotic signals would stand out. <br>
      <br>
      But even 2-gluon to 4-gluon processes were so complex, a group of
      physicists had written two years earlier, “that they may not be
      evaluated in the foreseeable future.”<br>
      <br>
      Stephen Parke and Tommy Taylor, theorists at Fermi National
      Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, took that statement as a
      challenge. Using a few mathematical tricks, they managed to
      simplify the 2-gluon to 4-gluon amplitude calculation from several
      billion terms to a 9-page-long formula, which a 1980s
      supercomputer could handle. Then, based on a pattern they observed
      in the scattering amplitudes of other gluon interactions, Parke
      and Taylor guessed a simple one-term expression for the amplitude.
      It was, the computer verified, equivalent to the 9-page formula.
      In other words, the traditional machinery of quantum field theory,

      Feynman diagrams worth thousands of mathematical terms, was
      obfuscating something much simpler. As Bourjaily put it: “Why are

      function?”<br>
      <br>

      The message of Parke and Taylor’s single-term result took decades
      to interpret. “That one-term, beautiful little function was like a
      beacon for the next 30 years,” Bourjaily said. It “really started
      this revolution.”<br>

      </i><br>
      In the mid-2000s, more patterns emerged in the scattering
      amplitudes of particle interactions, repeatedly hinting at an
      underlying, coherent mathematical structure behind quantum field
      theory. Most important was a set of formulas called the BCFW
      recursion relations, named for Ruth <br>
      <br>
      Britto, Freddy Cachazo, Bo Feng and Edward Witten. Instead of
      describing scattering processes in terms of familiar variables
      like position and time and depicting them in thousands of Feynman
      diagrams, the BCFW relations are best couched in terms of strange
      variables called “twistors,” and particle interactions can be
      captured in a handful of associated twistor diagrams. The
      relations gained rapid adoption as tools for computing scattering
      amplitudes relevant to experiments, such as collisions at the
      Large Hadron Collider. But their simplicity was mysterious.<br>
      <br>
      “The terms in these BCFW relations were coming from a different
      world, and we wanted to understand what that world was,”
      Arkani-Hamed said. “That’s what drew me into the subject five
      years ago.”<br>
      <br>
      With the help of leading mathematicians such as Pierre Deligne,
      Arkani-Hamed and his collaborators discovered that the recursion
      relations and associated twistor diagrams corresponded to a
      well-known geometric object. <br>
      <br>
      In fact, as detailed in a paper posted to arXiv.org in December by
      Arkani-Hamed, Bourjaily, Cachazo, Alexander Goncharov, Alexander
      Postnikov and Jaroslav Trnka, the twistor diagrams gave
      instructions for calculating the volume of pieces of this object,
      called the positive Grassmannian.<br>
      <br>
      Named for Hermann Grassmann, a 19th-century German linguist and
      mathematician who studied its properties, “the positive
      Grassmannian is the slightly more grown-up cousin of the inside of
      a triangle,” Arkani-Hamed explained. Just as the inside of a
      triangle is a region in a two-dimensional space bounded by
      intersecting lines, the simplest case of the positive Grassmannian
      is a region in an N-dimensional space bounded by intersecting
      planes. (N is the number of particles involved in a scattering
      process.)<br>
      <br>
      It was a geometric representation of real particle data, such as
      the likelihood that two colliding gluons will turn into four
      gluons. But something was still missing.<br>
      <br>
      The physicists hoped that the amplitude of a scattering process
      would emerge purely and inevitably from geometry, but locality and
      unitarity were dictating which pieces of the positive Grassmannian
      to add together to get it. They wondered whether the amplitude was
      “the answer to some particular mathematical question,” said Trnka,
      a post-doctoral researcher at the California Institute of
      Technology. “And it is,” he said.<br>
      A sketch of the amplituhedron representing an 8-gluon particle
      interaction. Using Feynman diagrams, the same calculation would
      take roughly 500 pages of algebra.<br>

        take roughly 500 pages of algebra.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Arkani-Hamed and Trnka discovered that the scattering amplitude
      equals the volume of a brand-new mathematical object — the
      amplituhedron. The details of a particular scattering process
      dictate the dimensionality and facets of the corresponding
      amplituhedron. The pieces of the positive Grassmannian that were
      being calculated with twistor diagrams and then added together by
      hand were building blocks that fit together inside this jewel,
      just as triangles fit together to form a polygon.<br>
      <br>
      Like the twistor diagrams, the Feynman diagrams are another way of
      computing the volume of the amplituhedron piece by piece, but they
      are much less efficient. “They are local and unitary in
      space-time, but they are not necessarily very convenient or
      well-adapted to the shape of this jewel itself,” Skinner said.
      “Using Feynman diagrams is like taking a Ming vase and smashing it
      on the floor.”<br>
      <br>
      Arkani-Hamed and Trnka have been able to calculate the volume of
      the amplituhedron directly in some cases, without using twistor
      diagrams to compute the volumes of its pieces. They have also
      found a “master amplituhedron” with an infinite number of facets,
      analogous to a circle in 2-D, which has an infinite number of
      sides. Its volume represents, in theory, the total amplitude of
      all physical processes. Lower-dimensional amplituhedra, which
      correspond to interactions between finite numbers of particles,
      live on the faces of this master structure.<br>
      <br>
      “They are very powerful calculational techniques, but they are
      also incredibly suggestive,” Skinner said. “They suggest that
      thinking in terms of space-time was not the right way of going
      about this.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Quest for Quantum Gravity</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The seemingly irreconcilable conflict between gravity and quantum
      field theory enters crisis mode in black holes. Black holes pack a
      huge amount of mass into an extremely small space, making gravity
      a major player at the quantum scale, where it can usually be
      ignored. Inevitably, either locality or unitarity is the source of
      the conflict.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Puzzling Thoughts</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Locality and unitarity are the central pillars of quantum field
      theory, but as the following thought experiments show, both break
      down in certain situations involving gravity. This suggests
      physics should be formulated without either principle.<br>
      <br>
      Locality says that particles interact at points in space-time. But
      suppose you want to inspect space-time very closely. Probing
      smaller and smaller distance scales requires ever higher energies,
      but at a certain scale, called the Planck length, the picture gets
      blurry: So much energy must be concentrated into such a small
      region that the energy collapses the region into a black hole,
      making it impossible to inspect. “There’s no way of measuring
      space and time separations once they are smaller than the Planck
      length,” said Arkani-Hamed. “So we imagine space-time is a
      continuous thing, but because it’s impossible to talk sharply
      about that thing, then that suggests it must not be fundamental —
      it must be emergent.”<br>
      <br>
      Unitarity says the quantum mechanical probabilities of all
      possible outcomes of a particle interaction must sum to one. To
      prove it, one would have to observe the same interaction over and
      over and count the frequencies of the different outcomes. Doing
      this to perfect accuracy would require an infinite number of
      observations using an infinitely large measuring apparatus, but
      the latter would again cause gravitational collapse into a black
      hole. In finite regions of the universe, unitarity can therefore
      only be approximately known.<br>
      <br>
      “We have indications that both ideas have got to go,” Arkani-Hamed
      said. <br>
      <br>
      “They can’t be fundamental features of the next description,” such
      as a theory of quantum gravity.<br>
      <br>
      String theory, a framework that treats particles as invisibly
      small, vibrating strings, is one candidate for a theory of quantum
      gravity that seems to hold up in black hole situations, but its
      relationship to reality is unproven — or at least confusing.
      Recently, a strange duality has been found between string theory
      and quantum field theory, indicating that the former (which
      includes gravity) is mathematically equivalent to the latter
      (which does not) when the two theories describe the same event as
      if it is taking place in different numbers of dimensions. No one
      knows quite what to make of this discovery. But the new
      amplituhedron research suggests space-time, and therefore
      dimensions, may be illusory anyway.<br>
      <br>
      “We can’t rely on the usual familiar quantum mechanical space-time
      pictures of describing physics,” Arkani-Hamed said. “We have to
      learn new ways of talking about it. This work is a baby step in
      that direction.”<br>
      <br>
      Even without unitarity and locality, the amplituhedron formulation
      of quantum field theory does not yet incorporate gravity. But
      researchers are working on it. They say scattering processes that
      include gravity particles may be possible to describe with the
      amplituhedron, or with a similar geometric object. “It might be
      closely related but slightly different and harder to find,”
      Skinner said.<br>
      <br>
      Nima Arkani-Hamed, a professor at the Institute for Advanced
      Study, and his former student and co-author Jaroslav Trnka, who
      finished his Ph.D. at Princeton University in July and is now a
      post-doctoral researcher at the California Institute of
      Technology.<br>
      <br>
      Physicists must also prove that the new geometric formulation
      applies to the exact particles that are known to exist in the
      universe, rather than to the idealized quantum field theory they
      used to develop it, called maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills
      theory. This model, which includes a “superpartner” particle for
      every known particle and treats space-time as flat, “just happens
      to be the simplest test case for these new tools,” <br>
      <br>
      Bourjaily said. “The way to generalize these new tools to [other]
      theories is understood.”<br>
      <br>
      Beyond making calculations easier or possibly leading the way to
      quantum <br>
      <br>
      gravity, the discovery of the amplituhedron could cause an even
      more profound shift, Arkani-Hamed said. That is, giving up space
      and time as fundamental constituents of nature and figuring out
      how the Big Bang and cosmological evolution of the universe arose
      out of pure geometry.<br>
      <br>
      “In a sense, we would see that change arises from the structure of
      the object,” he said. “But it’s not from the object changing. The
      object is basically timeless.”<br>
      <br>
      While more work is needed, many theoretical physicists are paying
      close attention to the new ideas.<br>
      <br>
      The work is “very unexpected from several points of view,” said
      Witten, a theoretical physicist at the Institute for Advanced
      Study. “The field is still developing very fast, and it is
      difficult to guess what will happen or what the lessons will turn
      out to be.”<br>

      <br>
      Fish that live in piranha infested waters have evolved scales to
      protect them from the predator's fearsome teeth and are being used
      to develop new types of body armour The protective scales of
      Arapaima gigas are capable of absorbing the impact of a bite by
      flexing and twisting to spread the stress created by the
      teeth.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      They are fearsome predators that have been exploited by James Bond
      villains and horror movie directors to strike fear into swimmers.<br>
      <br>
      But while piranhas have the reputation for being able to strip
      their victims to the bone in minutes, some species of fish that
      live alongside them have evolved ways of avoiding their sharp
      teeth and powerful jaws.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists have found that a freshwater fish called Arapaima
      gigas, which lives in the Amazon River in Brazil, has developed
      tough armour that protects them from piranha bites.<br>
      <br>
      Now these fish are being used to help develop new types of body
      armour to protect people against bullets and knife attacks.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers found that the protective scales of Arapaima gigas,
      are capable of absorbing the impact of a piranha bite by flexing
      and twisting to spread the stress created by the teeth.<br>
      <br>
      Yet the scales are also hard enough to cause the teeth of the
      piranha to fracture, meaning Arapaima rarely fall prey to the
      veracious Amazon predators.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Robert Ritchie, chair of material sciences at the University of
      California Berkeley and who led the research, described the scales
      as having a structure like twisted plywood that deforms under
      pressure.<br>
      <br>
      The outer layers are hardened, making them resistant to
      penetration by the teeth while an overlapping, corrugated
      structure helps share the strain of the bite.<br>
      <br>
      He said they are now attempting to mimic the structure to create
      new types of body armour of shields.<br>
      <br>
      He said: "Without such scales the Arapaima as a very large fish
      would be easy prey for piranhas.<br>
      <br>
      "The fish scale is designed ideally for armour, which has a hard
      external layer to resist penetration by a bullet and a flexible
      and tough inner layer to accommodate the excessive deformation
      without fracturing the armour.<br>
      <br>
      "What we are trying to do is to create composite ceramics with the
      hard external layer and some flexible foundation to use as a
      shield or armour."<br>
      <br>
      Arapaima are the largest fish found in South American rivers,
      growing up to six feet seven inches long and weighing around
      220lbs.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Nature
      Communications, used X-rays to determine the structure of the
      layers, or lamella, that make up the scales that coat the fish's
      body.<br>
      <br>
      Each layer is made from the protein collagen, which is also found
      in hair and nails. The upper layers have a high mineral content,
      making them hard but brittle.<br>
      <br>
      Lower layers have lower mineral content meaning they are more
      flexible.<br>
      <br>
      These are layered on top of each other in a twisting pattern,
      which the researcher described as being a Bouligand-like
      arrangement.<br>
      <br>
      When they are put under strain they rotate further, as the
      collagen fibres stretch and slide.<br>
      <br>
      Previous work has shown the scales can resisting pressures of up
      to 12 gigapascals, or 1.7 million pounds per square inch.<br>
      <br>
      To give some idea of how large this is, commercial diamonds are
      created using pressures of 18 gigapascals.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Ritchie said: “The dermal scales of the Arapaima fish are a
      prime example of how the structural arrangement of simple
      biological components can create armour with the capacity to be
      tough yet penetration resistant.<br>
      <br>
      “The ability of the A. gigas’ outer dermal layer to resist
      predatory attacks derives from its sophisticated structure from
      the nano- to macro-length-scales.<br>
      <br>
      “The outer mineral layer gives the scale hardness and penetration
      resistance whereas the overlapping of the scales and the
      corrugated outer surface of the mineral layer allow the scales to
      bend transferring tensile stress to the inner lower-mineralised
      lamellae.”<br>
      <br>
      Piranha themselves have one of the most powerful bites for their
      size – rows of interlocking triangular teeth are powered by huge
      muscles that make up most of the fish's head.<br>
      <br>
      Despite their reputation, attacks on humans are relatively rare.
      there are an estimated 30 different species of piranha with most
      measuring between five inches to 10 inches in length.<br>
      <br>
      Rather than being ferocious predators that hunt in schools they
      are mainly timid fish.<br>
      <br>
      However, the red bellied piranha are known to attack in this way
      when water levels are low and they have been starved of food.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists have previously pitted piranha teeth against Arapaima
      scales by mounting them on rubber and pressing the teeth into them
      with an industrial hole puncher.<br>
      <br>
      The teeth cracked before they reached the rubber underneath.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Arapaima gigas, a fresh water fish found in the Amazon Basin,
      resist predation by piranhas through the strength and toughness of
      their scales, which act as natural dermal armour. Arapaima scales
      consist of a hard, mineralized outer shell surrounding a more
      ductile core. This core region is composed of aligned mineralized
      collagen fibrils arranged in distinct lamellae. Here we show how
      the Bouligand-type (twisted plywood) arrangement of collagen
      fibril lamellae has a key role in developing their unique
      protective properties, by using in situ synchrotron small-angle
      X-ray scattering during mechanical tensile tests to observe
      deformation mechanisms in the fibrils. Specifically, the
      Bouligand-type structure allows the lamellae to reorient in
      response to the loading environment; remarkably, most lamellae
      reorient towards the tensile axis and deform in tension through
      stretching/sliding mechanisms, whereas other lamellae
      sympathetically rotate away from the tensile axis and compress,
      thereby enhancing the scale’s ductility and toughness to prevent
      fracture.<br>

      <i>A sensor previously used for military operations can now be
        tuned to secretly locate and record any single conversation on a
        busy street</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      EVERYONE knows that to have a private chat in the NSA era, you go
      outdoors. Phones, the internet, email and your office can all be
      compromised with ease. But soon even that whispered conversation
      in the park may no longer be safe from prying ears.<br>
      <br>
      Carrying out covert audio surveillance along a city street or a
      wooded path, say, currently requires parabolic microphones, which
      look like large, clear salad bowls and need a direct, unobstructed
      view of the subject. Hardly 007 territory.<br>
      <br>
      Now, a Dutch acoustics firm, Microflown Technologies, has
      developed a matchstick-sized sensor that can pinpoint and record a
      target's conversations from a distance.<br>
      <br>
      Known as an acoustic vector sensor, Microflown's sensor measures
      the movement of air, disturbed by sound waves, to almost instantly
      locate where a sound originated. It can then identify the noise
      and, if required, transmit it live to waiting ears.<br>
      <br>
      Conventional microphones work when sound waves make a diaphragm
      move, creating an electrical signal. Microflown's sensor has no
      moving parts. It consists of two parallel platinum strips, each
      just 200 nanometres deep, that are heated to 200 °C. Air molecules
      flowing across the strips cause temperature differences between
      the pair. Microflown's software counts the air molecules that pass
      through the gap between the strips to gauge sound intensity: the
      more air molecules in a sound wave, the louder the sound. <br>
      <br>
      At the same time, it analyses the temperature change in the strips
      to work out the movement of the air and calculate the coordinates
      of whatever generated the sound.<br>
      <br>
      Until now, the military has been using an early version of the
      sensor to pinpoint enemy planes and rockets. A single sensor can
      track and identify multiple distant jets, mortar rounds and sniper
      rifles in any environment.<br>
      <br>
      Earlier this year, Microflown's researchers discovered by chance
      that the device can hear, record or stream an ordinary
      conversation from as far away as 20 metres, says Hans-Elias de
      Bree, the firm's co-founder. <br>
      <br>
      Signal-processing software filters out unwanted noise like wind or
      traffic commotion. Work is now underway to increase the range.<br>
      <br>
      Given a battery and a tiny antenna, the sensor could be attached
      to traffic lights, a shrub or park bench. Such systems can be
      teamed with surveillance cameras. Detecting a shout or a gunshot,
      the sensor can direct the camera to the precise location of
      trouble, the way our ears work with our eyes. It can then start
      recording everything that is being said in that location.<br>
      <br>
      A number of countries are now testing the matchstick sensor
      attached to drones and crewed vehicles, says de Bree. He foresees
      governments placing them on small dirigibles that tail suspects or
      hover over political rallies.<br>
      <br>
      "Not only could this work, it has worked," says Ron
      Barrett-Gonzalez at the University of Kansas. He has helped boost
      the sensor's range by 28 per cent to more than 25 metres. It will
      be possible to record a parade of people on a busy sidewalk all
      day using a camera and acoustic sensor, and tune into each
      conversation or voice, live or via stored files, he says.<br>
      <br>
      Security technologist Bruce Schneier says this new capability is
      unwelcome – particularly given the recent claims about the NSA's
      success at tapping into our private lives. "It's not just this one
      technology that's the problem," Schneier says. "It's the mic plus
      the drones, plus the signal processing, plus voice recognition."<br>

      <b>Listening to the skies</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A tiny sensor that can eavesdrop on private conversations is not
      just useful to big brother (see main story). Ecuador is using
      sensors that measure airflow for something other than spycraft.
      The government is putting sensors in, around and near airports to
      form an acoustic air-traffic control system. The sensors pinpoint
      a plane's direction by analysing the air movement. Software can
      tell if a plane is climbing, descending or straining with cargo.<br>
      <br>
      While geographical features such as mountains can play havoc with
      radar returns, the comparative simplicity of passive listening can
      make Microflown's sensors less easy to fool. They are also much
      cheaper than radar equipment.<br>

      It is so difficult to make that the researchers who first
      discovered it called it the “impossible material”.<br>
      <br>
      Now a century later, a team of Swedish scientists have done the
      impossible by producing the substance known as Upsalite by
      accident – after leaving their equipment running over the weekend.<br>
      <br>
      The breakthrough has far-reaching commercial applications, as
      Upsalite (named after the University of Uppsala, where the
      scientists are based) is the world’s most efficient water
      absorber, with potential to be used for the removal of moisture in
      drug creation and high-tech electronics to cleaning up huge oil
      spills.<br>
      <br>
      A single gram of this elusive white, dry, powdered form of
      magnesium carbonate (MgCO3) has an extraordinarily-large surface
      area of 800 square meters thanks to numerous minuscule pores, each
      one a million times smaller than the width of a human hair.<br>
      <br>
      “Upsalite absorbs more water and low relative humidities than the
      best materials presently available and can be regenerated with
      less energy consumption than is used in similar processes today,”
      said Maria Stromme, professor of nanotechnology at Uppsala
      University.<br>
      <br>
      “This, together with other unique properties of the discovered
      impossible material, is expected to pave the way for new
      sustainable products in a number of industrial applications,” she
      said.<br>
      <br>
      Other uses include ice hockey rinks, warehouses, the collection of
      toxic waste or chemical spills and odour control. MgCO3 is also
      about as dry as a material can get, a property which, combined
      with a huge relative surface area that is inundated with pocket
      pores, makes it the world’s best mop. The only problem is that,
      until now, this absorbent form of magnesium carbonate could only
      be produced by a process that is so expensive and involves so much
      heat that it wasn’t remotely feasible to use it. While other
      members of the so-called “disordered carbonates” family could be
      produced more cheaply and simply – by bubbling carbon dioxide
      through a mixture containing alcohol – a group of German
      researchers claimed in 1908 that this method couldn’t be used to
      make dry MgCO3. And so they dubbed it the “impossible
      material”.The irony is that although the Uppsala team had been
      trying to create the impossible material, they had been going
      about it the wrong way.<br>
      <br>
      “A Thursday afternoon in 2011, we slightly changed the synthesis
      parameters of the earlier employed unsuccessful attempts, and by
      mistake left the material in the reaction chamber over the
      weekend. Back at work on Monday morning we discovered that a rigid
      gel had formed and after drying this gel we started to get
      excited,” says Johan Gomez de la Torre.<br>
      <br>
      The unwitting solution still involved bubbling the Co2 through the
      alcohol mixture, but at three times normal atmospheric pressure. A
      year of detailed analysis and experimental fine tuning followed,
      during which time it was discovered that when heated to 70C the
      resulting gel solidifies and collapses into a white and coarse
      powder.<br>
      <br>
      “It became clear that we had indeed synthesised the material that
      previously had been claimed impossible to make. This places it in
      the exclusive class of porous, high surface area materials,” said
      Ms Stromme.<br>
      <br>
      The findings have been published in the journal PLOS ONE.<br>

      </b>When it comes to the growth of graphene -- an ultrathin,
      ultrastrong, all-carbon material -- it is survival of the fittest,
      according to researchers at The University of Texas at Austin.<br>
      <br>
      The team used surface oxygen to grow centimeter-size single
      graphene crystals on copper. The crystals were about 10,000 times
      as large as the largest crystals from only four years ago. Very
      large single crystals have exceptional electrical properties.<br>
      <br>
      "The game we play is that we want nucleation (the growth of tiny
      'crystal seeds') to occur, but we also want to harness and control
      how many of these tiny nuclei there are, and which will grow
      larger," said Rodney S. Ruoff, professor in the Cockrell School of
      Engineering. "Oxygen at the right surface concentration means only
      a few nuclei grow, and winners can grow into very large crystals."<br>
      <br>
      The team -- led by postdoctoral fellow Yufeng Hao and Ruoff of the
      Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Materials Science and
      Engineering Program, along with Luigi Colombo, a material
      scientist with Texas Instruments -- worked for three years on the
      graphene growth method. <br>
      <br>
      The team's paper, "The Role of Surface Oxygen in the Growth of
      Large Single-Crystal Graphene on Copper," is featured on the cover
      of the Nov. 8, 2013, issue of Science.<br>
      <br>
      One of the world's strongest materials, graphene is flexible and
      has high electrical and thermal conductivity that makes it a
      promising material for flexible electronics, solar cells,
      batteries and high-speed transistors. <br>
      <br>
      The team's understanding of how graphene growth is influenced by
      differing amounts of surface oxygen is a major step toward
      improved high-quality graphene films at industrial scale.<br>
      <br>
      The team's method "is a fundamental breakthrough, which will lead
      to growth of high-quality and large area graphene film," said
      Sanjay Banerjee, who heads the Cockrell School's South West
      Academy of Nanoelectronics (SWAN). "By increasing the
      single-crystal domain sizes, the electronic transport properties
      will be dramatically improved and lead to new applications in
      flexible electronics."<br>
      <br>
      Graphene has always been grown in a polycrystalline form, that is,
      it is composed of many crystals that are joined together with
      irregular chemical bonding at the boundaries between crystals
      ("grain boundaries"), something like a patch-work quilt. Large
      single-crystal graphene is of great interest because the grain
      boundaries in polycrystalline material have defects, and
      eliminating such defects makes for a better material.<br>
      <br>
      By controlling the concentration of surface oxygen, the
      researchers could increase the crystal size from a millimeter to a
      centimeter. Rather than hexagon-shaped and smaller crystals, the
      addition of the right amount of surface oxygen produced much
      larger single crystals with multibranched edges, similar to a
      snowflake.<br>
      <br>
      "In the long run it might be possible to achieve meter-length
      single crystals," Ruoff said. "This has been possible with other
      materials, such as silicon and quartz. Even a centimeter crystal
      size -- if the grain boundaries are not too defective -- is
      extremely significant."<br>
      <br>
      "We can start to think of this material's potential use in
      airplanes and in other structural applications -- if it proves to
      be exceptionally strong at length scales like parts of an airplane
      wing, and so on," he said.<br>
      <br>
      Another major finding by the team was that the "carrier mobility"
      of electrons (how fast the electrons move) in graphene films grown
      in the presence of surface oxygen is exceptionally high. This is
      important because the speed at which the charge carriers move is
      important for many electronic devices -- the higher the speed, the
      faster the device can perform.<br>
      <br>
      Yufeng Hao says he thinks the knowledge gained in this study could
      prove useful to industry.<br>
      <br>
      "The high quality of the graphene grown by our method will likely
      be developed further by industry, and that will eventually allow
      devices to be faster and more efficient," Hao said.<br>
      <br>
      Single-crystal films can also be used for the evaluation and
      development of new types of devices that call for a larger scale
      than could be achieved before, added Colombo.<br>
      <br>
      "At this time, there are no other reported techniques that can
      provide high quality transferrable films," Colombo said. "The
      material we were able to grow will be much more uniform in its
      properties than a polycrystalline film."<br>

      <br>
      Menlo Park, Calif. — A single layer of tin atoms could be the
      world’s first material to conduct electricity with 100 percent
      efficiency at the temperatures that computer chips operate,
      according to a team of theoretical physicists led by researchers
      from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) SLAC National
      Accelerator Laboratory and Stanford University.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers call the new material "stanene," combining the Latin
      name for tin (stannum) with the suffix used in graphene, another
      single-layer material whose novel electrical properties hold
      promise for a wide range of applications.<br>
      <br>
      "Stanene could increase the speed and lower the power needs of
      future generations of computer chips, if our prediction is
      confirmed by experiments that are underway in several laboratories
      around the world," said the team leader, Shoucheng Zhang, a
      physics professor at Stanford and the Stanford Institute for
      Materials and Energy Sciences (SIMES), a joint institute with
      SLAC. The team’s work was published recently in Physical Review
      Letters.<br>

      For the past decade, Zhang and colleagues have been calculating
      and predicting the electronic properties of a special class of
      materials known as topological insulators, which conduct
      electricity only on their outside edges or surfaces and not
      through their interiors. When topological insulators are just one
      atom thick, their edges conduct electricity with 100 percent
      efficiency. These unusual properties result from complex
      interactions between the electrons and nuclei of heavy atoms in
      the materials.<br>
      <br>
      “The magic of topological insulators is that by their very nature,
      they force electrons to move in defined lanes without any speed
      limit, like the German autobahn,” Zhang said. “As long as they’re
      on the freeway – the edges or surfaces – the electrons will travel
      without resistance.”<br>
      <br>
      In 2006 and 2009, Zhang’s group predicted that mercury telluride
      and several combinations of bismuth, antimony, selenium and
      tellurium should be topological insulators, and they were soon
      proven right in experiments performed by others. But none of those
      materials is a perfect conductor of electricity at room
      temperature, limiting their potential for commercial applications.<br>
      <br>
      Earlier this year, visiting scientist Yong Xu, who is now at
      Tsinghua University in Beijing, collaborated with Zhang’s group to
      consider the properties of a single layer of pure tin.<br>
      <br>
      “We knew we should be looking at elements in the lower-right
      portion of the periodic table,” Xu said. “All previous topological
      insulators have involved the heavy and electron-rich elements
      located there.”<br>
      <br>
      Their calculations indicated that a single layer of tin would be a
      topological insulator at and above room temperature, and that
      adding fluorine atoms to the tin would extend its operating range
      to at least 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ultimately a Substitute for Silicon?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Zhang said the first application for this stanene-fluorine
      combination could be in wiring that connects the many sections of
      a microprocessor, allowing electrons to flow as freely as cars on
      a highway. Traffic congestion would still occur at on- and
      off-ramps made of conventional conductors, he said. But stanene
      wiring should significantly reduce the power consumption and heat
      production of microprocessors.Manufacturing challenges include
      ensuring that only a single layer of tin is deposited and keeping
      that single layer intact during high-temperature chip-making
      processes.<br>
      <br>
      “Eventually, we can imagine stanene being used for many more
      circuit structures, including replacing silicon in the hearts of
      transistors,” Zhang said. “Someday we might even call this area
      Tin Valley rather than Silicon Valley.”<br>

      University in Beijing and the Max Planck Institute for Chemical
      Physics of Solids in Dresden, Germany. The research was supported

      </b>The search for large-gap quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators
      and effective approaches to tune QSH states is important for both
      fundamental and practical interests. Based on first-principles
      calculations we find two-dimensional tin films are QSH insulators
      with sizable bulk gaps of 0.3 eV, sufficiently large for practical
      applications at room temperature. These QSH states can be
      effectively tuned by chemical functionalization and by external
      strain. The mechanism for the QSH effect in this system is band
      inversion at the G point, similar to the case of a HgTe quantum
      well. With surface doping of magnetic elements, the quantum
      anomalous Hall effect could also be realized.<br>

      Stanene is a theoretical topological insulator which may display
      superconductivity at its edges above room temperature. It is
      composed of tin atoms arranged in a single layer, in a manner
      similar to graphene.[1] Stanene got its name by combining stannum
      (the Latin name for tin) with the suffix -ene used by graphene.[2]<br>
      <br>
      The addition of fluorine atoms to the tin lattice could extend the
      critical temperature up to 100°C.[3] This would make it practical

      Using the work of V. Kronin as the basis for their treatment
      modality, a team of Russian physicians has been working at the
      laboratories of the Centers For Disease Control in Atlanta,
      Georgia, and Baylor University Medical Research Center in Houston,
      Texas, for more than a year. Their project demonstrates a
      revolutionary new medical treatment modality which capitalizes on
      this attribute of torsion field mechanics, to fundamentally cure
      patients infected with the hepatitis-C virus.i<br>
      <br>
      The frequency signature of the hepatitis-C virus was mapped using
      infra-red spectrometry, a specially designed scalar interferometer
      and MRI technologies. The complex waveform which is mutually
      exclusive to the hepatitis-C virus was then fed into a desktop
      computer and converted to a waveform which was its phase
      conjugated opposite. The resulting waveform information was then
      fed to a torsion field generator which was used to irradiate a .5%
      molal solution of NaCl (Ringer's) for a period of 30 minutes. The
      ionic salt solution emitted a phase conjugated signal when fed
      into the patient’s system. The solution was infiltrated into the
      vascular system of 15 patients diagnosed with advanced cases of
      hepatitis-C. After 30 days of three-times-per-week treatment, 14
      of the 15 patients were diagnosed as being completely free of any
      sign of infection. The 15th patient died during treatment from
      complications arising from an extremely advanced, chronic case of
      the disease. The technology is now being tested under double blind
      protocols by Dr. Robert Pennington and virologists at the Baylor
      University Medical Center. <br>

            world’s ‘cheapest’ power</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A Bangladeshi student has developed a system that can produce
      electricity without any fuel, claiming it to be the world’s
      cheapest form of power.<br>
      <br>
      The system known as Heavy Circular Moving Object’s Triggering
      Energy Conversion (HECMOTE) uses round objects moving on a plain
      exterior, to capture the surface’s gravitational energy to run
      traditional generators to produce power.<br>
      <br>
      “The technology is about converting gravitational energy into
      mechanical energy to generate electrical energy. It will not use
      any fossil fuel and thus, will not release any toxic elements into
      the atmosphere,” said Shahid Hossain, inventor of the new
      technology, at a press meet at Dhaka Reporters Unity yesterday.<br>
      <br>
      Gravitational energy is potential energy an object possesses
      because of its position in a gravitational field.<br>
      <br>
      Hossain, who is studying for a diploma in electrical engineering
      at a technical college in Uttara, began work on his idea in 2007.<br>
      <br>
      A 100KVA power plant adopting Hossain’s technology was set up on
      an experimental basis in Tongi in 2011, which has been running
      successfully since then.<br>
      <br>
      Hossain, 29, said the production cost of a kilowatt-hour of
      electricity would be Tk 0.2 with his system, whereas it is Tk
      14.46 per kwh for a diesel-run plant.<br>
      <br>
      The production cost of a unit of electricity with other renewable
      energy sources is even higher than that of the fossil fuel-run
      plants.<br>
      <br>
      The operation and maintenance costs are also much lower; a 100MW
      HECMOTE power plant will cost Tk 1.5 crore a month against Tk 5
      crore of a diesel-run plant.<br>
      <br>
      The diesel-run power plant consumes fuel worth Tk 144,000 an hour
      whereas the HECMOTE power plant will not use any fuel.<br>
      <br>
      The youth from Dinajpur said he ignored a lucrative offer from a
      Canadian firm a few years ago that offered to buy all rights of
      the technology.<br>
      <br>
      Hossain said Bangladesh, an energy-starved nation, would benefit
      from the invention before it becomes available for others. “I need
      support from the government to make it commercial, as I will not
      be able to set up a plant capable of producing 100 megawatts of
      electricity worth crores of taka on my own.”<br>
      <br>
      His company, UltraMax Power Development Ltd, plans to set up
      plants that are within a capacity of 5 megawatts and 10 megawatts.<br>
      <br>
      The life-span of the system is 25 to 30 years, said Hossain.<br>
      <br>
      He believes his invention could create a new dimension in solving
      the world’s present energy crisis.<br>

          Bioluminescence Imaging and Scanning Electron Microscopic
          Analysis </b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Objective: The aim of this study was to test photodynamic therapy
      (PDT) as an alternative approach to biofilm disruption on dental
      hard tissue, We evaluated the effect of methylene blue and a
      660?nm diode laser on the viability and architecture of
      Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial biofilms. Materials and
      methods: Ten human teeth were inoculated with bioluminescent
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Enterococcus faecalis to form 3 day
      biofilms in prepared root canals. Bioluminescence imaging was used
      to serially quantify and evaluate the bacterial viability, and
      scanning electron microscopic (SEM) imaging was used to assess
      architecture and morphology of bacterial biofilm before and after
      PDT employing methylene blue and 40?mW, 660?nm diode laser light
      delivered into the root canal via a 300?µm fiber for 240?sec,
      resulting in a total energy of 9.6?J. The data were statistically
      analyzed with analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey test.
      Results: The bacterial reduction showed a dose dependence; as the
      light energy increased, the bioluminescence decreased in both
      planktonic suspension and in biofilms. The SEM analysis showed a
      significant reduction of biofilm on the surface. PDT promoted
      disruption of the biofilm and the number of adherent bacteria was
      reduced. Conclusions: The photodynamic effect seems to disrupt the
      biofilm by acting both on bacterial cells and on the extracellular
      matrix.<br>

      <br>
      Bacterial resistance to drugs poses a major healthcare problem,
      causing widespread epidemic of diseases that hitherto were
      susceptible to antibiotics. Since penicillin was introduced in the
      1940s, the pharmaceutical industry has countered this trend with
      periodic development and deployment of “stronger” antibiotics;
      however, bacteria in general, and methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in particular, have continually
      evolved a repertoire of evasive mechanisms that frequently defy
      antibiotic treatment. More than two billion people now carry some
      strain of S. aureus; 53 million of whom have MRSA.1 Estimates
      indicate that the United States alone spends 3.2–4.2 billion
      dollars on hospitalized patients with MRSA every year,2,3 and this
      does not include the human costs associated with lost labor, and
      lost lives, which now exceed that caused by HIV/AIDS.4<br>
      <br>
      Deadly outbreaks of MRSA have been reported in every region of the
      world, with air travel and sociopolitical ties speeding the spread
      and resulting in the emergence of similar strains in countries
      with historical ties.3 Whereas infections were once confined to
      hospitals, that is, hospital-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA), the
      ongoing spread of community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) and
      livestock associated MRSA (LA-MRSA), and the reported jump of
      strains from animal to human and vice versa,5–9 now present a
      larger clinical conundrum. Pandemic strains of CA-MRSA have been
      found on beaches, computer keyboards, locker rooms, schools,
      athletic fields, and other common locations.10–13 It is now
      estimated that MRSA infection accounts for 44% of all
      hospital-associated infections in the United States; of these, as
      many as 92% are CA-MRSA.14<br>
      <br>
      The continuing resistance of MRSA and other bacteria to
      antibiotics calls for a paradigm shift in the quest for therapies
      capable of stemming their spread. Alternative modalities currently
      under investigation include hyperbaric oxygen,15 photodynamic
      therapy (PDT),16 antibacterial clays,17 and blue light
      phototherapy.18–20 Interest in hyperbaric oxygen has waned,
      because of its moderate bactericidal effect compared with other
      emerging alternatives, such as PDT, antibacterial clay, and blue
      light. As shown in this issue of the journal, PDT, when used as an
      adjunct to conventional oral disinfection protocols, significantly
      reduces infection caused by ontopathogenic bacteria, including
      Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis,
      and Prevotella intermedia.21 Moreover, the report shows that PDT
      kills cariogenic bacteria, including Streptococcus mutans and
      Streptococcus sanguis, as well as bacteria associated with
      infected root canals and peri-implantitis.21<br>
      <br>
      This finding is supported by the work of Gacez et al.22 (in this
      issue), who showed that PDT, using 660?nm diode laser and
      methylene blue, significantly reduced infection in human root
      canals inoculated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Enterococcus
      faecalis. Similarly, PDT has been shown to be beneficial in
      treating dermatologic and ophthalmologic disorders.23,24 However,
      serious concerns remain for its acute side effects and the
      non-targeted nature of available photosensitizers.24 This
      situation calls for other alternatives to PDT, in spite of its
      beneficial antimicrobial effect. The Ebers Papyrus, published
      circa 1600 BCE,25 and the 5000-year-old tablets of Nippur26
      identified clay and sunlight as therapies used by humans to treat
      a wide range of diseases, including infections caused by bacteria.
      Emerging reports now show that certain types of clay and light in
      the ultraviolet (UV), violet, and blue spectra have antibacterial
      properties.18–20,27<br>
      <br>
      In this issue of the journal, we focus on articles that indicate
      that certain wavelengths of light are bactericidal and can
      eradicate recalcitrant bacteria in vitro and in vivo. First, a
      connection between light therapy and the antimicrobial action of
      clay may be seen in the work of Lipovsky et al.28 (in this issue)
      who showed that doping nanoparticles such as ZnO, CuO, and TiO2,
      with transition metals ions, or attaching the metal oxides
      nanoparticles to an organic molecule, enhances their antimicrobial
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation activity when irradiated
      with light in the visible and near infrared ranges. Furthermore,
      they found that ZnO and TiO2 nanoparticles had notable absorption
      in the blue spectrum, indicating that visible light could be used
      to trigger ROS production, and, hence, the antimicrobial effect of
      metal oxides. Studies of clay treatment similarly show that
      mineral leachates, including ions of copper, iron, cobalt, nickel,
      and zinc, from certain varieties of clay, are responsible for the
      antibacterial action of clay against Escherichia coli and MRSA.17
      That light may be equally involved in clay treatment remains
      unexplored, but a potential role cannot be ruled out entirely.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, encouraging data from Dai et al.,29 (in this issue)
      indicate that the bacteria- eradicating effect of blue light, long
      reported in a multitude of in vitro studies,18–20,27 is achievable
      in vivo. They found that irradiation with 415±10?nm blue light
      reduced bacterial burden in abrasive skin wounds of laboratory
      rats inoculated with CA-MRSA. Furthermore, bacterial clearance was
      achieved without significant adverse effect on keratinocytes
      co-cultured with CA-MRSA. And electron microscopy revealed that
      irradiation of the bacteria caused extrusions of cytoplasmic
      content, cell wall damage, and cell debris, providing an insight
      into the potential mechanisms involved in photo-eradication of
      MRSA. However, these results are achievable only with certain
      parameters, as suggested by the preliminary findings of Lanzafame
      et al.,30 (in this issue) who found significant reduction of
      bacteria with photo-activated collagen-embedded flavins (PCF)
      treatment, but not with 455±5?nm blue light irradiation alone,
      when treating pressure ulcers in mice inoculated with MRSA. The
      implication is that experimental model and mode of treatment can
      significantly affect the results obtained in these types of
      studies.<br>
      <br>
      Further evidence that experimental parameters influence outcomes
      can be seen in the work of Bumah et al.31 and Kim et al.32 For
      example, Bumah et al.31 showed that irradiation with either 405 or
      470?nm blue light cleared MRSA progressively as fluence increased,
      and also as bacterial density increased, even though the
      proportion of bacterial colonies cleared decreased inversely as
      bacterial density. Whereas both wavelengths had similar effects on
      less dense cultures, that is, 3×106 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL
      and 5×106 CFU/mL cultures, 405?nm light cleared more bacteria in
      the denser 7×106 CFU/mL culture. And regardless of wavelength,
      more bacteria were cleared when the culture plates were irradiated
      from above and below instead of being irradiated from one
      direction at the same corresponding total dose. The latter finding
      suggests that the bactericidal effect of light-emitting diode
      (LED) blue light is limited more by the ability of blue light to
      penetrate the layers of bacteria than by bacterial density alone.
      That wavelength affects the outcome of LED photo-irradiation of
      bacteria is corroborated by Kim et al.32 They showed that, even
      though P. gingivalis and E. coli are killed with 425?nm blue
      light, 525?nm green light only induces bacteriostatic effect.
      Also, 625?nm red light did not kill any of the bacteria tested.<br>
      <br>
      Collectively, these reports present further evidence that light,
      in particular, blue light in the range of 405–470?nm wavelength is
      bactericidal, and has the potential to help stem the ongoing
      pandemic of MRSA and other bacterial infections.<br>

      New Rochelle, NY--Blue light has proven to have powerful
      bacteria-killing ability in the laboratory. The potent
      antibacterial effects of irradiation using light in the blue
      spectra have now also been demonstrated in human and animal
      tissues. A series of groundbreaking articles that provide
      compelling evidence of this effect are published in Photomedicine
      and Laser Surgery, a peer-reviewed journal published by Mary Ann
      Liebert, Inc., publishers. The articles are available on the
      Photomedicine and Laser Surgery website

      Alternative to Antibiotics,"

      citing the growing number of deadly outbreaks worldwide of
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The articles
      in this issue of Photomedicine and Laser Surgery provide evidence
      that "blue light in the range of 405-470 nm wavelength is
      bactericidal and has the potential to help stem the ongoing
      pandemic of MRSA and other bacterial infections."<br>

      Aguinaldo S. Garcez, PhD and coauthors show that photodynamic
      therapy and methylene blue delivered directly into the root canal
      of a human tooth infected with a bacterial biofilm was able to

      biofilms, and reduce the number of bacteria adhering to the tooth.<br>

      Raymond J. Lanzafame, MD, MBA, and colleagues demonstrated
      significantly greater bacterial reduction in the treatment of
      pressure ulcers in mice using a combination of photoactivated
      collagen-embedded compounds plus 455 nm diode laser irradiation
      compared to irradiation alone or no treatment. The antibacterial
      effect of the combined therapy increased with successive

      Violet Bumah, PhD and coauthors compared the bacteria-killing

      <br>
      ABSTRACT: This report describes the preparation of polyacrylate
      nanoparticles in which an N-thiolated b-lactam antibiotic is
      covalently conjugated onto the polymer framework. These
      nanoparticles are formed in water by emulsion polymerization of an
      acrylated antibiotic pre-dissolved in a liquid acrylate monomer
      (or mixture of co-monomers) in the presence of sodium dodecyl
      sulfate as a surfactant and potassium persulfate as a radical
      initiator. Dynamic light scattering analysis and electron
      microscopy images of these emulsions show that the nanoparticles
      are approximately 40 nm in diameter. The emulsions have potent in
      vitro antibacterial properties against methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus and have improved bioactivity relative to
      the non-polymerized form of the antibiotic. A unique feature of
      this methodology is the ability to incorporate water-insoluble
      drugs directly into the nanoparticle framework without the need
      for post-synthetic modification. Additionally, the antibiotic
      properties of the nanoparticles can be modulated by changing the
      length or location of the acrylate linker on the drug monomer.

      <b>Dec 25, 2013</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Tampa, Florida -- The University of South Florida ranks 10th among
      universities worldwide in U.S. patents. One of the inventions
      that's putting USF on the map is a liquid bandage that helps close
      wounds both big and small.<br>
      <br>
      While getting her PhD, Dr. Kerriann Greenhalgh was collaborating
      with a professor at USF on a project when she discovered a polymer
      could be turned into a bandage.<br>
      <br>
      "I was really struck by its elastic properties, its ability to
      stretch and move with the body and then come back to its original
      shape which is very similar to the skin," Greenhalgh said.<br>
      <br>
      In the midst of her research, her soon-to-be husband had a nasty
      cut that developed staph that needed immediate surgery to avoid
      nerve damage or amputation. That's when she knew she needed to
      push forward with KeriCure.<br>
      <br>
      "It just kind of clicked for me," Greenhalgh said. "This would
      make a great skin, a secondary skin, an artificial skin to help
      clean wounds clean and infection free. "<br>
      <br>
      She tinkered with the formula, even tested it on her own cuts and
      scrapes, and created a water based solution that has no harsh
      chemicals or preservatives.<br>
      <br>
      "When you put it on, you spray it on your hand. It forms a
      protective barrier and it protects bacteria from getting in. But
      because it's water-based, there's no stinging involved and it
      actually helps to hydrate the wound and it keeps it moisturized
      which actually helps with the cosmetic outcome of the wound as
      well."<br>
      <br>
      While its competitors are flexible, they don't have the same
      elasticity which allows you to move your knuckles while it's on.
      It's also waterproof and sweatproof.<br>
      <br>
      "You can go swimming with it," Greenhalgh said. "The EMTs at
      SeaWorld have it in their pockets which is great there you know
      the kids have these cuts and if they put band aids on them then
      they're putting their hands in the fish tanks in the touch tanks
      and you get band aids in there and it's awful."<br>
      <br>
      The spray is attached to a keychain or you can put it in your
      pocket, and with about 170 liquid bandages in a bottle for $10.99
      at major retailers like Publix and Kroger, KeriCure is sealing up
      success.<br>
      <br>
      "Our motto with this product is KeriCure and carry on so it's
      really intended for moms, people on the go, active lifestyles
      doing sports to really be able to spray it and keep going about
      their business and not have to worry about it."<br>
      <br>
      KeriCure is Tampa-based company with five full-time employees.
      It's manufactured and packaged locally too. Since KeriCure is
      partners with USF, the company has lab space and supports eight
      undergraduates, giving them real life research experience.<br>
