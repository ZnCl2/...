              About 2,500 years ago Pythagoras founded the idea of a
              harmony of the spheres. At the beginning of the 17th
              century Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) gave this idea vital
              new impulses, as he explored the fundamental laws of
              planetary movements. Using mathematical calculation
              methods and musical programming these thoughts were
              continued and translated into music by Brian Cranford,
              Tobias Krug and Hartmut Warm. The CD includes a 24-page
              booklet explaining the methods and the approach in detail.
              On the CD several important interpreters of contemporary
              music can be heard such as Masako Otha, Heinz Friedl,
              Tobias Hermanutz and others.<br>

              Of course you all know of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. Who
              doesn't?&nbsp; Legendary Russian dissident during the
              Soviet era, prisoner in the gulags, starved, tortured,
              ostracised.&nbsp; But never broken. He spoke truth to
              power like few have ever done. His novels such as The
              Gulag Archipelago, The First Circle and Cancer Ward were
              not only brilliant literature but offered the rarest of
              insights into the life of a dissident in the USSR.&nbsp;
              He came to be regarded as one of the most eminent writers
              and philosophers of his age.&nbsp; Which contributed to
              his being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1970
              "for the ethical force with which he has pursued the
              indispensable traditions of Russian literature".<br>
              <br>
              Feted wherever he went, his books became international
              best sellers, translated into dozens of languages, the
              world was at his feet.&nbsp; Then almost overnight it all
              stopped. He became a non-person. The transformation was
              virtually unprecedented in the field of literature. Why
              did this happen? Because Alex stepped on the Third
              Rail.&nbsp; Well he didn't so much step on it, rather
              dived on it full length. You see he wrote a book called
              200 Years Together that traced the Jews' colourful
              relationship with the Russian people and especially their
              role in the Bolshevik Revolution and its ensuing murderous
              tyranny.<br>
              <br>
              He didn't pull his punches.&nbsp; He placed Soviet Jews
              centre place in perpetrating the worst mass murders of the
              20th century. While acknowledging that some Jews also
              suffered under this tyranny he clarified that it was not
              as Jews per se, rather that they were in the wrong faction
              at the wrong time. Solzhenitsyn's own estimate for the
              number of Christians (his word) who died was 60 million.<br>
              <br>
              He documented all of this in meticulous detail.... names,
              dates, times. But he did something else, something more
              insidious and dangerous. Something that had strategic
              international consequences for the Tribe. For a start he
              shone a light on the extraordinary Jewish capacity to
              magic themselves into the position of victimhood
              irrespective of their actual accountability. This in turn
              depended on - as he pointedly noted - their uncanny
              ability to seize control of media outlets.&nbsp; "There
              are pages of this history which one does not open without
              trembling. And these are the pages that are systematically
              and purposefully eradicated from the consciousness of the
              Jews."<br>
              <br>
              Other observations that cut to the bone included their
              practice of manipulating the legal framework to reflect
              Jewish interests.&nbsp; (Think "hate" legislation.)
              “Russian people are now confronted by a Jew both as their
              judge and hangman. Why was it that anyone who had the
              misfortune to fall into the hands of the Cheka could count
              with high probability on standing before a Jewish
              investigator or being shot by a Jew?" He meticulously
              debunked Jewish writers who sought to portray Soviet Jews
              as having no choice in what they did. 'Just following
              orders'&nbsp; How ironic is that? He carefully traces the
              ways in which Jews, both within the USSR and
              internationally, favoured and supported Jewish interests
              under the cloak of universalistic altruism.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Sound familiar?</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              I haven't even begun to describe what he wrote in '200
              Years Together' not least because I haven't read it, only
              certain chapters.&nbsp; So why have I not read it? Aha,
              therein lies a tale!&nbsp; You see, Solzhenitsyn's
              legendary status and guarantee of vast sales would in
              normal circumstances have had international publishers
              slavering at the prospect of getting their hands on the
              rights. But none did. None wanted it. It was never
              published in the West. In fact, incredible as it seems it
              has never been formally translated into English! Given
              that English translations exist for almost every
              half-assed writing in the most obscure of languages the
              disappearance of 200 Years Together is mind-blowing. The
              author himself became a non-person just as he had in the
              USSR.<br>
              <br>
              Think about it. It is, as I said, mind-blowing. What sort
              of pressure could have resulted in every Western
              publishing house, every Western TV company, every Western
              magazine being intimidated into passing up such a unique

              COLUMBIA, Mo. – Previous studies have suggested that plant
              growth can be influenced by sound and that plants respond
              to wind and touch. Now, researchers at the University of
              Missouri, in a collaboration that brings together audio
              and chemical analysis, have determined that plants respond
              to the sounds that caterpillars make when eating plants
              and that the plants respond with more defenses.<br>
              <br>
              “Previous research has investigated how plants respond to
              acoustic energy, including music,” said Heidi Appel,
              senior research scientist in the Division of Plant
              Sciences in the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural
              Resources and the Bond Life Sciences Center at MU.
              “However, our work is the first example of how plants
              respond to an ecologically relevant vibration. We found
              that feeding vibrations signal changes in the plant cells’
              metabolism, creating more defensive chemicals that can
              repel attacks from caterpillars.”<br>
              <br>
              Appel collaborated with Rex Cocroft, professor in the
              Division of Biological Sciences at MU. In the study,
              caterpillars were placed on Arabidopsis, a small flowering
              plant related to cabbage and mustard. Using a laser and a
              tiny piece of reflective material on the leaf of the
              plant, Cocroft was able to measure the movement of the
              leaf in response to the chewing caterpillar.<br>
              <br>
              Cocroft and Appel then played back recordings of
              caterpillar feeding vibrations to one set of plants, but
              played back only silence to the other set of plants. When
              caterpillars later fed on both sets of plants, the
              researchers found that the plants previously exposed to
              feeding vibrations produced more mustard oils, a chemical
              that is unappealing to many caterpillars.<br>
              <br>
              “What is remarkable is that the plants exposed to
              different vibrations, including those made by a gentle
              wind or different insect sounds that share some acoustic
              features with caterpillar feeding vibrations did not
              increase their chemical defenses,” Cocroft said. “This
              indicates that the plants are able to distinguish feeding
              vibrations from other common sources of environmental
              vibration.”<br>
              <br>
              Appel and Cocroft say future research will focus on how
              vibrations are sensed by the plants, what features of the
              complex vibrational signal are important, and how the
              mechanical vibrations interact with other forms of plant
              information to generate protective responses to pests.<br>
              <br>
              “Plants have many ways to detect insect attack, but
              feeding vibrations are likely the fastest way for distant
              parts of the plant to perceive the attack and begin to
              increase their defenses,” Cocroft said.<br>
              <br>
              “Caterpillars react to this chemical defense by crawling
              away, so using vibrations to enhance plant defenses could
              be useful to agriculture,” Appel said. “This research also
              opens the window of plant behavior a little wider, showing
              that plants have many of the same responses to outside
              influences that animals do, even though the responses look
              different.”<br>
              <br>
              The study, “Plants respond to leaf vibrations caused by
              insect herbivore chewing,” was funded in part by the
              National Science Foundation and was published in
              Oecologia.<br>

              <br>
              Plant germination and growth can be influenced by sound,
              but the ecological significance of these responses is
              unclear. We asked whether acoustic energy generated by the
              feeding of insect herbivores was detected by plants. We
              report that the vibrations caused by insect feeding can
              elicit chemical defenses. Arabidopsis thaliana (L.)
              rosettes pre-treated with the vibrations caused by
              caterpillar feeding had higher levels of glucosinolate and
              anthocyanin defenses when subsequently fed upon by Pieris
              rapae (L.) caterpillars than did untreated plants. The
              plants also discriminated between the vibrations caused by
              chewing and those caused by wind or insect song. Plants
              thus respond to herbivore-generated vibrations in a
              selective and ecologically meaningful way. A vibration
              signaling pathway would complement the known signaling
              pathways that rely on volatile, electrical, or
              phloem-borne signals. We suggest that vibration may
              represent a new long distance signaling mechanism in
              plant–insect interactions that contributes to systemic
              induction of chemical defenses.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Introduction</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              The effects of sound on plant growth and other traits have
              been recognized for decades, but the ecological
              significance of these responses is unclear. While plant
              responses to wind and touch have been examined and have
              clear adaptive significance (Chehab et al. 2009), plant
              responses to acoustic energy have largely been studied in
              the absence of an ecological context. For example, there
              is a long tradition of exposing plants to musical sound
              (Klein and Edsall 1965; Telewski 2006; Jeong et al. 2004).
              Although music influences growth and germination in some
              plants, music contains such a wide range of frequencies,
              amplitudes and fine-temporal patterns that its usefulness
              as an experimental stimulus is limited. More systematic
              studies have found that some frequencies have a greater
              influence than others (Telewski 2006). For example, young
              roots of corn grow towards the source of continuous tones,
              transmitted as airborne or waterborne sound, and respond
              optimally to frequencies of 200–300 Hz (Gagliano et al.
              2012a). While these studies bring us a step closer to
              being able to link plant responses to acoustic energy to
              ecologically relevant sound sources, the experimental
              stimuli still remain far removed from those produced by
              natural sources of acoustic energy in the plant’s
              environment...<br>

              </b><br>
              In&nbsp; any&nbsp; atoms&nbsp; all&nbsp; s-orbital&nbsp;
              electrons&nbsp; are&nbsp; interpenetrating&nbsp; the&nbsp;
              nuclei&nbsp; then&nbsp; and&nbsp; there&nbsp; interacting
              with protons and neutrons electromagnetically. This
              feature indicates the possible influences of the
              s-electrons on the nuclear kinetics, which is predicted
              already late in the 1930’s as the ß-decay through orbital
              electron capture. This nuclear penetration effect was
              extensively explained in the internal electron conversion
              early in the 1960’s. The electric monopole (E0) isometric
              transition through the internal electron conversion is the
              most typical nuclear penetration effect. The author
              himself was involved in explaining these phenomena from
              1950’s to 1960’s.<br>
              <br>
              The valence s-electrons in the atoms reveal the
              thermodynamic collective features in the spontaneous
              chemical reactions in the liquid solutions. These features
              likely transfer into the nuclear reactions through the
              collective dynamics of valence and mobile s-electrons in
              the thermodynamically stable alloy liquid i.e. solution of
              metallic solvent with valence s-electrons.&nbsp;
              Here&nbsp; macroscopically&nbsp; distinct&nbsp;
              parts&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; valence&nbsp;
              s-electrons&nbsp; fixed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the reactant nuclei
              are correlated and a long range coherence are developed in
              the liquid revealing the collective dynamics of nuclei
              through the interaction with the macroscopically
              correlated valence and mobile s-electrons in the alloy
              liquid.<br>
              <br>
              The&nbsp; first&nbsp; suggestive&nbsp; evidence&nbsp;
              supporting&nbsp; the&nbsp; above&nbsp; consideration&nbsp;
              appeared&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; astronomical research on
              the enormously enhanced pycnonuclear fusion reaction in
              the metallic hydrogen liquid in stars e.g. supernova
              progenitors of white dwarfs. The mechanism of this
              reaction seemed to be the nuclear fusion enhanced by the
              coupled spontaneous chemical&nbsp; reaction&nbsp;
              forming&nbsp; the&nbsp; united&nbsp; atoms&nbsp; in&nbsp;
              the&nbsp; liquid&nbsp; of&nbsp; metal&nbsp; atoms&nbsp;
              with&nbsp; valence s-electrons.&nbsp; Based&nbsp; on&nbsp;
              this&nbsp; conjecture,&nbsp; the&nbsp; author&nbsp;
              observed&nbsp; successfully&nbsp; the&nbsp; enormously
              enhanced fusion reactions in the metallic Li liquids under
              the collaborations with R. Pettersson in Uppsala and T.
              Watanabe in Sakura/Tokyo. The above described
              enhancednuclear reations or transitions are generally
              expected through the spontaneous chemical reactions
              coupled with the nuclear transitions in the
              thermodynamically stable liquids.<br>
              <br>
              The enhanced nuclear transitions - chemonuclear
              reaction/transition called after S. Kullander - open up

              In the latest hilarious example of fake science from a
              dirty, dishonest industry, the so-called National
              Osteoporosis Society — little more than a junk science
              front group for the dirty dairy industry — has declared
              clean eating to be a “dangerous timebomb.” According to
              the group, clean food promotes disease, while the best way
              to support lifelong health is to consume dirty foods such
              as processed milk and cheese that are loaded with
              artificial hormones and pesticides. (I’m not making this
              up. See the link below…)<br>
              <br>
              Right on cue, the dishonest mainstream media now decrees
              clean eating to be a “cult” that could cause horrible
              disease. Anyone who avoids processed sugar, homogenized
              milk, pesticide-laden foods or nutritionally-depleted
              refined starches is now condemned as a “cultist” by the
              hopelessly dishonest (and nutritionally illiterate) media,
              which depends on dairy industry advertising for its
              revenues.<br>
              <br>
              “[T]he charity said many of those following the trends had
              no idea that cutting out major food groups could
              jeopardise their long-term health, with bones still
              developing in early adulthood,” reports The Telegraph in a
              dairy industry propaganda piece that demonizes clean food
              diets. The same article goes on to condemn celebrities
              “who have boasted how they have cut out gluten, dairy,
              grains and refined sugars” as if that’s a horrible sin of
              some kind.<br>
              <br>
              People who choose to eat clean food are further smeared in
              the story which somehow equates clean food with a “poor
              diet,” explaining:<br>
              <br>
              A poor diet for those in their teens and early twenties
              now could see a significant rise in the numbers of people
              suffering fractures and the complications associated with
              them in the future.<br>
              <br>
              The story goes on to ridiculously equate drinking milk
              with preventing osteoporosis while insisting that people
              who eat clean, unprocessed foods are committing
              nutritional suicide.<br>
              <br>
              Yes, The Telegraph is the same UK-based publication that
              openly attacks breastfeeding, falsely declaring that
              breastfeeding does nothing for the IQ of your child while
              promoting anti-breastfeeding propaganda groups that push
              infant formula from globalist food conglomerates. The
              message from The Telegraph? Human breast milk is BAD for
              babies, but processed, homogenized cow’s milk is GREAT for
              children and teens.<br>
              <br>
              Folks, it doesn’t get any more idiotic than this. The
              Telegraph has just labeled itself a media “DUNCE” for life
              (as well as a real danger to the health of UK children who
              might be negatively influenced by the publisher’s
              dangerous nutritional illiteracy). If there’s any
              publication that should be labeled “fake news” on health
              matters, it’s The Telegraph. And this story was authored
              by their Health Editor!<br>
              <br>
              Fact check: Processed MILK does not equal strong bones<br>
              <br>
              The wildly dishonest dairy industry has long attempted to
              equate drinking milk with developing strong bones while
              glossing over the cardiovascular risks of consuming a
              processed, homogenized, pasteurized milk product.<br>
              <br>
              Here are some truths about milk the dairy industry doesn’t
              want you to realize:<br>
              <br>
              Truth #1) Strong bones depend far more on vitamin D than
              milk. Most people get plenty of calcium in their diet, but
              without sufficient vitamin D in your blood, your bones
              can’t efficiently use the calcium you’re consuming.<br>
              <br>
              Truth #2) While raw milk can be very healthy, homogenized
              milk is artificially altered to change the structure of
              the fat molecules, making them more dangerous to your
              health and a major contributing factor to cardiovascular
              disease (and atherosclerosis).<br>
              <br>
              Truth #3) The pasteurization of milk destroys the lactase
              enzymes that make milk more easily digestible by
              consumers. This is one reason why so many people can’t
              consume milk without experiencing extreme mucous, sinus
              congestion and even constipation: They can’t digest the
              product because the lactase has been deactivated, causing
              many people to believe they are lactose-intolerant.<br>
              <br>
              Truth #4) There’s more calcium in a glass of broccoli
              juice than a glass of milk. If you really want calcium and
              other nutrients, raw food juicing is by far the best way
              to get more calcium into your diet. The “milk = calcium”
              myth is a total fabrication of the dishonest dairy
              industry, which has about as much scientific credibility
              as Big Tobacco.<br>
              <br>
              Truth #5) Most commercial dairy operations are cruel,
              inhumane animal factories that subject dairy cows to
              excruciating pain and suffering in order to produce
              corporate profits.<br>
              <br>
              Truth #6) Both BLOOD and PUS are legally allowed in
              commercial milk products. Few consumers know that
              pasteurized milk contains 150 times higher levels of blood
              and pus than fresh, raw milk.<br>
              <br>
              The dairy industry is totally freaking out that people are
              learning the truth about “dirty milk”<br>
              <br>
              As the truth about the deceptions of the factory-run dairy
              industry continues to spread across social media, the
              dairy industry is ramping up its public relations
              propaganda arm, now trying to scare people into drinking
              more milk by claiming their bones will break if they
              don’t. Even more shockingly, by attacking the “clean
              eating” movement that avoids processed dairy and cheese
              products, the dairy industry is admitting its products are
              DIRTY food.<br>
              <br>
              Even more absurdly, the industry insists that you can only
              be healthy if you eat sufficient quantities of their
              “dirty food” which is waning in terms of public demand.<br>
              <br>
              It’s already obvious this deceptive P.R. campaign is going
              to wildly backfire on the dairy industry. Do these
              corporate morons really believe that they can scare people
              into drinking more dirty milk by running around screaming
              that “clean food” is a horribly harmful diet?<br>
              <br>
              It’s just laughable. Pathetic, sad and laughable. If
              anything, all this is yet another great reminder why you
              should never buy factory produced milk or cheese products
              again.<br>
              <br>
              Personally, I’m a fan of making my own almond milk using a
              blender, fresh almonds, a nut milk bag and some water.
              It’s the best-tasting milk in the world, and it’s not
              produced with hormones, GMOs, pesticides or cruelty. If
              you want to consume cow’s milk, get whole, fresh RAW cow’s
              milk from a local farmer (and hope the food police don’t
              arrest you for the “crime” of purchasing real food).<br>

              Here, I lay out how to treat HPV naturally. Much like
              treating herpes, natural antiviral treatments can help.
              There are many home remedies that contain antiviral
              properties, such as herbal supplements, using essential
              oils and eating certain foods. Try these remedies to keep
              HPV symptoms at bay.<br>
              <br>
              <b>1. Diet</b><br>
              <br>
              Eat a wart-removal diet filled with lots of antiviral
              herbs. Help prevent or get rid of warts by consuming
              immune-boosting foods:<br>
              <br>
              Foods high in vitamin C, such as citrus fruits, bell
              peppers and strawberries<br>
              Probiotic foods like fermented vegetables, such as kimchi
              or sauerkraut and live-cultured yogurt and Greek yogurt<br>
              Green leafy vegetables, which provide vitamin A and
              important minerals<br>
              High-selenium foods, such as Brazil nuts and mushrooms<br>
              Raw cheeses made from goat’s milk, sheep’s milk and A2
              cow’s milk<br>
              Kvass, a fermented drink made from rye bread with
              lactobacilli probiotics and has blood- and liver-cleansing
              properties<br>
              Kombucha, a fermented tea high rich in probiotics and B
              vitamins<br>
              Goat’s milk kefir or coconut kefir — contain lots of
              probiotics; the goat’s milk version has more than the
              coconut version, which is dairy-free<br>
              <br>
              <b>2. Antiviral Herbs</b><br>
              <br>
              Ingest or apply antiviral herbs to boost the immune system
              and inhibit viruses, as well as to provide cardiovascular,
              digestive and anti-inflammatory support. You can consume
              antiviral herbs as herbal teas, infusions or
              herbal-infused oils. The top 10 antiviral herbs are:<br>
              <br>
              Elderberry<br>
              Echinacea<br>
              Calendula<br>
              Garlic<br>
              Astragalus root<br>
              Cat’s claw<br>
              Ginger<br>
              Licorice root<br>
              Olive leaf<br>
              Oregano and oregano oil<br>
              <br>
              Goldenseal is another herbal option, which is a great
              antimicrobial that acts as an effective natural antibiotic
              and immune system booster.<br>

          </b>This is the second installment of the series: Cosmic
          Climate Change, from Cygni Ice Age Climate 'University.'<br>
          <br>
          The focus is on the now increasing Climate Change in the world
          resulting from the now rapidly weakening Sun, and the
          consequent increase in solar cosmic-ray flux that enormously
          increases the cloud-forming intensity, and with it increases
          flooding, droughts, and hurricanes, all with near unimaginable
          effects in the immediate future. Fortunately there is a
          solution possible, in a manner by which we will come out
          richer, more secure, and with a satisfying future versus
          having no future at all. The potential solution may even
          prevent nuclear war. This too, is vital, with nuclear war now
          being evermore on the agenda, which is unsurvivable in the
          long run.<br>

          <div align="center"><b>A new study published in the Journal of
              Neuroscience found that there's a direct link between
              nasal breathing and our cognitive function...</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          The scientists began by testing the electrical brain signals
          of seven epilepsy patients with electrodes in their brains.
          Their findings showed that the rhythms of the participants'
          natural breathing matched the slow electrical rhythms in their
          brain regions associated with their sense of smell.<br>
          <br>
          The scientists also noted that<b> during nasal inhalation, the
            fast electrical rhythms in the amygdala, responsible for our
            ability to process emotions, and the hippocampus, associated
            with memories and emotions, became stronger.</b><b><br>
          </b><b> </b><br>
          To gain a better understanding of their research, the
          scientists then examined an additional 60 healthy participants
          to discover the effects nasal breathing has on memory and
          emotional behaviour. The participants were shown both scared
          and surprised faces, and then they had to immediately
          determine the emotional expression of the face they just saw.
          As it turned out, the <b>participants were able to identify
            the scared faces much faster when they were inhaling through
            the nose than when they were shown the images when exhaling
            or when breathing through the mouth.</b><br>
          <br>
          The scientists also tested the participants by showing them
          images and then asking them to recall them later. The <b>
            participants were much better at recalling the original
            images if they were shown them on an inhale breath through
            the nose.</b><br>
          <br>
          The study's findings suggest that the act of nasal breathing
          plays an integral role in coordinationg electrical brain
          signals in the olfactory "smell" cortex, the brain regions
          that receive input from our nose. It's clear that the act of
          breathing through the nose, even when we don't smell anything,
          can still affect our emotions and memory... <br>

                solar power to produce clean hydrogen from biomass</b></font><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          A team of scientists at the University of Cambridge has
          developed a way of using solar power to generate a fuel that
          is both sustainable and relatively cheap to produce. It’s
          using natural light to generate hydrogen from biomass.<br>
          <br>
          One of the challenges facing modern society is what it does
          with its waste products. As natural resources decline in
          abundance, using waste for energy is becoming more pressing
          for both governments and business.<br>
          <br>
          Biomass has been a source of heat and energy since the
          beginning of recorded history.&nbsp; The planet’s oil reserves
          are derived from ancient biomass which has been subjected to
          high pressures and temperatures over millions of years.
          Lignocellulose is the main component of plant biomass and up
          to now its conversion into hydrogen has only been achieved
          through a gasification process which uses high temperatures to
          decompose it fully.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Dr Moritz Kuehnel, from the Department of Chemistry at the
          University of Cambridge, joint lead author on a new research
          paper published in Nature Energy, says:<br>
          <br>
          "Lignocellulose is nature's equivalent to armoured concrete.
          It consists of strong, highly crystalline cellulose fibres,
          that are interwoven with lignin and hemicellulose which act as
          a glue. This rigid structure has evolved to give plants and
          trees mechanical stability and protect them from degradation,
          and makes chemical utilisation of lignocellulose so
          challenging."<br>
          <br>
          The new technology relies on a simple photocatalytic
          conversion process. Catalytic nanoparticles are added to
          alkaline water in which the biomass is suspended. This is then
          placed in front of a light in the lab which mimics solar
          light. The solution is ideal for absorbing this light and
          converting the biomass into gaseous hydrogen which can then be
          collected from the headspace. The hydrogen is free of
          fuel-cell inhibitors, such as carbon monoxide, which allows it
          to be used for power.<br>
          <br>
          The nanoparticle is able to absorb energy from solar light and
          use it to undertake complex chemical reactions. In this case,
          it rearranges the atoms in the water and biomass to form
          hydrogen fuel and other organic chemicals, such as formic acid
          and carbonate.<br>
          <br>
          Joint lead author, Dr David Wakerley, also of the Department
          of Chemistry, says:<br>
          <br>
          “There’s a lot of chemical energy stored in raw biomass, but
          it’s unrefined, so you can’t expect it to work in complicated
          machinery, such as a car engine. Our system is able to convert
          the long, messy structures that make up biomass into hydrogen
          gas, which is much more useful. We have specifically designed
          a combination of catalyst and solution that allows this
          transformation to occur using sunlight as a source of energy.
          With this in place we can simply add organic matter to the
          system and then, provided it’s a sunny day, produce hydrogen
          fuel.”<br>
          <br>
          The team used different types of biomass in their experiments.
          Pieces of wood, paper and leaves were placed in test tubes and
          exposed to solar light. The biomass didn’t require any
          processing beforehand.<br>
          <br>
          The technology was developed in the Christian Doppler
          Laboratory for Sustainable SynGas Chemistry at the University
          of Cambridge. The head of the laboratory, Dr. Erwin Reisner,
          adds:<br>
          <br>
          “Our sunlight-powered technology is exciting as it enables the
          production of clean hydrogen from unprocessed biomass under
          ambient conditions. We see it as a new and viable alternative
          to high temperature gasification and other renewable means of
          hydrogen production.<br>
          <br>
          Future development can be envisioned at any scale, from small
          scale devices for off-grid applications to industrial-scale
          plants, and we are currently exploring a range of potential
          commercial options."<br>
          <br>
          With the help of Cambridge Enterprise, the commercialisation
          arm of the University, a UK patent application has been filed
          and talks are under way with a potential commercial partner.<br>

          </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
          <br>
          Lignocellulose is Earth’s most abundant form of biomass and
          its valorization to H2 is a key objective for the generation
          of renewable fuels. Solar-driven photocatalytic reforming of
          lignocellulose to H2 at ambient temperature offers a
          sustainable route towards this goal, but this reaction is
          currently limited to noble-metal-containing systems that
          operate with low activity under ultraviolet light. Here, we
          report the light-driven photoreforming of cellulose,
          hemicellulose and lignin to H2 using semiconducting cadmium
          sulfide quantum dots in alkaline aqueous solution. We show
          that basic conditions cause these dots to become coated with
          oxide/hydroxide in situ, presenting a strategy to improve
          their photocatalytic performance. The system operates under
          visible light, is stable beyond six days and is even able to
          reform unprocessed lignocellulose, such as wood and paper,
          under solar irradiation at room temperature, presenting an
          inexpensive route to drive aqueous proton reduction to H2
          through waste biomass oxidation.<br>

              Fibromyalgia Syndrome – Prospective Clinical Trial</b><br>
            <br>

          </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
          <br>
          Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) is a persistent and debilitating
          disorder estimated to impair the quality of life of 2–4% of
          the population, with 9:1 female-to-male incidence ratio. FMS
          is an important representative example of central nervous
          system sensitization and is associated with abnormal brain
          activity. Key symptoms include chronic widespread pain,
          allodynia and diffuse tenderness, along with fatigue and sleep
          disturbance. The syndrome is still elusive and refractory. The
          goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of hyperbaric
          oxygen therapy (HBOT) on symptoms and brain activity in FMS.<br>
          Methods and Findings<br>
          <br>
          A prospective, active control, crossover clinical trial.
          Patients were randomly assigned to treated and crossover
          groups: The treated group patients were evaluated at baseline
          and after HBOT. Patients in the crossover-control group were
          evaluated three times: baseline, after a control period of no
          treatment, and after HBOT. Evaluations consisted of physical
          examination, including tender point count and pain threshold,
          extensive evaluation of quality of life, and single photon
          emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging for evaluation of
          brain activity. The HBOT protocol comprised 40 sessions, 5
          days/week, 90 minutes, 100% oxygen at 2ATA. Sixty female
          patients were included, aged 21–67 years and diagnosed with
          FMS at least 2 years earlier. HBOT in both groups led to
          significant amelioration of all FMS symptoms, with significant
          improvement in life quality. Analysis of SPECT imaging
          revealed rectification of the abnormal brain activity:
          decrease of the hyperactivity mainly in the posterior region
          and elevation of the reduced activity mainly in frontal areas.
          No improvement in any of the parameters was observed following
          the control period.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Conclusions</b><br>
          <br>
          The study provides evidence that HBOT can improve the symptoms
          and life quality of FMS patients. Moreover, it shows that HBOT
          can induce neuroplasticity and significantly rectify abnormal
          brain activity in pain related areas of FMS patients.<br>

          Rice University part of Israel study to test novel treatment
          for little-understood condition<br>
          <br>
          Women who suffer from fibromyalgia benefit from a treatment
          regimen in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, according to
          researchers at Rice University and institutes in Israel.<br>
          <br>
          A clinical trial involving women diagnosed with fibromyalgia
          showed the painful condition improved in every one of the 48
          who completed two months of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Brain
          scans of the women before and after treatment gave credence to
          the theory that abnormal conditions in pain-related areas of
          the brain may be responsible for the syndrome.<br>
          <br>
          Results of the study appear in the open-access journal PLOS
          One.<br>
          <br>
          Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain syndrome that can be
          accompanied by – and perhaps related to – other physical and
          mental conditions that include fatigue, cognitive impairment,
          irritable bowel syndrome and sleep disturbance.<br>
          <br>
          More than 90 percent of those diagnosed with the syndrome are
          women, said Eshel Ben-Jacob, a lead author of the
          proof-of-concept study who developed the analytical method
          used to show the association between patients’ improvement and
          changes in their brains. He is an adjunct professor of
          biosciences at Rice University, a senior investigator at
          Rice’s Center for Theoretical Biological Physics and a
          professor of physics and member of the Sagol School of
          Neuroscience at Tel Aviv University.<br>
          <br>
          “Symptoms in about 70 percent of the women who took part have
          to do with the interpretation of pain in their brains,”
          Ben-Jacob said. “They’re the ones who showed the most
          improvement with hyperbaric oxygen treatment. We found
          significant changes in their brain activity.”<br>
          <br>
          Scientists have not pinned down the syndrome’s cause, although
          another recent PLOS One study identified a possible RNA-based
          biomarker for its diagnosis. A variety of treatments from
          drugs to lifestyle changes have been tried to relieve
          patients’ suffering, with limited success, Ben-Jacob said.<br>
          <br>
          “Most people have never heard of fibromyalgia,” he said. “And
          many who have, including some medical doctors, don’t admit
          that this is a real disorder. I learned from my M.D. friends
          that this is not the only case in which disorders that target
          mainly women raise skepticism in the medical community as to
          whether they’re real or not. However, these days there are
          increasing efforts to understand the effect of gender on body
          disorders.”<br>
          <br>
          Researchers at the Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and
          Research at the Assaf Harofeh Medical Center and Tel Aviv
          University were studying post-traumatic brain injury patients
          when they realized hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) could
          help patients with fibromyalgia.<br>
          <br>
          “Patients who had fibromyalgia in addition to their
          post-concussion symptoms had complete resolution of the
          symptoms,” said Dr. Shai Efrati, who noted his own mother
          suffers from the syndrome. Efrati is lead author of the study,
          head of the research and development unit at the Assaf Harofeh
          Medical Center and a member of the Sagol School of
          Neuroscience at Tel Aviv University.<br>
          <br>
          Hyperbaric oxygen chambers that expose patients to pure oxygen
          at higher-than-atmospheric pressures are commonly used to
          treat patients with embolisms, burns, carbon monoxide
          poisoning and decompression sickness (known to divers as “the
          bends”), among many other conditions.<br>
          <br>
          One effect of exposure is to push more oxygen into a patient’s
          bloodstream, which delivers it to the brain. Efrati’s earlier
          trials found HBOT induces neuroplasticity that leads to repair
          of chronically impaired brain functions and improved quality
          of life for post-stroke and mild traumatic brain injury
          patients, even years after the initial injury.<br>
          <br>
          Ben-Jacob said two patients spearheaded the push for the
          study. One was an Oxford graduate student who developed
          fibromyalgia after suffering a traumatic brain injury in a
          train crash. “By chance, the secretary of the department where
          she worked is the mother of the nurse in charge of the HBOT.
          She said you have to go and try to do it,” he recalled.<br>
          <br>
          The other, he said, is a professor of sociology who
          specializes in post-traumatic stress disorders due to child
          abuse. The professor had suffered from fibromyalgia for many
          years. Her symptoms got worse through the initial treatments –
          a common experience for other patients in the study who she
          said had suppressed memories due to child abuse – before they
          got better. But by the end of treatment both women showed
          remarkable improvement, Ben-Jacob said.<br>
          <br>
          Efrati said some patients will likely require follow-up
          sessions. “The abnormalities in brain regions responsible for
          the chronic pain sensation in fibromyalgia patients can be
          triggered by different events,” he said. “Accordingly, the
          long-term response may be different.<br>
          <br>
          “We have learned, for example, that when fibromyalgia is
          triggered by traumatic brain injury, we can expect complete
          resolution without any need for further treatment. However,
          when the trigger is attributed to other causes, such as
          fever-related diseases, patients will probably need periodic
          maintenance therapy.”<br>
          <br>
          The clinical trial involved 60 women who had been diagnosed
          with fibromyalgia at least two years earlier. A dozen left the
          trial for various reasons, but half of the 48 patients who
          completed it received 40 HBOT treatments five days a week over
          two months. The 90-minute treatments exposed patients to pure
          oxygen at two times the atmospheric pressure.<br>
          <br>
          The other half were part of what Ben-Jacob called a
          crossover-control group. They were evaluated before the trial
          and after a control period that saw no improvement in their
          conditions. After the two-month control, they were given the
          same HBOT treatment as the first group and experienced the
          same relief, according to the researchers.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers noted the successful treatment enabled
          patients to drastically reduce or even eliminate their use of
          pain medications. “The intake of the drugs eased the pain but
          did not reverse the condition, while HBOT did reverse the
          condition,” the researchers wrote.<br>
          <br>
          Efrati said the findings warrant further study. “The results
          are of significant importance since, unlike the current
          treatments offered for fibromyalgia patients, HBOT is not
          aiming for just symptomatic improvement,” he said. “HBOT is
          aiming for the actual cause — the brain pathology responsible
          for the syndrome. It means that brain repair, including even
          neuronal regeneration, is possible even for chronic,
          long-lasting pain syndromes, and we can and should aim for
          that in any future treatment development.”<br>

          The waste fibres from hemp crops can be transformed into
          high-performance energy storage devices, scientists say.<br>
          <br>
          They "cooked" cannabis bark into carbon nanosheets and built
          supercapacitors "on a par with or better than graphene" - the
          industry gold standard.<br>
          <br>
          Electric cars and power tools could harness this hemp
          technology, the US researchers say.<br>
          <br>
          They presented their work at the American Chemical Society
          meeting in San Francisco.<br>
          <br>
          "People ask me: why hemp? I say, why not?" said Dr David
          Mitlin of Clarkson University, New York, who describes his

          "We're making graphene-like materials for a thousandth of the
          price - and we're doing it with waste.<br>
          <br>
          "The hemp we use is perfectly legal to grow. It has no THC in
          it at all - so there's no overlap with any recreational
          activities."<br>
          <br>
          <b>Secret sauce</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          In countries including China, Canada and the UK, hemp can be
          grown industrially for clothing and building materials.<br>
          <br>
          But the leftover bast fibre - the inner bark - typically ends
          up as landfill.<br>
          <br>
          Dr Mitlin's team took these fibres and recycled them into
          supercapacitors - energy storage devices which are
          transforming the way electronics are powered.<br>
          <br>
          Conventional batteries store large reservoirs of energy and
          drip-feed it slowly, whereas supercapacitors can rapidly
          discharge their entire load.<br>
          <br>
          They are ideal in machines that rely on sharp bursts of power.
          In electric cars, for example, supercapacitors are used for
          regenerative braking.<br>
          <br>
          Releasing this torrent requires electrodes with high surface
          area - one of graphene's many phenomenal properties.<br>
          <br>
          Stronger than diamond, more conductive than copper and more
          flexible than rubber, the "miracle material" was the target of
          a £50m investment by UK Chancellor George Osborne.<br>
          <br>
          But while this carbon monolayer is the state-of-the-art
          material for commercial supercapacitors, it is prohibitively
          expensive to produce.<br>
          <br>
          Finding cheap, sustainable alternatives is the speciality of
          Dr Mitlin's former research group at the University of
          Alberta.<br>
          <br>
          They have experimented with all flavours of biowaste - from
          peat moss to eggs. Most recently, they turned banana peel into
          batteries.<br>
          <br>
          You can do really interesting things with bio-waste. We've
          pretty much figured out the secret sauce of it," said Dr
          Mitlin.<br>
          <br>
          The trick is to tailor the right plant fibre to the right
          electrical device - according to their organic structure.<br>
          <br>
          "With banana peels, you can turn them into a dense block of
          carbon - we call it pseudo-graphite - and that's great for
          sodium ion batteries," he explained.<br>
          <br>
          "But if you look at hemp fibre its structure is the opposite -
          it makes sheets with high surface area - and that's very
          conducive to supercapacitors."<br>
          <br>
          The first step, he explained, "is to cook it - almost like a
          pressure cooker. It's called hydrothermal synthesis.<br>
          <br>
          "Once you dissolve the lignin and the semicellulose, it leaves
          these carbon nanosheets - a pseudo-graphene structure."<br>
          <br>
          By fabricating these sheets into electrodes and adding an
          ionic liquid as the electrolyte, his team made supercapacitors
          which operate at a broad range of temperatures and a high
          energy density.<br>
          <br>
          Direct comparisons with rival devices are complicated by the
          variety of measures for performance.<br>
          <br>
          But Mitlin's peer-reviewed journal paper ranks the device "on
          par with or better than commercial graphene-based devices".<br>
          <br>
          "They work down to 0C and display some of the best
          power-energy combinations reported in the literature for any
          carbon.<br>
          <br>
          "For example, at a very high power density of 20 kW/kg
          (kilowatt per kilo) and temperatures of 20, 60, and 100C, the
          energy densities are 19, 34, and 40 Wh/kg (watt-hours per
          kilo) respectively."<br>
          <br>
          Fully assembled, their energy density is 12 Wh/kg, which can
          be achieved at a charge time less than six seconds.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Growth industry</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          "Obviously hemp can't do all the things graphene can," Dr
          Mitlin concedes.<br>
          <br>
          "But for energy storage, it works just as well. And it costs a
          fraction of the price -$500-1,000 a tonne."<br>
          <br>
          Having established a proof of principle, his start-up company
          Alta Supercaps is hoping to begin small-scale manufacturing.<br>
          <br>
          It plans to market devices to the oil and gas industries -
          where high-temperature operation is a valuable asset.<br>
          <br>
          His move to the US coincides with a change in regulatory
          attitudes - with signs that hemp could be making a comeback.<br>
          <br>
          In China the crop is widely cultivated, and in Canada, the
          industry for textiles is growing.<br>
          <br>
          "Fifty miles down the road from my house in Alberta there was
          an agricultural hemp processing facility. And all that bast
          fibre - it just sits in a high bay, and they don't know what
          to do with it," Dr Mitlin told BBC News.<br>
          <br>
          "It's a waste product looking for a value-added application.
          People are almost paying you to take it away."<br>
          <br>
          And if the technology really takes off - it could help
          economies, he argues.<br>
          <br>
          "It's a robust plant - you can even grow it in Alberta,
          Manitoba.<br>
          <br>
          "A lot of farmers would be thrilled to grow hemp."<br>

              Colon and Stomach Tumor Growth Cold</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          A team of Australian researchers have discovered a new method
          to fight colon and stomach cancer. Their technique involves
          inhibiting a protein that cancer cells use to rapidly
          reproduce.<br>
          <br>
          "Our discovery could potentially offer a new and complementary
          approach to chemotherapy and immunotherapy as options for
          treating gastrointestinal cancers," said professor Matthias
          Ernst, scientific director at the Olivia Newton-John Cancer
          Research Institute, in a statement.<br>
          <br>
          Hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK) is an enzyme that helps stem
          cells become blood cells – hematopoietic cells are the stem
          cells that all blood cells start as. One type of blood cells
          that HCK helps to code are macrophages, "big eater" white
          blood cells whose job is to consume and destroy anything that
          impedes healthy blood, such as cellular debris, microbes and
          cancer cells.<br>
          <br>
          But when tumors form, macrophages unwillingly are turned into
          some of cancer's most effective soldiers.They are altered by
          tumorous cells into becoming cells that assist in forming and
          growing tumors. Ernst says that his team found that "the more
          HCK activity a macrophage has, the more it nurtures cancer
          cell growth and survival."<br>
          <br>
          The solution was simple. By injecting a small drug-like
          molecule that acts as an HCK inhibitor, the team found that
          tumor growth stopped cold in the animals they were testing.<br>
          <br>
          Colorectal cancer is the second deadliest form of cancer in
          the United States, losing only to lung cancer. It is
          notoriously resistant to conventional forms of treatment. <br>
          <br>
          But the findings at the Olivia Newton-John Institute offer a
          "new approach to possibly overcome this resistance," according
          to Niall Tebbutt, head of medical oncology at the center. <br>
          <br>
          This treatment is still in preclinical trials, however, and is
          nowhere near viability as a cancer drug. But the research does
          show promise for the future treatment of colon cancer as well
          as for stomach cancer, which is rarer but has a very high
          mortality rate.<br>

              Invent Nanoparticles That Kill Cancer</b><br>

            <i>Breakthrough: Experimental New Treatment Kills Cancer
              Cells, Skips Healthy Ones</i><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Russian scientists have proposed a new kind of cancer
          treatment based on nanoparticles which induce more damage to
          cancer cells than conventional treatments and may even work on
          cells which are resistant to drugs. <br>
          <br>
          The nanoparticles are made from cytochrome, an enzyme, and
          cardiolipin, a key part of a cell's inner mitochondrial
          membrane.<br>
          <br>
          In a cell culture, researchers from Moscow State University,
          Northeastern University in Boston and the Russian Academy of
          Sciences demonstrated that the nanoparticles stimulate the
          death of cancer cells by acting on the cell membrane and/or

          journal Pharmaceutical Research.<br>

          "This complex exists in normal cells, where it is used to

          </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b><b>Purpose</b><br>
          <br>
          The effect of existing anti-cancer therapies is based mainly
          on the stimulation of apoptosis in cancer cells. Here, we have
          demonstrated the ability of a catalytically-reactive
          nanoparticle-based complex of cytochrome c with cardiolipin
          (Cyt-CL) to induce the apoptosis and killing of cancer cells
          in a monolayer cell culture.<br>
          <b><br>
            Methods</b><br>
          <br>
          Cyt-CL nanoparticles were prepared by complexing CytC with
          different molar excesses of CL. Following characterization,
          cytotoxicity and apoptosis inducing effects of nanoparticles
          were investigated. In an attempt to identify the anticancer
          activity mechanism of Cyt-CL, pseudo-lipoxygenase and
          lipoperoxidase reaction kinetics were measured by
          chemiluminescence.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Results</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Using chemiluminescence, we have demonstrated that the Cyt-CL
          complex produces lipoperoxide radicals in two reactions: by
          decomposition of lipid hydroperoxides, and by lipid
          peroxidation under the action of H2O2. Antioxidants inhibited
          the formation of lipid radicals. Cyt-CL nanoparticles, but not
          the CytC alone, dramatically enhanced the level of apoptosis
          and cell death in two cell lines: drug-sensitive (A2780) and
          doxorubicin-resistant (A2780-Adr). The proposed mechanism of
          the cytotoxic action of Cyt-CL involves either penetration
          through the cytoplasm and outer mitochondrial membrane and
          catalysis of lipid peroxidation reactions at the inner
          mitochondrial membrane, or/and activation of lipid
          peroxidation within the cytoplasmic membrane.<br>
          <b><br>
            Conclusions</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Here we propose a new type of anticancer nano-formulation,
          with an action based on the catalytic action of Cyt-CL
          nanoparticles on the cell membrane and and/or mitochondrial
          membranes that results in lipid peroxidation reactions, which
          give rise to activation of apoptosis in cancer cells,
          including multidrug resistant cells.<br>

          <br>
          When it comes to future challenges, one of the biggest will be
          water scarcity - on a warming planet we're going to have
          plenty of seawater, but not enough fresh, clean water in the
          right places for everybody to drink.<br>
          <br>
          And while a lot of research has focussed on desalination, a
          team of scientists have now come up with another possible
          solution - a device that pulls fresh water out of thin air,
          even in places with humidity as low as 20 percent. All it
          needs is sunlight.<br>
          <br>
          It might sound too good to be true, but so far the research is
          solid. Called the 'solar-powered harvester', the device was
          created by teams from MIT and the University of California,
          Berkeley, using a special type of material known as a
          metal-organic framework (MOF).<br>
          <br>
          To be clear, it's only in the prototype phase right now and
          has been tested in pretty limited situations, but the results
          so far have just been published in Science.<br>
          <br>
          "This is a major breakthrough in the long-standing challenge
          of harvesting water from the air at low humidity," said one of
          the researchers, Omar Yaghi from UC Berkeley.<br>
          <br>
          "There is no other way to do that right now, except by using
          extra energy. Your electric dehumidifier at home 'produces'
          very expensive water."<br>
          <br>
          Two-thirds of the world's population is currently experiencing
          a shortage of clean water, but it's estimated that there's
          about 13,000 trillion litres of water worldwide present in the
          air all around us.<br>
          <br>
          So far the prototype device has been tested under conditions
          of 20 to 30 percent humidity, and was able to pull 2.8 litres
          (3 quarts) of water from the air over a 12- hour period, using
          1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of MOF.<br>
          <br>
          Successful tests have also been conducted on the rooftop at
          MIT, showing that it works in real-world conditions.<br>
          <br>
          The team says that the device could easily be scaled up to
          provide a family with their freshwater needs for the day.<br>
          <br>
          "One vision for the future is to have water off-grid, where
          you have a device at home running on ambient solar for
          delivering water that satisfies the needs of a household,"
          said Yaghi.<br>
          <br>
          "To me, that will be made possible because of this experiment.
          I call it personalised water."<br>
          <br>
          Yaghi worked on the first MOF more than 20 years ago. Unlike
          regular sheets of metals, MOFs are structures where metals
          such as magnesium or aluminium are combined with organic
          molecules in an arrangement that creates rigid, porous
          structures ideal for storing gases or liquids.<br>
          <br>
          Since then, more than 20,000 different kinds of MOFs have been
          created by researchers around the world, and are already being
          used to capture CO2, and efficiently store chemicals such as
          hydrogen or methane.<br>
          <br>
          The MOF used in the solar-powered harvester, shown above, was
          synthesised in 2014, and contains a combination of zirconium
          metal and adipic acid, which binds water vapour. <br>
          <br>
          The MIT team then took dust-sized crystals of this MOF and
          compressed them between a solar absorber and a condenser
          plate, and placed the whole thing inside a chamber that was
          exposed to the outside air.<br>
          <br>
          As ambient air diffuses through the MOF crystals, water
          molecules attach to the interior surfaces. X-ray diffraction
          studies of the system have shown that the water vapour
          molecules often gather in groups of eight, forming cubes.<br>
          <br>
          Sunlight then heats the MOF up and pushes the bound water
          towards the condenser, which is the same temperature as the
          outside air. This vapour condenses as liquid water, and drips
          into a collector to provide clean drinking water.<br>
          <br>
          "This work offers a new way to harvest water from air that
          does not require high relative humidity conditions and is much
          more energy efficient than other existing technologies," said
          MIT team leader, Evelyn Wang.<br>
          <br>
          While it sounds pretty awesome already, the team admits
          there's a lot of room for improvement and fine-tuning, to make
          the device even more efficient.<br>
          <br>
          Right now, the MOF can only absorb 20 percent of its weight in
          water, but other MOF materials could potentially absorb more
          than 40 percent.<br>
          <br>
          The material can also be tweaked to be more effective at
          higher or lower humidity levels.<br>
          <br>
          "It's not just that we made a passive device that sits there
          collecting water; we have now laid both the experimental and
          theoretical foundations so that we can screen other MOFs,
          thousands of which could be made, to find even better
          materials," said Yaghi.<br>
          <br>
          "There is a lot of potential for scaling up the amount of
          water that is being harvested. It is just a matter of further
          engineering now."<br>
          <br>
          "To have water running all the time, you could design a system
          that absorbs the humidity during the night and evolves it
          during the day," he added.<br>
          <br>
          "Or design the solar collector to allow for this at a much
          faster rate, where more air is pushed in. We wanted to
          demonstrate that if you are cut off somewhere in the desert,
          you could survive because of this device."<br>
          <br>
          "A person needs about a Coke can of water per day. That is
          something one could collect in less than an hour with this
          system."<br>
          <br>

          </b><br>
          Atmospheric water is a resource equivalent to ~10% of all
          fresh water in lakes on Earth. However, an efficient process
          for capturing and delivering water from air, especially at low
          humidity levels (down to 20%), has not been developed. We
          report the design and demonstration of a device based on
          porous metal-organic framework-801 [Zr6O4(OH)4(fumarate)6]
          that captures water from the atmosphere at ambient conditions
          using low-grade heat from natural sunlight below one sun (1 kW
          per square meter). This device is capable of harvesting 2.8
          liters of water per kilogram of MOF daily at relative humidity
          levels as low as 20%, and requires no additional input of
          energy.<br>

            </b></b>Can we afford it? Not social housing, but universal
          free housing by the millions! Can we continue without?<br>
          <br>
          High quality housing is a corner stone of civilization. It is
          critical for developing the human potential. It is a key
          investment by society into itself. It is the Credit Society
          Principle expressed. Scientific and cultural development of
          the human being is not possible in an environment of
          homelessness, slum living, rent slavery, and so on. For
          civilization to develop, society needs to invest into its
          self-development. Society is its own greatest asset. To
          develop this asset to its utmost potential is the foundation
          for civilization. Without it, civilization cannot stand, and
          mankind has no future. Slum living, not to mention
          homelessness, destroys a society. It disables the human
          potential. A farmer will have a poor harvest if he puts no
          seeds into his fields, or just a few seeds of poor quality.
          Civilization is society's harvest of the 'seeds' it plants.<br>
          <br>
          The quality of housing is a chief factor in the dimension of
          civilization. A lack of housing, or unlivable conditions, or
          unaffordable housing, destroys civilization. This lack is
          therefore one of the greatest barrier a society can impose on
          its self-development and the wealth of its civilization.<br>
          <br>
          But how can we upgrade the current state of housing, which is
          in a state of crisis? The cost of housing has risen
          astronomically to the point that society has become enslaved,
          just to meet the housing cost, and even then, evermore people
          can't afford any housing at all. <br>
          <br>
          On this universally enslaving basis there is no economic
          recovery possible whereby society is increasingly doomed to
          decay. Desperation becomes the outcome, and crime,
          hopelessness, depression, and disease set in. By society
          tolerating poor quality housing (or none at all) it is wasting
          the most precious asset is has, which is itself and its human
          development potential.<br>
          <br>
          This should have been recognized a long time ago, and been
          addressed as a strategic defense of the nation, and it can
          still be done. <br>
          <br>
          Of course I'm not talking about cutting down trees and sawing
          them into planks to be nailed together laboriously. Nor are
          there enough trees left in the world to meet the global need,
          much less to facilitate the relocation of entire nations when
          the 'nearby' Ice Age glaciation stets in. I am talking about
          high energy intensive automated production. I am talking about
          highly modularized houses, constructed in completely automated
          assembly processes. Wood construction is archaic. I'm thinking
          of new materials, the kind that no one owns, a global resource
          that number of countries have in infinite abundance. I am
          talking about building houses of basalt and glass. Basalt has
          a ten times higher tensile strength than steel. I'm talking
          about the new houses made cast and extruded modules of glass
          fiber reinforced basalt. The modules would be fully insulated,
          with basalt micro fibers. Basalt fibers are a three times
          better thermal insulator than asbestos is, which is too
          dangerous to use.<br>
          <br>
          Sure basalt is just stone, a volcanic stone. But it's more
          than just stone. It's an extremely fine-grained stone and is
          very dense, and hard. It is stronger and less brittle than
          glass, and its melting point is 500 degrees below the melting
          point of high quality glass so that it can be reinforced with
          glass fibers when needed, for extreme strength. It's also
          nicely fluid when melted. It can be extruded into fibers, even
          micro <br>
          fibers, or any other shape you can imagine, such as wall
          panels, roof modules. Basalt is the perfect stuff for
          automated fabrication, and it i<br>
          s better in quality than anything on the market is today. What
          makes basalt an even more ideal building material is the fact
          that there is plenty of basalt right in the backyard of the
          USA. <br>
          <br>
          The Columbia River Basin contains more than 150,000 cubic
          kilometers of this top grade building material. That's enough
          to cover the entire USA twelve meters deep. Nor would one need
          to dig into the ground to get to it. It's sitting on the
          surface. All one needs to do is pick it up, melt it, and
          reshape it into whatever one wants to make of it. And the
          material is 100% useable. No waste products result, or
          pollution during the <br>
          processing. The only input that one needs is basalt and
          process heat. Basalt melts at 1,200 degrees Celsius. High
          quality glass melts as 1,700 degrees. One can easily get this
          kind of process heat from nuclear power. Also, ceramic
          materials have been developed that remain structural strong
          way past the 2,000 degree range to facilitate the processes.<br>
          <br>
          The leading edge Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor, which has
          been tested successfully for five years in the 1950s, would be
          ideal for that. It provides 500 degree process heat with a
          high energy flux density. The heat can be pumped up through
          heat pump concentrators to get the kind of heat that melts
          basalt, and also steel, glass, and a lot of other things as
          well. On this basis automated mass production is achievable
          for the new housing units that are urgently required as a
          first step to jumpstart the world. The new housing units would
          be produced with the same efficiency with which egg cartons
          are produced today. Of course, one wouldn't build just those
          tens of millions of units needed to eradicate homeless and
          slum living.<br>
          <br>
          I am thinking abut the need to create many new cities in the
          wide open areas that are presently empty desert lands that are
          ideally suited for the large scale industrial development that
          new materials and energy resources facilitate. For this also
          millions of new houses are needed of about 1,500 to 2,000
          square feet in floor area for efficient family living.<br>
          <br>
          The point here is that we don't just face a crisis in terms of
          homeless living, but also in slum type living, and in areas
          far too distant to commute for efficient living. Many of the
          slum places that people are forced to live in for the lack of
          anything else, aren't fit for human habitation, much less for
          human development. In this respect the housing scene is fast
          becoming a crime scene of horrendous crimes against humanity.
          We probably need to build several million new free houses to
          start with, just to end this crime and dig the nation out of
          its slum hole. With large scale automated production, powered
          with nuclear power, that's easily accomplished.<br>
          <br>
          It is even possible to make the needed furniture's in a
          similar fashion, including beds, possible also clothing, and
          even shoes. I can see basalt microfibers becoming the textile
          of the future.<br>
          <br>
          Am I dreaming yet? No, I don't.<br>
          <br>
          It is also politically necessary to enrich our world from one
          end to the other, with rent free houses and entire new cities,
          just for the economic uplift and vitality the new places would
          bring, with rich human living.<br>
          <br>
          Soon entire free city would then become incorporated into the
          old cities to keep the old cultural diversity alive. I can
          also see older cities not just offering free housing, but also
          offering advanced environments in competition with each other
          to attract people. Once it is becoming recognized that the
          people of society, beyond anything else, are a society's most
          precious resource, then the cities will be in a general
          competition with each other to attract more people with long
          term promises and long term potentials, and free housing as a
          standard feature. The resulting universal development process
          would most certainly transform America and the world. And this
          is precisely what we need as political driver. The breakout
          from the imperial monetarist mode will not likely happen on
          the negative focus of aiming to avoid a new dark age that the
          imperial monetarist mode makes inevitable. The driver for a
          breakout needs to be a positive impetus that offers a powerful
          new future, that make the political effort to break away from
          poverty intensely exciting and worthwhile, and thereby
          possible.<br>
          <br>
          The General Welfare Principle would then no longer be dead in
          America. Real healthcare and real education would resume.
          Everything that a person needs to exist, especially the basic
          necessities, such as housing, transportation, health care and
          education, would by then be taken back out the hands of the
          profit engines, like education for profit, health care for
          profit, etc., that soon thereafter most people wouldn't
          remember anymore. And this would happen worldwide. And if this
          became the reality, the return of the Ice Age, which is
          already on the horizon, wouldn't represent a challenge then
          that couldn't be met then and mastered, but would produce a
          still richer world by the developed power for overcoming that
          still larger challenge.<b><b><br>

              <br>
            </b></b>It has become embarrassing to be an American. Our
          country has had four war criminal presidents in succession.
          Clinton twice launched military attacks on Serbia, ordering
          NATO to bomb the former Yugoslavia twice, both in 1995 and in
          1999, so that gives Bill two war crimes. George W. Bush
          invaded Afghanistan and Iraq and attacked provinces of
          Pakistan and Yemen from the air. That comes to four war crimes
          for Bush. Obama used NATO to destroy Libya and sent
          mercenaries to destroy Syria, thereby commiting two war
          crimes. Trump attacked Syria with US forces, thereby becoming
          a war criminal early in his regime.<br>
          <br>
          To the extent that the UN participated in these war crimes
          along with Washington’s European, Canadian and Australian
          vassals, all are guilty of war crimes. Perhaps the UN itself
          should be arraigned before the War Crimes Tribunal along with
          the EU, US, Australia and Canada.<br>
          <br>
          Quite a record. Western Civilization, if civilization it is,
          is the greatest committer of war crimes in human history.<br>
          <br>
          And there are other crimes—Somalia, and Obama’s coups against
          Honduras and Ukraine and Washington’s ongoing attempts to
          overthrow the governments of Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia.
          Washington wants to overthrow Ecuador in order to grab and
          torture Julian Assange, the world’s leading democrat.<br>
          <br>
          These war crimes committed by four US presidents caused
          millions of civilian deaths and injuries and dispossessed and
          dislocated millions of peoples, who have now arrived as
          refugees in Europe, UK, US, Canada, and Australia, bringing
          their problems with them, some of which become problerms for
          Europeans, such as gang rapes.<br>
          <br>
          What is the reason for all the death and destruction and the
          flooding of the West with refugees from the West’s naked
          violence? We don’t know. We are told lies: Saddam Hussein’s
          “weapons of mass destruction,” which the US government knew
          for an absolute fact did not exist. “Assad’s use of chemical
          weapons,” an obvious, blatant lie. “Iranian nukes,” another
          blatant lie. The lies about Gaddafi in Libya are so absurd
          that it is pointless to repeat them.<br>
          <br>
          What were the lies used to justify bombing tribesmen in
          Pakistan, to bomb a new government in Yemen? No American knows
          or cares. Why the US violence against Somalia? Again, no
          Americans knows or cares.<br>
          <br>
          Or the morons saw a movie.<br>
          <br>
          Violence for its own sake. That is what America has become.<br>
          <br>
          Indeed, violence is what America is. There is nothing else
          there. Violence is the heart of America.<br>
          <br>
          Consider not only the bombings and destruction of countries,
          but also the endless gratuitous, outrageous police violence
          against US citizens. If anyone should be disarmed, it is the
          US police. The police commit more “gun violence” than anyone
          else, and unlike drug gangs fighting one another for
          territory, police violence has no other reason than the love
          of committing violence against other humans. The American
          police even shoot down 12-year old American kids prior to
          asking any question, especially if they are black.<br>
          <br>
          Violence is America. America is violence. The moronic liberals
          blame it on gun owners, but it is always the government that
          is the source of violence. That is the reason our Founding
          Fathers gave us the Second Amendment. It is not gun owners who
          have destroyed in whole or part eight countries. It is the
          armed-at-taxpayer-expense US government that commits the
          violence.<br>
          <br>
          America’s lust for violence is now bringing the Washington
          morons up against people who can commit violence back: the
          Russians and Chinese, Iran and North Korea.<br>
          <br>
          Beginning with the Clinton moron every US government has
          broken or withdrawn from agreements with Russia, agreements
          that were made in order to reduce tensions and the risk of
          thermo-nuclear war. Washington initially covered its
          aggressive steps toward Russia with lies, such as ABM missile
          sites on Russia’s border are there to protect Europe from
          (non-existent) Iranian nuclear ICBMs.<br>
          <br>
          The Obama regime still told lies but escalated to false
          charges against Russia and Russia’s president in order to
          build tensions between nuclear powers, the antithesis of
          Ronald Reagan’s policy. Yet moronic liberals love Obama and
          hate Reagan.<br>
          <br>
          Did you know that Russia is so powerful and the NSA and CIA so
          weak and helpless that Russia can determine the outcome of US
          elections? You must know this, because this is all you have
          heard from the utterly corrupt Democratic Party, the CIA, the
          FBI, the Amerian whore media, and the morons who listen to
          CNN, MSNBC, NPR or read the New York Times and Washington
          Post.<br>
          <br>
          Surely you have heard at least one thousand times that Russia
          invaded Ukraine; yet Washington’s puppet still sits in Kiev.
          One doesn’t have to have an IQ above 90 to understand that if
          Russia invaded Ukraine, Ukraine would not still be there.<br>
          <br>
          Did you know that the president of Russia, which world polls
          show is the most respected leader in the world, is, according
          to Hillary Clinton “the new Hitler”?<br>
          <br>
          Did you know that the most respected leader in the world,
          Vladimir Putin, is a Mafia don, a thug, a tarantula at the
          center of a spy web, according to members of the US government
          who are so stupid that they cannot even spell their own names?<br>
          <br>
          Did you know that Putin, who has refrained from responding
          aggressively to US provocations, not out of fear, but out of
          respect for human life, is said to be hellbent on
          reconstructing the Soviet Empire? Yet, when Putin sent a
          Russian force against the US and Israeli trained and supplied
          Georgian army that Washington sent to attack South Ossetia,
          the Russian Army conquered Georgia in five hours; yet withdrew
          after teaching the morons the lesson. If Putin wanted to
          reconstruct the Russian Empire, why didn’t he keep Georgia, a
          Russian province for 300 years prior to Washington’s breakup
          of the Russian Empire when the Soviet Union collapsed?
          Washington was powerless to do anything had Putin declared
          Georgia to be again part of Russia.<br>
          <br>
          And now we have the embarrassment of Trump’s CIA director,
          Mike Pompeo, possibly the most stupid person in America. Here
          we have a moron of the lowest grade. I am not sure there is
          any IQ there at all. Possibly it reads zero.<br>
          <br>
          This moron, if he qualifies to that level, which I doubt, has
          accused Julian Assange, the world’s Premier Journalist, the
          person who more than anyone represents the First Amendment of
          the US Constitution, of being a demon who sides with dictators
          and endangers the security of American hegemony with the help
          of Russia. All because Wilileaks publishes material from
          official sources revealing the criminal behavior of the US
          government. Wikileaks doesn’t steal the documents. The
          documents are leaked to Wikileaks by whistleblowers who cannot
          tolerate the immorality and lies of the US government.<br>
          <br>
          Anyone who tells the truth is by definition against the United
          States of America. And the moron Pompeo intends to get them.<br>
          <br>
          When I first read Pompeo’s accusation against Assange, I
          thought it had to be a joke. The CIA director wants to revoke
          the First Amendment. But the moron Pompeo actually said it.

          <br>
          What are we to do, what is the world to do, when we have utter
          morons as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, as
          President of the US, as National Security Adviser, as
          Secretary of Defense, as Secretary of State, as US Ambassador
          to the UN, as editors of the New York Times, Washington Post,
          CNN, NPR, MSNBC? How can there be any intelligence when only
          morons are in charge?<br>
          <br>
          Stupid is as stupid does. The Chinese government has said that
          the moronic Americans could attack North Korea at any moment.
          A large US fleet is heading to North Korea. North Korea
          apparently now has nuclear weapons. One North Korean nuclear
          weapon can wipe out the entirety of the US fleet. Why is
          Washington inviting this outcome? The only possible answer is
          moronic stupidity.<br>
          <br>
          North Korea is not bothering anyone. Why is Washington picking
          on North Korea? Does Washington want war with China? In which
          case, is Washinton kissing off the West Coast of the US? Why
          does the West Coast support policies that imply the demise of
          the West Coast of the US? Do the morons on the West Coast
          think that the US can initiate war with China, or North Korea,
          without any consequesnces to the West Coast? Are even Amerians
          this utterly stupid?<br>
          <br>
          China or Russia individually can wipe out the US. Together
          they can make North America uninhabitalbe until the end of
          time. Why are the Washington morons provoking powerful nuclear
          powers? Do the Washington morons think Russia and China will
          submit to threats?<br>
          <br>
          The answer is: Washington is a collection of morons, people
          stupid below the meaning of stupid. People so far outside of
          reality that they imagine that their hubris and arrogance
          elevates them above reality.<br>
          <br>
          When the first Satan 2 hits Washington, the greatest
          collection of morons in the world will cease to exist.<br>
          <br>
          The world will breathe a huge sigh of relief.<br>
          <br>
          Bring it on! Come on morons, eliminate yourselves! The rest of
          us cannot wait.<br>

                <b>MANUFACTURING METHOD OF THE SPHINCTER EXERCISES USING
                  JEJU VOLCANIC</b><br>
              </div>
              <br>
            </b></b>The present invention relates to a sphincter
          exerciser, and more particularly, to a sphincter exerciser
          which is configured to be inserted into the rectum of the
          human body or the vagina of a woman to train the muscle of the
          sphincter or to impart elasticity to the pelvic floor muscle,
          and to prevent and treat feminine diseases. The sphincter
          exerciser is made of only basalt which is Jeju volcanic rock
          or scoria, is thus made by plastic working using the same
          component so as to have the strength of 30 N or more, and is
          thus very safe. Furthermore, the Jeju volcanic rock is
          pulverized into a size of 43 µm or greater or 3,000-1,000 nm,
          and the granular particles over 43 µm are formed into
          spherical particles using a spray dry method or formed by
          using self coupling force of nano-particles. Therefore, the
          sphincter exerciser is less irritating to the human body when
          inserted into the human body. In addition, a cone-shaped body
          suitable for the structure of the vagina of a woman or the
          rectum of the human body is formed by using basalt or scoria
          which emits very large amount of far infrared rays and
          negative ions and has very advantageous effects to the human
          body, for example, effects of heavy metal adsorption,
          deodorization, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and
          electromagnetic wave blocking. While the sphincter exerciser
          is inserted into the vagina or the rectum, an exercise is
          repeatedly performed such that when the cone-shaped body moves
          down in the vagina and is about to escape from the vagina, the
          sphincter is shrunk to prevent the escapement and a force is
          applied to the sphincter to move the cone-shaped body into the
          vagina. Thus, the exercising effect is maximized, blood
          circulation inside the vagina and cleaned state of the vagina
          are achieved, and metabolism is activated, and thus the
          sphincter exerciser has effects of preventing and treating
          unary incontinence, preventing anal diseases, preventing
          premature ejaculation, preventing a prostatic disease which is
          a disease of only man, or the like, and improving health.<b><b><br>

                create honest behavior<br>
                <br>
                by Jon Rappoport&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
              </div>
              <br>
              Do you care if your brain is controlled in a good cause?<br>
              <br>
              Medicalxpress reports: “Researchers at the University of
              Zurich have identified the brain mechanism that governs
              decisions between honesty and self-interest. Using
              non-invasive brain stimulation, they could even increase
              honest behavior.”<br>
              <br>
              In an experiment involving rolling dice, where cheating
              would increase volunteers’ earnings, “researchers applied
              transcranial direct current stimulation over a region in
              the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC). This
              noninvasive brain stimulation method makes brain cells
              more sensitive i.e., they are more likely to be active.
              When the researchers applied this stimulation during the
              task, participants were less likely to cheat.”<br>
              <br>
              That result was only obtained with people who weighed
              moral choices. For volunteers who were wholly committed to
              cheating, the brain-manipulation had no effect.<br>
              <br>
              This experiment reveals where brain research is going.
              Change the brain, change behavior. It’s a simple
              premise... It’s also a dangerous premise, because “greater
              good” is used as a justification for imposing ironclad
              behavior.<br>

              Today, the University of California at Berkeley has
              deleted 20,000 college lectures from its YouTube channel.
              Berkeley removed the videos because of a lawsuit brought
              by two students from another university under the
              Americans with Disabilities Act.<br>
              <br>
              We copied all 20,000 and are making them permanently
              available for free via LBRY.<br>
              <br>
              This makes the videos freely available and discoverable by
              all, without reliance on any one entity to provide them
              (even us!).<br>
              <br>
              The full catalog is over 4 TB and will be synced over the
              next several days.<br>
              <br>
              How to Access<br>
              <br>
              Until LBRY launches to the public in April, the videos are
              only accessible to technical users via the command line.<br>
              <br>
              If you already have access to LBRY, go to
              lbry://ucberkeley to see the full catalog.<br>
              <br>
              If you want to be notified as soon as the videos are made

              The vast majority of the lectures are licensed under a

              </b><br>
              While other archive teams have also backed up these
              lectures using traditional methods, publishing them to
              LBRY offers greater openness, usability, and robustness.<br>
              <br>
              LBRY is the first truly free and censorship-resistant way
              to exchange content. The LBRY protocol provides a

              <br>
              When publishing the lectures to LBRY, the content metadata
              is written to a public blockchain, making it permanently
              public and robust to interference. Then, the content data
              itself is hosted via a peer-to-peer data network that
              offers economic incentives to ensure the data remains
              viable. This is superior to centralized or manual hosting,
              which is vulnerable to technical failure or other forms of
              attrition.<br>

                  Sector of the Universe</b><br>
                <br>
                <b>by</b><br>

              Once upon a time, the Universe was just a hot soup of
              particles. In those days, together with visible particles,
              other particles to us hidden or dark might have formed.
              Billions of years later scientists catalogued 17 types of
              visible particles, with the most recent one being the
              Higgs boson, creating the 'Standard Model'. However, they
              are still struggling to detect the hidden particles, the
              ones that constitute the dark sector of the Universe.<br>
              <br>
              Scientists at the Center for Theoretical Physics of the
              Universe, within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS)
              have proposed a hypothetical portal that connects two
              possible dark sector particles; their research could open
              a new perspective into the murky understanding of the dark
              sector. Published in Physical Review Letters, this study
              has implications in cosmology and astroparticle physics.<br>
              <br>
              Physicists have plenty of ideas about what these dark
              sector particles might look like. One candidate is the
              axion, which is a very light particle that can solve some
              theoretical problems of the Standard Model. Another
              candidate is the dark photon: A very light particle which
              shares some properties with one of the particles of the
              Standard Model, that is the photon, the constituent of
              visible light. However, while photons couple to the
              electromagnetic charge, dark photons couple to the
              so-called dark charge, that might be carried by other dark
              sector particles.<br>
              <br>
              Physicists believe that the dark sector communicates with
              the Standard Model, via portals. For example, a vector
              portal would allow the mixing between photons and dark
              photons. And, an axion portal connects axions and photons.
              There are only several possible portals physicists have
              identified, and each portal is a major tool in theoretical
              and experimental studies in searching for dark sector
              particles. A team of IBS scientists, hypothesized the
              existence of a new portal they named the "dark axion
              portal" that connects dark photons and axions.<br>
              <br>
              The central idea of the dark axion portal is based on the
              observation that new heavy quarks may also have a dark
              charge that couples to the dark photon. Through the heavy
              quarks, axion, photon, and dark photon can interact with
              each other.<br>
              <br>
              IBS scientists imagine that the dark axion portal could
              bring ideas for new experiments. So far, the axion search
              has been performed using only the axion portal, which
              connects the axion to a pair of photons
              (axion—photon—photon coupling). Similarly, the dark photon
              search has been performed using a different portal, namely
              a vector portal, which allows a small mixing between the
              dark photon and photon. The dark axion portal could link
              the two: "The dark axion portal suggests the first
              meaningful connection between the two physics, which have
              been studied separately: It connects the dots. This will
              allow reinterpretation of the previous data, and
              potentially make a breakthrough in the axion and dark
              photon searches," explains LEE Hye-Sung, corresponding
              author of the paper.<br>

              PETA’s shenanigans vary from the absurd to the downright
              offensive. From likening rape survivors to pigs and cows,
              to calling Pokémon a form of animal cruelty, PETA’s
              efforts to “save the animals” always make the
              headlines—and with good reason: they’re completely absurd.<br>
              <br>
              The animal rights group today released a new video to cry
              over milk, equating the nutritious drink with Nazism.
              Following the rise in Trump Derangement Syndrome and the
              progressive left’s hysteria over white supremacism, PETA
              states:<br>
              <br>
              “Did you know that milk has long been a symbol used by
              white supremacists?”<br>

              For the general public, the question of whether genes
              contribute to a person’s intelligence is a matter of
              controversy. Among intelligence researchers, there is no
              doubt that variation in intelligence is partly
              attributable to genes. In fact, the purpose of the very
              first twin study, done back in 1924, was to study the
              contribution of genes to intelligence.<br>
              <br>
              Today, researchers can predict how similar the IQ scores
              of people will be based on how similar their genes are.
              Such work has confirmed what twin studies have long shown:
              In adulthood, the majority of variation in intelligence is
              caused by genes. We now know about many genes that can be
              used to predict intelligence. Geneticists can determine
              which version of these genes someone has and, based on how
              many IQ-enhancing and IQ-deflating gene variants there
              are, assign a “polygenic score” (a score based on the
              effect of many genes) that correlates at about 0.3 with IQ
              scores, which is moderate by conventional standards....<br>

              </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
              <br>
              A non-lethal weapon for disabling an engine such as that
              of a fleeing car by means of a high voltage discharge that
              perturbs or destroys the electrical circuits. The
              transmission of the disabling voltage to the distant
              target is via two channels of electrically conductive air.
              The conductive channels are created by multi-photon and
              collisional ionization within the paths of two beams of
              coherent (laser) or collimated incoherent ultraviolet
              radiation directed to the target. A single beam may be
              used when the high voltage source and the target are
              grounded. The high-voltage current flows from electrodes
              at the origin of the beams along the channels of free
              electrons within them.<br>
              <br>
              <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              This invention relates to weapons and more particularly to
              a type of non-disabling weapon which may be used by
              military personnel or law enforcement agents for the
              temporary immobilization of a target subject or subjects.
              The invention also relates to muscle tissue involuntary
              contraction by application of electric current identical
              to or closely approximating the physiological
              neuroelectric impulses which control muscle movements.
              This weapon may further be used to stop an automobile or
              other vehicle by disabling the electronic circuits which
              control its engine...<br>
              <br>
              The present invention also results from prior experiences
              in the laser-induced ionization of air as described by
              Koopman and Wilkerson, "Channeling of Ionizing Electrical
              Streamer by a Laser Beam," Journal of Applied Physics,
              Vol. 42, pp. 1883-1886, 1971, and Koopman and Saum,
              "Formation and Guiding of High-Velocity Electrical
              Streamers by Laser-Induced Ionization," Journal of Applied
              Physics, Vol. 44, pp. 5328-5336, 1973. Prior applications
              of laser-induced ionization can be found in U.S. Pat. No.
              3,719,829, Vaill and U.S. Pat. No. 3,775,638, Tidman which
              disclose methods of creating a conductive path in a gas,
              U.S. Pat. No. 4,017,767 Ball and U.S. Pat. No. 4,453,196
              Herr which disclose the transmission of electricity via
              laser-ionized air channels, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,175,664
              Diels et al. which discloses methods of creating
              conductive paths of ionized air by means of laser beams
              toward the goal of discharging storm clouds...<br>

              the first pirate website in the world to provide mass and
              public access to tens of millions of research papers<br>
              <br>
              A research paper is a special publication written by
              scientists to be read by other researchers. Papers are
              primary sources neccessary for research – for example,
              they contain detailed description of new results and
              experiments.<br>
              <br>
              At this time the widest possible distribution of research
              papers, as well as of other scientific or educational
              sources, is artificially restricted by copyright laws.
              Such laws effectively slow down the development of science
              in human society. The Sci-Hub project, running from 5th
              September 2011, is challenging the status quo. At the
              moment, Sci-Hub provides access to hundreds of thousands
              research papers every day, effectively bypassing any
              paywalls and restrictions.<br>

              COLLEGE PARK, Md. — Fire tornados, or ‘fire whirls,’ pose
              a powerful and essentially uncontrollable threat to life,
              property, and the surrounding environment in large urban
              and wildland fires. But now, a team of researchers in the
              University of Maryland’s A. James Clark School of
              Engineering say their discovery of a type of fire tornado
              they call a ‘blue whirl’ could lead to beneficial new
              approaches for reducing carbon emissions and improving oil
              spill cleanup.<br>
              <br>
              A new paper published online August 4, 2016, in the
              peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy
              of Sciences (PNAS) describes this previously unobserved
              flame phenomenon, which burns nearly soot-free.<br>
              <br>
              “Blue whirls evolve from traditional yellow fire whirls.
              The yellow color is due to radiating soot particles, which
              form when there is not enough oxygen to burn the fuel
              completely,” said Elaine Oran, Glenn L. Martin Institute
              Professor of Engineering and co-author of the paper. “Blue
              in the whirl indicates there is enough oxygen for complete
              combustion, which means less or no soot, and is therefore
              a cleaner burn.”<br>
              <br>
              The Clark School team initially set out to investigate the
              combustion and burning dynamics of fire whirls on water.
              What they discovered was a novel, swirling blue flame that
              they say could help meet the growing worldwide demand for
              high-efficiency, low-emission combustion.<br>
              <br>
              “A fire tornado has long been seen as this incredibly
              scary, destructive thing. But, like electricity, can you
              harness it for good? If we can understand it, then maybe
              we can control and use it,” said Michael Gollner,
              assistant professor of fire protection engineering and
              co-author of the paper.<br>
              <br>
              “This is the first time fire whirls have been studied for
              their practical applications,” Gollner added.<br>
              <br>
              Some oil spill remediation techniques include corralling
              up the crude oil to create a thick layer on the water
              surface that can be burned in place, but the resulting
              combustion is smoky, inefficient, and incomplete. However,
              the Clark School researchers say blue whirls could improve
              remediation-by-combustion approaches by burning the oil
              layer with increased efficiency, reducing harmful
              emissions into the atmosphere around it and the ocean
              beneath it.<br>
              <br>
              “Fire whirls are more efficient than other forms of
              combustion because they produce drastically increased
              heating to the surface of fuels, allowing them to burn
              faster and more completely. In our experiments over water,
              we’ve seen how the circulation fire whirls generate also
              helps to pull in fuels. If we can achieve a state akin to
              the blue whirl at larger scale, we can further reduce
              airborne emissions for a much cleaner means of spill
              cleanup,” explained Gollner.<br>
              <br>
              Beyond improvements to fuel efficiency and oil spill
              remediation, there are currently few easy methods to
              generate a stable vortex in the lab, so the team hopes
              their discovery of the ‘blue swirl’ can serve as a natural
              research platform for the future study of vortices and
              vortex breakdown in fluid mechanics.<br>
              <br>
              “A fire whirl is usually turbulent, but this blue whirl is
              very quiet and stable without visible or audible signs of
              turbulence,” said Huahua Xiao, assistant research
              scientist in the Clark School's Department of Aerospace
              Engineering and corresponding author of the paper. “It’s
              really a very exciting discovery that offers important
              possibilities both within and outside of the research
              lab.”<br>

              <br>
              The detonation propagation in a channel geometry which
              suppresses detonation propagation in one direction, allows
              it in another direction, and does not create flow
              restrictions in the channel. The geometry consists of a
              series of divergent sections separated by wedges that form
              a sawtooth shape. The detonation fails to propagate
              through this geometry in one direction because the
              detonation front is weakened by diffraction, and
              reignition centers are isolated from the main channel. In
              an opposite direction, convergent parts of the geometry
              support the detonation propagation, because subsequent
              shock collisions with oblique walls that form convergent
              sections create powerful transverse waves. These powerful
              transverse waves help the detonation propagation or
              reignite it.<br>

                  2030's (Energy From the Vacuum 20)</b><br>
              </div>
              <br>
              In addition to Energy From the Vacuum 19 I also purchased
              Energy From the Vacuum 20 in which John Bedini talks about
              his time with John Cejka, a mysterious individual who had
              a vast knowledge and access to supressed free energy and
              other exotic devices, some of which Cejka demonstrated to
              Bedini. During one time in 1984, Bedini was invited one
              night by Cejka to go to a warehouse. When Bedini got to
              the warehouse, which was about 1000 feet long, and stepped
              inside he saw that stacked side by side along the top of
              the building on the upper rows were exotic technologies.
              Amongst these were magnets that picked up gold, gasoline
              made from plants, a working model of a Papp engine and
              strange shaped coils, amongst other inventions. The
              warehouse also had a facility that made a catalyst that
              would turn tap water into gasoline.<br>
              <br>
              Along one of the walls of the warehouse was a chart that
              was about 1000 feet long which consisted of a sinusoidal
              line that had small vertical lines drawn on it, while the
              words "Time Starts" were written on the left of the chart
              and "Time Ends" were written on the right. Cejka invited
              Bedini to have a closer look at the chart and Bedini found
              that it was a timeline of humanity. The small vertical
              lines marked individual years and at each year was
              description of significant events, world food production
              and who the President of the United States was for a given
              period. Bedini went towards the end of the chart, taking
              note that the US Presidents which would be in office
              beyond 1984 were Reagan, Bush Sr. and Clinton. When Bedini
              asked Cejka how he knew this Cejka replied "We know, we
              know who's going to be the President". He looked at around
              the year 2000, taking note for the year 2001 of a small
              picture of two buildings that were on fire.<br>
              <br>
              Beyond the years 2000 Bedini noted that there was
              continuous war which occured up until the point of the
              chart with the words "Time Ends". Bedini says that at this
              point humanity ends in disaster. Bedini never took note of
              the specific year at which "Time Ends" since he wasn't
              close paying attention to the events after the year 2000
              other than noting there was continuous war but estimated
              that since the year 2000 is marked at the last sinusoidal
              peak and the year 1984 is marked between the previous
              trough and the peak he estimates that the "Time Ends"
              point, which occurs at the last sinusoidal trough, occurs
              at around 2036.<br>
              <br>
              Bedini makes no mention of the disaster/s that ends
              humanity or if "Time Ends" wipes out humanity completely.
              It should be noted that since Bedini wasn't paying close
              attention to the events after 2000 he may be assuming that
              the "Time Ends" point ends in disaster for humanity. "Time
              Ends" could mean the end of modern civilised society or a
              major socio-economic transition...<br>

                  A new engine that generates electricity from waste hot
                  water could reduce energy consumption and carbon
                  emissions for thousands of different businesses, from
                  cargo shipping to data centres.<br>
                  <br>
                  So says Exergyn, a firm based in Dublin, Ireland,
                  which plans to run the first industrial trials of its
                  technology next year.<br>
                  <br>
                  Globally, Exergyn estimates that the heat lost in
                  waste hot water from industrial processes amounts to
                  around twice the energy in Saudi Arabia’s annual oil
                  and gas output.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Cut carbon emissions</b><b><br>
                  </b><br>
                  Cargo ships, for example, typically pump waste hot
                  water from the engine around the vessel to cool it
                  down. And in data centres, electricity-hungry fans are
                  used to dissipate the heat generated by rows of
                  servers. Finding an efficient way to capture and use
                  this wasted energy would both reduce costs and cut
                  carbon emissions.<br>
                  <br>
                  The Exergyn Drive uses the quirky properties of an
                  alloy of nickel and titanium called nitinol. You can
                  bend nitinol out of shape, but when heated it
                  undergoes a phase transition and reverts to its
                  original crystal lattice structure. This “shape
                  memory” property makes nitinol desirable in a wide
                  range of applications, including medical devices,

                  It also has another unusual quality. Unlike most
                  materials, nitinol expands when cooled, rather like
                  water does when it turns to ice (think of the mess in
                  your freezer when you leave a bottle of beer to cool
                  in there too long).<br>
                  <br>
                  “There aren’t many materials in the universe that do
                  that,” says Mike Langan, Exergyn’s head of product
                  management.<br>
                  <br>
                  These two properties drive the Exergyn engine. Inside
                  the device, a bundle of metre-long nitinol wires are
                  attached to a piston. Hot and cold water is
                  alternately flushed over the wires every 10 seconds,
                  which causes them to rapidly expand and contract by 4
                  centimetres, driving the piston up and down. A
                  hydraulic system converts that forceful linear motion
                  into rotary motion, which in turn drives a generator.
                  The engine produces 10 kilowatts of electricity from
                  around 200 kW of thermal energy in the waste hot
                  water.<br>

                  That might not be hugely efficient, but this is “free”
                  energy that would otherwise be wasted. And often,
                  money and energy would be spent actively cooling down
                  the waste water.<br>
                  <br>
                  The company has spent three years perfecting the
                  design and modifying the material so that it will keep
                  working for millions of cycles. It was awarded 2.5
                  million euros from the European Commission’s Horizon
                  2020 fund last year to help bring the technology to
                  market and is now planning three industrial tests in
                  2017, at Dublin Airport and two landfill sites. In all
                  three cases, the Exergyn technology will use warm
                  water at 90 °C or less – from a gas engine at the
                  airport and from biogas generators at the landfill
                  sites – to produce electricity on-site.<br>
                  <br>
                  In addition to harnessing waste heat from industry,
                  the company hopes that the engine could expand the
                  geothermal energy market. At the moment, generating
                  electricity from geothermal sources in a
                  cost-effective manner requires very hot water at high
                  flow rates. That typically means digging very deep
                  wells with a wide diameter, which hugely increases
                  drilling costs. Langdon says that Exergyn’s technology
                  makes a broader range of geothermal sites viable, as
                  it works with water at a lower temperature and flow.<br>
                  <br>
                  John Blowes, a past president of the Institution of
                  Diesel and Gas Turbine Engineers, who has seen the
                  technology but has no stake in the company, agrees
                  there is a “massive” range of applications. But he
                  says that only a small percentage of these will be
                  viable unless the company can produce the technology
                  cheaply. “It comes down at the end of the day, for me,
                  to commercial viability,” he says.<br>
                  <br>
                  Langan says the combination of no fuel costs and the
                  mechanical simplicity of the machine means that
                  Exergyn will be able to keep costs down. He says it
                  can currently generate electricity at £40 per MWhr –
                  cheaper than gas and coal.<br>

                    <i>Two German inventors created a laundry bag to
                      prevent shedding microfibers ending up in oceans.

                    </i></div>
                  <br>
                  For the past three years, Alexander Nolte and Oliver
                  Spies, surfing buddies and co-owners of Langbrett, a
                  German retailer with four stores that sells surf gear
                  and outdoor apparel, have been haunted by news reports
                  connecting many of the products they sell to an
                  emerging but serious environmental threat: microfiber
                  pollution. Synthetic textiles, such as fleece jackets,
                  send tiny plastic fibers into wastewater after
                  washing. These bits eventually make their way into
                  rivers, lakes and our oceans, where they pose health
                  threats to plants and animals. The two men knew they
                  had to act.<br>
                  <br>
                  “We said, ‘either we have to stop selling fleece
                  [apparel] or we have to think of a solution’,”
                  explains Nolte. “So we went out to our beer garden and
                  said ‘what can we do?’”<br>
                  <br>
                  The beer-filled brainstorming session eventually led
                  to Guppy Friend, a mesh laundry bag, that goes into
                  the washing machine. The bag captures shedding fibers
                  as clothes are tossed and spun, preventing the fibers
                  from escaping. It’s roomy enough for a couple of
                  fleece jackets or other apparel made of synthetic
                  fabric. In two weeks, Langbrett, in partnership with
                  outdoor clothing company Patagonia, will start
                  shipping the Guppy Friend to the backers of their
                  Kickstarter campaign. Patagonia will then begin
                  selling the bag to customers.<br>
                  <br>
                  The Guppy Friend is the first device designed and
                  marketed specifically to prevent microfiber pollution.
                  Microfibers are tiny, so they can easily move through
                  sewage treatment plants. Natural fibers, such as
                  cotton or wool, biodegrade over time. But synthetic
                  fibers are problematic because they do not biodegrade,
                  and tend to bind with molecules of harmful chemical
                  pollutants found in wastewater, such as pesticides or
                  flame retardants. Plus, fibers from apparel are often
                  coated with chemicals to achieve performance
                  attributes such as water resistance. Studies have
                  shown health problems among plankton and other small
                  organisms that eat microfibers, which then make their
                  way up the food chain. Researchers have found high
                  numbers of fibers inside fish and shellfish sold at
                  markets.<br>
                  <br>
                  To date, no studies have shown that microfibers cause
                  health problems in humans. But that’s cold comfort to
                  Nolte: “Scientific research is slow, so it might take
                  another generation to find out what harm [these
                  pollutants] will do. I don’t want to wait that long.”<br>
                  <br>
                  Nolte and Spies worked with German research institute
                  Fraunhofer to test and vet the bag’s design and
                  material. They settled on polyamide, also known as
                  nylon, that doesn’t shed fibers easily. It’s made with
                  a 50-micron mesh, a width that allows soapy water to
                  enter the bag without allowing fibers to leave. When
                  the bag is removed from the washer at the end of a
                  cycle, the fiber – visible against the white mesh –
                  can be removed by hand and disposed of. Tests show
                  that the bag remains functional and intact after
                  hundreds of washings.<br>
                  <br>
                  The duo isn’t alone in tackling the problem in the
                  laundry room. A startup called the Rozalia Project is
                  developing a microfiber-catching device, but it is not
                  yet available. Devices called after-market filters are
                  already available – these are designed to reduce the
                  amount of lint that enters septic systems. But unless
                  you have some plumbing skills, hiring a plumber to
                  install the $130 filters can be expensive.<br>
                  <br>
                  Guppy Friend attracted the attention of Patagonia last
                  summer when word about the project reached Phil
                  Graves, managing director of Tin Shed Ventures,
                  Patagonia’s investment fund. Patagonia already had a
                  relationship with Langbrett, which sells Patagonia
                  clothing.<br>
                  <br>
                  Patagonia is interested in reducing microfiber
                  pollution, based on the results of a study it
                  commissioned at the University of California at Santa
                  Barbara in 2015. Researchers calculated the
                  microfibers shed from Patagonia outerwear during
                  laundry, and found that a single fleece jacket sheds
                  as many as 250,000 synthetic fibers. Using sales
                  numbers, the researchers extrapolated that about
                  100,000 jackets are in use worldwide each year, and
                  washing them would produce enough plastic to make
                  11,900 grocery bags.<br>
                  <br>
                  “We received early prototypes [of the bag] and tested
                  them with the UCSB researchers we had worked with on
                  our fiber loss study. They confirmed that the bag
                  trapped anywhere from 90-95% of fibers,” Graves says.
                  “We brought in our material engineers and gave [Nolte
                  and Spies] feedback on construction.” Nolte says
                  design improvements have boosted the bag’s ability to
                  capture fibers to 99%.<br>
                  <br>
                  Patagonia gave Nolte and Spies financial support – a
                  €100,000 ($108,000) grant – to develop the mesh bag
                  and a supply chain for it. The duo also launched the
                  Kickstarter campaign that ran from last October to
                  December and raised €28,640 ($30,604) from 668
                  backers.<br>
                  <br>
                  In exchange for the grant, Nolte and Spies agreed to
                  let Patagonia be the first retailer, aside from
                  Langbrett, to sell Guppy Friend.<br>
                  <br>
                  Patagonia plans to sell Guppy Friend at the cost of
                  buying and shipping it from Nolte and Spies – the
                  California company won’t be making a profit. It hasn’t
                  settled on a retail price yet, but it will likely be
                  between $20-$30.<br>
                  <br>
                  Since sales of synthetic fabric are growing, Guppy
                  Friend will need to be a big seller to make a dent in
                  microfiber pollution. So how likely is that?<br>
                  <br>
                  It will require some convincing. Nik Sawe, a Stanford
                  University researcher who uses neuroscience to study
                  how consumers make decisions on environmental issues,
                  says the key is to use emotion to influence behavior.<br>
                  <br>
                  “If Guppy Friend can appeal to consumers’ feelings
                  around the negative impacts of microfiber pollution,
                  it might be able to elicit them to spend $20 or $30
                  for the bag,” he says.<br>
                  <br>
                  In the meantime, Nolte says he’s gotten a lot of
                  interest from retailers. So far, he and Nolte have
                  30,000 pre-orders for Guppy Friend, from Patagonia and
                  other retailers he could not yet name.<br>
                  <br>
                  Next up: Nolte and Spies are also working on reducing
                  microfiber losses before the fabric reaches the
                  laundry room. They are working with Deutsche
                  Textilforschungszentrum, a German standards body, to
                  create a metric that will show the rate/amount of
                  fiber losses of a given textile. They hope clothing
                  designers will choose fabrics that aren’t prone to
                  shedding.<br>
                  <br>
                  “We know that higher quality fabrics shed fewer
                  fibers,” he says. He hopes the testing standard will
                  make that clear to brands and consumers. But
                  eventually it might take government regulation to curb
                  the sale of high-shed synthetics, he says.<br>
                  <br>
                  But with Guppy Friend, he says: “We can act now. We do
                  not need to wait for anyone.”<br>

                  Plastic fibers released from washing pollute our
                  waterbodies and food supply. The GUPPY FRIEND wash bag
                  is the first solution to prevent microfibers from
                  entering into rivers and oceans.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>The problem</b><br>
                  <br>
                  Synthetic materials are poisoning our oceans and food
                  supply. When we think of the issue, images of plastic
                  bottles bags and bottles come to mind, but synthetic
                  textiles are a big part of the problem.<br>
                  <br>
                  The problem starts in your laundry. An alarming number
                  of tiny fibers from synthetic fabrics are making their
                  way from washing machine into rivers and oceans.
                  Unfortunately, sewage treatment plants don’t
                  effectively filter out these microfibers.<br>
                  <br>
                  According to a research team from the University of
                  California at Santa Barbara a city of 100,000
                  inhabitants releases a wash-related volume of
                  microfibers equivalent to 15,000 plastic bags. A city
                  the size of Berlin may be responsible for 540,000
                  plastic bags – every single day.<br>
                  <br>
                  Once in the environment, these fibers decompose, which
                  increases their surface area, enabling the fibers to
                  concentrate pervasive bacteria and pollutants. The
                  tiny fibers are consumed by aquatic organisms, which
                  can result in gastrointestinal infections and
                  blockages, reproductive problems, and
                  starvation—problems that ultimately work their way up
                  the food chain.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Our solution</b><br>
                  <br>
                  The GUPPY FRIEND wash bag filters out the tiniest
                  microfibers that are released from textiles during
                  washing. The fabric bag, made of a specially-designed
                  microfilter material captures 99% of fibers released
                  in the washing process.<br>
                  <br>
                  You can see the fibers trapped inside the bag after
                  each wash. Simply dispose the fibers properly in your
                  trash. In the process, GUPPY FRIEND draws attention to
                  the microfiber pollution and helps fight the problem.<br>
                  <br>
                  Independent research has confirmed the effectiveness
                  of the GUPPY FRIEND bag.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>How it works<br>
                    <br>
                  </b>Don’t change your washing ritual – just its toxic
                  effect<br>
                  1. Put synthetic textiles into the GUPPY FRIEND wash
                  bag<br>
                  2. Close the bag and wash as usual<br>
                  3. Take out wet cloth and residues of microfibers from
                  the inside of the bag. Discard properly.<br>
                  <br>
                  What do we want? Who are we?<br>
                  GUPPY FRIEND is a startup based in Germany, Berlin.
                  Our goal is to reduce plastics and microwaste
                  pollution in the world’s rivers and oceans. In
                  addition to the GUPPY FRIEND washing machine bag we
                  are developing a filter for washbasins for household
                  and commercial use as well as restraint devices for
                  floating debris.<br>
                  <br>
                  GUPPY FRIEND was founded by LANGBRETT community of
                  interest – a group of surfers, skaters and creative
                  individuals – driven by the desire to create
                  sustainable clothes for the surf and outdoor sport.<br>
                  <br>
                  In September, we are initiating a crowdfunding
                  campaign and seeking to partner with industry and
                  other stakeholders to spread the word about the bag
                  and to produce as many GUPPY FREINDS as possible at an
                  affordable price.<br>

                  can be placed in an eye as a liquid and still form a
                  gel in only 10 minutes. They used special techniques
                  to get it to gel quickly. The scientists mixed two
                  types of polymers to create branched polymer clusters
                  in liquid and incited them to form a solid when

                  <br>
                  Bio-based materials are being developed, increasingly,
                  because of the need for sustainable, environmentally
                  friendly, processes and products. We have made natural
                  rubber composites containing low cost fillers derived
                  from agro-industrial wastes, namely, eggshells, carbon
                  fly ash, processing tomato peels and guayule bagasse.
                  Composites manufactured with 35 phr (parts per hundred
                  rubber) of carbon black (particle size 108 ± 31 nm)
                  were used as a reference filled material. The amount
                  of carbon black was gradually replaced by a specific
                  waste-derived macro (&lt;300 µm diameter) or micro
                  (&lt;38 µm diameter) filler. Despite differences in
                  particle size distribution and surface chemistry, the
                  tensile properties of micro sized tomato peels
                  composite were similar to those of the carbon black
                  reference composite. Composites manufactured using
                  micro sized particles at low loadings (5 and 10 phr)
                  of carbon fly ash and eggshells, as co-fillers with
                  carbon black, also demonstrated comparable tensile
                  results to those of composites manufactured solely
                  with carbon black. Hierarchical cluster analysis
                  partitioned the data into five groups of composites
                  having statistically similar mechanical properties.
                  Composites containing micro sized particles at low
                  loadings (5 and 10 phr) were grouped in clusters 1, 2
                  and 5. These clusters gathered composites with the
                  highest tensile strength and 300 % modulus. As the
                  amount of non-carbon black filler increased above 10
                  phr and up to 35 phr (maximum filler loading used),
                  the composites became weaker than the carbon black
                  filled composites and modulus decreased.<br>

                  </b><b>Abstract: </b>Static, or electronic, energy
                  meters are replacing the conventional
                  electromechanical meters. Consumers are sometimes
                  complaining about higher energy readings and billing
                  after the change to a static meter, but there is not a
                  clear common or root cause at present. Electromagnetic
                  interference has been observed between active infeed
                  converters as used in photo-voltaic systems and static
                  meters. Reducing the interference levels eliminated
                  inaccurate reading in static meters. Several field
                  investigations failed to identify a clear root cause
                  of inaccurate readings of static energy meters.
                  Experiments were performed in a controlled lab
                  environment. Three-phase meters showed large
                  deviations, even when supplied with an ideal
                  sinusoidal voltage from a fourquadrant power
                  amplifier. Large variations could be observed when
                  non-linear, fast switching, loads were connected. A
                  deviation of +276 % was measured with one static
                  energy meter, +265% with a second and -46% with a
                  third static energy meter. After dismantling it was
                  revealed that the meters with the positive deviation
                  used a Rogowski coil current sensor. The meter with a
                  Hall effect-based current sensor gave the -46%
                  deviation. The fourth meter, with a current
                  transformer, resulted in -10% in one experiment and
                  +8% in another experiment, where the deviations are
                  with respect to a conventional electromechanical
                  meter. Measurements were repeated with more meters and
                  supplied from standard, low internal impedance, mains
                  supply in the laboratory. Deviations of +475%, +566%,
                  +569%, +581%, +582% and -31% and -32% were registered,
                  with again the positive deviation for Rogowski coil
                  current sensors and negative deviations for the Hall
                  sensors.<br>

                  scientist could hopefully be the beginning of

                  <br>
                  USRTK, a non-profit working for accountability in our
                  nation’s food system, originally uncovered a
                  heart-breaking letter&nbsp; former EPA scientist
                  Marion Copley, who passed away from cancer. In this
                  letter, Copley begs fellow EPA employee Jess Rowland
                  to protect the public from glyphosate’s toxic nature,
                  rather than continue to cow-tow to Monsanto’s
                  influence. “For once in your life, listen to me and
                  don’t play your political conniving games with the
                  science to favor the registrants. For once do the
                  right thing and don’t make decisions based on how it
                  affects your bonus,” Copley writes.<br>
                  <br>
                  She went on to state that Rowland and another EPA
                  employee, Anna Lowit, intimidated the staff on CARC
                  (Cancer Assessment Review Committee) and altered the
                  MI ARC and IIASPOC final reports to favor the
                  industry. Lowit is still working for the EPA, and
                  Copley’s letter warns that other scientists within the
                  EPA may also be taking bribes....<br>
