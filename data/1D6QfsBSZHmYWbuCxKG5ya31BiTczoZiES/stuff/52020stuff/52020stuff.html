                </a>Multiscale Self-Assembly of Distinctive Weblike
                Structures from Evaporated Drops of Dilute American
                Whiskeys<br>
                Adam D. Carrithers, et al.<br>
                Abstract<br>
              </b>When a sessile droplet of a complex mixture
              evaporates, its nonvolatile components may deposit into
              various patterns. One such phenomena, the coffee ring
              effect, has been a topic of interest for several decades.
              Here, we identify what we believe to be a fascinating
              phenomenon of droplet pattern deposition for another
              well-known beverage—what we have termed a “whiskey web”.
              Nanoscale agglomerates were generated in diluted American
              whiskeys (20–25% alcohol by volume), which later
              stratified as microwebs on the liquid–air interface during
              evaporation. The web’s strandlike features result from
              monolayer collapse, and the resulting pattern is a
              function of the intrinsic molecular constituents of the
              whiskey. Data suggest that, for our conditions (diluted
              1.0 &#956;L drops evaporated on cleaned glass substrates),
              whiskey webs were unique to diluted American whiskey;
              however, similar structures were generated with other
              whiskeys under different conditions. Further, each product
              forms their own distinct pattern, demonstrating that this
              phenomenon could be used for sample analysis and
              counterfeit identification.<br>

                  ‘lockdown’: they’ve made us all prisoners</b><br>

              </div>
              <b><br>
              </b>We will never get out of this now. It will go on for
              ever. We will not be free people again. <br>
              <br>
              Even when we seem to be free we will be like prisoners on
              parole, who can be snatched back to their cells at a
              moment’s notice.<br>
              <br>
              I think I now understand why this period has come to be
              known by the repulsive word ‘lockdown’, an American term
              which describes the punishment of rioting convicts in a
              penitentiary, by confining them in their cells for long
              periods. <br>
              <br>
              I hate this word, because it does not seem to me to be
              fitting to describe free people in a free country.<br>
              <br>
              But we are no longer such people, or such a country. We
              have become muzzled, mouthless, voiceless, humiliated,
              regimented prisoners, shuffling about at the command of
              others, stopping when told to stop, moving when told to
              move, shouted at by jacks-in-office against whom we have
              no appeal.<br>
              <br>
              We are learning, during this induction period, to do what
              we are told and to become obedient, servile citizens of a
              new authoritarian State. We are unlearning the old rules
              of freedom. <br>
              <br>
              All the things we used to take for granted now belong to
              the State, which can hand them back to us if we are good,
              and yank them away from us again if we are bad, or if it
              can think of an excuse.<br>
              <br>
              And there will always be an excuse, a rise in the
              fictional ‘R’ rate, an ‘emergency’ that can be exaggerated
              into fear, whether it be a virus, a terror threat or even
              the new Middle Eastern war that I have long feared is
              coming.<br>
              <br>
              But who would have thought it would be Covid-19, of all
              things, that would be the pretext for the snuffing out of
              centuries of liberty? <br>
              <br>
              We are learning, during this induction period, to do what

              centuries of liberty? <br>
              <br>
              I have long sensed a desire in our new elite to be more
              powerful. It goes with their belief that they are so
              wonderful that nobody ought to disagree with them.<br>
              <br>
              You could tell that they longed for curfews, to go on the
              TV with grim faces and tell us all to go quietly to our
              homes, to ban gatherings of more than three people, for
              our own good. But it never quite worked. <br>
              <br>
              People actually laughed in 2003 when Anthony Blair madly
              sent tanks to Heathrow Airport to deal with an alleged
              terror threat, which never materialised.<br>
              <br>
              Al Qaeda was a good bogeyman for a bit, but all the
              stuffing came out of it, especially when we ended up
              supporting it in Syria. Islamic State had the same basic
              problem. <br>
              <br>
              Its supposed supporters here almost invariably turned out
              (like Al Qaeda’s before them) to be fantasists or
              drugged-up maniacs with no coherent aim or plan. There was
              never an excuse to fire up the shiny new Civil
              Contingencies Act, with its enormous dictatorial powers,<br>
              <br>
              But now the new Strong State, growing in our midst for
              decades, has finally become powerful enough to emerge in
              all its naked nastiness. Or rather, all the proper
              institutions of a civil society have grown so weak that
              the Strong State can now get its way.<br>
              <br>
              The married family, the independent middle-class, able to
              make a decent living on the basis of hard-won
              qualifications, the political parties, Parliament itself,
              the Opposition, the Monarchy, the Armed Forces, the Church
              (pathetically anxious to close itself), the Civil Service,
              most of the media, the BBC, are just husks of what they
              were 50 years ago.<br>
              <br>
              In many cases, bodies supposed to stand up for us now
              lecture and browbeat us on behalf of the Government. But I
              think the worst thing of all has been the naked
              transformation of the police into a politicised state
              militia. I have had plenty of criticisms of the police
              before now, and take none of them back.<br>
              <br>
              But their performance in this crisis has been deeply
              shocking and sad. They have acted as the agents of
              Ministers, openly taking one side in a political
              controversy, shouting angrily and menacingly at innocent
              citizens that they must go home and that, if they do not,
              they are ‘killing people’.<br>
              <br>
              Lord Sumption, the former Supreme Court judge,
              distinguished historian and Reith Lecturer who has spoken
              repeatedly for Britain in these dark times, said it very
              clearly many weeks ago: ‘This is what a police state is
              like. It’s a state in which the government can issue
              orders or express preferences with no legal authority and
              the police will enforce Ministers’ wishes.’<br>
              <br>
              These are not the words of some troublesome scribbler,
              like me, but those of an enormously distinguished
              intellect who is nobody’s fool, never uses a word he has
              not considered, and knows his way very well round the past
              and the present.<br>
              <br>
              And so it has been. Lulled by the lotus-eating weeks of
              furlough payments and mortgage holidays, and by the almost
              unceasing spring sunshine, we have lolled about for the
              past two months vaguely wondering what that faint
              unpleasant sound in the distance might be.<br>
              <br>
              Well, I will tell you what it is. It is the forging of the
              fetters we shall be wearing in the times to come, because,
              for the most part, we didn’t care about our liberty, and
              so no longer deserve to have it...<br>

              </b>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tells us that despite
              the record of destroying in whole or part eight countries
              in recent years, the US is a “force for good.” This is the
              Trump regime’s version of the neoconservative doctrine
              espoused by President Clinton’s Secretary of State
              Madeleine Albright: “If we have to use force, it is
              because we are America; we are the indispensable nation.
              We stand tall and we see further than other countries into
              the future, and we see the danger here to all of us.” The
              notion that Iraq was a danger to the US shows imbecility.
              The inhumanity of Washington’s response to the “danger”
              was sanctions that resulted in the deaths of 500,000 Iraqi
              children. When asked on national television if a half
              million dead children achieved a justified purpose, the
              heartless Albright said that it was “a very hard choice,
              but the price, we think the price is worth it.”<br>
              <br>
              The neoconservatives, with their preference for war uber
              alles are running the Trump regime. It appears that the
              reelection of Donald Trump will be a continuation of the
              Bill Clinton presidency, the George W. Bush presidency,
              and the Obama presidency. Whoever is elected War is the
              policy.<br>
              <br>
              Philip Giraldi tells us about it:
https://www.unz.com/pgiraldi/leading-neocon-directs-pentagon-middle-east-planning/<br>
              <br>
              What Giraldi forgets to mention is that the “terrorist”
              groups are Washington’s creations and serve as
              Washington’s tools to advance the war agenda.<br>
              <br>
              Giraldi gives away too much when he characterizes the
              Hussein and Gaddafi governments as dictatorships.
              Authority was centralized, as it is in Washington, but the
              governments had to balance contending forces in the

              any worse than the US, a country’s whose FBI and

              the President of the United States and his National
              Security Advisor. The extraordinary conflict that
              Democrats brought to US political life since 2016 exceeds
              the internal conflict that had to be managed by Iraq’s

              </b>... Concerns emerged on March 14, when French health
              minister Olivier Veran said ibuprofen could aggravate
              coronavirus infections.<br>
              His comments are thought to be partly based on remarks
              made by an infectious diseases doctor about four young
              Covid-19 patients with no underlying health conditions who
              developed serious symptoms after taking ibuprofen, as well
              as a letter that had been published in the journal Lancet
              Respiratory Medicine three days earlier...<br>
              <br>
              he letter, from researchers in Switzerland, suggested
              ibuprofen makes it easier for the virus to get into the
              body’s cells and so could exacerbate infections.<br>
              In a clarification on March 16, the authors stressed they
              had merely been putting forward a ‘suspicion’.<br>
              But it was too late — worries about the ‘link’ were
              already rife and, on March 17, the NHS advised people with
              symptoms of Covid-19 to avoid taking ibuprofen and use
              paracetamol instead.<br>

              the Zero G concept was inspired by Reinhold Platz, chief
              designer for the Fokker Aircraft Company after WW1.
              Decades before the modern hang glider, he built and flew a
              full-scale canard-winged craft that folded up to carry on
              a bicycle. With small wings in front, the canard
              configuration allows a virtually stall-proof glider that
              will float eerily in a level attitude even when it’s
              barely flying forward. A clever dynamic bridle adjusts the
              angle of the forward wings in flight according to the
              tension on the line, allowing the kite to behave as a kite
              under tension and a glider whenever the line is released.<br>

              In this study, researchers from South Korea obtained
              extracts from various plant species and tested their
              efficacy in suppressing the fungus Colletotrichum
              coccodes, which causes anthracnose in Diospyros kaki
              (Japanese persimmon). Their findings were published in the
              journal Biological Agriculture &amp; Horticulture.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For their analysis, the researchers
              obtained extracts from various parts of 45 plant species
              from 27 families using different extraction methods.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Testing was conducted for the extracts
              alone and for a few selected ones in combination with
              emulsifiers like brown rice vinegar, powdered soap,
              loess-sulfur and natural emulsifier-B.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The researchers found that 10 percent
              fermentation extracts of Torilis japonica (Japanese hedge
              parsley) roots and Portulaca oleracea (common purslane),
              all above-ground parts, as well as 10 percent ethanol
              extracts of Rheum palmatum (Chinese rhubarb) roots and
              Cinnamomum cassia (Chinese cinnamon) bark effectively
              suppressed anthracnose by 83 percent or more in laboratory
              tests.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The researchers also found that
              anthracnose was 100 percent suppressed by three percent
              brown rice vinegar, three percent powdered soap, five
              percent loess-sulfur and five percent natural emulsifier-B
              in laboratory tests.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In field tests with organically grown
              D. kaki trees, the researchers found that the five percent
              fermentation extract of T. japonica and the five percent
              ethanol extract of R. palmatum reduced anthracnose by 63
              percent and 51 percent, respectively.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, the five percent
              fermentation extract of T. japonica combined with either
              one percent natural emulsifier-B or one percent
              loess-sulfur reduced anthracnose by 79 percent and 67
              percent, respectively.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The five percent ethanol extract of R.
              palmatum combined with either one percent natural
              emulsifier-B or one percent loess-sulfur reduced
              anthracnose by 63 and 56 percent, respectively.<br>
              <br>
              Based on their findings, the researchers concluded that
              plant extracts combined with natural emulsifiers can be
              used to control anthracnose in organic production systems.<br>

              </b>This study was conducted to determine suppression of
              the anthracnose fungus (Colletotrichum coccodes), causing
              disease in persimmon trees (Diospyros kaki Thunb), by (1)
              extracts from various parts of 45 plant species from 27
              families obtained using different extraction methods, and
              (2) selected plant extracts and emulsifiers. Fermentation
              extracts of Torilis japonica roots and Portulaca oleracea,
              all above ground parts, as well as ethanol extracts of
              Rheum palmatum roots and Cinnamomum cassia barks were
              found to effectively suppress anthracnose, leading to 83%,
              or more, suppression by 10% plant extracts in laboratory
              tests. Additionally, anthracnose was suppressed by 100% by
              3% brown rice vinegar, 3% powder soap, 5% loess sulphur,
              and by 5% natural emulsifier-B in a laboratory test. In
              the field trial with organically grown persimmon trees,
              treatments with plant extracts used on their own, resulted
              a reduction of anthracnose by 63% and 51% by 5%
              fermentation extract of T. japonica and 5% ethanol extract
              of R. palmatum, respectively, compared with a control.
              However, in treatments with combinations of plant extracts
              and emulsifiers, anthracnose was reduced by 79%, 67%, 63%
              and 56% when treated with 5% fermentation extract of T.
              japonica + natural emulsifier-B (1%), 5% fermentation
              extract of T. japonica + loess sulphur (1%), 5% ethanol
              extract of R. palmatum + natural emulsifier-B (1%), and 5%
              ethanol extract of R. palmatum + loess sulphur (1%),
              respectively, compared with the control. Thus, mixtures of
              plant extracts and emulsifiers may be used to control
              anthracnose in organic production systems.<b><br>

                  inflammation reducing properties</b><br>
              </div>
              <b><br>
              </b>The cannabis plant contains molecules that are 30
              times more powerful at reducing inflammation compared to
              aspiri, researchers have said.<br>
              <br>
              The molecules investigated by the Canadian research team
              are flavonoids. There are many different flavonoids
              available in different plants including those which we
              eat.<br>
              <br>
              Two specific flavonoids, cannflavin A and cannflavin B,
              were found to have the strong anti-inflammatory properties
              which could be used to develop pain relief with fewer side
              effects.<br>
              <br>
              Previously, cannabis has been shown to have potential for
              treating neuropathy pain in people with diabetes.<br>
              <br>
              Professor Tariq Akhtar, from the University of Guelph,
              said: “There’s clearly a need to develop alternatives for
              relief of acute and chronic pain that go beyond opioids.
              These molecules are non-psychoactive and they target the
              inflammation at the source, making them ideal
              painkillers.”<br>
              <br>
              Cannflavins were first discovered more than 30 years ago,
              but research into cannabis was highly regulated. Now the
              drug is legal in Canada, more studies are being carried
              out looking at how effective it might be in treating
              health issues.<br>
              <br>
              Chronic pain sometimes requires treatment with strong
              opioids which block the brain’s pain receptors. However,
              the use of opioids carries significant risk of developing
              addiction to the drugs.<br>
              <br>
              Relying on cannabis plants to treat pain could provide a
              useful alternative. The university is proceeding to trying
              to find a way of extracting the anti-inflammatory
              properties from the plant. The researchers will also need
              to test different doses to see how effective the treatment
              may be.<br>
              <br>
              Professor Steven Rothstei, who also worked on the trial,
              said: “Being able to offer a new pain relief option is
              exciting, and we are proud that our work has the potential
              to become a new tool in the pain relief arsenal.”<br>
              <br>
              The findings are published in the Phytochemistry journal.<br>

              <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              Since the outbreak of the severe respiratory disease
              caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the use of
              face masks has become ubiquitous worldwide to control the
              rapid spread of this pandemic. As a result, the world is
              currently facing a face mask shortage, and some countries
              have placed limits on the number of masks that can be
              bought by each person. Although the surgical grade N95
              mask provides the highest level of protection currently
              available, its filtration efficiency for sub-300 nm
              particles is around 85% due to its wider pore size (&#8764;300
              nm). Because the COVID-19 virus shows a diameter of around
              65–125 nm, there is a need for developing more efficient
              masks. To overcome these issues, we demonstrate the
              development of a flexible, nanoporous membrane to achieve
              a reusable N95 mask with a replaceable membrane and
              enhanced filtration efficiency. We first developed a
              flexible nanoporous Si-based template on a
              silicon-on-insulator wafer using KOH etching and then used
              the template as a hard mask during a reactive ion etching
              process to transfer the patterns onto a flexible and
              lightweight (&lt;0.12 g) polymeric membrane. Pores with
              sizes down to 5 nm were achieved with a narrow
              distribution. Theoretical calculations show that airflow
              rates above 85 L/min are possible through the mask, which
              confirms its breathability over a wide range of pore
              sizes, densities, membrane thicknesses, and pressure
              drops. Finally, the membrane is intrinsically hydrophobic,
              which contributes to antifouling and self-cleaning as a
              result of droplets rolling and sliding on the inclined
              mask area.<br>

              My name is Rachel Seller and I'm a registered nurse. My
              specialty is forensic nursing. I expose medical crime on
              misdiagnosis. At a time I help people discover the root
              cause of disease. I'm also a holistic nurse so I
              specialize in all things: natural medicine integrative and
              functional medicine. Today I have a very important message
              for you about vaccines containing MRC five cell line. This
              is an urgent message. What we now know about vaccines,
              they are genetically modified organisms. They were made in
              a lab. They are using aborted human fetal cells! I also
              want to tell you that my brother who was 18 years old was
              vaccine injured. He went paralyzed from waist down after a
              flu shot and none of the doctors knew what was wrong with
              him. I will tell you today that these vaccines that they
              are making, the only thing I can think of is calling it as
              WITCHCRAFT, medical sorcery. This is vast vaccine sorcery
              because the MRC five cell line is actually used using
              aborted human fetal tissue! This fetal tissue has been
              around since the 1960s.. So basically they're taking
              aborted human fetal cells that are CANCEROUS and they are
              putting it into your vaccine MRC-5 cell line. It is a
              genetically modified cell line but this is nothing new.
              That's in the insert. This is why we have cancer and
              autoimmune folks! it's very important not to fall into any
              of the cancer vaccine scams! Vaccines are bio weapons and
              the ones that contain MRC-5 cell line is a whole other
              level of a bio weapon. <br>

                <b>Teng and Yang et al.</b><br>
              </div>
              <b>Introduction<br>
              </b>The development of effective and energy-efficient
              water disinfection technologies is extremely urgent to
              relieve clean water scarcity and global energy shortage.1
              Photocatalytic disinfection is considered to be a
              promising approach.6<br>
              Nowadays, the most efficient photocatalysts for
              disinfection are metal-based nanomaterials, but they are
              likely to cause secondary pollution because of the
              inevitable release of metal ions.10<br>
              Hence, it is of great importance to seek highly efficient
              metal-free photocatalysts for water disinfection. Until
              now, the efficiency of the reported metal-free
              photocatalysts has been much lower than that of
              metal-based photocatalysts. One of the reasons is that the
              surface of carbon materials is chemically inert and
              hydrophobic, which limits their application in catalysis,
              especially in aqueous solutions.17<br>
              Another reason is that the band gaps of the widely studied
              carbon materials—such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, and
              graphene oxide—are too small to effectively generate
              electron-hole pairs.19<br>
              Thus, they cannot produce enough reactive oxygen species
              (ROS) to inactivate pathogen via photocatalysis.<br>
              Recently, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), first
              reported by Wang et al. as a fascinating two-dimensional
              layered metal-free semiconductor with a band gap of
              approximately 2.7 eV, drew broad interdisciplinary
              attention for its photocatalytic abilities. Wang et al.
              also first reported the disinfection effect of g-C3N4.22<br>
              However, the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency of
              g-C3N4 is much lower than that of metal-based
              photocatalysts because of its fast recombination.23<br>
              Many approaches, such as element doping and morphology
              control, have been adopted to improve the catalytic
              activity, but the limited enhancement achieved so far
              leaves it still far from feasible with respect to
              practical application, and the efficiency still remains
              inferior to that of metal-based catalysts.13<br>
              Considering that the introduction of electron-withdrawing
              groups can modify the charge distribution on
              nanomaterials, we propose a novel method to promote the
              charge separation efficiency of g-C3N4 by introducing
              electron-withdrawing groups at the edge of g-C3N4
              nanosheets, which can induce an anisotropic built-in
              electric field in the two-dimensional plane, and thus the
              recombination can be suppressed.<br>
              Herein, we synthesized the edge-functionalized g-C3N4
              nanosheets by using a facile method and investigated its
              photocatalytic disinfection performance (Scheme 1).
              Notably, a record-high efficiency of &#8722;log10(C/C0) = 6
              (&gt;99.9999%) in the disinfection of model Escherichia
              coli (E. coli) was obtained in 30 min under visible-light
              irradiation. Meanwhile, its first-order disinfection rate
              is five times higher than that of previously reported best
              metal-free photocatalysts with only 1/10 catalyst
              consumption. This remarkably high efficiency is also
              comparable to that of the best metal-based photocatalysts.
              With further investigation using transmission electron
              microscopy (TEM), density functional theory (DFT)
              calculations, and electron spin resonance (ESR), it was
              found that the edge functionalization of g-C3N4 nanosheets
              not only induces an upward bending of their energy band,
              which improves the adsorption of oxygen molecules, but
              also promotes the separation of photo-generated
              electron-hole pairs. Importantly, this catalyst was also
              incorporated into portable devices for highly efficient
              and large-scale water disinfection, producing water that
              reaches the standard of drinking water. Thus, these
              devices are believed to be very promising for commercial
              applications.<br>

                be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time
                likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness
                stings with intolerable insult. To be “cured” against

              been circulating around the world probably since last
              September. You WILL have to confront this thing, if you
              haven't already. There is no way around it, unless you
              lock yourself up in your house and it somehow doesn't
              manage to hop on some mail or some groceries that you
              ordered online. Your fear is not an excuse to destroy
              America. Your fear is not my fear and your fear does not
              have the right to interfere with my life, my job, my
              income or my future as a free American citizen. So if
              you're scared, you can just put your tin foil hat on, or
              even wrap foil all around your whole body - or around your
              whole house if you wish - but please keep your fear
              contained to your little corner of the world and don't

                How to opt out<br>
              </font></font></b><font color="#660000"><font
              color="#000000">OK, here’s how to take control of this
              stuff if you’re worried about it. No, opting out is not
              especially simple, although if you take an absolutist
              approach it doesn’t take at all long to set everything to
              ‘no.’ If you’re yet to install Windows 10 and are
              concerned about all this stuff, you can head most of it
              off at the pass by declining Express settings and choosing
              options yourself, refusing any request to let the OS or
              apps access your location and turning the Cortana search
              assistant off. If you missed the boat there, you’ll need
              to do any and all of the following. Even if you were
              super-cautious during setup, be sure to follow step 3
              below if you’re concerned.<br>
              <br>
              1. Go to Settings – Privacy and go through the 13
              different screens there and turn anything which concerns
              you to off. The biggest, most universal settings are under
              ‘General’, while the other screens let you choose which
              apps can and can’t access your calendar, messages, camera,
              mic, etcetera. There may well be stuff you want to leave
              on – for instance, I do actually want Windows’ Calendar
              app to access my calendar data (obv), I just don’t want it
              to sell that data on because I don’t want to be bombarded
              with flower ads when it’s my mum’s birthday.<br>
              <br>
              2. Depending on whether you’ve been finding it useful or
              not, you may want to go to Cortana’s settings and turn off
              everything there. It’s just working as a basic file search
              for me now, as I didn’t want its ‘suggestions’, I didn’t
              want it to lock me into Bing and I didn’t want a tiny part
              of my processor to be forever dedicated to listening out
              for voice commands I will never use.<br>
              <br>
              3. This is the crucial one, and so fundamental to Windows
              10’s tracking that Microsoft have stuck the setting on an
              external website, which they say is so that it’s on one
              easy dashboard, but I find it hard not to wonder if it’s
              in the hope that we don’t easily stumble across it while
              browsing Windows 10’s own Privacy menus. Said website is
              colourful and cheerful and can play a video at you talking
              about how wonderful targeted advertising is. Ignore the
              bumf and instead go directly here and set both options to
              Off. It’s the innocuous-sounding “Personalised ads
              wherever I use my Microsoft account” which is the likely
              root of all this, because having that on means Windows 10
              itself becomes a hub for targeted ads. You’ll probably
              have set up Windows 10 with a Microsoft account, because
              it heavily encourages you to do so with talk of
              synchronised files and settings and a OneDrive cloud
              account during installation, but this means the OS is
              signed into that account all the time. As a result,
              Windows 10 itself has it spyglasses on, not just apps or
              pages that you’re signed into with your MS account.<br>
              <br>
              I notice that every time I go back to that page, the
              “Personalised ads in this browser” setting has silently
              turned itself back on again. This is concerning, but I’m
              not yet sure if it’s a bug or if it’s exploiting sessions
              as an excuse to reset regularly. Judicious ad and cookie
              control with your plugins and browser options of choice
              can change this, however. Again, do remember that many
              websites are dependent on advertising revenue to survive,
              but opting out of targeted advertising – and having that
              opt out be respected – is another matter entirely.<br>
              <br>
              4. You may also wish to remove your Microsoft account from
              Windows 10 and use a local account instead. This will
              double-down on restricting what’s harvested, though you’ll
              lose out on features such as settings synchronisation
              across all your PCs and will suffer more nagging from
              stuff like the Windows Store and OneDrive. Probably not a
              big deal for many people, I suspect. Go to Settings –
              Accounts – Your Account within Windows 10 (or just type
              ‘Accounts’ into haha Cortana) to get to the relevant
              options.<br>
              <br>
              If you have multiple PCs already running Windows 10 you’ll
              need to do all of this on each of them, although your
              Microsoft account opt-out should be universal.<br>
              <br>
              None of these options mean you’ll see fewer ads, but they
              do mean that not quite so much information about you will
              be gathered and sold, and also that the ads you do see
              won’t be ‘relevant’ to what algorithms have decided your
              interests are. It is worth noting that some folk find the
              latter to be preferable to entirely irrelevant ads, and in
              some cases even useful – but certainly not everyone.
              Hopefully you can use the information here to make an
              informed choice about what happens. Again, in many
              respects it’s not wildly different from what already
              happens on your smart phone or your browser, but it’s
              important that you should know about it, and that Windows
              now has something of an ulterior motive.<br>
              <br>
              More options, or clearer options, may become available in
              time, depending on how much of the world frowns at
              Microsoft about this. I’ll let you know if I hear of
              anything else that needs doing in order to have Windows 10
              respect your privacy.<br>

              color="#000000">Shadows are everywhere. Not much
              engineering use has been found for shadows, and this
              ubiquitous effect is strenuously avoided in optoelectronic
              applications. In this work, we present a shadow-effect
              energy generator (SEG) that scavenges the illumination
              contrast that arises on the device from shadow castings,
              and generates a direct current, simply by placing a part
              of the generator in shadow. The shadow-effect mechanism is
              experimentally validated by Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy
              (KPFM). The SEG is capable of harvesting energy from
              illumination contrasts arising under weak ambient light.
              Without any optimization, our generator has a power
              density of 0.14 &#956;W cm&#8722;2 under indoor conditions 0.001 sun,
              where shadows are persistent. Our SEG performs 200% better
              than that of commercial silicon solar cells under the
              effects of shadows. The harvested energy from our
              generator in the presence of shadows arising at a very low
              intensity (0.0025 sun) can drive an electronic watch (1.2
              V). In addition, the SEG can serve as a self-powered
              sensor for monitoring moving objects by tracking the
              movement of shadows. With its cost-efficiency, simplicity
              and stability, our SEG offers a promising architecture to
              generate green energy from ambient conditions to power
              electronics, and as a part of a smart sensor systems,
              especially in buildings.<br>

              color="#000000">The density of gold and tungsten are
              almost identical, allowing for substitution by
              unscrupulous entities. The detection of the replacement is
              difficult to detect by common nondestructive testing
              methods, and repositories have resorted to drilling,
              cutting and melting samples of gold bars to certify their
              integrity. Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy allows a
              digital fingerprint to be produced, which has been shown
              to be effective in the detection of tampering. These
              spectra are representative of the dimensions, density and
              elastic constants of any solid object. Since the
              dimensions and density are essentially identical for pure
              and adulterated gold samples, only the elastic constant
              variance changes the spectral fingerprint. The method
              described in this application provides a reliable and
              accurate process to certify the integrity of gold samples.<br>

            <b>By Michael Thomsen&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
            </b></div>
          A new joint study from MIT and Harvard has identified an
          enzyme that could help reverse the effects of DNA damage
          associated with aging and Alzheimer's disease. <br>
          <br>
          The researchers, led by MIT's Li-Huei Tsai and Harvard's
          Stephen Haggarty, identified an enzyme called HDAC1 that can
          help repair 8-oxoguanine lesions on DNA strands, which have
          been linked to age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's.<br>
          <br>
          Test subjects with fewer of these lesions exhibit
          significantly improved cognitive performance, memory ability
          and basic spatial awareness.<br>
          Researchers identified an enzyme that can heal DNA lesions
          linked to cognitive decline and Alzheimer's. Scans from mice
          with an abundance of HDAC1 (top row) had fewer lesions, shown
          as dark green spots, than mice with no HDAC1 (bottom row)<br>
          <br>
          'It seems that HDAC1 is really an anti-aging molecule,' Tsai
          told MIT News.<br>
          <br>
          'I think this is a very broadly applicable basic biology
          finding, because nearly all of the human neurodegenerative
          diseases only happen during aging. I would speculate that
          activating HDAC1 is beneficial in many conditions.'<br>
          <br>
          Tsai and Haggerty tested their theory on mice, by genetically
          engineering some to not produce HDAC1 and comparing them as
          they aged with a control group with normal levels of HDAC1.<br>
          <br>
          While there were no significant differences initially, over
          time the mice without the ability to produce HDAC1 developed
          DNA lesions at a faster rate than for the control and they
          showed declines in memory tests and spatial navigation.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;HDAC1 regulates the production of a separate enzyme,
          OGG1, which can repair these DNA lesions, but as HDAC1
          production decreases with age, so does the brain's ability to
          heal itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          The researchers are hopeful that a safe chemical treatment can
          be found to help stimulate the production for HDAC1 in humans
          to heal the accumulation of DNA lesions that build up with age<br>
          <br>
          The researchers are hopeful that a safe chemical treatment can
          be found to help stimulate the production for HDAC1 in humans
          to heal the accumulation of DNA lesions that build up with age<br>
          <br>
          In earlier research, Tsai and her team established that HDAC1
          production could be stimulated with the drug exifone, which
          had been commonly prescribed in the 1980s as a treatment for
          dementia.<br>
          <br>
          The drug had been discontinued on humans after it was shown to
          cause liver damage, but in tests on mice, Tsai showed it
          stimulated the production of HDAC1 and improved the cognitive
          ability and memory performance in mice.<br>
          <br>
          Tsai also found that the mice had a significant reduction in
          lesions after being given exifone.<br>
          <br>
          'This study really positions HDAC1 as a potential new drug
          target for age-related phenotypes, as well as
          neurodegeneration-associated pathology and phenotypes,' Tsai
          said.<br>
          <br>
          While the team isn't advocating for exifone to be prescribed
          to humans, the findings make them hopeful a similar but safer
          drug could be found to stimulate HDAC1 production as a
          treatment for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's.<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          Griffithsin (GRFT), an algae-derived lectin, is one of the
          most potent viral entry inhibitors discovered to date. It is
          currently being developed as a microbicide with broad-spectrum
          activity against several enveloped viruses. GRFT can inhibit
          human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection at picomolar
          concentrations, surpassing the ability of most anti-HIV
          agents. The potential to inhibit other viruses as well as
          parasites has also been demonstrated. Griffithsin’s antiviral
          activity stems from its ability to bind terminal mannoses
          present in high-mannose oligosaccharides and crosslink these
          glycans on the surface of the viral envelope glycoproteins.
          Here, we review structural and biochemical studies that
          established mode of action and facilitated construction of
          GRFT analogs, mechanisms that may lead to resistance, and in
          vitro and pre-clinical results that support the therapeutic
          potential of this lectin.<br>

          <br>
          &nbsp;Doxycycline along with Ivermectin has yielded
          near-miraculous results in Covid 19 patients claim experts
          from Bangladesh. The Hunt for new effective treatment for
          Covid 19 is on. A team of doctors from Bangladesh have claimed
          that their research on the combination of two widely used
          drugs has yielded astounding results in curing the patients
          with acute symptoms of the coronavirus that has created havoc
          worldwide and claimed the lives of over 312,000 people
          globally. The claim by the Bangladeshi medical team, which
          includes prominent physicians from the country, comes amidst
          the desperate global attempts for a remedy to the deadly
          coronavirus.<br>
          <br>
          We have got astounding results. Out of 60 COVID-19 patients,
          all recovered as the combination of the two drugs were
          applied, said Professor Dr Md Tarek Alam, the head of medicine
          department at private Bangladesh Medical College Hospital
          (BMCH). Alam, a reputed clinician in Bangladesh, said a
          frequently used antiprotozoal medicine called Ivermectin in a
          single dose with Doxycycline, an antibiotic, yielded virtually
          the near-miraculous result in curing the patients with
          COVID-19.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          My team was prescribing the two medicines only for coronavirus
          patients, most of them initially reporting with respiratory
          problems with related complaints, later to be tested COVID-19
          positive, he said. Bangladesh has so far reported 20,995
          coronavirus cases. A total of 314 people have lost their lives
          in the country due to the disease. Claiming that the efficacy
          of the drug developed by them was such that patients recovered
          from the virus within 4 days, he said, adding that there were
          no side effects of it.<br>
          <br>
          We first ask them to be tested for COVID-19 and when found
          coronavirus positive we apply the drugs . . . they are
          recovering within four days". "The repeated or second tests,
          in line with the procedure, reconfirmed them COVID-19 negative
          in all the cases under the research which found the
          combination to have no side effects on patients either, he
          said. We are hundred per cent hopeful about the effectiveness
          of the combination, he said, adding they by now contacted the
          concerned government regulators and preparing to exhaust
          international procedures for acknowledgement of the drugs for
          the COVID-19 treatment...<br>

          <br>
          A LOT of attention has been given to Professor Neil Ferguson’s
          dubious track record on epidemics and his equally dubious
          judgment in meeting his lover on at least two occasions during
          the lockdown introduced on his own advice.<br>
          <br>
          On closer examination, there are two especially significant
          elements crying out for independent investigation: the quality
          and reliability of Ferguson’s computer model, and the
          political affiliations of his lover.<br>
          <br>
          Firstly, the computer model. The source code behind the
          Ferguson model has finally been made available to the public
          via the GitHub website. Mark E Jeftovic, in his Axis of Easy
          website, says: ‘A code review has been undertaken by an
          anonymous ex-Google software engineer here, who tells us the
          GitHub repository code has been heavily massaged by Microsoft
          engineers, and others, in an effort to whip the code into
          shape to safely expose it to thioe public. Alas, they seem to
          have failed and numerous flaws and bugs from the original
          software persist in the released version. Requests for the
          unedited version of the original code behind the model have
          gone unanswered.’<br>
          <br>
          Jeftovic believes the most worrisome outcome of the model
          review is that the code produces ‘non-deterministic outputs’.
          This means that owing to bugs, the code can produce very
          different results given identical inputs, making the code
          unsuitable for scientific purposes. Jeftovic says the
          documentation provided wants the reader to accept that given a
          ‘starting seed’, the model will always produce the same
          results. ‘Investigation reveals the truth: the code produces
          critically different results, even for identical starting
          seeds and parameters.’<br>
          <br>
          He says that a team even found that the output varied
          depending on which type of computer it was run on.<br>
          <br>
          Jeftovic cannot understand why the Imperial team failed to
          realise that their software was so flawed. He quotes the usual
          computing adage ‘Garbage In/Garbage Out’ which the untrained
          reader may think is what is being asserted in the code review.
          In fact, he says, ‘it’s not. What’s being asserted is that
          output is garbage, regardless of the input. In this case, the
          output we’re experiencing as a result is a worldwide lockdown
          and shutdown of the global economy, and we don’t really know
          if this was necessary or not, because we have no actual data
          (aside from Sweden) and severely flawed models.’<br>
          <br>
          Another expert, Martin Armstrong (who has a controversial
          record) also reviews the Ferguson model code and comes to very
          similar conclusions. He says that it ‘is such a joke it is
          either an outright fraud, or it is the most inept piece of
          programming&nbsp; I have ever seen in my life . . . This is
          the most unprofessional operation perhaps in computer science.
          The entire team should be disbanded and an independent team
          put in place to review the work of Neil Ferguson . . . The
          only reasonable conclusion I can reach is that this has been
          deliberately used to justify bogus forecasts intent for
          political activism . . . There seems to have been no
          independent review of Ferguson’s work, which is
          unimaginable!’...<br>

              Viral On Brighteon.com, Facebook Bans All Brighteon Links,

          <br>
          Facebook has initiated a whole new level of tyranny and
          censorship to try to eliminate any information about the Wuhan
          coronavirus that disagrees with the World Health Organization,
          which is largely run by communist China and is currently led
          by a former member of a violent communist group.<br>
          <br>
          Late last night, Facebook began banning all links from
          Brighteon.com, regardless of the content of the videos,
          claiming that videos about gardening and smoothie recipes and
          backyard chickens now violate Facebook’s “community
          guidelines.”<br>
          <br>
          The real reason for the banning, of course, is that
          Brighteon.com hosts the “Plandemic” video featuring Dr. Judy
          Mikovits who warns about the dangers of the coronavirus
          vaccine. Users have posted a Portuguese version of the
          documentary that has achieved nearly a million views, and a
          Greek language version is also rapidly gaining hundreds of
          thousands of views.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The rapid explosion in people viewing the video has resulted
          in Facebook blacklisting the entire Brighteon platform,
          confirming Facebook is engaged in anti-trust behavior to try
          to crush competing platforms by starving them of user traffic.
          This is blatant criminal anti-trust behavior on the part of
          Facebook, and it is a direct attack on human knowledge and
          human freedom.<br>
          <br>
          Even more importantly, both Facebook and YouTube now openly
          claim that any content which contradicts the “official”
          opinions of the W.H.O. will be banned, meaning Facebook and
          YouTube are now run by communist China, because that’s the
          anti-human rights regime that dictates the policies of the
          W.H.O.<br>
          Facebook scrubs all Natural News content posted since November
          of 2019<br>
          <br>
          Adding to the extreme, punitive censorship, Facebook also
          banned all links from NaturalNews.com and NewsTarget.com while
          scrubbing all the content we have posted, back to November of
          2019, which is the month in which the Wuhan coronavirus
          bioweapon was released by communist China.<br>

          <br>
          Any attempt to post any link from Natural News or NewsTarget
          is now blocked by Facebook, and Facebook has scrubbed all our
          posts about the coronavirus in order to cover up communist
          China’s war against humanity.<br>
          <br>
          In effect, Facebook is now covering up the bioweapons crimes
          of communist China by banning independent media publishers
          that are documenting China’s deliberate engineering and
          release of this weapon against humanity.<br>
          <br>
          This puts Mark Zuckerberg in the same class as Adolf Hitler
          and Joseph Stalin, actively carrying out crimes against
          humanity and defending an anti-human regime that builds
          weapons of mass destruction to cause mass death on a global
          scale. Mark Zuckerberg is an enemy of humanity and a criminal
          against all who value life and liberty.<br>
          <br>
          We repeat our call for the arrest and prosecution of Mark
          Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook and other
          tech giant CEOs that have engaged in malicious, anti-human
          censorship that protects communist China and the vaccine
          industry.<br>
          How to share the Plandemic video on Facebook and other
          platforms without getting banned<br>
          <br>
          Because of the extreme level of criminal censorship being
          carried out by Facebook, YouTube, Google, Twitter and even
          Vimeo, the only current way to share Plandemic videos from
          Brighteon.com or other targeted platforms is to embed the
          videos on another website page, then share that page.<br>
          <br>
          Each video on Brighteon.com has a “share” link at the bottom
          right-hand corner:<br>
          <br>
          From the share link, you can copy either the direct link to
          the video play page or get embed code that embeds the video
          into any web page. This code can be pasted into the HTML code
          of any page, including pages that are edited in WordPress or
          other page editors.<br>
          <br>
          Here’s an example of the embed code for the Plandemic video
          from the “Jesus Social” channel on Brighteon:<br>
          <br>
          &lt;iframe
          src=’https://www.brighteon.com/embed/45c1558c-4163-4961-9f92-11c7c4c1af21&#8242;














          width=’560&#8242; height=’315&#8242; frameborder=’0&#8242;
          allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br>
          <br>
          And here’s the embedded video it produces when you add this
          code to your web page:<br>
          <br>
          Once the video is embedded in your page, you can then share
          that page on Facebook or other platforms.<br>
          <br>
          You can also, of course, share Brighteon links on Gab.com and
          other alternative internet ecosystems that aren’t run by evil
          globalists working for communist China.<br>
          <br>
          In the future, we will also have alternate URLs and domain
          names that will allow you to share Brighteon videos, but those
          domains will of course be eventually banned by Facebook and
          the other tech giants, all of which are criminal operations
          that are complicit in communist China’s war against humanity.<br>
          <br>
          The tech giants will not stop until they succeed in destroying
          humanity and achieving mass death across the globe.<br>
          <br>
          We have now arrived at a very dark chapter in human history
          where the gatekeepers who control online speech are protecting
          the very communist regime that has declared war on humanity
          through the deliberate deployment of engineered bioweapons.
          Mark Zuckerberg and other big tech globalists are criminals
          against humanity, and they no longer even pretend to support
          free speech. Instead, they brazenly censor all platforms and
          publishers that are working to blow the whistle on global
          criminals who wield weapons of mass destruction against the
          innocent.<br>
          <br>
          This is why today, we are repeating our call for the arrest
          and prosecution of Mark Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Google,
          YouTube, Twitter and Vimeo for their conspiracy against
          humankind and their deliberate, malicious crimes against human
          freedom and human survival.<br>
          <br>
          Human freedom cannot coexist with these evil, anti-human
          regimes. We either dismantle the tech giants and imprison
          their architects and leaders, or humanity dies in darkness.<br>
          <br>
          Even if it is his last act, President Trump must deploy
          military police to arrest the CEOs of the tech giants and
          prosecute them under military tribunals for their crimes
          against humanity. Trump must order the US State Department to
          seize the domain names of all the tech giants engaged in
          malicious censorship, halting their operations until they
          restore First Amendment protections on their platforms. In
          just 24 hours, Trump could order the US government to seize
          Google.com, Apple.com, Twitter.com, YouTube.com, Vimeo.com and
          all the other domains run by the techno-fascists, and he could
          force them to either respect the First Amendment or be
          permanently put out of business.<br>
          <br>
          And no, that isn’t tyranny on the part of government, not when
          the only demand is that tech platforms must respect the
          freedoms described in the Bill of Rights. For the free world
          to thrive, Sec. 230 must be dismantled and free speech must be
          affirmed across the internet, or humanity has no future other
          than death and tyranny.<br>
          <br>
          That’s the whole plan behind the coronavirus, of course: To
          unleash mass death, tyranny and censorship, carrying out a new
          holocaust against billions of innocent people so that
          globalists can achieve their depopulation dreams.<br>

          Watch my recent interview with Dr. Judy Mikovits to find out
          why globalists are so afraid of this woman that they are

              along with Ivermectin has yielded near-miraculous results
              in Covid 19 patients claim experts from Bangladesh. The
              Hunt for new effective treatment for Covid 19 is on. A
              team of doctors from Bangladesh have claimed that their
              research on the combination of two widely used drugs has
              yielded astounding results in curing the patients with
              acute symptoms of the coronavirus that has created havoc
              worldwide and claimed the lives of over 312,000 people
              globally. The claim by the Bangladeshi medical team, which
              includes prominent physicians from the country, comes
              amidst the desperate global attempts for a remedy to the
              deadly coronavirus.<br>
              <br>
              We have got astounding results. Out of 60 COVID-19
              patients, all recovered as the combination of the two
              drugs were applied, said Professor Dr Md Tarek Alam, the
              head of medicine department at private Bangladesh Medical
              College Hospital (BMCH). Alam, a reputed clinician in
              Bangladesh, said a frequently used antiprotozoal medicine
              called Ivermectin in a single dose with Doxycycline, an
              antibiotic, yielded virtually the near-miraculous result
              in curing the patients with COVID-19.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              My team was prescribing the two medicines only for
              coronavirus patients, most of them initially reporting
              with respiratory problems with related complaints, later
              to be tested COVID-19 positive, he said. Bangladesh has so
              far reported 20,995 coronavirus cases. A total of 314
              people have lost their lives in the country due to the
              disease. Claiming that the efficacy of the drug developed
              by them was such that patients recovered from the virus
              within 4 days, he said, adding that there were no side
              effects of it.<br>
              <br>
              We first ask them to be tested for COVID-19 and when found
              coronavirus positive we apply the drugs . . . they are
              recovering within four days". "The repeated or second
              tests, in line with the procedure, reconfirmed them
              COVID-19 negative in all the cases under the research
              which found the combination to have no side effects on
              patients either, he said. We are hundred per cent hopeful
              about the effectiveness of the combination, he said,
              adding they by now contacted the concerned government
              regulators and preparing to exhaust international
              procedures for acknowledgement of the drugs for the
              COVID-19 treatment...</font><b><font color="#000000"><br>

              posed by the COVID-19 coronavirus among high-risk
              individuals and the vulnerability of the earth’s 7.9
              billion human population to a newly mutated COVID-19
              coronavirus without a proven vaccine has prompted Moshe
              Shifrine PhD&nbsp; to pose a revolutionary therapy based
              upon his decades of research in the field of olfactory
              (smell) therapy.<br>
              <br>
              Dr. Shifrine holds two patents on the use of odors to
              tickle the olfactory bulb in the nose to produce hormones
              like testosterone and insulin.&nbsp; Dr. Shifrine writes:<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Just a small number of molecules (in a
              concentration in billionths of a gram) in the nasal
              passages are needed to carry scent to the 20,000 nerve
              receptors in the olfactory bulb that is located on both
              hemispheres of the forebrain.&nbsp; When the molecules
              attach to these receptors their vibratory signature sends
              an electric signal to the hypothalamus in the brain that
              results in the production of the smelled substance.&nbsp;
              For example, the scent of testosterone or insulin
              stimulates the body’s production of these hormones.”<br>
              <br>
              Dr. Shifrine instructs:&nbsp; The olfactory system is able
              to distinguish 12,000 different aromas.<br>

              Dr. Shifrine holds a patent (US 8,679,507 B2) for the use
              of truffle extract that contains a very small amount of
              natural testosterone. A whiff of same has been
              demonstrated to double testosterone levels in men in all
              ten subjects tested.&nbsp; The truffle extract, available
              commercially, also elevates testosterone levels in females
              and was demonstrated to alleviate common symptoms of
              menopause.<br>
              <br>
              Shifrine, who has spent 15 years investigating olfactory
              science, suggests, via a natural mechanism he calls
              HARMONIC OLFACTORY IMMUNITY, that it may, in a patient
              with COVID-19 coronavirus-infection, be possible to obtain
              natural antibodies from saliva via a mouth swab and expose
              the olfactory bulb to them via the nasal passages.&nbsp;
              This in turn would make direct contact with the brain and
              therefore would purportedly increase antibody response
              throughout the body...<br>

              </font></b><font color="#000000">I have been saying for
              months now that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) would be
              an excellent treatment adjunct against severe COVID-19 and
              a superior alternative to ventilators, which have been
              shown to cause harm in many patients and increase the risk
              of death.<br>
              <br>
              Mechanical ventilation can easily damage the lungs for the
              fact that it’s pushing air into the lungs with force in a
              disease where the alveoli are compromised and filled with
              fluid from inflammatory cytokines due to insulin
              resistance. HBOT bypasses this problem by supplying 100%
              oxygen in a pressurized chamber, which allows your body to
              bypass this defect and absorb oxygen directly into your
              tissues.<br>
              <br>
              There’s no airflow being forced directly into the lungs.
              HBOT also improves mitochondrial function, helps with
              detoxification, inhibits and controls inflammation and
              optimizes your body’s innate healing capacity.<br>

              deploying “off-label compassionate use” of HBOT as an
              alternative for patients that would otherwise have
              required ventilation. Dr. Kelly Thibodeaux told WGNO:<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The thing we see with severe COVID-19
              patients is a complication with an inability to carry
              oxygen in addition to the problem to lungs itself. It’s
              not just lung injury. The virus does something to the red
              blood cells of certain patients …<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being inside hyperbaric chambers won’t
              cause injury. It’s a less invasive way to deliver oxygen
              that doesn’t require sticking a tube down the trachea.”<br>

              Hospital’s decision to deploy HBOT for compassionate use
              was in part supported by the findings of Chinese doctors
              who reported3 “promising results” after treating five
              COVID-19 patients with HBOT. Two were in critical
              condition and three were severe. As reported by the
              International Hyperbarics Association:4<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Hyperbaric oxygen was added to the
              current comprehensive treatments being performed at the
              hospital for COVID-19 affected patients, with a dose of
              90-120 minutes at treatment pressures of 1.4 to 1 fi.ATA.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The results were very encouraging as
              these five patients received significant therapeutic
              benefits, including rapid relief of symptoms after the
              first session.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rationale for adding this procedure
              is to help combat the progressive hypoxemia (low blood
              oxygen levels) that COVID-19 can cause. Hyperbaric oxygen
              has the ability to add a substantial supply of extra
              oxygen into the bloodstream …”<br>

                <br>
              </font></b><font color="#000000">The report5 from China
              states patients with severe COVID-19 disease experienced
              rapid relief of hypoxic symptoms, rapid correction of
              hypoxemia, improved lung pathology and a general reversal
              of associated conditions, including gastrointestinal
              symptoms, appetite, headache and mental state.<br>
              <br>
              The report also details some of the mechanics behind HBOT
              and why it benefits COVID-19. Importantly, delivering
              oxygen under pressure allows for greater oxygen uptake by
              inflamed lung tissue.<br>
              <br>
              It also improves cellular oxygen uptake in general, and to
              a greater degree than extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
              (ECMO), which involves oxygenating the patient’s blood
              outside the body and then pumping it back into
              circulation.<br>
              <br>
              And, while ECMO is recommended6,7 for relatively young
              patients with few comorbidities who are failing to respond
              to ventilator treatment, Opelousas General Hospital’s work
              shows HBOT can successfully be used on older patients who
              have several comorbidities. Moreover, as noted in the
              Chinese report, HBOT does not conflict with other
              conventional means of critical treatment:8<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “HBOT is not the etiological treatment
              of COVID-19, it is the symptomatic treatment of hypoxia in
              patients with COVID-19, and it is a supplement to the
              existing oxygen treatment technology …<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to HBOT, ICU clinicians are
              still responsible for the daily comprehensive treatment of
              the above-mentioned severe patients. There is no conflict
              in treatment technology. On the contrary, it can provide
              better support for other supportive treatments.”<br>

              clinical trial involving more than 100 covid-19 patients
              in Ecuador has resulted in a claimed 100 cure rate within
              four days, according to Andreas Kalcker who is closely
              following the results of the effort. The tests were
              carried out by the Asociacion Ecuatoriana de Medicos
              Expertos en Medicina Integrativa, a group of integrative
              medicine practitioners.<br>
              <br>
              Ecuador has been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus,
              and the current “standard of care” promoted by Western
              medicine — largely based on the use of ventilators — has
              been killing the vast majority of critical patients while
              utterly failing to address the real root of the problem.<br>
              <br>
              Covid-19 isn’t an Acute Respiratory Disease (ARD), it
              turns out. Rather, it often presents as an inflammation
              and blood clotting condition (see The Lancet research,
              below) which causes the blood to be unable to carry
              oxygen, resulting in patient hypoxia and eventual
              asphyxiation.<br>
              <br>
              This is why intravenous chlorine dioxide — which
              immediately delivers a high dose of oxygen to blood cells
              — is believed to work so effectively against covid-19. It
              reportedly restores the oxygen-carrying capacity of
              hemoglobin and clears the clotting in the lungs, all while
              destroying pathogens.<br>
              <br>
              Chlorine dioxide researcher and advocate Andreas Kalcker
              has posted a video (in Spanish) where he explains the
              findings. That video, entitled, “Mas de 100 Casos de
              Covid-19 recuperados con CDS por medicos de Aememi,” is

              Andreas explains that researchers were able to achieve a
              complete cure in just four days through the use of
              intravenous chlorine dioxide (ClO2). Here’s a photo of
              some of the researchers holding syringes of chlorine
              dioxide, which is then infused into the patients’ blood,
              where it releases a wave of oxygen that researchers
              believe saturates the blood with O2 while killing
              pathogens:<br>
              <br>
              Another clinical trial involving chlorine dioxide is
              currently under way, documented by the US National Library
              of Medicine at ClinicalTrials.gov. The study uses oral
              chlorine dioxide (rather than intravenous) and is
              entitled, “Determination of the Effectiveness of Oral
              Chlorine Dioxide in the Treatment of COVID 19.” The trial
              is being conducted by the Genesis Foundation and involves
              20 patients.<br>

              in his video that chlorine dioxide is a powerful
              disinfectant that destroys viruses and bacteria. The
              substance has long been used in water purification
              processes and is approved by various US government
              agencies for as a water treatment and purification agent.<br>
              <br>
              This video frame shows blood cells being flooded with
              oxygen from ClO2, instantly reducing clotting /
              coagulation:<br>

              </font></b><font color="#000000">In another bombshell
              science paper published May 7, 2020, in The Lancet,
              researchers Dennis McGonagle and others determined that
              covid-19 is not a respiratory disease but rather “diffuse
              pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy,” a kind of blood
              clotting that presents in lung tissue.<br>
              <br>
              This explains why patients with covid-19 are dying from
              hypoxia (lack of oxygen) and are frequently killed by the
              use of ventilators. As an ICU doctor from New York warned
              months ago, doctors are treating the wrong disease. (That
              doctor’s YouTube channel was deleted and all his videos
              were censored, of course. No one is allowed to question
              medical orthodoxy in the medical police state known as the
              United States of America.)<br>
              <br>
              Study authors also found the inflammation triggers a
              worsening of the condition, which implies that
              anti-inflammatory interventions might be the key to saving
              lives and ending the pandemic. From the study:<br>
              <br>
              The immune mechanism underlying diffuse alveolar and
              pulmonary interstitial inflammation in COVID-19 involves a
              MAS-like state that triggers extensive immunothrombosis…<br>
              <br>
              MAS stands for Macrophage Activation Syndrome, and it is
              an inflammatory response stemming from an over-reactive
              immune response, similar to the “cytokine storm” that’s
              being widely discussed (which vitamin C helps prevent,
              according to published research). As the study explains:<br>
              <br>
              The severity of systemic inflammation in response to human
              coronavirus family members has features reminiscent of a
              cytokine storm or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS),
              also known as secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis
              (sHLH).<br>
              <br>
              o simplify these findings, covid-19 is not acute viral
              pneumonia impacting the respiratory system but rather an
              inflammation-based immunological response that leads to
              thrombosis (clotting in the lungs) which kills the
              patient. The use of ventilators only makes the problem
              worse, which is why previous observational studies have
              found that 88% of patients put on ventilators end up
              dying. They are dying because the ventilator treatment is
              the wrong treatment.<br>
              <br>
              Chlorine dioxide is reportedly saving 100 percent of the
              patients studied so far because chlorine dioxide floods
              the blood with instantly usable oxygen while killing the
              pathogens responsible for clotting. There is also
              anecdotal evidence that some people are beating covid-19
              infections with high doses of aspirin, a blood thinner,
              although this information should not be taken as advice
              for treatment, and far more research is needed on blood
              thinners and anti-inflammatory interventions...<br>

              four and Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) victim from New York
              is breathing easy after her son, a medical student,
              successfully cured her of the virus with the “master”
              antioxidant glutathione....<br>
              <br>
              Remembering a remedy that worked for his 16-year-old
              sister, who was struck with a mystery ailment back in 2015
              that left her unable to walk and that later turned out to
              be Lyme disease, James decided to try it on his mom – and
              the results were astounding.<br>
              <br>
              It was actually Dr. Richard Horowitz, a Lyme disease
              specialist and ally of James who helped treat his sister
              Julia, who came up with the idea to give Josephine
              glutathione, which almost immediately gave her back the
              life she previously had.<br>
              <br>
              “When you get a viral infection with a huge amount of
              inflammation you don’t have enough glutathione to be able
              to protect your very sensitive lung tissue,” Horowitz
              stated, noting that glutathione works very well in Lyme
              patients to reduce inflammation.<br>
              <br>
              After giving Josephine her first 2,000-milligram dose of
              glutathione, Joseph observed that his mother became a
              whole new person.<br>
              <br>
              “Within an hour my breathing got better,” Josephine
              recalled. “It was amazing. I sat up, I got up. I went and
              I took a shower,” she added, noting that she was even able
              to make her own bed.<br>
              <br>
              After five days of taking glutathione, Josephine had no
              relapse back to the pain and suffering she endured while
              infected with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), which left
              her bound to a wheelchair.<br>

              </font></b><font color="#000000">The lung pathology seen
              in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shows
              marked microvascular thrombosis and haemorrhage linked to
              extensive alveolar and interstitial inflammation that
              shares features with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).
              We have termed the lung-restricted vascular
              immunopathology associated with COVID-19 as diffuse
              pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy, which in its early
              stages is distinct from disseminated intravascular
              coagulation. Increased circulating D-dimer concentrations
              (reflecting pulmonary vascular bed thrombosis with
              fibrinolysis) and elevated cardiac enzyme concentrations
              (reflecting emergent ventricular stress induced by
              pulmonary hypertension) in the face of normal fibrinogen
              and platelet levels are key early features of severe
              pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy related to COVID-19.
              Extensive immunothrombosis over a wide pulmonary vascular
              territory without confirmation of COVID-19 viraemia in
              early disease best explains the adverse impact of male
              sex, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes on the prognosis
              of patients with COVID-19. The immune mechanism underlying
              diffuse alveolar and pulmonary interstitial inflammation
              in COVID-19 involves a MAS-like state that triggers
              extensive immunothrombosis, which might unmask subclinical
              cardiovascular disease and is distinct from the MAS and
              disseminated intravascular coagulation that is more
              familiar to rheumatologists.<br>

              Nobel Prize winner for his 1983 discovery of the HIV
              virus) made the point that the specific occurrence of HIV
              RNA viral segments spliced surgically within the COVID-19
              genome could not have originated naturally and he
              described it in the following words:<br>
              <br>
              “We have carefully analyzed the description of the genome
              of this RNA virus. We weren’t the first, a group of Indian
              researchers tried to publish a study showing that the
              complete genome of this virus that has within the
              sequences of another virus: that of HIV.”...<br>

                Luc Montagnier’s Wave Therapy: Quackery or Brilliance?<br>
                <br>
              </font></b><font color="#000000">The most powerful aspect
              of Montagnier’s April 16th intervention into world
              politics in my view is not really found in his support for
              the laboratory-origins theory, but rather in the
              scientist’s often overlooked proposition for an
              international crash program in something called
              electromagnetic wave therapy. Rather than investing in
              vaccines, Montagnier has explained that it were much wiser
              for nations of the world to launch a crash project into a
              very different approach to viral treatments than is
              currently common in polite society saying:<br>
              <br>
              “I think we can make interference waves which are behind
              the RNA sequences that can eliminate those sequences with
              waves and consequently stop the pandemic”<br>
              <br>
              Before brushing this off as “quackery” as so many are wont
              to do, one should keep in mind that President Trump
              himself has indicated his interest in Montagnier’s
              approach in his April 23rd briefing telling reporters:<br>
              <br>
              “Supposing we hit the body with a tremendous … whether
              it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light. And I think
              you said that hasn’t been checked, but you are going to
              test it… And then I said supposing you brought the light
              inside the body, which you can do either through the skin
              or in some other way. And I think you said you are going
              to test it.”<br>
              <br>
              While Trump has been vilely attacked as “unscientific” for
              these utterances, it is only due to the vast ignorance of
              Montagnier’s incredible discoveries into the
              electromagnetic properties of life that such mockery can
              go unchallenged. Montagnier’s innovations into “bleaching
              therapy” which Trump referenced in the same speech are
              also much more complex than mainstream detractors assume
              and has nothing to do with simply “injecting”disinfectants
              into the blood stream. These therapies are highly
              interconnected with the electromagnetic waves emitted by
              certain types of bacteria which Montagnier has discovered
              to be the most likely driving mechanism to many of the
              diseases both chronic and acute plaguing humanity. More
              will be said on that below.<br>

                and What did Montagnier Discover?<br>
                <br>
              </font></b><font color="#000000">Optical biophysics is the
              study of the electromagnetic properties of the physics of
              life. This means paying attention to the light emissions
              and absorption frequencies from cells, DNA, and molecules
              of organic matter, how these interface with water (making
              up over 75% of a human body) and moderated by the nested
              array of magnetic fields located on the quantum level and
              stretching up to the galactic level.<br>
              <br>
              Not to discount the bio-chemical nature of life which is
              hegemonic in the health science realm, the optical
              biophysician asks: which of these is PRIMARY in growth,
              replication, and division of labor of individual cells or
              entire species of organisms? Is it the chemical attributes
              of living matter or the electromagnetic properties?<br>
            </font><b><font color="#000000"><br>
                Let me explain the paradox a bit more.<br>
                <br>
              </font></b><font color="#000000">There are approximately
              40 trillion highly differentiated cells in the average
              human body, each performing very specific functions and
              requiring an immense field of coherence and
              intercommunication. Every second approximately 10 million
              of those cells die, to be replaced by 10 million new cells
              being born. Many of those cells are made up of bacteria,
              and much of the DNA and RNA within those cells is made up
              of viruses (mostly dormant), but which can be
              activated/deactivated by a variety of methods both
              chemical and electromagnetic.<br>
              <br>
              Here’s the big question:<br>
              <br>
              HOW might this complex system be maintained by chemical
              processes alone- either over the course of a day, month or
              an entire lifetime?<br>
              <br>
              The simple physics of motion of enzymes which carry
              information in the body from one location to another
              simply doesn’t come close to accounting for the
              information coordination required among all parts. This is
              where Montagnier’s research comes in.<br>
              <br>
              After winning the 2008 Nobel Prize, Dr. Montagnier
              published a revolutionary yet heretical 2010 paper called
              “DNA Waves and Water” which took the medical community by
              storm. In this paper, Montagnier demonstrated how low
              frequency electromagnetic radiation within the radio wave
              part of the spectrum was emitted from bacterial and viral
              DNA and how said light was able to both organize water and
              transmit information! The results of his experiments were
              showcased wonderfully in this 8 min&nbsp; video:<br>

              </font></b><font color="#000000">Using a photo-amplifying
              device invented by Dr. Jacques Benveniste in the 1980s to
              capture the ultra low light emissions from cells,
              Montagnier filtered out all particles of bacterial DNA
              from a tube of water and discovered that the post-filtered
              solutions containing no material particles continued to
              emit ultra low frequency waves! This became more
              fascinating when Montagnier showed that under specific
              conditions of a 7 Hz background field (the same as the
              Schumann resonance which naturally occurs between the
              earth’s surface and the ionosphere), the non-emitting tube
              of water that had never received organic material could be
              induced to emit frequencies when placed in close proximity
              with the emitting tube! Even more interesting is that when
              base proteins, nucleotides and polymers (building blocks
              of DNA) were put into the pure water, near perfect clones
              of the original DNA were formed!<br>
              <br>
              Dr. Montagnier and his team hypothesized that the only way
              for this to happen was if the DNA’s blueprint was somehow
              imprinted into the very structure of water itself
              resulting in a form of “water memory” that had earlier
              been pioneered by Jacques Benveniste, the results of which
              are showcased in this incredible 2014 documentary “Water
              Memory”.<br>
              <br>
              Just as Benveniste suffered one of the most ugly witch
              hunts in modern times (led in large measure by Nature
              Magazine in 1988), Montagnier’s Nobel prize did not
              protect him from a similar fate as an international
              slander campaign has followed him over the past 10 years
              of his life. Nearly 40 Nobel prize winners have signed a
              petition denouncing Montagnier for his heresy and the
              great scientist was forced to even flee Europe to escape
              what he described as a culture of “intellectual terror”.
              In response to this slander, Montagnier stated to LaCroix
              magazine:&nbsp; “I’m used to attacks from these academics
              who are just retired bureaucrats, closed off from all
              innovation. I have the scientific proofs of what I say”.<br>
              <br>
              Describing the greatest challenges to advancing this
              research, Montagnier stated:<br>
              <br>
              “We have chosen to work with the private sector because no
              funds could come from public institutions. The Benveniste
              case has made it so that anyone who takes an interest in
              the memory of water is considered… I mean it smells of
              sulphur. It’s Hell.”<br>
            </font><b><font color="#000000"><br>
                Casting Montagnier’s Research in a New Light<br>
                <br>
              </font></b><font color="#000000">In a 2011 interview, Dr.
              Montagnier recapitulated the consequences of his
              discoveries:<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The existence of a harmonic signal
              emanating from DNA can help to resolve long-standing
              questions about cell development, for example how the
              embryo is able to make its manifold transformations, as if
              guided by an external field. If DNA can communicate its
              essential information to water by radio frequency, then
              non-material structures will exist within the watery
              environment of the living organism, some of them hiding
              disease signals and others involved in the healthy
              development of the organism.”<br>
              <br>
              With these insights in mind, Montagnier has discovered
              that many of the frequencies of EM emissions from a wide
              variety of microbial DNA is also found in the blood
              plasmas of patients suffering from influenza A, Hepatitis
              C, and even many neurological diseases not commonly
              thought of as bacteria-influenced such as Parkinsons,
              Multiple Sclerosis, Rheumathoid Arthritis and Alzheimers.
              In recent years, Montagnier’s teams even found certain
              signals in the blood plasmas of people with autism and
              several varieties of cancers!<br>
              <br>
              Over a dozen French doctors have taken Montagnier’s ideas
              seriously enough to prescribe antibiotics to treat autism
              over the course of six years and in opposition to
              conventional theories, have found that amidst 240 patients
              treated, 4 out of 5 saw their symptoms either dramatically
              regress or disappear completely!<br>
              <br>
              These results imply again that certain hard-to-detect
              species of light emitting microbes are closer to the cause
              of these ills than the modern pharmaceutical industry
              would like to admit.<br>

                A New Domain of Thinking: Why Big Pharma Should Be
                Afraid<br>
                <br>
              </font></b><font color="#000000">As the filmed 2014
              experiment demonstrated, Montagnier went even further to
              demonstrate that the frequencies of wave emissions within
              a filtrate located in a French laboratory can be recorded
              and emailed to another laboratory in Italy where that same
              harmonic recording was infused into tubes of non-emitting
              water causing the Italian tubes to slowly begin emitting
              signals! These DNA frequencies were then able to structure
              the Italian water tubes from the parent source a thousand
              miles away resulting in a 98% exact DNA replica!<br>
              <br>
              Standing as we are, on the cusp of so many exciting
              breakthroughs in medical science, we should ask: what
              could these results mean for the multi-billion dollar
              pharmaceutical industrial complex which relies on keeping
              the world locked into a practice of chemical drugs and
              vaccines?<br>
              <br>
              Speaking to this point, Montagnier stated:<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The day that we admit that signals can
              have tangible effects, we will use them. From that moment
              on we will be able to treat patients with waves. Therefore
              it’s a new domain of medicine that people fear of course.
              Especially the pharmaceutical industry… one day we will be
              able to treat cancers using frequency waves.”<br>
              <br>
              Montagnier’s friend and collaborator Marc Henry a
              professor of Chemistry and Quantum Mechanics at the
              University of Strasbourg stated:<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “If we treat with frequencies and not
              with medicines it becomes extremely cost effective
              regarding the amount of money spent. We spend a lot of
              money to find the frequencies, but once they have been
              found, it costs nothing to treat.”<br>
              <br>
              Whether produced in a lab as Montagnier asserts or having
              appeared naturally as Nature Magazine asserts, the fact
              remains that the current coronavirus pandemic has
              accelerated a collapse of the world financial system and
              forced the leaders of the world to discuss the reality of
              a needed new paradigm and new world economic order.
              Whether that new system will be driven by Pharmaceutical
              cartels, and sociopathic bankers running global health
              policy for a technocratic elite of social engineers or
              whether it will be driven by nation states shaping the
              terms of that new system around human needs, remains to be
              seen.<br>
              <br>
              If nation states manage to stay in the driver’s seat of
              this new system, then it will have to be driven by certain
              fundamental principles of healthcare for all, science
              practice reform and broader political/economic reform
              whereby the sacredness of human life is placed above all
              considerations of monetary profit. In this light, such
              crash programs into long term projects in space science,
              asteroid defense, and Lunar/Mars development will be as
              necessary in the astrophysical domain as crash programs in
              fusion energy will be in the atomic domain. Uniting both
              worlds, is the domain of life sciences that intersects the
              electromagnetic properties of atoms, cells and DNA with
              the large scale electromagnetic properties of the Earth,
              Sun and galaxy as a whole.<br>

              Donald Trump and white Americans.&nbsp; Dr. Baker told the
              gathered audience,<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Carol Baker: “So I have the

              when you look at vaccine refusers. I’m not talking about…
              hesitance, most of them we can talk into coming to terms.

              confusion where so many possible scenarios of what we are
              seeing take place regarding the coronavirus outbreak, the
              origins of the virus and the severity of the pandemic, one
              is reminded of the quote from former CIA Director William
              Casey…<br>
              <br>
              “We’ll know our disinformation program is complete when
              everything the American public believes is false.” <br>
              <br>
              While at this point we certainly do not claim to have all
              of the answers, we are working hard to provide alternative
              perspectives from top qualified experts and encourage the
              viewer to consider more than one possibility while having
              an open mind and draw your own conclusions. <br>
              <br>
              In this interview Spiro is joined by the author of the US
              Biowarfare Act Professor Francis Boyle to discuss the
              latest developments regarding the Coronavirus outbreak,
              the source of the virus and the corrupt interests
              involved.<br>
              <br>
              Professor Boyle also outlines two reports which he claims
              confirm his position on the origins of the virus. One,
              from a Nobel Peace Prize winning scientist in France. The
              second, a leaked memo from the 5 Eyes intelligence
              alliance.&nbsp; <br>

              a vision in your church and it wasn’t what I expected to
              see. I saw bread lines, soup kitchens, and I saw people
              wearing beautiful clothing. Their clothing was not worn
              out. Now in my nation when people are hungry you can tell.
              I mean they are in shredded rags. They don’t have shoes or
              they have flip flops. Most of them have no shoes. They are
              hungry and they know they are hungry. They come for food,
              not because they are beggars, but because they are hungry.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have held starving children in my
              arms. I know what starvation is. I know what pain is. I
              know what suffering is. But in this vision that I had that
              was in your nation, which the Lord is helping me to say, I
              will identify with America as well as Mozambique.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw this bread line, long bread
              lines, and I said, “Lord, I don’t think that is popular to
              say in a church, especially one that is all about revival
              and victory and power.”<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn’t want to see what I saw, but I
              saw what I saw so, I was so undone that I just said what I
              saw. And I saw all these people and they had beautiful
              cars, 4 by 4’s and Lexus, Mercedez, BMW’s, Toyotas. There
              they were with fancy shiny cars, but they were standing in
              line.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I said about worrying, the
              worriers turned into worshipping warriors.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked, “Why are they so well dressed
              and standing in this line?”<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said, “Because it is a suddenly.
              They are suddenly in need of food.”<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked, “What are we to do?”<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said, “Tell them that what you see
              in Mozambique they will see in America with the signs and
              wonders and miracles. They will see it on their soil. They
              will see what I do.”<br>
              <br>

              He puts peace on you in the midst of the storm.”<br>

          <b>Summary</b><br>
          Microplastics (MPs) pollution in household wastewater and
          global aquatic systems has become an emerging issue and
          potential threat to marine life and human health. However,
          advanced technologies for efficient MPs control and
          purification remain largely underdeveloped. Herein, we present
          integrated carbocatalytic oxidation and hydrothermal (HT)
          hydrolysis of microplastics over magnetic spring-like carbon
          nanotubes. The robust carbon hybrids exhibited an outstanding
          MPs degradation performance by catalytic activation of
          peroxymonosulfate to generate reactive radicals. The spiral
          architecture and highly graphitic degree guaranteed the superb
          stability of the carbocatalysts in HT environment. The
          toxicity tests indicated that the organic intermediates from
          MPs degradation were environmentally benign to the aquatic
          microorganisms and can serve as a carbon source for algae
          cultivation. The outcomes of this study are dedicated to
          providing a green strategy by integrating state-of-the-art
          carbocatalysis and nanotechnology for remediation of MPs
          contamination in water.<br>

              reduces S. aureus infection and regenerates critical-sized

            <b>Christopher T. Johnson, et al.</b><br>

          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen associated
          with bacterial infections in orthopedic procedures. Infections
          often lead to implant failure and subsequent removal,
          motivating the development of bifunctional materials that both
          promote repair and prevent failure due to infection.
          Lysostaphin is an anti-staphylococcal enzyme resulting in
          bacterial lysis and biofilm reduction. Lysostaphin use is
          limited by the lack of effective delivery methods to provide
          sustained, high doses of enzyme to infection sites. We
          engineered a BMP-2–loaded lysostaphin-delivering hydrogel that
          simultaneously prevents S. aureus infection and repairs
          nonhealing segmental bone defects in the murine radius.
          Lysostaphin-delivering hydrogels eradicated S. aureus
          infection and resulted in mechanically competent bone.
          Cytokine and immune cell profiling demonstrated that
          lysostaphin-delivering hydrogels restored the local
          inflammatory environment to that of a sterile injury. These
          results show that BMP-2–loaded lysostaphin-delivering hydrogel
          therapy effectively eliminates S. aureus infection while
          simultaneously regenerating functional bone resulting in
          defect healing.<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          Metal ion separations are critical to numerous fields,
          including nuclear medicine, waste recycling, space
          exploration, and fundamental research. Nonetheless,
          operational conditions and performance are limited, imposing
          compromises between recovery, purity, and cost.
          Siderophore-inspired ligands show unprecedented charge-based
          selectivity and compatibility with harsh industry conditions,
          affording excellent separation efficiency, robustness and
          process control. Here, we successfully demonstrate a general
          separation strategy on three distinct systems, for Ac, Pu, and
          Bk purification. Separation factors (SF) obtained with model
          compound 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) are orders of magnitude higher
          than with any other ligand currently employed: 106 between Ac
          and relevant metal impurities, and over 108 for redox-free Pu
          purification against uranyl ions and trivalent actinides or
          fission products. Finally, a one-step separation method
          (SF&#8201;&gt;&#8201;3&#8201;×&#8201;106 and radiopurity&#8201;&gt;&#8201;99.999%) enables the
          isolation of Bk from adjacent actinides and fission products.
          The proposed approach offers a paradigm change for the
          production of strategic elements.<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          Exposure to inorganic arsenic in the general population occurs
          mainly from drinking water and food sources. This study
          examined the association between rice consumption and urinary
          concentrations of arsenic in US adults, aged 20-85 years, in
          the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination
          Survey. Significantly higher geometric means of
          creatinine-corrected urinary concentrations of total arsenic
          (TAs) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) were found in
          participants who consumed rice more than twice per week,
          compared to the reference group. Multivariate logistic
          regression analysis revealed a statistically significant
          association between rice consumption and urinary
          concentrations of TAs [odds ratio (OR) = 1.51 (1.08, 2.09)]
          and DMA [OR = 2.24 (1.57, 3.21)] after adjustment for
          demographic variables, seafood intake (the main source of
          organic arsenic), and source of drinking water. Furthermore,
          significant variations in rice consumption and urinary
          concentrations of arsenic were observed in different racial
          groups. This study demonstrated that rice consumption
          contributed to inorganic arsenic exposure in US adults.<br>

          </b>Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome
          coronavirus (SARS&#8208;CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome
          coronavirus (MERS&#8208;CoV), another highly pathogenic coronavirus
          named SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (previously known as 2019&#8208;nCoV) emerged in
          December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spreads around the
          world. This virus shares highly homological sequence with
          SARS&#8208;CoV, and causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia
          coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) with clinical symptoms
          similar to those reported for SARS&#8208;CoV and MERS&#8208;CoV. The most
          characteristic symptom of patients with COVID&#8208;19 is
          respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the
          intensive care could not breathe spontaneously. Additionally,
          some patients with COVID&#8208;19 also showed neurologic signs, such
          as headache, nausea, and vomiting. Increasing evidence shows
          that coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory
          tract and that they may also invade the central nervous system
          inducing neurological diseases. The infection of SARS&#8208;CoV has
          been reported in the brains from both patients and
          experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily
          infected. Furthermore, some coronaviruses have been
          demonstrated able to spread via a synapse&#8208;connected route to
          the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the
          mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower
          respiratory airways. Considering the high similarity between
          SARS&#8208;CoV and SARS&#8208;CoV2, it remains to make clear whether the
          potential invasion of SARS&#8208;CoV2 is partially responsible for
          the acute respiratory failure of patients with COVID&#8208;19.
          Awareness of this may have a guiding significance for the
          prevention and treatment of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;induced respiratory
          failure.<br>

              residual popular trust in the system. As assets devalue,
              trust will further disintegrate, which will cause assets
              to devalue further, and so on. Every slide in asset
              prices, employment, and production will give every
              generation cause to grow more alarmed...<br>

              “In retrospect, the spark might seem as ominous as a
              financial crash, as ordinary as a national election, or as
              trivial as a Tea Party. The catalyst will unfold according
              to a basic Crisis dynamic that underlies all of these
              scenarios: An initial spark will trigger a chain reaction
              of unyielding responses and further emergencies. The core
              elements of these scenarios (debt, civic decay, global
              disorder) will matter more than the details, which the
              catalyst will juxtapose and connect in some unknowable
              way. If foreign societies are also entering a Fourth
              Turning, this could accelerate the chain reaction. At home
              and abroad, these events will reflect the tearing of the
              civic fabric at points of extreme vulnerability – problem
              areas where America will have neglected, denied, or
              delayed needed action.”-– The Fourth Turning – Strauss

            </b></a><b>By Jeremy Samuel Faust | April 28, 2020</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [...] When reports about the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2
          began circulating earlier this year and questions were being
          raised about how the illness it causes, COVID-19, compared to
          the flu, it occurred to me that, in four years of emergency
          medicine residency and over three and a half years as an
          attending physician, I had almost never seen anyone die of the
          flu. I could only remember one tragic pediatric case.<br>
          <br>
          Based on the CDC numbers though, I should have seen many, many
          more. In 2018, over 46,000 Americans died from opioid
          overdoses. Over 36,500 died in traffic accidents. Nearly
          40,000 died from gun violence. I see those deaths all the
          time. Was I alone in noticing this discrepancy?<br>
          <br>
          I decided to call colleagues around the country who work in
          other emergency departments and in intensive care units to ask
          a simple question: how many patients could they remember dying
          from the flu? Most of the physicians I surveyed couldn’t
          remember a single one over their careers. Some said they
          recalled a few. All of them seemed to be having the same light
          bulb moment I had already experienced: For too long, we have
          blindly accepted a statistic that does not match our clinical
          experience.<br>
          <br>
          The 25,000 to 69,000 numbers that Trump cited do not represent
          counted flu deaths per year; they are estimates that the CDC
          produces by multiplying the number of flu death counts
          reported by various coefficients produced through complicated
          algorithms. These coefficients are based on assumptions of how
          many cases, hospitalizations, and deaths they believe went
          unreported. In the last six flu seasons, the CDC’s reported
          number of actual confirmed flu deaths—that is, counting flu
          deaths the way we are currently counting deaths from the
          coronavirus—has ranged from 3,448 to 15,620, which far lower
          than the numbers commonly repeated by public officials and
          even public health experts.<br>
          <br>
          There is some logic behind the CDC’s methods. There are, of
          course, some flu deaths that are missed, because not everyone
          who contracts the flu gets a flu test. But there are little
          data to support the CDC’s assumption that the number of people
          who die of flu each year is on average six times greater than
          the number of flu deaths that are actually confirmed. In fact,
          in the fine print, the CDC’s flu numbers also include
          pneumonia deaths.<br>
          <br>
          The CDC should immediately change how it reports flu deaths.
          While in the past it was justifiable to err on the side of
          substantially overestimating flu deaths, in order to encourage
          vaccination and good hygiene, at this point the CDC’s
          reporting about flu deaths is dangerously misleading the
          public and even public officials about the comparison between
          these two viruses. If we incorrectly conclude that COVID-19 is
          “just another flu,” we may retreat from strategies that appear
          to be working in minimizing the speed of spread of the virus.<br>
          <br>
          The question remains. Can we accurately compare the toll of
          the flu to the toll of the coronavirus pandemic?<br>
          <br>
          To do this, we have to compare counted deaths to counted
          deaths, not counted deaths to wildly inflated statistical
          estimates. If we compare, for instance, the number of people
          who died in the United States from COVID-19 in the second full
          week of April to the number of people who died from influenza
          during the worst week of the past seven flu seasons (as
          reported to the CDC), we find that the novel coronavirus
          killed between 9.5 and 44 times more people than seasonal flu.
          In other words, the coronavirus is not anything like the flu:
          It is much, much worse...<br>

          claiming the CDC's yearly reported flu deaths are
          "substantially" overestimated "in order to encourage
          vaccination."... <br>
          Most of the deaths are concentrated in states where Democratic
          governors ordered nursing homes to take in coronavirus
          patients, which is undoubtedly the biggest scandal of this
          entire crisis and probably criminally negligent...<br>

              toppling a govt’: Venezuelan VP decries Guaido’s hiring of
              US mercenaries to Rafael Correa</b><br>
            <b>by Avatar Greg </b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          A leaked multimillion-dollar deal between an opposition
          figurehead and a US mercenary firm to oust a leader is quite a
          piece of work, as it’s odd to see a contract for a coup,
          Venezuela’s VP told Rafael Correa on RT.<br>
          <br>
          “This invasion contract, signed by Jordan Goudreau, the head
          of a US private military company and Juan Guaido, is just a
          disgrace,” Delcy Rodriguez, the vice president of Venezuela,
          said while talking to Ecuador’s former president, Rafael
          Correa, on his show ‘Conversation with Correa’ on RT Spanish.<br>
          <br>
          Rodriguez was referring to an agreement to “capture, detain or
          remove” the current president, Nicolas Maduro, in exchange for
          a $212.9-million reward. Leaked by the Washington Post, the
          contract carefully discusses tactical details, including which
          gear to use and who to treat as legitimate targets.<br>
          <br>
          It bears what appear to be signatures of Guaido’s
          functionaries and Goudreau, the head of the Florida-based
          Silvercorp private military company and retired Green Beret.
          This is what makes the document so bizarre, Rodriguez told
          Correa.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have never seen anyone trying to
          overthrow the constitutional government through a contract.<br>
          <br>
          Guaido himself has denied any involvement in the failed
          attempt to overthrow Maduro, and called the leak “fake.” But
          as one of the plotters told Venezuelan security services
          during interrogation, the US-backed opposition leader had a
          meeting with Goudreau at the White House earlier in March. The
          conversation, the detainee revealed, included plans to oust
          Maduro.<br>
          <br>
          The contract also allowed anyone deemed to be “armed and
          violent colectivos” – a derogatory term used for working-class
          people, including trade unionists and pro-government
          protesters – to be targeted. So, the deal allowed “carnage
          against Venezuelan people” and gave the green light to “crimes
          against humanity,” according to Rodriguez.<br>
          <br>
          “When you read this… I’m a lawyer, and when I read this
          contract, I could never have imagined that such an unlawful
          [agreement] that so blatantly violates human rights could be
          given legal force,” she said.<br>
          <br>
          Silvercorp and its involvement in the coup came to light
          earlier this month when a group of commandos – among them two
          US mercenaries – landed on a resort coast in Venezuela. They
          were met by local security forces, who killed eight of them.<br>
          <br>
          The survivors of the failed raid were arrested and appeared on
          local television, with one confessing in an interrogation tape
          to plotting to overthrow Maduro and bring him to the US.<br>

          &nbsp;As US President Donald Trump was extolling the promise
          of a malaria drug in the desperate hunt for coronavirus
          treatments, one of his top global allies was selling the world
          on his own "trump card", a pale yellow pill that he said could
          be crucial to fighting the pandemic.<br>
          <br>
          This supposed beacon of hope is an antiviral medicine known as
          Avigan, and its most vocal proponent is Japan's prime
          minister, Shinzo Abe.<br>
          <br>
          Mr Abe has pushed the homegrown drug in news conferences and
          in meetings with world leaders, including a call with Trump
          and the other heads of the Group of 7. He has allocated nearly
          US$130 million to triple an existing stockpile of the
          medication. And he has offered to provide it free to dozens of
          other countries.<br>
          <br>
          The prime minister, however, has glossed over one crucial
          fact: There is no solid evidence that Avigan is actually
          effective against Covid-19. While the drug has shown potential
          for treating some deadly diseases like Ebola in animal
          studies, there are limited findings that it works for any
          illness in humans.<br>
          <br>
          What Avigan, whose generic name is favipiravir, does have is a
          peculiar regulatory history and one dangerous potential side
          effect - birth defects. Mr Abe himself noted in a news
          conference Monday that the side effect was "the same as
          thalidomide", which caused deformities in thousands of babies
          in the 1950s and '60s...<br>

          Come again? In light of the recent story broken that
          potentially links Dr Anthony Fauci to the project that
          initially came into existence in the United States and was
          eventually ported to China, we may be getting back to an old

              Pandemic, With Globalists As Saviours</b><br>
            <b>Eerie 2012 document painted eurocrats as saving the
              planet from a killer virus and draconian lockdowns</b><br>
            <i>Bizarre EU Funded Comic Book Predicted Pandemic, With
              Globalists As Saviours </i><br>
            <i><b>Steve Watson </b></i></div>
          <br>
          A strange comic book that was commissioned for publication by
          the European Union in 2012 eerily predicted almost exactly
          what has unfolded with the Covid-19 global pandemic. However,
          in this propaganda laced presentation of the outbreak,
          unelected globalist bureaucrats save the planet.<br>
          <br>
          The comic book, titled ‘Infected’, was a production of the
          European Commission’s international cooperation and
          development arm. It was not intended for widespread public
          consumption, but instead to be distributed inside EU
          institutions. Only a few hundred of the comic books were made.<br>
          <br>
          The EU’s description of the strange publication states that
          “While the story may be fictional, it is nevertheless
          intertwined with some factual information.”<br>
          <br>
          The graphic novel depicts scientists inside a lab in China
          experimenting with deadly pathogens:<br>
          <br>
          A wannabe hero time travels from the future, alerting
          authorities to the coming pandemic, and presents an antidote,
          before quickly becoming the target of opportunists who want to
          steal the cure and sell it to drug companies:<br>
          <br>
          The story features the transmission of a novel virus from
          animals to humans in a crowded wet market:<br>
          <br>
          “Indeed, imagine if you were infected in this market by a new
          contagious agent.” says the UN’s chief advisor on contagious
          diseases, adding “You probably wouldn’t even realise it until
          the end of the incubation period.”<br>
          <br>
          The publication suggests that air travel would exacerbate the
          spread of the disease, with the character adding that “You’d
          have headed back to Europe, the US, Latin America, or
          Australia as planned via an international airport.”<br>
          <br>
          The cartoon depicts the failure of a global health
          organisation to act quickly enough to stop a pandemic:<br>
          <br>
          It also predicts draconian safety measures, including social
          distancing, which make everyday life “totally unbearable”:<br>
          <br>
          The piece concludes with an EU Parliament hearing, in which
          Brussels pushes for more integrated European cooperation on
          global health matters, mirroring a real life initiative known
          as ‘One health’.<br>
          <br>
          The globalists are lauded for helping develop and distribute a
          vaccine to the world:<br>
          <br>
          Was this predictive programming or just a bizarre coincidence?<br>
          <br>
          In 2020, in reality, the EU has pandered to China, and bowed
          to censorship regarding the virus outbreak.<br>
          <br>
          The EU has also been heavily criticised by member states and
          insiders for monumental failings owing to internal
          bureaucracy. The EU’s science chief even resigned due to the
          inept coronavirus response from the institution.<br>
          <br>
          In the Eurocrats’ own fiction, globalism saves the planet. In
          reality, it ends in mass death and global tyranny.<br>

          <div align="left">PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To change physical
            properties of water by effectively activating water so as to
            use the same in an industrial product or medical treatment
            to promote one's health by allowing liquids to be treated to
            collide with each other at a high speed while revolving them
            to divide both liquids into fine particles and passing the
            liquids to be treated through a magnetic field of a fractal
            coil. <br>
          </div>
          <div align="left">SOLUTION: Water sent from a pump or a tank
            under pressure is allowed to flow in from an inflow port 1
            to be charged into a first storage chamber 3 and introduced
            into the straight pipe 5 and spiral pipe 7 extending along
            the center of the storage chamber 3. At this time, the flow
            rates of water flowing through the straight pipe 5 and the
            spiral pipe 7 are adjusted so as to become almost same. By
            allowing the water passed through the straight pipe 5 and
            the water passed through the spiral pipe 7 to join with each
            other in a second storage chamber 3, both waters are
            mutually resonated by respective water molecules to generate
            predetermined vibration and passed through a magnetic field
            of a fractal coil. By repeating this treatment a plurality
            of times, a special magnetic field is generated by revolving
            streams or vortex streams generated by the spiral number of
            times to obtain activated water high in vibration energy.<br>

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>A method for extracting electrical energy through the
          transformation of electromagnetic fields is described. The
          method comprises the steps of providing at least one
          electromagnetic coil and flowing water in the proximity of
          said coil, and generating a quantum field in the form of a
          three-dimensional Mandelbrot fractal, at a given frequency,
          between the electromagnetic coil and the flowing water.
          Furthermore, radiating quantum energy is generated at the
          tapered tip of said fractal. The quantum energy is transported
          via an electrode arranged in said flowing water to an
          electrically conductive vacuum chamber and converted into
          electrical energy in the vacuum chamber. A corresponding
          apparatus is also described.<b><br>

          <br>
          In this powerful interview Spiro is joined with Doctor Andrew
          Kaufman. Spiro and Dr. Kaufman discuss the expanding
          curtailment of basic civil liberties being normalized under
          the false pretext of a global health emergency.<br>
          <br>
          Doctor Kaufman lays his reputation and his career on the line
          as he blows the whistle, on what he describes as a
          manufactured crisis to carry out a preplanned agenda to
          facilitate global governance and population control.<br>
          <br>
          Doctor Kaufman is a well educated medical professional who
          convincingly illustrates, using the CDC's own technical data,
          how the public has been manipulated on the grandest scale.<br>

          from Comments: farmboy 002 -- My wife works for a Tyson pork
          plant. And they are only running 5to6 hrs because the cut
          floor can't keep up because no one is showing up for work.
          They have hogs that need cut up that are five to six days old
          normally hogs are cut up the very next day. The plant were my
          wife works had a points system and if you called in to much
          you would get points against you and to many points would get
          you fired. They got rid of the points system when this covid
          shit started. Now most all of them are calling in or just not
          showing up for work... <br>

          “At some point, America’s short-term Crisis psychology will
          catch up to the long-term post-Unraveling fundamentals. This
          might result in a Great Devaluation, a severe drop in the
          market price of most financial and real assets. This
          devaluation could be a short but horrific panic, a
          free-falling price in a market with no buyers. Or it could be
          a series of downward ratchets linked to political events that
          sequentially knock the supports out from under the residual
          popular trust in the system. As assets devalue, trust will
          further disintegrate, which will cause assets to devalue
          further, and so on. Every slide in asset prices, employment,
          and production will give every generation cause to grow more
          alarmed.” – Strauss &amp; Howe – The Fourth Turning<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          In this study, 221 phytocompounds were evaluated for activity
          against anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome associated
          coronavirus (SARS-CoV) activities using a cell-based assay
          measuring SARS-CoV-induced cytopathogenic effect on Vero E6
          cells. Ten diterpenoids (1&#8722;10), two sesquiterpenoids (11 and
          12), two triterpenoids (13 and 14), five lignoids (15&#8722;19),
          curcumin (20), and reference controls niclosamide (21) and
          valinomycin (22) were potent inhibitors at concentrations
          between 3.3 and 10 &#956;M. The concentrations of the 22 compounds
          to inhibit 50% of Vero E6 cell proliferation (CC50) and viral
          replication (EC50) were measured. The selective index values
          (SI = CC50/EC50) of the most potent compounds 1, 5, 6, 8, 14,
          and 16 were 58, &gt;510, 111, 193, 180, and &gt;667,
          respectively. Betulinic acid (13) and savinin (16) were
          competitive inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CL protease with Ki values
          = 8.2 ± 0.7 and 9.1 ± 2.4 &#956;M, respectively. Our findings
          suggest that specific abietane-type diterpenoids and lignoids
          exhibit strong anti-SARS-CoV effects. <br>

              <b><br>
              </b>Dr. Judy Mikovits is a modern-day Rosalind Franklin, a
              brilliant researcher shaking up the old boys’ club of
              science with her groundbreaking discoveries. And like many
              women who have trespassed into the world of men, she
              uncovered decades-old secrets that many would prefer to
              stay buried.<br>
              <br>
              From her doctoral thesis, which changed the treatment of
              HIV-AIDS, saving the lives of millions, including
              basketball great Magic Johnson, to her spectacular
              discovery of a new family of human retroviruses, and her
              latest research which points to a new golden age of
              health, Dr. Mikovits has always been on the leading edge
              of science.<br>
              <br>
              With the brilliant wit one might expect if Erin Brockovich
              had a doctorate in molecular biology, Dr. Mikovits has
              seen the best and worst of science. When she was part of
              the research community that turned HIV-AIDS from a fatal
              disease into a manageable one, she saw science at its
              best. But when her investigations questioned whether the
              use of animal tissue in medical research were unleashing
              devastating plagues of chronic diseases, such as autism
              and chronic fatigue syndrome, she saw science at its
              worst. If her suspicions are correct, we are looking at a
              complete realignment of scientific practices, including
              how we study and treat human disease.<br>
              <br>
              Recounting her nearly four decades in science, including
              her collaboration of more than thirty-five years with Dr.
              Frank Ruscetti, one of the founders of the field of human
              retrovirology, this is a behind the scenes look at the
              issues and egos which will determine the future health of
              humanity. <b><br>

              </b>On July 22, 2009, a special meeting was held with
              twenty-four leading scientists at the National Institutes
              of Health to discuss early findings that a newly
              discovered retrovirus was linked to chronic fatigue
              syndrome (CFS), prostate cancer, lymphoma, and eventually
              neurodevelopmental disorders in children. When Dr. Judy
              Mikovits finished her presentation the room was silent for
              a moment, then one of the scientists said, “Oh my God!”
              The resulting investigation would be like no other in
              science.<br>
              <br>
              For Dr. Mikovits, a twenty-year veteran of the National
              Cancer Institute, this was the midpoint of a five-year
              journey that would start with the founding of the
              Whittemore-Peterson Institute for Neuro-Immune Disease at
              the University of Nevada, Reno, and end with her as a
              witness for the federal government against her former
              employer, Harvey Whittemore, for illegal campaign
              contributions to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.<br>
              <br>
              On this journey Dr. Mikovits would face the scientific
              prejudices against CFS, wander into the minefield that is
              autism, and through it all struggle to maintain her faith
              in God and the profession to which she had dedicated her
              life. This is a story for anybody interested in the peril
              and promise of science at the very highest levels in our
              country.<b><br>

                  coating can protect surfaces for 90 days</b><br>
              </div>
              <br>
              Researchers at a Hong Kong university say they have
              developed an antiviral coating which could provide 90 days
              of “significant” protection against bacteria and viruses
              such as the one causing COVID-19.<br>
              <br>
              The coating, called MAP-1, took 10 years to develop and
              can be sprayed on surfaces that are frequently used by the
              public, such as elevator buttons and handrails,
              researchers at the Hong Kong University of Science and
              Technology (HKUST) say.<br>
              <br>
              “These places are frequently touched, and, at the same
              time, serve as a very effective medium for transmission of
              diseases,” said HKUST Adjunct Professor Joseph Kwan, one
              of the chief researchers in the team that developed the
              product. <br>
              <br>
              The coating that forms after spraying has millions of
              nano-capsules containing disinfectants, which Kwan says
              remain effective in killing bacteria, viruses and spores
              even after the coating has dried...

                Our Answer superbugs, deadly pathogens is BASE
                Sterilizer’s Dial-1 “Cold Steam.” Sterilizes a variation
                of deadly pathogens and micro-organism, and now possibly
                COVID-19 when our lab reports return. We are for sure it
                can but the data is very much required. BASE Sterilizer
                was architecturally invented in Brantford, Ontario: It’s
                a Cold Steam technology which is a surface germ
                sterilization, eradication, decontamination and
                extraction technology. The current 4 or 6 chamber models
                are being modified into a super 6 chamber technology
                whereby they are set at 1,200 Degrees F as opposed to
                500 degrees F. Although with the dial set at 1 for cold
                steam it's ambient to the touch or cold. Capable of
                lifting, killing and extracting deadly pathogens and
                superbugs and more. This 1,200 degree F. Models could
                easily kill anything in 30-20 seconds, the silver Bullet
                effect for surface and food packaging sterilization. The
                current 500 Degrees F. 6 Chamber 2nd model was lab
                tested at a major University for 13 months in Canada,
                proving its effectiveness, paid for by the NSERC. One of
                its advantages is that it uses just plain purified
                distilled water (no chemicals). Cold steam has no threat
                to humans or sensitive electronics even if ingested.
                Hence it's ideal for indoor surface sterilization even
                during the day-time with everyone in place and computers
                operating. It has a blue stream at the nozzle because of
                super flash evaporation and the reason why why it’s
                called "Cold Steam.“ A new more advanced entrant of
                steam technology coined B.A.S.E.S. which is an acronym
                for "BICCSAN Air Surface Extraction Sterilizer." Any
                other Antimicrobial cleansing technology must meet this
                same technology standard to be competitive with the BASE
                Sterilizer’s Cold Steam dial. Able to sterilize any
                facility even while using a personal sterilization
                accessory or a walkthrough similar to a car wash effect.
                Ideal for residential, commercial aircraft &amp; water
                vessels to name a few wherever people gather. Including
                Mining facilities, food packaging plants and secondary
                containment systems, industrial treatment plants as well
                as optimization for industrial processes, and more. The
                6 chambers 500 Degree F. Model requires about 10 kW of
                energy. Whereas the (1,200 Degree F.) model about 14 kW.
                I spent another 8 years in developing their own
                off-the-grid power supply, completed as an option. Able
                to also power homes and other facilities off the grid
                especially for Hospitals in isolated areas such as
                powerless islands, Sincerely, Gerald B/P.<br>

              <b><font color="#000000"><br>
                </font></b><font color="#000000">&nbsp;Scientists in
                Wuhan, China claim to have created a carbon-neutral
                prototype jet engine which could one day allow for a new
                era in fossil-fuel free manned flight.<br>
                <br>
                Their prototype engine compresses air and ionizes it
                with microwaves thus generating plasma which it expels
                out the back of the engine to generate thrust. Plasma is
                the fourth state of matter which usually only exists in
                the laboratory, the surface of the Sun or for brief
                instances during lightning strikes. <br>
                <br>
                The proposed system differs from previous attempts at
                creating plasma jet thrusters as they relied on xenon
                plasma which cannot withstand the friction inherent in
                the Earth’s atmosphere. Simply put, they were not
                powerful enough. <br>
                <br>
                Their proof-of-concept prototype launched a one-kilogram
                (2.2lb) steel ball 24mm (almost an inch) into the air.
                While not particularly impressive on face value, when
                scaled up, this would equal the same amount of thrust
                produced by a conventional, commercial jet engine. <br>
                <br>
                “Our results demonstrated that such a jet engine based
                on microwave air plasma can be a potentially viable
                alternative to the conventional fossil fuel jet engine,”
                lead researcher and Wuhan University engineer Jau Tang
                said in a press release.<br>
                <br>
                While there is still a long way to go from
                proof-of-concept to commercial deployment, the incentive
                for fossil fuel-free air travel is certainly there given
                that current commercial flight is responsible for 2.5
                percent of all greenhouse gas emissions (excluding
                global military aviation).<br>
                <br>
                “There is no need for fossil fuel with our design, and
                therefore, there is no carbon emission to cause
                greenhouse effects and global warming,” Tang added. <br>
                <br>
                The researchers at the Institute of Technological
                Sciences at Wuhan University published their findings
                Tuesday in the journal AIP Advances. They successfully
                released the ground-breaking study despite enduring
                months of lockdown after the coronavirus emerged in
                Wuhan late last year.<br>

                </font></b><font color="#000000">We propose a prototype
                design of a propulsion thruster that utilizes air plasma
                induced by microwave ionization. Such a jet engine
                simply uses only air and electricity to produce high
                temperature and pressurized plasma for jet propulsion.
                We used a home-made device to measure the lifting force
                and jet pressure at various settings of microwave power
                and the air flow rate. We demonstrated that, given the
                same power consumption, its propulsion pressure is
                comparable to that of conventional airplane jet engines
                using fossil fuels. Therefore, such a carbon-emission
                free thruster could potentially be used as a jet
                thruster in the atmosphere.<br>
                Similar to solids, liquids, and gases, plasma is a
                normal state of matter. Plasma naturally arises due to
                the ionization of molecules at high temperatures (such
                as in the sun) or in high electric fields (such as in
                lightning). In the laboratory, plasma can be generated
                using an electric arc, microwave cavity, laser, fire
                flame, or discharging high-voltage needle. Plasma has
                wide applications in many areas, including metal
                processing,1,2 crystal growth,3,4 medical treatment,5–7
                food processing,8,9 energy,10,11 and environmental

                jet thruster using xenon plasma in a spacecraft exerts
                only a tiny propulsion force and can only be used in
                outer space in the absence of air friction. Even though
                such a plasma engine has a very small propulsion force,
                after months and years of constant acceleration, the
                spacecraft can ultimately reach a high speed. However,
                this type of an engine, like that of the NASA Dawn space
                probe,16 is not useful in the atmosphere
                environment.17,18 Recently, a research team from MIT
                demonstrated a plasma-powered glider that can operate in
                air by using a needle-discharge array to generate air
                plasma to power the flight. This team demonstrated a
                continuous flight time of 12 s and a flight distance of
                55 m. However, this Tesla type of plasma thruster has a
                lifting force and jet pressure of only 6 N/kW and 3
                N/m2, respectively.19 It is very challenging for this
                approach to become feasible for use as a powerful engine
                for actual air transportation. In this report, we
                consider a microwave air plasma jet thruster using
                high-temperature and high-pressure plasma generated by a
                2.45 GHz microwave ionization chamber for injected
                pressurized air. We propose a simple prototype plasma
                jet thruster that can generate approximately 10 N of
                thrust at 400 W using 0.5 l/s for the airflow,
                corresponding to the lifting force of 28 N/kW and a jet
                pressure of 2.4 × 104 N/m2. At a higher microwave power
                or greater airflow, propulsion forces and jet pressures
                comparable to those of commercial airplane jet engines
                can be achieved.<br>
                Our experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1 and includes a
                magnetron with the power of 1 kW at 2.45 GHz, a
                circulator, a flattened waveguide, an igniter, and a
                quartz tube. The magnetron is the microwave source, the
                circulator is used to absorb reflected microwaves, and a
                three-stub tuner is used to optimize the power inside
                the air ionization chamber. The length, width, and
                height of the waveguide are 600 mm, 90 mm, and 50 mm,
                respectively. The flattened part of the waveguide has a
                height of 25 mm. The flat area of the waveguide is
                designed to increase the electric field strength. The
                microwave generated by the magnetron passes through the
                circulator and the three-stub tuner and reaches the
                flattened waveguide. This flat part has a circular
                opening for the insertion of a quartz tube with an inner
                diameter of 24 mm, an outer diameter of 27 mm, and a
                length of 600 mm. The quartz tube passes vertically
                through the wall of the flattened waveguide tube and the
                central axis of the tube located at a quarter wavelength
                from the short end of the waveguide.20 The igniter is
                used to ignite and generate a plasma jet. An industrial
                cooler is used to cool the circulator and the magnetron.
                We use an air compressor and an airflow meter to
                generate and condition the high-pressure air into the
                quartz tube. Air enters the quartz tube from the side,
                forming a vortex that keeps the plasma jet stable in the
                tube.21 As shown in Fig. 2, variation in the microwave
                power affects the length of the air microwave plasma
                jet. Our observation indicates that the length of the
                flame increased with increasing power. In addition,
                changes in the injected airflow also affect the flame
                length.</font><b><font color="#000000"><br>

                </font></b><font color="#000000">The invention discloses
                a self-cooled microwave enhanced electric thruster, and
                belongs to the technical field of aerospace electric
                propulsion. The self-cooled microwave enhanced electric
                thruster comprises a metal antenna, a discharge cavity,
                an air inlet interface, an SMA radio frequency input
                interface, a conical outlet and a permanent magnet ring
                set. The metal antenna, the discharge cavity and the
                conical outlet are sequentially connected through
                threads; the permanent magnetic ring set is installed
                outside the discharge cavity and conical outlet; and the
                air inlet interface and the SMAradio frequency input
                interface are formed in a threaded through hole of the
                discharge cavity. The problem of unstable discharge
                caused by partial overheating of the metal antenna due
                to long-term discharge in an existing microwave thruster
                is solved, the heating capacity of the antenna is
                greatly decreased through the air cooling effect, thus
                discharge stability is maintained, and the thruster
                isself-cooled. Through the conical outlet in the tail of
                the thruster, an electromagnetic field is strengthened
                locally, the energy conversion efficiency of plasma is
                improved, and thus the performanceof the thruster is
                improved.<br>

                stopped a business deal. That is not the case! The Arabs
                have taken billions of dollars out of this country, and

                gravity! It is ecological balance! You are an old man
                who thinks in terms of nations and peoples. There are no
                nations. There are no peoples. There are no Russians.
                There are no Arabs. There are no third worlds. There is
                no West. There is only one holistic system of systems,
                one vast and immane, interwoven, interacting,
                multivariate, multinational dominion of dollars.
                Petro-dollars, electro-dollars, multi-dollars,
                reichmarks, rins, rubles, pounds, and shekels. It is the
                international system of currency which determines the

                order of things today. That is the atomic and subatomic
                and galactic structure of things today! And YOU have
                meddled with the primal forces of nature, and YOU… WILL…
                ATONE! Am I getting through to you, Mr. Beale? You get
                up on your little twenty-one inch screen and howl about
                America and democracy. There is no America. There is no
                democracy. There is only IBM, and ITT, and AT&amp;T, and
                DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon. Those are the
                nations of the world today. What do you think the
                Russians talk about in their councils of state, Karl
                Marx? They get out their linear programming charts,
                statistical decision theories, minimax solutions, and
                compute the price-cost probabilities of their
                transactions and investments, just like we do. We no
                longer live in a world of nations and ideologies, Mr.

                business. The world is a business, Mr. Beale. It has

              <br>
              The video below, from a licensed Private Detective,
              reveals that through a "policy change" every customer of
              AT&amp;T Cellular services is now tracked 24/7/365 whether
              they have their cellular phone turned on -- or OFF. <br>
              <br>
              The phone still communicates with AT&amp;T cell towers to
              "ping" location info, even when owner turns phone off;
              turns "data" off and turns off location services. <br>
              <br>
              The private detective performs "sweeping" for listening
              devices for private citizens, and has known for years he
              must turn off his cell phones when checking for devices
              inside a client location.&nbsp; But recently, he and his
              crew found that their cell phones were still emitting
              location data, even though the phones were turned off!<br>
              <br>
              He called AT&amp;T and found they changed their policy to
              track every cellular customer, every 15 to 30 seconds,
              whether the customer has the phone on or not.<br>
              <br>
              Even if you turn off location services, turn off cellular
              data, or turn the phone itself off, the phone still pings
              the cell tower with your location!<br>
              <br>
              Here's the proof:<br>

                  Tesla coil aligns, electrifies materials from a
                  distance <br>
                  <br>
                  Scientists at Rice University have discovered that the
                  strong force field emitted by a Tesla coil causes
                  carbon nanotubes to self-assemble into long wires, a
                  phenomenon they call “Teslaphoresis.”<br>
                  <br>
                  The team led by Rice chemist Paul Cherukuri reported
                  its results this week in ACS Nano.<br>
                  <br>
                  Cherukuri sees this research as setting a clear path
                  toward scalable assembly of nanotubes from the bottom
                  up.<br>
                  <br>
                  The system works by remotely oscillating positive and
                  negative charges in each nanotube, causing them to
                  chain together into long wires. Cherukuri’s specially
                  designed Tesla coil even generates a tractor beam-like
                  effect as nanotube wires are pulled toward the coil
                  over long distances.<br>
                  Rice University chemist Paul Cherukuri, left, Texas
                  A&amp;M graduate student Lindsey Bornhoeft, center,
                  and Rice research scientist Carter Kittrell show the
                  power of Teslaphoresis, which wirelessly lights their
                  fluorescent tubes. Tests with a customized Tesla coil
                  revealed that nanotubes within the field self-assemble
                  into wires.<br>
                  <br>
                  This force-field effect on matter had never been
                  observed on such a large scale, Cherukuri said, and
                  the phenomenon was unknown to Nikola Tesla, who
                  invented the coil in 1891 with the intention of
                  delivering wireless electrical energy.<br>
                  <br>
                  “Electric fields have been used to move small objects,
                  but only over ultrashort distances,” Cherukuri said.
                  “With Teslaphoresis, we have the ability to massively
                  scale up force fields to move matter remotely.”<br>
                  <br>
                  The researchers discovered that the phenomenon
                  simultaneously assembles and powers circuits that
                  harvest energy from the field. In one experiment,
                  nanotubes assembled themselves into wires, formed a
                  circuit connecting two LEDs and then absorbed energy
                  from the Tesla coil’s field to light them.<br>
                  <br>
                  Cherukuri realized a redesigned Tesla coil could
                  create a powerful force field at distances far greater
                  than anyone imagined. His team observed alignment and
                  movement of the nanotubes several feet away from the
                  coil. “It is such a stunning thing to watch these
                  nanotubes come alive and stitch themselves into wires
                  on the other side of the room,” he said.<br>
                  <br>
                  Nanotubes were a natural first test material, given
                  their heritage at Rice, where the HiPco production
                  process was invented. But the researchers envision
                  many other nanomaterials can be assembled as well.<br>
                  <br>
                  Lindsey Bornhoeft, the paper’s lead author and a
                  biomedical engineering graduate student at Texas
                  A&amp;M University, said the directed force field from
                  the bench-top coil at Rice is restricted to just a few
                  feet. To examine the effects on matter at greater
                  distances would require larger systems that are under
                  development. Cherukuri suggested patterned surfaces
                  and multiple Tesla coil systems could create more
                  complex self-assembling circuits from nanoscale-sized
                  particles.<br>
                  <br>
                  Cherukuri and his wife, Tonya, also a Rice alum and a
                  co-author of the paper, noted that their son Adam made
                  some remarkable observations while watching videos of
                  the experiment. “I was surprised that he noticed
                  patterns in nanotube movements that I didn’t see,”
                  Cherukuri said. “I couldn’t make him an author on the
                  paper, but both he and his little brother John are
                  acknowledged for helpful discussions.”<br>
                  <br>
                  Cherukuri knows the value of youthful observation –
                  and imagination – since he started designing Tesla
                  coils as a teen. “I would have never thought, as a
                  14-year-old kid building coils, that it was going to
                  be useful someday,” he said.<br>
                  <br>
                  Cherukuri and his team self-funded the work, which he
                  said made it more meaningful for the group. “This was
                  one of the most exciting projects I’ve ever done, made
                  even more so because it was an all-volunteer group of
                  passionate scientists and students. But because Rice
                  has this wonderful culture of unconventional wisdom,
                  we were able to make an amazing discovery that pushes
                  the frontiers of nanoscience.”<br>
                  <br>
                  The teammates look forward to seeing where their
                  research leads. “These nanotube wires grow and act
                  like nerves, and controlled assembly of nanomaterials
                  from the bottom up may be used as a template for
                  applications in regenerative medicine,” Bornhoeft
                  said.<br>
                  <br>
                  “There are so many applications where one could
                  utilize strong force fields to control the behavior of
                  matter in both biological and artificial systems,”
                  Cherukuri said. “And even more exciting is how much
                  fundamental physics and chemistry we are discovering
                  as we move along. This really is just the first act in
                  an amazing story.”...<br>

                  </font></b><font color="#000000">This paper introduces
                  Teslaphoresis, the directed motion and self-assembly
                  of matter by a Tesla coil, and studies this
                  electrokinetic phenomenon using single-walled carbon
                  nanotubes (CNTs). Conventional directed self-assembly
                  of matter using electric fields has been restricted to
                  small scale structures, but with Teslaphoresis, we
                  exceed this limitation by using the Tesla coil’s
                  antenna to create a gradient high-voltage force field
                  that projects into free space. CNTs placed within the
                  Teslaphoretic (TEP) field polarize and self-assemble
                  into wires that span from the nanoscale to the
                  macroscale, the longest thus far being 15 cm. We show
                  that the TEP field not only directs the self-assembly
                  of long nanotube wires at remote distances (&gt;30 cm)
                  but can also wirelessly power nanotube-based LED
                  circuits. Furthermore, individualized CNTs
                  self-organize to form long parallel arrays with high
                  fidelity alignment to the TEP field. Thus,
                  Teslaphoresis is effective for directed self-assembly
                  from the bottom-up to the macroscale.<br>

              </div>
              <br>
              In this explosive interview, Spiro Skouras is joined by
              Dr. Sherri Tenpenny. The two discuss the latest
              developments regarding the coronavirus situation which was
              declared a global health pandemic, by the Gates funded
              World Health Organization, as more information comes to
              light questioning the need for a global lockdown.<br>
              <br>
              Dr. Tenpenny and Spiro examine and explore, the motives of
              the global response by governments,&nbsp; global
              institutions and private interests, as Dr. Tenpenny
              exposes perhaps the most alarming aspect of the crisis
              yet! <br>
              <br>
              No, it is not the virus, it is the blank check issued to
              the vaccine and drug manufacturers, which not only
              provides unlimited funding, but also provides blanket
              immunity to Big Pharma for any harm attributed with the
              treatments produced during the declared emergency,
              including all drugs and vaccines. <br>
              <br>
              This blanket immunity is provided by the US government
              under the PREP Act and provides the drug and vaccine
              manufacturers the 'Ultimate Blank Check' during a declared
              emergency. As Dr. Tenpenny points out, the vaccine and
              drug manufacturers have zero incentive to produce a safe
              product, as the declared emergency not only rolls back
              regulatory standards and removes them from any and all
              liability, but it also ensures the government will
              purchase their products.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              This is an unprecedented level of immunity which raises
              many questions and safety concerns.<br>

              A federal court in Utah has order a halt to the sale of a
              product called "Alkaline Structured Silver," charging it
              was fraudulently touted as a treatment for the
              coronavirus.<br>
              <br>
              Its promoters claim the product will "usher" the
              coronavirus out of the body and protect from infections.<br>
              <br>
              The temporary restraining order Tuesday came in response
              to a civil complaint in Salt Lake City against defendants
              Gordon Pedersen of Cedar Hills and his companies, My
              Doctor Suggests LLC and GP Silver LLC.<br>
              <br>
              "Even in a time of great uncertainty, there are at least
              two unchanging realities. There are those who would
              unlawfully exploit our vulnerabilities, and there are
              those who will hold such parties accountable," said U.S.
              Attorney John W. Huber of Utah.<br>
              <br>
              TRENDING: Outrageous 'don't defend Trump' memo uncovered,
              written by top Republican strategist<br>
              <br>
              "COVID-19 is a dangerous disease, and American consumers
              must have accurate and reliable information as they make
              important health decisions," he said.<br>
              <br>
              The company claimed that once silver nanoparticles are in
              the bloodstream they can block the virus from attaching to
              cells.<br>
              <br>
              The DOJ said the civil complaint "alleges that the
              defendants are fraudulently promoting and selling various
              silver products for the treatment and prevention of
              COVID-19."<br>
              <br>
              "The court’s order temporarily enjoins the defendants from
              continuing to sell or distribute their silver products for
              the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention
              of any disease, including COVID-19," the DOJ said.<br>
              <br>
              The defendants' assets also were frozen to preserve the
              court’s ability to grant effective final relief, the DOJ
              said.<br>
              <br>
              "The Department of Justice will take swift action to
              protect consumers from those who would recklessly exploit
              this public health crisis by offering phony cure-alls for
              the treatment and prevention of COVID-19," said Assistant
              Attorney General Jody Hunt of the Department of Justice’s
              Civil Division. “We work closely with our partners at the
              Food and Drug Administration and will move quickly to shut
              down schemes that promote and sell unlawful products
              during this pandemic.”<br>
              <br>
              Authorities explained they suspected a scheme to defraud
              consumers by selling silver products based on "fraudulent
              claims of protection against, and treatment for,
              COVID-19."<br>
              <br>
              Prosecutors allege the defendants "have made a wide
              variety of false and misleading claims touting silver
              products as a preventative for COVID-19, including that
              having silver in the bloodstream will 'usher' any
              coronavirus out of the body and that 'it has been proven
              that Alkaline Structured Silver will destroy all forms of
              viruses, it will protect people from the coronavirus.'"<br>
              <br>
              "The FDA will continue to help ensure those who place
              profits above the public health during the COVID-19
              pandemic are stopped,” said Judy McMeekin, Pharm.D.,
              associate commissioner for Regulatory Affairs, U.S. Food
              and Drug Administration. “We are fully committed to
              working with the Department of Justice to take appropriate
              action against those jeopardizing the health of Americans
              by offering and distributing products with unproven claims
              to prevent or treat COVID-19.”<br>

                  actually spouting statistical nonsense… don’t be
                  fooled</b><br>

              The two doctors featured in the video, Drs. Dan Erickson
              and Artin Massih, co-owners of Accelerated Urgent Care in
              Bakersfield, California, put on a clinic of mathematical
              and statistical illiteracy in their now-banned video,
              essentially claiming no lockdowns were ever necessary and
              that the coronavirus isn’t really very dangerous at all.<br>
              <br>
              To arrive at that absurd conclusion, they of course cite
              horribly bad math… the kind of math that would earn you an
              “F” in Statistics 101. From their video, here’s what they
              say:<br>
              <br>
              So if you look at California—these numbers are from
              yesterday—we have 33,865 COVID cases, out of a total of
              280,900 total tested. That’s 12% of Californians were
              positive for COVID. So we don’t, the initial—as you guys
              know, the initial models were woefully inaccurate. They
              predicted millions of cases of death—not of prevalence or
              incidence—but death. That is not materializing. What is
              materializing is, in the state of California is 12%
              positives. You have a 0.03 chance of dying from COVID in
              the state of California. Does that necessitate sheltering
              in place? Does that necessitate shutting down medical
              systems? Does that necessitate people being out of work?<br>
              <br>
              The problem with that explanation? The sample of people
              who are being tested are, of course, the people most
              likely to have symptoms or who believe they have been
              exposed. It’s not a random sample of the population at
              large. (Again, this is Statistics 101.)<br>

                  to make LIQUID MAGNETS: Magnetic device could be used
                  to make “flexible liquid robots”</b><br>
                <b> By Arsenio Toledo</b><br>
              </div>
              <br>
              Scientists from the Department of Energy‘s Office of
              Science, working at the Lawrence Berkeley National
              Laboratory, have created the first ever liquid magnet.
              This substance retains its magnetism even when it changes
              its shape. According to the researchers, this makes the
              material attractive for the creation of flexible liquid
              robots that can change their shape at will to adapt to
              their surroundings.<br>
              <br>
              “We’ve made a new material that is both liquid and
              magnetic. No one has ever observed this before,” said Tom
              Russell, professor of polymer science and engineering at
              the University of Massachusetts, Amherst and a visiting
              faculty scientist at the Berkeley National Laboratory.<br>
              <br>
              “This opens the door to a new area of science in magnetic
              soft matter.”<br>
              <br>
              <b>Liquid magnets, a breakthrough in the scientific world</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              Russell and Xubo Liu, the first author of the study and a
              doctoral student at the Beijing University of Chemical
              Technology, came up with the idea of creating liquid
              structures using ferrofluids, or nanoparticles that became
              strongly magnetic when they were in the presence of a
              magnetic substance.<br>
              <br>
              Russell and Liu’s hypothesis rested on the possibility of
              turning ferrofluids permanently magnetic. This
              hypothetical material would behave much like a solid
              magnet while maintaining the properties of a liquid
              substance.<br>
              <br>
              To test whether or not their hypothesis is, in fact,
              doable, Russell and Liu used 3D printing technology
              developed in the Berkeley National Lab to print 1 mL
              droplets of a ferrofluid solution. This solution contains
              iron-oxide nanoparticles that are just 20 nm in diameter,
              or the average size of an antibody protein.<br>
              <br>
              With the help of other colleagues from the Berkeley
              National Lab and using knowledge obtained from surface
              chemistry and sophisticated atomic force microscopy
              techniques, Russel and Liu discovered that the
              nanoparticles created a liquid “shell” at the interface
              between the two liquids. This rare phenomenon is known as
              “interfacial jamming.” The nanoparticles crowded onto the
              surface of the droplet “like the walls coming together in
              a small room jampacked with people,” Russell explained.<br>
              <br>
              To make this liquid magnetic, the researchers placed the
              substance by a magnetic coil in solution. As they
              predicted, the magnetic coil pulled the iron-oxide
              nanoparticles. However, when they removed the magnetic
              coil, they were surprised to find that the droplets became
              permanently magnetic.<br>
              <br>
              The droplets began to gravitate toward each other, almost
              like dancing as Liu explained, in a perfect unison. They
              formed an elegant swirl. Before this study, the scientific
              consensus was that only solid objects could be permanently
              magnetized.<br>

              In this explosive interview, Spiro Skouras is joined by
              Dr. Sherri Tenpenny. The two discuss the latest
              developments regarding the coronavirus situation which was
              declared a global health pandemic, by the Gates funded
              World Health Organization, as more information comes to
              light questioning the need for a global lockdown.<br>
              <br>
              Dr. Tenpenny and Spiro examine and explore, the motives of
              the global response by governments,&nbsp; global
              institutions and private interests, as Dr. Tenpenny
              exposes perhaps the most alarming aspect of the crisis
              yet! <br>
              <br>
              No, it is not the virus, it is the blank check issued to
              the vaccine and drug manufacturers, which not only
              provides unlimited funding, but also provides blanket
              immunity to Big Pharma for any harm attributed with the
              treatments produced during the declared emergency,
              including all drugs and vaccines. <br>
              <br>
              This blanket immunity is provided by the US government
              under the PREP Act and provides the drug and vaccine
              manufacturers the 'Ultimate Blank Check' during a declared
              emergency. As Dr. Tenpenny points out, the vaccine and
              drug manufacturers have zero incentive to produce a safe
              product, as the declared emergency not only rolls back
              regulatory standards and removes them from any and all
              liability, but it also ensures the government will
              purchase their products.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              This is an unprecedented level of immunity which raises
              many questions and safety concerns.<br>

              </div>
              <br>
              A recent study brings good news to people who have a sweet
              tooth and those who neglect to properly brush their teeth.
              Scientists were able to discover that teeth have the
              ability to reverse tooth decay; meaning, traces of such
              tooth damage can be totally gone, thus doing away with the
              necessity to undergo oral surgeries or have tooth
              fillings.<br>
              <br>
              What would this miracle entail? Simple, researchers said.
              Just take a single aspirin.<br>
              <br>
              “Our initial research findings in the laboratory suggest
              that the use of aspirin, a drug already licensed for human
              use, could offer an immediate innovative solution enabling
              our teeth to repair themselves,” principal investigator,
              Professor Ikhlas El Karim, a senior lecturer in the School
              of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences at Queen’s
              University Belfast (QUB), said.<br>
              <br>
              “Ideally, what we’re reporting here is that we’re hoping
              to be able to develop a therapy [so] that the teeth could
              repair themselves,” Karim added. (Related: Stop gum pain
              and tooth decay with sustainable dentistry.)<br>
              <br>
              What the researchers did was collate previous research
              data to be able to point to aspirin as a compound that can
              induce the gene signature that is needed to make new
              dentine. Having done so, the QUB scientists treated stem
              cells in a Petri dish and identified “genetic and also
              material evidence that it can produce dentine”.<br>
              <br>
              “The next step is to go and try and figure out how you are
              going to apply the aspirin to the teeth, to regenerate the
              dentine, and to replace the need for fillings. You need to
              put it [on the tooth] in a way that bit can be easily
              released over a long period of time, if you put an aspirin
              now on a cavity, it’s going to be washed away.<br>
              <br>
              We are not encouraging that, there is a scientific way to
              go about this, so that we produce a final product that can
              be used by a dentist, not by a patient. The next step is
              to work with our pharmacy colleagues to try to develop a
              vehicle to put it in to the teeth, after the clinical
              trials,” Karim said.<br>
              <br>
              The fact that aspirin is already a
              commercially-manufactured product is a boon to the dental
              industry’s longing to have this endeavor materialize.<br>
              <br>
              “We are not really talking about 10 or 20 years time, it
              will probably be in the near future that it could be tried
              in a clinical trial with patients. This novel approach
              could not only increase the long-term survival of teeth,
              but could also result in huge savings for the [National
              Health Service] and other healthcare systems worldwide,”
              Karim concluded.<br>
              <br>
              Aspirin, which is also called acetylsalicylic acid, is a
              drug that has been popular for many years now as an
              effective painkiller. It has anti-inflammatory properties,
              and is used to soothe headaches, menstrual cramps, and
              muscle pain. People can get it for merely a penny a
              tablet.<br>
              <br>
              According to recent data, tooth decay is one among the
              most common tooth ailments in the world today; it affects
              a third of adults the world over. Also, it is the number
              one problem in the teeth of children who are residing in
              the United Kingdom.<br>
              <br>
              Tooth decay happens when oral acids dissolve the enamel
              and dentine of the teeth, causing black holes or cavities
              to form within, around, or on the teeth. The oral acids
              are caused by bacteria that are found within the plaque –
              a sticky and thin film – that gets deposited in and around
              our teeth.<br>
              <br>
              Fillings are usually used to prevent bacteria from totally
              ruining a single tooth by hindering the cavity from
              reaching the tooth’s most critical component: the pulp.<br>
              <br>
              Normally, our teeth do not recuperate from the onset of
              cavities. If worse comes to worst, they can produce a thin
              band of dentine – the layer just below the enamel – if the
              inner dental pulp becomes exposed, but other than that
              they can do nothing: a large cavity cannot possibly be
              repaired...<br>

              Aspirin could reverse the effects of tooth decay and could
              lead to fewer fillings being needed in the future,
              researchers in Belfast have said.<br>
              <br>
              Initial research at Queen's University has found aspirin
              stimulates stem cells in teeth, enhancing tooth
              regeneration.<br>
              <br>
              Tooth decay, the most common dental disease, leads to the
              inflammation of the tooth nerve, causing toothache.<br>
              <br>
              The British Dental Association reported in 2016 that 72%
              of 15-year-olds in Northern Ireland have dental decay.<br>
              <br>
              That figure compared to 44% in England and 63% in Wales.<br>
              <br>
              Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is a drug that has been
              used for many years as a painkiller. It has an
              anti-inflammatory action, and is used to relieve headache,
              menstrual pain and muscle aches. It costs one penny a
              tablet.<br>
              <br>
              Teeth naturally have limited regenerative abilities. They
              can produce a thin band of dentine - the layer just below
              the enamel - if the inner dental pulp becomes exposed, but
              this cannot repair a large cavity.<br>
              <br>
              Current treatment for tooth decay involves fillings, which
              may need to be replaced many times during the lifetime of
              the tooth.<br>
              <br>
              Prof Ikhlas El Karim is a senior lecturer in the School of
              Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences at Queen's
              University Belfast.<br>
              <br>
              Her research focuses on dental stem cells found in teeth
              and how dentists can enhance their ability to regenerate
              and repair damaged teeth, removing the need for fillings.<br>
              <br>
              The research findings, to be presented on Thursday at the
              British Society for Oral and Dental Research annual
              conference, show that aspirin can enhance the function of
              those stem cells, thus helping self-repair by regenerating
              lost tooth structure.<br>
              <br>
              "Ideally, what we're really reporting here is that we're
              hoping to be able to develop a therapy [so] that the teeth
              could repair themselves," she said.<br>
              <br>
              "This is going to be gradual, it's not going to be the end
              of the filling straight away."<br>
              <br>
              The researchers collated large amounts of previous
              research data to indentify aspirin as a compound that can
              induce the gene signature needed to generate new dentine.<br>
              <br>
              The QUB scientists then treated stem cells in a Petri dish
              with aspirin and found "genetic and also material evidence
              that it can produce dentine".<br>
              <br>
              "The next step is to go and try to figure out how you are
              going to apply the aspirin to the teeth, to regenerate the
              dentine and to replace the need for fillings."<br>
              <br>
              Applying the aspirin to teeth will not involve simply
              putting it on an infected tooth however.<br>
              <br>
              "You need to put it [on the tooth] in a way that it can be
              easily released over a long period of time, if you put an
              aspirin now on a cavity, it's going to be washed away," Dr
              El Karim said.<br>
              <br>
              "We are not encouraging that, there is a scientific way to
              go about this, so that we produce a final product that can
              be used by a dentist, not by a patient.<br>

              try to develop a vehicle to put it in to the teeth, after
              that clinical trials."<br>
              <br>
              Dr El Karim said the fact that aspirin is already a
              licensed drug should help the development of the
              treatment.<br>
              <br>
              "We are not really talking about 10 or 20 years time, it
              will probably be in the near future that it could be tried
              in a clinical trial with patients," she said.<br>
              <br>
              "There is huge potential to change our approach to one of
              the biggest dental challenges we face.<br>
              <br>
              "This novel approach could not only increase the long-term
              survival of teeth, but could also result in huge savings
              for the NHS and other healthcare systems worldwide." <br>

              from teeth using low-dose aspirin significantly increased
              mineralization and the expression of genes responsible for
              forming dentin. Coupled with the known anti-inflammatory
              and pain-relieving effects of aspirin, the researchers
              believe this discovery could provide a unique solution for
              controlling tooth nerve inflammation while promoting
              natural tooth repair...<br>

              </div>
              <br>
              Several published studies have found that the use of
              aspirin, if chewed, can contribute to the cause of tooth
              erosion. These studies analyzed both laboratory studies,
              where extracted teeth were placed in a water and aspirin
              mixture, and clinical case studies of people who took six
              doses of aspirin powder per day for a two-to-three year
              period. In the laboratory study, scientists observed
              changes in the surface of both the enamel, outer covering
              of the teeth, and dentin, the layer of tooth structure
              under the enamel, of the extracted teeth tested.1<br>
              <br>
              In the clinical case study, the top surface of the teeth,
              also called the occlusal surface, showed severe erosion of
              the lower molars and premolars and on the lower anterior
              teeth on the tongue side. The researchers concluded that
              the aspirin powder caused the tooth erosion.2<br>
              <br>
              Another study examined 42 children with rheumatoid
              arthritis. The participants were split into two groups,
              those who chewed aspirin, and those who swallowed it. The
              study found that the 25 children who chewed aspirin
              tablets experienced severe erosion of the upper and lower
              primary molars, and their first permanent molars. The 17
              children who swallowed the aspirin tablets experienced no
              erosion of their teeth. The scientists concluded that the
              tooth erosion these children developed was due to chewing
              the aspirin tablets.3<br>
              <br>
              These studies show that aspirin can affect the structure
              of the tooth surface depending how the analgesic is taken
              and can cause irritation to the soft tissue in the mouth.
              Consult with your dentist and physician if required doses
              of aspirin are recommended for a medical condition.<br>

              A team at the University of Tsukuba studied a novel
              process for creating coherent lattice waves inside silicon
              crystals using ultrashort laser pulses. Using theoretical
              calculations combined with experimental results that were
              obtained at the University of Pittsburgh, they were able
              to show that coherent vibrational signals could be
              maintained inside the samples. This research may lead to
              quantum computers based on existing silicon devices that
              can rapidly perform tasks out of the reach of even the
              fastest supercomputers now available... <br>
              <br>
              In the current research, a team at the University of
              Tsukuba and Hrvoje Petek, RK Mellon Chair of Physics and
              Astronomy at the University of Pittsburgh used very short
              laser pulses to excite electrons inside a silicon crystal.
              "The use of existing silicon for quantum computing will
              make the transition to quantum computers much easier,"
              first author Dr. Yohei Watanabe explains. The energetic
              electrons created coherent vibrations of the silicon
              structure, such that the motions of the electron and the
              silicon atoms became entangled. The state of the system
              was then probed after a variable delay time with a second
              laser pulse.<br>
              <br>
              Based on their theoretical model, the scientists were able
              to explain oscillations observed in the charge generated
              as a function of delay time. "This experiment reveals the
              underlying quantum mechanical effects governing the
              coherent vibrations," says senior author Prof. Muneaki
              Hase, who performed the experiments. "In this way, the
              project represents a first step towards affordable
              consumer quantum computers." <br>

              A Royal Navy sailor who served on nuclear ‘Hunter Killer’
              submarines has used his military know-how to develop a new
              ‘green’ car device to slash motorists’ fuel bills and
              harmful emissions.<br>
              <br>
              Former Leading Seaman Brian Sheard, 49, has switched from
              Cold War warrior to civvy-street inventor to create – in
              his own garage – a smart box inspired by the way
              submarines make their own air to keep crews breathing
              during long missions underwater.<br>
              <br>
              His resulting compact hydrogen fuel-cell box reduces car
              emissions by up to 80 per cent and offers fuel savings of
              up to 20 per cent, according to independent tests.<br>
              <br>
              His box fits neatly into a car’s engine bay and uses
              electrolysis to generate on-board hydrogen.<br>
              <br>
              This is pumped immediately and directly into the engine to

              family cars, Mr Sheard sought professional help from
              industry and finance from crowd-funding to found his
              company called CGON, which now manufactures his ‘green’
              box in the UK.<br>
              <br>
              It has already caught the attention of Malvern sports
              car-maker Morgan, which has been trialling the kit in its
              own cars.<br>
              <br>
              The married father-of-two’s technology is a peace-time
              spin-off from his Cold War Royal Navy job when - as well
              as tracking Russian submarines and ships on sonar - he was
              responsible for creating an on-board oxygen supply,
              through electrolysis, so his crew didn’t suffocate while
              serving underwater for weeks at a time.<br>
              <br>
              Then, the hydrogen was a waste by-product that was not
              needed, so was jettisoned.<br>
              <br>
              But in his new device, that hydrogen is now harnessed.<br>
              <br>
              Mr Sheard developed his device in the garage of his modest
              three-bedroom semi-detached home in Topsham, Exeter, where
              he lives with his wife Dawn. The couple have two grown up
              daughters: Penny, 26, and Molly, 23. <br>
              <br>
              Born in Woking, Mr Sheard grew up until age nine in South
              Africa before moving to Bristol and joined Navy in 1986
              age 17, training in Gosport and serving in diesel-electric
              and then Hunter Killer nuclear submarines before leaving
              the service in 2008.<br>
              <br>
              Explaining how his life beneath the waves had sparked his
              idea, the former submariner said: ‘My primary role was
              Underwater Acoustic Analysis, so I was a sonar specialist.
              But being a submariner, you need to know every other job
              on board, including knowledge of mechanical systems, in
              case you are caught in a compartment in time of emergency.<br>
              <br>
              ‘One of those systems was the sub’s on-board electrolyser.
              This takes in sea water, splits it into hydrogen and
              oxygen. The oxygen is used for life support on board,
              while the hydrogen is discharged overboard.’<br>
              <br>
              He said: ‘It was only when I left the Navy that it dawned
              on me that I could apply my knowledge of electrolysers to
              hydrogen additive systems in cars.’<br>
              <br>
              Significantly, he has created specially-coated titanium
              electrodes and an electrolyte solution that does not
              create toxic bi-products (such as Hexavalent Chromium )
              during the electrolysis process.<br>
              <b><br>
              </b><b>HOW IT WORKS </b><br>
              <br>
              CGON’s ‘ezero1’ is a compact electrolyser box fitted into
              a car’s engine-bay. It produce hydrogen which goes
              directly into a petrol or diesel engine’s fuel/air mix for
              a cleaner and faster burn that slashes fuel costs and
              pollution.<br>
              <br>
              The box uses electrolysis - the decomposition of a liquid
              using electricity - to create a small amount of very pure,
              powerful hydrogen (called Ortho Hydrogen) , on demand.<br>
              <br>
              It is inspired by nuclear submarines, which use
              industrial-scale electrolysis to break down water (H2O) to
              create oxygen - to allow crews to breath while staying
              underwater for weeks at a time - with hydrogen as a
              by-product.<br>
              <br>
              Inside the box are two special titanium-coated electrodes
              - a cathode (negative) and anode (positive) – which pass
              electric current through an electrolyte solution, causing
              hydrogen gas to split off.<br>
              <br>
              The hydrogen is ‘sucked’ into the engine’s combustion
              chamber along with the conventional fuel-air mixture. This
              creates a faster, more complete and ‘cooler’ burn that
              eliminates almost all waste gases, gives better fuel
              economy, and ‘drastically reduces’ harmful emissions
              including Carbon Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, NOX,
              Hydrocarbons and particulates.<br>
              <br>
              80 per cent reduction in overall emissions and about 20
              per cent reduction in fuel consumption. It also keeps
              diesel particulate filters clean.<br>
              <br>
              System works with any petrol, diesel, or LPG
              internal-combustion engine including cars, taxis,
              forklifts and HGV trucks, and is on trial with car-maker
              Morgan.<br>

                  back into damaged teeth</b><br>
              </div>
              <br>
              A group at Queen Mary University of London have now
              developed a very fast dissolving 'bioactive' glass which
              they are putting in toothpaste to repair decayed teeth...
              , the team's research in the Journal Physical Chemistry B
              has shown the potential of a glass that uses chlorine
              instead of fluorine. The chlorine atom and ions are much
              bigger, which enables them to incorporate much more of it
              into the glass.<br>
              <br>
              The team's spin out company BioMin Technologies Ltd have
              also launched the first product based on these
              Chloride-containing glasses -- a remineralising toothpaste
              called "BioMinC." The toothpaste is designed for people
              who don't want to use a Fluoride-containing toothpaste and
              for areas of the world where the water is naturally
              fluoridated.<br>
              <br>
              Professor Robert Hill from QMUL's Institute of Dentistry
              said: "This toothpaste is unique because it can put back
              the mineral lost from your teeth after consumption of an
              acidic drink, but without the use of fluoride. This isn't
              just for people who have bad teeth, everyone can
              potentially benefit from using this new toothpaste."<br>

              <b>Abstract</b><br>
              The addition of chlorine into a bioactive glass
              composition is expected to reduce its abrasiveness and
              increase its bioactivity, which is important for dental
              applications such as toothpastes. There is a lack of
              information and understanding regarding the structural
              role of chlorine in chlorine-containing bioactive silicate
              glasses. This has prompted classical core–shell model
              molecular dynamics simulations of (50 – x/2)CaO–(50 –
              x/2)SiO2–xCaCl2 glasses to be performed, where x ranges
              from x = 0.0 to 43.1 mol % CaCl2. These ternary glasses
              are advantageous for a fundamental study because they do
              not have additional network formers (e.g., phosphorus
              pentoxide) or modifiers (e.g., sodium) typically found in
              bioactive glass compositions. The (50 – x/2)CaO–(50 –
              x/2)SiO2–xCaCl2 glasses were seen to become
              phase-separated around the x = 16.1 mol % CaCl2
              composition, and chlorine predominantly coordinated with
              calcium. These findings provide a solid foundation for
              further computational modeling work on more complex
              chlorine-containing bioactive glass compositions.<br>

              ...According to reports, HyMag technology will ” benefit
              virtually any technology that draws power from electric
              motors or generates power from generators.” Even
              battery-powered devices such as power tools and
              wheelchairs may be improved with the advent of this new
              tech.<br>
              <br>
              Through the addition of “enhancing layers” to the
              structures which make up a magnet motor, the scientists at
              Argonne were able to improve the magnetic flux density.
              And with higher flux density comes increased efficiency —
              and increased energy production.<br>
              <br>
              As sources explain, flux density is a feature of permanent
              magnets which can be used to generate power.<br>
              <br>
              HyMag’s inventors, Kaizhong Gao and Yuepeng Zhang, say
              that “the gain in the magnet’s usable flux density ranges
              from 10 to 30 percent, depending on the application and
              working temperatures,” — provided that it is designed

              Inventors of centuries past and scientists of today have
              found ingenious ways to make our lives better with magnets
              -- from the magnetic needle on a compass to magnetic data
              storage devices and even MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)
              body scan machines.<br>
              <br>
              All of these technologies rely on magnets made from solid
              materials. But what if you could make a magnetic device
              out of liquids? Using a modified 3D printer, a team of
              scientists at Berkeley Lab has done just that. Their
              findings, to be published July 19 in the journal Science,
              could lead to a revolutionary class of printable liquid
              devices for a variety of applications from artificial
              cells that deliver targeted cancer therapies to flexible
              liquid robots that can change their shape to adapt to
              their surroundings.<br>
              <br>
              "We've made a new material that is both liquid and
              magnetic. No one has ever observed this before," said Tom
              Russell, a visiting faculty scientist at Berkeley Lab and
              professor of polymer science and engineering at the
              University of Massachusetts, Amherst who led the study.
              "This opens the door to a new area of science in magnetic
              soft matter." <br>
              <br>
              <b>Jam sessions: making magnets out of liquids</b><br>
              For the past seven years, Russell, who leads a program
              called Adaptive Interfacial Assemblies Towards Structuring
              Liquids in Berkeley Lab's Materials Sciences Division, has
              focused on developing a new class of materials --
              3D-printable all-liquid structures.<br>
              <br>
              One day, Russell and the current study's first author Xubo
              Liu came up with the idea of forming liquid structures
              from ferrofluids, solutions of iron-oxide particles that
              become strongly magnetic, but only in the presence of
              another magnet. "We wondered, if a ferrofluid can become
              temporarily magnetic, what could we do to make it
              permanently magnetic, and behave like a solid magnet but
              still look and feel like a liquid?" said Russell.<br>
              <br>
              To find out, Russell and Liu -- a graduate student
              researcher in Berkeley Lab's Materials Sciences Division
              and a doctoral student at the Beijing University of
              Chemical Technology -- used a 3D-printing technique they
              had developed with former postdoctoral researcher Joe
              Forth in Berkeley Lab's Materials Sciences Division to
              print 1 millimeter droplets from a ferrofluid solution
              containing iron-oxide-nanoparticles just 20 nanometers in
              diameter (the average size of an antibody protein.)<br>
              <br>
              Using surface chemistry and sophisticated atomic force
              microscopy techniques at the Molecular Foundry, co-authors
              Paul Ashby and Brett Helms of Berkeley Lab revealed that
              the nanoparticles formed a solid-like shell at the
              interface between the two liquids through a phenomenon
              called "interfacial jamming," which causes the
              nanoparticles to crowd at the droplet's surface, "like the
              walls coming together in a small room jampacked with
              people," said Russell.<br>
              <br>
              To make them magnetic, the scientists placed the droplets
              by a magnetic coil in solution. As expected, the magnetic
              coil pulled the iron-oxide nanoparticles toward it.<br>
              <br>
              But when they removed the magnetic coil, something quite
              unexpected happened.<br>
              <br>
              Like synchronized swimmers, the droplets gravitated toward
              each other in perfect unison, forming an elegant swirl.
              "Like little dancing droplets," said Liu.<br>
              <br>
              Somehow, these droplets had become permanently magnetic.
              "We almost couldn't believe it," said Russell. "Before our
              study, people always assumed that permanent magnets could
              only be made from solids."<br>
              All magnets, no matter how big or small, have a north pole
              and a south pole. Opposite poles are attracted to each
              other, while the same poles repel each other.<br>
              <br>
              Through magnetometry measurements, the scientists found
              that when they placed a magnetic field by a droplet, all
              of the nanoparticles' north-south poles, from the 70
              billion iron-oxide nanoparticles floating around in the
              droplet to the 1 billion nanoparticles on the droplet's
              surface, responded in unison, just like a solid magnet.<br>
              <br>
              Key to this finding were the iron-oxide nanoparticles
              jamming tightly together at the droplet's surface. With
              just 8 nm between each of the billion nanoparticles,
              together they created a solid surface around each liquid
              droplet. Somehow, when the jammed nanoparticles on the
              surface are magnetized, they transfer this magnetic
              orientation to the particles swimming around in the core,
              and the entire droplet becomes permanently magnetic, just
              like a solid, Russell and Liu explained.<br>
              <br>
              The researchers also found that the droplet's magnetic
              properties were preserved, even if they divided a droplet
              into smaller, thinner droplets about the size of a human
              hair, added Russell.<br>
              <br>
              Among the magnetic droplets' many amazing qualities, what
              stands out even more, Russell noted, is that they change
              shape to adapt to their surroundings, morphing from a
              sphere to a cylinder to a pancake, or a tube as thin as a
              strand of hair, or even to the shape of an octopus -- all
              without losing their magnetic properties.<br>
              <br>
              The droplets' can also be tuned to switch between a
              magnetic mode and a nonmagnetic mode. And when their
              magnetic mode is switched on, their movements can be
              remotely controlled as directed by an external magnet,
              Russell added...<br>
              <br>
              All magnets, no matter how big or small, have a north pole
              and a south pole. Opposite poles are attracted to each
              other, while the same poles repel each other.<br>
              <br>
              Through magnetometry measurements, the scientists found
              that when they placed a magnetic field by a droplet, all
              of the nanoparticles' north-south poles, from the 70
              billion iron-oxide nanoparticles floating around in the
              droplet to the 1 billion nanoparticles on the droplet's
              surface, responded in unison, just like a solid magnet.<br>
              <br>
              Key to this finding were the iron-oxide nanoparticles
              jamming tightly together at the droplet's surface. With
              just 8 nm between each of the billion nanoparticles,
              together they created a solid surface around each liquid
              droplet. Somehow, when the jammed nanoparticles on the
              surface are magnetized, they transfer this magnetic
              orientation to the particles swimming around in the core,
              and the entire droplet becomes permanently magnetic, just
              like a solid, Russell and Liu explained.<br>
              <br>
              The researchers also found that the droplet's magnetic
              properties were preserved, even if they divided a droplet
              into smaller, thinner droplets about the size of a human
              hair, added Russell.<br>
              <br>
              Among the magnetic droplets' many amazing qualities, what
              stands out even more, Russell noted, is that they change
              shape to adapt to their surroundings, morphing from a
              sphere to a cylinder to a pancake, or a tube as thin as a
              strand of hair, or even to the shape of an octopus -- all
              without losing their magnetic properties.<br>
              <br>
              The droplets' can also be tuned to switch between a
              magnetic mode and a nonmagnetic mode. And when their
              magnetic mode is switched on, their movements can be
              remotely controlled as directed by an external magnet,
              Russell added.<br>

              ...According to reports, HyMag technology will ” benefit
              virtually any technology that draws power from electric
              motors or generates power from generators.” Even
              battery-powered devices such as power tools and
              wheelchairs may be improved with the advent of this new
              tech.<br>
              <br>
              Through the addition of “enhancing layers” to the
              structures which make up a magnet motor, the scientists at
              Argonne were able to improve the magnetic flux density.
              And with higher flux density comes increased efficiency —
              and increased energy production.<br>
              <br>
              As sources explain, flux density is a feature of permanent
              magnets which can be used to generate power.<br>
              <br>
              HyMag’s inventors, Kaizhong Gao and Yuepeng Zhang, say
              that “the gain in the magnet’s usable flux density ranges
              from 10 to 30 percent, depending on the application and
              working temperatures,” — provided that it is designed
              correctly...<br>

                  cases of coronavirus and the presence of 5G networks</b><br>
                <b>Author: Bartomeu Payeras i Cifre1</b><br>
              </div>
              <b>Translated from the Spanish by Claire Edwards</b><b><br>
              </b><b>Findings</b><br>
              1. The results obtained demonstrate a clear and close
              relationship between the rate of coronavirus infections
              and 5G antenna location.<br>
              2. This study does not analyse the beneficial or harmful
              effects on humans of 5G electromagnetic radiation.
              However, it does indicate a possible cause-effect in the
              current pandemic.<br>
              3. A “border effect” is significant, original and unique
              to this pandemic: it presents marked differences between
              contiguous states with and without 5G installation. it is
              particularly significant that the countries bordering
              China have very low rates of infection. One may also
              compare between Mexico and the USA or between Portugal and
              Spain, etc.<br>
              4. The case of San Marino is particularly significant. It
              was the first state in the world to install 5G and
              therefore, the state whose citizens have been exposed to
              5G radiation the longest, and suspiciously, the first
              state in the world with infections. The probability of
              this happening is 1 in 37,636.<br>
              5. In the cities studied, Madrid, Barcelona and New York,
              this correlation is also observed. In the study of the
              city of Barcelona (pp. 7-8), it can be seen that the
              socio- economic factor plays a significant role.2<br>
              6. It is very significant that on the African continent,
              with scarce health resources but without 5G, the rate of
              infection is very low, except for some antennas in South
              Africa, which also presents the highest rates of infection
              in Africa.<br>
              7. The rates of infection are diluted. The rates of some
              regions are influenced by cities with 5G, but the rates of
              infection of these cities are diluted in those of the
              region to which they belong. So it is more significant, as
              is the case of Spain, to compare uniprovincial autonomous
              regions, than among those that are formed by 3 or more of
              the old provinces. Thus we see that some regions with 5G
              such as Rioja, Madrid and Navarra, have rates between 4
              and 8 times higher than others without 5G. The same is
              true in other cities around the world where the 5G network
              does not cover the entire territory of the state or
              region.<br>
              8. These data and results have the value of being taken
              “in vivo”, not based on prospective or laboratory studies.
              Never before have we had so much epidemiological
              information about a disease in humans to be able to
              produce scientific studies. A means of answering the
              question of cause and effect would be to disconnect the 5G
              networks, at least as a preventive measure, and see the
              results of the evolution of cases of coronavirus. So would
              studying the rate of infection in a state that declared a
              5G moratorium after the pandemic started and studying if
              the statistics change. Given the evidence presented here,
              the data and conclusions of this study urgently need to be
              given due consideration. Given the current gravity of the
              pandemic, the media and political and health authorities
              have a responsibility to take urgent action. A failure to
              act in the face of the findings of this study could be
              considered negligent at the very least and very possibly
              criminal.<br>

              do not have a significant influence on rates of
              infection”, and in the other it is stated that they do.<br>

              The following is the text of a study by Prof Isaac
              Ben-Israel, first published on April 16, 2020. (Ben-Israel
              discussed his research on Israeli TV on April 13, saying
              that simple statistics show the spread of the coronavirus
              declines to almost zero after 70 days — no matter where it
              strikes, and no matter what measures governments impose to
              try to thwart it.) <br>
              <br>
              The following article aims at examining the development of
              the coronavirus disease in Israel since its inception 56
              days ago (8 weeks).<br>
              <br>
              It turns out that the peak of the virus’ spread has been
              behind us for about two weeks now, and will probably fade
              within two more weeks.<br>
              <br>
              Our analysis shows that this is a constant pattern across
              countries. Surprisingly, this pattern is common to
              countries that have taken a severe lockdown, including the
              paralysis of the economy, as well as to countries that
              implemented a far more lenient policy and have continued
              in ordinary life.<br>
              <br>
              The data indicates that the lockdown policy can be stopped
              within a few days and replaced by a policy of moderate
              social distancing...<br>

              <b>What is Textise?</b><b><br>
              </b>Textise is a new way of looking at the Web. It’s an
              internet tool that removes everything from a web page
              except for its text. In practice, this means that images,
              forms, scripts, adverts, they all go, leaving plain text.

              RESULTS: Overall, reported flu and cold symptoms in the
              test group decreased 85% compared with the control group
              after the administration of megadose Vitamin C.<br>
              CONCLUSION: Vitamin C in megadoses administered before or
              after the appearance of cold and flu symptoms relieved and
              prevented the symptoms in the test population compared
              with the control group.<br>
