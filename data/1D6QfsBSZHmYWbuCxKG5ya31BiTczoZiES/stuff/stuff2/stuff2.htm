      <b>SUPERLUMINAL ANTENNA</b><br>
      <b>WO2013119566</b><br>
      <b>US2013201073 </b><br>
      A superluminal antenna element integrates a balun element to
      better impedance match an input cable or waveguide to a dielectric
      radiator element, thus preventing stray reflections and consequent
      undesirable radiation. For example, a dielectric housing material
      can be used that has a cutout area. A cable can extend into the
      cutout area. A triangular conductor can function as an impednace
      transition. An additional cylindrical element functions as a
      sleeve balun to better impedance match the radiator element to the
      cable.<br>

      <br>
      The invention discloses an atomic spectrum communication device. A
      core technical content of the device is that the atomic spectrum
      communication device can reflect a resonance transmission process
      of some superluminal waves, and through a high sensitive atomic
      spectral analysis, information transfer can be realized. The
      atomic spectrum communication device consists of three major
      parts: an atom information receiver, an atomic spectrum analyzer,
      and an information demodulation device.<br>

      <b>Acceleration of particles beyond the speed of light and
        applications</b><br>
      <b>US2012168676</b><br>
      <br>
      With my device, I can accelerate in void particles of matter
      beyond the speed of light thanks to particles, antiparticles of
      antimatter and electromagnetic or electrostatic field. I can
      produce energy in a void electromagnetic or electrostatic circuit
      thanks to properties of superluminal particles since
      electromagnetic fields produced by superluminal particles are
      always behind them. So they can heat "black" or "dark" material
      according to fields produced by them without decelerate at all. I
      can also produce hypersensitive electromagnetic or electrostatic
      sensors since superluminal particles doesn't have inertia.<br>

      <b>Method for accelerating beam of e.g. atomic nucleus</b><br>
      <b>FR2948847</b><br>
      <br>
      The method involves guiding a beam of material particles with
      velocity (v1) into a vacuum by electromagnetic or electrostatic
      fields, and accelerating or retarding the beam of material
      particles by using constant electrostatic or electromagnetic
      fields. The beam of material particles is accelerated at
      superluminal speed, which is greater than speed of light. The beam
      of particle materials is annihilated with a beam of anti-material
      particles having a velocity (v2) at right angle. Independent
      claims are also included for the following: (1) a device for
      production of economic energy in the form of heat or
      electromagnetic radiation (2) a method of production of

      <br>
      The invention provides a super-light-speed flight vehicle aiming
      at solving the problem of difficult space entrance of human
      beings. The invention belongs to the technical field of
      super-light-speed flight vehicles. A large circle encloses a small
      circle; and the larger circle and the small circle are divided
      into two equal parts. The center of the circles is designed with
      'magnetic explosion' photon jet flow acceleration, rotation and
      turning double-speed double-side movement and inner and outer
      magnetic suspension effect. The flight vehicle realizes
      super-light-speed flight according to the instructions of a
      computer. The technical key points of the technical proposal
      comprise: a solution to a weightless problem; a solution to
      super-light-speed problem; a solution to a human residence
      problem; and realization of computer control over 'energy level'

      <b>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SPACECRAFT PROPULSION WITH A FIELD
        SHIELD PROTECTION</b><br>
      <b>CA2638667</b><br>
      <br>
      The propulsion method is based on a gravito-inertial phenomenon
      predicted by the Basic Structures of Matter - Supergavitation
      Unified Theory (BSM-SG), the practical demonstration of which is
      called a Stimulated Anomalous Reaction to the Gravity (SARG)
      effect. The SARG effect is a unidirectional change of the
      gravito-inertial mass of an object by modulation the parameters of
      the physical vacuum. The suggested technique employs an
      asymmetrical envelope of EM activated neutral plasma. The result
      is a unique force field distinguished from the reactive jet
      propulsion by lack of throwing mass and effect of reduced
      gravito-inertial mass of the spacecraft and the surrounding gas
      molecules. This means a less power for acceleration and less
      turbulence when moving in a planetary atmosphere. A small scale
      SARG effect is verified by laboratory experiments. A unique field
      shield protection against micrometeorites, also predicted by
      BSM-SG theory, can be achieved by emission of properly space and
      time correlated EM field packets and superluminal waves, known
      also as X-waves. KEYWORDS: massless propulsion, space drive, field

      <b>APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR PHASE FRONTS BASED ON SUPERLUMINAL
        POLARIZATION CURRENT</b><br>
      <b>US8125385</b><br>
      <br>
      An apparatus and method for a radiation source involving phase
      fronts emanating from an accelerated, oscillating polarization
      current whose distribution pattern moves superluminally (that is,
      faster than light in vacuo). Theoretical predictions and
      experimental measurements using an existing prototype superluminal
      source show that the phase fronts from such a source can be made
      to be very complex. Consequently, it will be very difficult for an
      aircraft imaged by such a radiation to detect where this radiation
      has come from. Moreover, the complexity of the phase fronts makes
      it almost impossible for electronics on an aircraft to synthesize
      a rogue reflection. A simple directional antenna and timing system
      should, on the other hand, be sufficient for the radar operators
      to locate the aircraft, given knowledge of their own source's
      speed and modulation pattern.<br>

      <b>Method and device for obtaining hypervelocity:</b><br>
      <b>CN101338809</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a method for achieving an
      extremely high speed and a device, which belong to the mechanical
      field. Continuous acceleration principle is utilized, the device
      is continuously accelerated by multiple driven gears with attached
      gears; the ratio between the radius (Rn) of the big gear of each
      driven gear with the attached gear and the radius (rn) of the
      small attached gear is not less than 20; when the edge of a first
      driving gear (C0) reaches a speed (V0), the speed is continuously
      doubled by the first driven gear (C1) with the attached gear to
      the nth driven gear (Cn) with the attached gear, and finally the
      value of the extremely high speed (Vn) on the edge of the Cn is
      not less than 20&lt;n&gt; multipled by V0. The device can output
      an extremely high speed which is higher than the first cosmic
      velocity (7.9km/) and is approximate light speed or superluminal
      speed. The method can produce an extremely high-speed device which
      has the advantages of high transmission efficiency, simple
      structure, each processing, small volume, low production cost,
      easy control and convenient operation. The method is used to

      A method of, and system for, binary signalling via quantum
      non-locality. The method and system are particularly suitable for
      rapid communication including superluminal signalling. The method
      and system use an ensemble of quantum-systems in which the
      quantum-systems are in pairs, with one quantum-system of each pair
      being in quantum entanglement with the other quantum-system of
      each pair. The quantum-systems may comprise particles or parts of
      particles. The paired quantum-systems are separated into two
      subgroups, with the quantum-systems of each pair being in
      different subgroups. The quantum-systems in one subgroup are
      subjected to an influence, such as a slit, to enhance scattering
      of the quantum-systems to an extent corresponding to the selected
      binary signal to be transmitted.; The extent of correlated
      scattering in the quantum-systems in the other subgroup is then
      detected, the extent of scattering providing an indication of the
      particular binary signal transmitted. Detection of the extent of
      correlated scattering involves subjecting the quantum-systems in
      the other subgroup to a detector slit.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Bioflavonoids, such as quercetin, have recently emerged as a new
      class of chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of various
      cancer types, but are marred by their low potency and poor
      selectivity. We report that a short application of low-frequency
      ultrasound selectively sensitises prostate and skin cancer cells
      against quercetin. Pretreatment of cells with ultrasound (20 kHz,
      2 W cm-2, 60 s) selectively induced cytotoxicity in skin and
      prostate cancer cells, while having minimal effect on
      corresponding normal cell lines. About 90% of the viable skin
      cancer cell population was lost within 48 h after
      ultrasound-quercetin (50 µM) treatment. Ultrasound reduced the
      LC50 of quercetin for skin cancer cells by almost 80-fold, while
      showing no effect on LC50 for nonmalignant skin cells.<br>
      <br>
      Therapeutic selectivity plays a crucial role in determining the
      success of chemotherapy. Some of the current targeted therapies
      attempt to localise drugs to cancer cells based on overexpression
      of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) (Mendelsohn and
      Baselga, 2000) or angiogenesis (Carter, 2001). Antibodies,
      inhibitors, antisense therapy and gene therapy are also among a
      few strategies that have gained momentum (Guillemard and Saragovi,
      2004). Many of these strategies have now reached clinical trials;
      however, these methods are still limited by issues including low
      potency, delivery complications, multi-drug resistance, side
      effects, collateral damage (Tattersall and Clarke, 2003) or
      incomplete success (Lynch et al, 2004).<br>
      <br>
      In an attempt to develop a targeted chemotherapeutic strategy, we
      propose the use of bioflavonoids, which are common dietary
      supplements, in conjunction with low-frequency ultrasound.
      Quercetin, a major bioflavonoid in human diet, has been identified
      as a chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of breast cancer
      (Singhal et al, 1995; Choi et al, 2001), colon cancer (Salucci et
      al, 2002), ovarian cancer (Chan et al, 2003) and prostate cancer
      (Knowles et al, 2000; Nakanoma et al, 2001; Kobayashi et al,
      2002). Antiproliferative action of quercetin is hypothesised to be
      mediated by attenuating phosphorylation of activated hsp
      transcription factor (hsf), shortly after its trimerisation (Nagai
      et al, 1995; Lee et al, 1998), thereby resulting in increased
      susceptibility of hsf to proteolytic degradation and as a
      consequence inhibiting all downstream events, including hsp
      expression (Li et al, 1999). Since hsps are constitutively
      overexpressed in many tumours (Jaattela, 1999), inhibition of hsps
      is an attractive chemotherapeutic strategy. hsps form a complex
      with mutant p53 protein (mp53), thereby prolonging the half-life
      of malignant mp53 and allowing tumour cells to bypass the normal
      mechanism of cell cycle arrest (Selkirk et al, 1996).<br>
      <br>
      In spite of its therapeutic benefits, utilisation of quercetin in
      clinical applications has been limited by low potency and poor
      specificity. Additionally, it is difficult to sustain therapeutic
      quercetin concentrations in blood by oral ingestion (Lamson and
      Bringall, 2000).<br>
      <br>
      Here, through in vitro studies, we demonstrate for the first time,
      using two pairs of normal and cancer cells (human skin fibroblast
      and human prostate epithelial cells), that ultrasound selectively
      sensitises cancer cells against quercetin. LC50 of quercetin for
      skin cancer cells is selectively decreased by almost 80-fold by a
      short pretreatment with ultrasound....<br>
      <br>
      <b>RESULTS</b><br>
      <br>
      Cytotoxic effects of quercetin and ultrasound were assessed using
      two pairs of normal and cancer cell lines (human skin fibroblast
      and human prostate epithelial cells). The pair of skin cells was
      obtained from the same donor and differed from each other only in
      terms of malignancy. Cells were incubated with quercetin (0–50 µM)
      with or without prior exposure to ultrasound (20 kHz, 2 W cm-2, 60
      s). A strong concentration-dependent cytoxicity was observed in
      skin cancer cells for the combined ultrasound and quercetin
      treatment (Figure 1A, closed squares), but not in nonmalignant
      skin cells (Figure 1A, open squares, P&lt;0.001 for quercetin=50
      µM). About 90% of viable population of skin cancer cells was lost
      in 48 h after ultrasound and quercetin (50 µM) treatment (Figure
      1A, closed squares). In the absence of ultrasound, quercetin
      showed no significant effect on either malignant or nonmalignant
      skin cells after 48 h incubation (Figure 1A, closed circles and
      open circles, respectively; P&gt;0.90 for 50 µM quercetin
      concentration). Similar results were obtained for prostate cancer
      and normal cells (data not shown, P&lt;0.05 for ultrasound,
      followed by quercetin (50 µM) treatment).<br>

      <br>
      Enhancement in quercetin cytotoxicity towards skin cancer cells
      due to ultrasound exposure (defined as the fraction of cells
      killed with ultrasound exposure divided by the fraction of cells
      killed without the use of ultrasound at the same quercetin
      concentration) increased with increasing quercetin concentrations
      (Figure 1B, closed circles; P&lt;0.02 for 50 µM quercetin
      concentration). Ultrasound had no effect on quercetin toxicity
      towards nonmalignant skin cells (Figure 1B, open circles). Tumour
      selectivity (defined as the number of dead cancer cells divided by
      number of total dead cells; for equal number of normal and cancer
      cells treated) as high as 82% was observed. Ultrasound alone had
      no effect on cell viability of either type of skin cells
      (viability of 96±5% for both types of skin cells). The effect of
      ultrasound on quercetin-induced cytotoxicity is clearly due to the
      synergistic activity between the two and not due to the direct
      effect of ultrasound on cell viability.<br>
      <br>
      The LC50 (quercetin concentration necessary to reduce cell
      viability by 50%) for skin cancer cells was also significantly
      reduced by ultrasound pre-exposure (Figure 2A: filled bar – skin
      cancer cells, open bar – nonmalignant skin cells). In the absence
      of ultrasound, LC50 of skin cancer cells was 98 µM. However, a
      single exposure to ultrasound for 60 s reduced LC50 to about 9 µM
      and two further applications of ultrasound 24 h apart reduced LC50
      by 80-fold to about 1.2 µM. LC50 of nonmalignant skin cells was
      not significantly altered (&gt;50 µM in all cases). To assess the
      specificity of synergy between quercetin and ultrasound, similar
      experiments were performed using another drug geldanamycin (a drug
      known to interfere with hsp90 cycle) and ultrasound. Geldanamycin
      alone exhibited cytotoxicity consistent with prior reports (Gan et
      al, 1998); however, no synergistic effect with ultrasound was
      found.<br>

      <br>
      Selective effect of quercetin and ultrasound on skin cancer cells
      was accompanied by an effect on the inducible form of hsp70
      (hsp72), which has long been known to confer protection to cells
      under severe stress (Kiang and Tsokos, 1998) and has been
      identified as a target of quercetin (Hansen et al, 1997). Skin
      cancer cells exhibited higher concentrations of hsp72 (1.8-fold,
      P&lt;0.05) compared to corresponding nonmalignant cells (Figure
      2B, lane 4 vs lane 1). This observation is consistent with the
      generally accepted notion that cancer cells overexpress heat shock
      proteins (Jaattela, 1999; Jolly and Morimoto, 2000; Nylandsted et
      al, 2000). Ultrasound alone or ultrasound+quercetin had minimal
      effect on cellular hsp72 in nonmalignant skin fibroblasts (Figure
      2B, 12% decrease for ultrasound alone, P&gt;0.90, and 22% decrease
      for ultrasound+50 µM quercetin, P&gt;0.76). A combination of
      ultrasound and quercetin (50 µM) induced a significant decrease in
      hsp72 concentration in skin cancer cells (72% decrease, P&lt;0.01,
      Figure 2B). In the same cells, quercetin alone decreased hsp72
      concentration by 31.4% (Figure 2B, lane 7) and ultrasound alone
      decreased hsp72 concentration by 31.7% (Figure 2B, lane 5).<br>
      <br>
      <b>DISCUSSION</b><br>
      <br>
      The effects reported in Figures 1 and ?and22 are unlikely to
      originate from enhanced transport of quercetin by ultrasound.
      Quercetin is a small and slightly lipophilic molecule (molecular
      weight=302 Da, octanol–water partition coefficient, Ko/w~1.2±0.13
      (Brown et al, 1998)) and is expected to diffuse across cell
      membranes at a high rate. Intracellular quercetin concentrations
      are expected to be in equilibrium with extracellular concentration
      even without ultrasound. Moreover, under the conditions used for
      the experiments in this study, a moderate degree of cavitation was
      observed (data not shown) and was not strong enough to induce
      significant membrane permeabilisation (as judged by lack of
      intracellular uptake of calcein under identical conditions), and
      hence incapable of pushing quercetin into cells.<br>
      <br>
      It is not clear at this stage as to how ultrasound selectively
      sensitises cancer cells against quercetin. It is possible that the
      selectivity originates from the effect of quercetin as well as
      ultrasound on stress response. Quercetin has been shown to
      interfere with the stress response and inhibit hsp72 both at
      protein and mRNA levels in certain cells (Hosokawa et al, 1990;
      Elia and Santoro, 1994; Jakubowicz-Gil et al, 2002). Ultrasound,
      being a mild stress, may also induce a stress response in
      mammalian cells. It is possible that the interplay between the
      effect of ultrasound and quercetin on hsp cycle leads to selective
      sensitisation of cancer cells against ultrasound. Whether or not
      other mild stresses, for example, hypoxia, yield similar results
      remains to be seen. Since elevated levels of hsps are broadly
      associated with survival of cancer cells (Burdon, 1987; Lasunskaia
      et al, 1997), chemotherapeutic strategies that target hsps are
      attractive. With further studies focused on in vivo testing and
      mechanistic understanding, this technique may provide a potential
      treatment for the treatment of cancer, especially skin cancer...<br>

      <b>Abstract</b>: Light harvesting components of photosynthetic
      organisms are complex, coupled, many-body quantum systems, in
      which electronic coherence has recently been shown to survive for
      relatively long time scales despite the decohering effects of
      their environments. Within this context, we analyze entanglement
      in multi-chromophoric light harvesting complexes, and establish
      methods for quantification of entanglement by presenting necessary
      and sufficient conditions for entanglement and by deriving a
      measure of global entanglement. These methods are then applied to
      the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) protein to extract the initial
      state and temperature dependencies of entanglement. We show that
      while FMO in natural conditions largely contains bipartite
      entanglement between dimerized chromophores, a small amount of
      long-range and multipartite entanglement exists even at
      physiological temperatures. This constitutes the first rigorous
      quantification of entanglement in a biological system. Finally, we
      discuss the practical utilization of entanglement in densely
      packed molecular aggregates such as light harvesting complexes. <br>
      <br>
      <b>First Evidence of Entanglement in Photosynthesis</b><br>
      <br>
      Room-temperature entanglement seems to be a by-product of the
      process of harvesting light. <br>
      <br>
      Physicists are fascinated with entanglement, the strange quantum
      phenomenon in which distinct objects share the same existence,
      regardless of the distance between them. But in their quest to
      study and exploit entanglement for information processing,
      physicists have found it fragile and easily destroyed. This
      fragility seems to severely limits how entanglement might ever be
      used.<br>
      <br>
      But a new, more robust face of entanglement is beginning to emerge
      from other types of experiment. For example, physicists have
      recently found the signature of entanglement in the thermal states
      of bulk materials at low temperatures. This has huge implications
      for biological systems: if entanglement is more robust than we
      thought, what role might it play in living things?<br>
      <br>
      Now we’re beginning to find out. In the first rigorous
      quantification of entanglement in a biological system, an answer
      is beginning to emerge. Researchers from various institutions in
      Berkeley California have shown that molecules taking part in
      photosynthesis can remain entangled even at ordinary atmospheric
      temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      The evidence comes from detailed study of light sensitive
      molecules called chromophore that harvest light in photosynthesis.<br>
      <br>
      Various studies have shown that in light harvesting complexes,
      chromophores can share coherently delocalised electronic states.
      K. Birgitta Whaley at the Berkeley Center for Quantum Information
      and Computation and pals say this can only happen if the
      chromophores are entangled.<br>
      <br>
      They point out that these molecules do not seem to exploit
      entanglement. Instead, its presence is just a consequence of the
      electronic coherence.<br>
      <br>
      This is a big claim that relies somewhat on circumstantial
      evidence. It’ll be important to get confirmation of these idea
      before they can become mainstream.<br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless, if correct, the discovery has huge implications. For
      a start, biologists could tap into this entanglement to make much
      more accurate measurement of what goes on inside molecules during
      photosynthesis using to the various techniques of quantum
      metrology that physicists have developed.<br>
      <br>
      More exciting still, is the possibility that these molecules could
      be used for quantum information processing at room temperature.
      Imagine photosynthetic quantum computers!<br>
      <br>
      And beyond that is the question that Whaley and co avoid
      altogether. If entanglement plays a role in photosynthesis, then
      why not in other important biological organs too? Anybody think of
      an organ where entanglement might be useful?<br>

        <b>Edward J. O’Reilly, Alexandra Olaya-Castro</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Advancing the debate on quantum effects in light-initiated
      reactions in biology requires clear identification of
      non-classical features that these processes can exhibit and
      utilize. Here we show that in prototype dimers present in a
      variety of photosynthetic antennae, efficient vibration-assisted
      energy transfer in the sub-picosecond timescale and at room
      temperature can manifest and benefit from non-classical
      fluctuations of collective pigment motions. Non-classicality of
      initially thermalized vibrations is induced via coherent
      exciton–vibration interactions and is unambiguously indicated by
      negativities in the phase–space quasi-probability distribution of
      the effective collective mode coupled to the electronic dynamics.
      These quantum effects can be prompted upon incoherent input of
      excitation. Our results therefore suggest that investigation of
      the non-classical properties of vibrational motions assisting
      excitation and charge transport, photoreception and chemical
      sensing processes could be a touchstone for revealing a role for
      non-trivial quantum phenomena in biology.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Eighty percent dietary methionine restriction (MetR) in rodents
      (without calorie restriction), like dietary restriction (DR),
      increases maximum longevity and strongly decreases mitochondrial
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative stress.
      Eighty percent MetR also lowers the degree of membrane fatty acid
      unsaturation in rat liver. Mitochondrial ROS generation and the
      degree of fatty acid unsaturation are the only two known factors
      linking oxidative stress with longevity in vertebrates. However,
      it is unknown whether 40% MetR, the relevant methionine
      restriction degree to clarify the mechanisms of action of standard
      (40%) DR can reproduce these effects in mitochondria from vital
      tissues of strong relevance for aging. Here we study the effect of
      40% MetR on ROS production and oxidative stress in rat brain and
      kidney mitochondria. Male Wistar rats were fed during 7 weeks
      semipurified diets differing only in their methionine content:
      control or 40% MetR diets. It was found that 40% MetR decreases
      mitochondrial ROS production and percent free radical leak (by
      62-71%) at complex I during forward (but not during reverse)
      electron flow in both brain and kidney mitochondria, increases the
      oxidative phosphorylation capacity of brain mitochondria, lowers
      oxidative damage to kidney mitochondrial DNA, and decreases
      specific markers of mitochondrial protein oxidation, lipoxidation,
      and glycoxidation in both tissues. Forty percent MetR also
      decreased the amount of respiratory complexes I, III, and IV and
      apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) in brain mitochondria and complex
      IV in kidney mitochondria, without changing the degree of
      mitochondrial membrane fatty acid unsaturation. Forty percent
      MetR, differing from 80% MetR, did not inhibit the increase in rat
      body weight. These changes are very similar to the ones previously
      found during dietary and protein restriction in rats. We conclude
      that methionine is the only dietary factor responsible for the
      decrease in mitochondrial ROS production and oxidative stress, and
      likely for part of the longevity extension effect, occurring in
      DR.<br>

          Embracing Super-Sized Darkness Inside Via Anti-Resolution</b><br>

      <br>
      Beams of light play a special role in our cultural heritage: World
      War II search lights picking out Nazi bombers, Gotham City’s Bat
      signal summoning help in times of distress and lighthouses warning
      unsuspecting shipping to stay away. Beams of light are beacons of
      safety.<br>
      <br>
      Now film-makers and optical engineers have something much more
      sinister to play with. Chao Wan at the National University of
      Singapore and a few pals have built a “darkness” beam that bathes
      objects in the absence of light.<br>
      <br>
      The new device hides macroscopic objects by beaming invisibility
      from a distance, an entirely different technique to the one used
      in conventional invisibility cloaks that have received much media
      coverage in recent years.<br>
      <br>
      The new device turns the conventional approach to optics on its
      head. Conventionally, optical engineers devise imaging system with
      the best resolving power possible.<br>
      <br>
      The basic idea is that an imaging system focuses light into a
      pattern known as a point spreading function. This consists of a
      central region of high intensity surrounded by a concentric region
      of lower intensity light and a higher intensity lobe beyond this.<br>
      <br>
      Engineers get the best resolution by narrowing and intensifying
      the central region while suppressing the outer lobe. (Indeed, one
      of the more exciting recent developments in imaging is in using
      this technique to resolve objects that are significantly smaller
      than the wavelength of the light being using to create the image,
      a technique known as super-resolution. )<br>
      <br>
      Now Chao and co have taken exactly the opposite approach. Instead
      of narrowing and intensifying the central region at the expense of
      the lobes, these guys intensify the lobes while suppressing the
      central region.<br>
      <br>
      The result is a central region where the field intensity of light
      is essentially zero. This is a region where objects cannot be
      resolved, hence the group’s name for this effect: anti-resolution.<br>
      <br>
      The central region is surrounded by a region of high intensity
      light which acts like a kind of light capsule containing a 3D
      region of darkness. “A three-dimensional object placed in the
      optical capsule does not cause scattering and one can therefore
      see the scene behind the object,” they say.<br>
      <br>
      In effect, it is an invisibility capsule. Chao and co say that the
      region of darkness can be as much as 8 orders of magnitude bigger
      than the wavelength of light used in the imaging process. That’s
      huge!<br>
      <br>
      And the imaging system itself is simple. Chao and co demonstrate
      it using a laser beam passing through a “lens” consisting of
      concentric dielectric grooves that are straightforward to
      manufacture. In their test, they hide an object—a letter ‘N’—that
      is 40 micrometres in size. That’s significantly larger than
      conventional invisibility cloaks could do when they first hit the
      headlines.<br>
      <br>
      Perhaps that’s not surprising given that the new device works in
      an entirely different way from conventional invisibility cloaks.
      These are built using bespoke metamaterials that steer light
      around an object placed inside them. By contrast, Chao and co can
      effectively beam invisibility from a distance.<br>
      <br>
      There are some limitations, however. The current device works at a
      single frequency of light so an interesting challenge will be to
      make broadband lenses that work at a wide range of frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      Beyond that, Chao and co will have to find a killer app for their
      new device. They say it has many potential applications such as in
      cloaking and surveillance but give little detail.<br>
      <br>
      Perhaps imaginative readers of the Physics arXiv Blog can help out
      with suggestions of their in the comments section here.<br>

      A student of the Kazan National Research Technological University,
      Ivan Zakharov, created eco-friendly film, an analogue of the film
      used for the production of plastic bags. The new film dissolves in

      harmless to humans.<br>
      <br>
      "For example, one car produces as much carbon dioxide as 50 tons
      of such bags&nbsp; do," says the student.<br>

      This invention pertains to a method of modifying the reproduction
      rate of cells by exposing the cells to north directional unipolar
      magnetic fields, thereby decreasing the reproduction rate of the
      cells. The reproduction rate of the cells can also be modified by
      exposing them to south directional unipolar magnetic fields,
      thereby increasing the reproduction rate of the cells.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates generally to methods for the modification
      of microbial metabolism using unipolar magnetic fields. In one
      aspect, this invention is directed to the modification of
      microbial metabolism, such as enhancing the microbial activity in
      the biodegradation of contaminated aqueous waste streams. In a
      further aspect, the present invention relates to methods for
      utilizing a unipolar magnetic field under controlled conditions to
      modify the metabolism of microorganisms.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The search for a biological effect due to magnetic fields has a
      long history dating back a hundred years. The literature on
      biomagnetic effects on the growth and development of various
      organisms has been quite extensive showing both positive and
      negative findings. Among the positive findings attributed to
      strong magnetic fields are: altered growth rate, enzyme
      activities, cellular metabolism, DNA synthesis and animal
      orientation.<br>
      <br>
      A wide variety of methods have been reported in the literature
      which are directed to the use of magnetic energy as a diagnostic
      technique and also for the treatment of diseases in warm blooded
      animals including humans. For example, magnetic energy has been
      utilized quite successfully over the past several years to promote
      the formation of osteoblasts in conjunction with the healing of
      bone fractures. In many instances markedly improved results in
      healing times have been achieved by the application of magnetic
      energy to the site of bone fractures and other injuries.<br>
      <br>
      In U.S. Pat. No. 3,337,776, which issued Aug. 22, 1967, there is
      disclosed an apparatus for generating magnetic fields which are
      indicated to be particularly useful for biomedical applications.
      Although the patentee is not specific as to individual
      applications, he does state that magnetic fields generated by the
      apparatus can decrease metabolism and reacts on the spastic
      syndrome.<br>
      <br>
      A magnetic probe is disclosed and claimed in U.S. Pat. No.
      3,664,327 which issued May 23, 1972 and states that the probe can
      be employed in relatively inaccessible locations, such as in body
      cavities of animals to cause relaxation of muscle tissue.<br>
      <br>
      A magnetic medical treatment device is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No.
      3,921,620 which states that the effects of a magnetic field upon a
      living body is dissociated by polarization and induced currents
      and is effective in controlling the sympathetic nervous system.<br>
      <br>
      On May 3, 1977, U.S. Pat. No. 4,020,590 issued to A. R. Davis
      discloses an apparatus and method for treating seeds in a unipolar
      magnetic field. It is indicated in the patent that this treatment
      enhances the germination rate of the seeds, as well as providing
      plants having greater sugar content, increased protein and other
      desirable features.<br>
      <br>
      In U.S. Pat. No. 4,134,935 which issued Jan. 16, 1979 also to A.
      R. Davis, a method is disclosed and claimed which uses magnetic
      fields for clinical examination of animals to determine damaged,
      diseased, abnormal or malfunctioning parts of the body. Changes in
      tensioning and relaxation of the body extremities are an
      indication of body abnormalities.<br>
      <br>
      A method for treating cancer is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No.
      4,622,952 which issued Nov. 18, 1986 and which involves timing an
      electromagnetic energy to the resonant energy absorption
      frequencies of the intracellular structures of the selected cells.
      and then exposing a subject to this tuned electromagnetic energy
      field. The field can also be tuned to the frequency which has been
      calculated to be closest to the resonant frequency of the cancer
      cells and furthest from the normal cells.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,622,953, which issued to the same patentee,
      disclosed the identical procedure for the treatment of
      atherosclerotic lesions. In this process, metabolic and activity
      varying substance such as ferric hydroxide and dextran were
      employed and by applying the proper resonant energy, the heat in
      the diseased cell is increased by an increment sufficient to kill
      the diseased cell but not sufficient to kill normal cells.<br>
      <br>
      In a patent issued to Robert T. Gordon on May 5, 1987, U.S. Pat.
      No. 4,602,359, a process is described and claimed for the
      treatment of cancer in a host organism which comprises providing
      to the host organism minute particles capable of being inductively
      heated and which are of a size which can be absorbed into cancer
      cells. Thereafter the organism is subjected to an alternating
      electromagnetic field to heat the particles at that point in
      metabolic time when the maximum difference in magnetic
      susceptibility between the cancer cells and normal cells within
      the region occurs, and then continuing the inductive heating to
      increase intracellular temperature to selectively kill the cancer
      cells.<br>
      <br>
      Previous developments of directional magnetic fields began in
      1936, when A. R. Davis first discovered that the north and the
      south magnetic pole fields each exhibited unique properties with
      respect to their effects on various forms of life. This discovery
      was slow to be accepted because of investigations by others who
      confused Davis' directional polarities magnetic fields with those
      which are simultaneously emitted by horse shoe type magnets and by
      AC-powered electromagnets. The common belief over the years
      relating to magnets has been that they emanate the same potential
      of type of energy. This belief has been found to be a
      misconception, since the two poles of a magnet are totally
      different in electric potential and effect. Correspondingly, the
      application of the respective poles to living systems has been
      found to produce quite different results. More specifically, it
      has been shown that magnetic energy has an effect on cells such as
      blood cells, nerves, bacteria, et al.<br>
      <br>
      Preliminary investigations regarding biological effects of
      exposure to magnetic fields have indicated a polarity dependence.
      Cells are deemed to be bioelectric in nature, function and
      behavior and studies have indicated that directional magnetic
      fields enhance biological activity. Moreover, due to the
      orientation of such cells and of the metal elements and other ions
      contained therein, the blood cells have been found to decrease
      certain biological effects when exposed to the north pole and to
      increase other biological effects when exposed to the magnetic
      south pole. This same type of reaction has been noted in
      connection with other type cells of the body, it having been
      observed that, as a general matter, the application of north pole
      energies to an existing unhealthy or abnormal condition tends to
      have an arresting, quieting or relaxing effect, to induce an
      overall healing reaction akin to the body's own defense mechanism.
      On the other hand, the application of south pole energies tends to
      have a strengthening, activating effect, which has been found
      useful in treating some abnormal conditions, particularly those
      associated with a slowing or weakening in function. Cancer cells
      exposed to the north field show a significant decrease in the
      number of surviving cells after a period of incubation.
      Conversely, the same type of cells, when exposed to the south
      field, indicated an increase in the number of surviving cells
      compared to the unexposed controls. A more detailed description of
      magnetic pole energies can be found in Davis et al, Magnetism and
      its Effects on the Living System, Acres U.S.A., Kansas City, Mo.
      (1974) and Davis et al, The Magnetic Effect, Acres U.S.A., Kansas
      City, Mo. (1975).<br>
      <br>
      The north pole, which is defined as the north seeking pole, is now
      believed to provide a negative form of energy while the south
      pole, which is defined as the south seeking pole, is believed to
      provide a positive form of energy. It has also been found upon
      examination of the electron paths associated with the fields
      surrounding the respective poles that the south pole end of a
      magnet provides a right hand spin of electrons, i.e., a clockwise
      rotation of electron movement, as contrasted with the north pole
      electron spin, which provides a left hand spin or counterclockwise
      rotation of its electron field.<br>
      <br>
      It has been further observed that the lines of magnetic energy
      leave the south pole to re-enter the magnet at the Bloch Wall
      where the 180 degrees phase takes place, and leave the Bloch Wall
      at that point to go on as the north pole energy to re-enter the
      magnet at its north pole.<br>
      <br>
      Magnetic enhancement or retardation of bacterial or cellular
      growth rates has been reported in the literature. For example,
      Davis and Rawls presented numerous examples of enhancement to
      seeds and various types of cellular growth (Davis, A. R. &amp;
      Rawls, Jr., W. C., Magnetism and its Effects on the Living System,
      Acres, U.S.A., Kansas City, Mo., 1974). Bornstein reported
      magnetic inhibition of bacterial growth in burn wounds (Bornstein,
      L. A., in Argosy, June, 1968). Investigations sponsored by
      Bio-Magnetics Systems, Inc. have shown that unidirectional
      magnetic fields inhibited or increased the growth of cancer cells,
      depending on the field polarity, as disclosed by A. Trappier et
      al., in Evolving Perspectives On The Exposure Risks From Magnetic
      Fields, Journal of Nat. Med. Assoc., 82:621-624, September 1990.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      In its broad aspect, this invention is directed to a method for
      the modification of microbial metabolism through the use of
      unipolar magnetic fields. In general, the method comprises
      exposing microbes to a unipolar magnetic field with gauss
      concentrations sufficient to effect microbial metabolism.<br>
      <br>
      Bioremediation processes, in which microbes are used to repair
      ecological damage, are under development at the Environmental
      Protection Agency and elsewhere to treat a range of contaminants
      including aromatic solvents, polychlorobiphenyls,
      trichloroethylene, petroleum hydrocarbons and other organic
      constituents. The use of unipolar magnetic fields has the
      potential for enhancing the applicability and cost-effectiveness
      of bioremediation for the treatment of contaminated groundwater
      and contaminated soil. Specifically, it has now been found that
      the application of unipolar magnetic fields enhances microbial
      activity and will result in increasing the efficiency and rate of
      bioremediation, and proportionally decreasing the time required to
      meet cleanup goals. Thus, the unipolar magnetic field technology
      can save significant remediation costs at those toxic waste sites
      amenable to biological degradation. In addition, this technology
      can provide an integrated process for remediation. Such an
      integrated process can be based upon pump, treat, reinjection
      and/or direct application of magnetic field to the vadose zone to
      stimulate in situ biodegradation.<br>
      <br>
      The method of modifying cells by exposing the cells to directional
      unipolar magnetic fields is also disclosed. The reproduction rate
      is increased when exposed to a south magnetic field, and decreased
      when exposed to a north magnetic field. The modification also
      applies to cells which derive energy for reproduction through
      fermentation. The modification can be either intracellular or
      modification is through the cell wall and the modification is
      retained within the cell.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, one or more of the following objects will be achieved
      by the practice of this invention. It is an object of this
      invention to amplify or otherwise modify microbial metabolism and
      thereby enhance a process which employees microbes. These and
      other objects will readily become apparent to those skilled in the
      art in the light of the teachings therein set forth...<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      In its broad aspect, the present invention is directed to the
      modification of microbial metabolism by the application thereto of
      unipolar magnetic energy, i.e., the energy, north or south,
      emanating from a single pole of a magnet, under specific
      conditions to achieve the modification. The term modification is
      used herein to indicate an increase or decrease in the rate and/or
      efficiency of metabolism...<br>
      <br>
      This invention modifies microbial metabolism using directional
      unipolar magnetic fields. Laboratory experiments have shown that
      south pole magnetic fields increase the rate of dissimilation in
      simulated bioremediation processes whereas north pole magnetic
      fields inhibit the rate of dissimilation (comparing to a control
      consisting of no magnetic fields).<br>
      <br>
      Magnetically enhanced bioremediation is one area of application of
      the invention. Bioremediation is a process by which the use of
      living organisms, in conjunction with or independent from other
      technologies, is employed to decontaminate a polluted system. In
      bioremediation, contaminants are destroyed by the action of
      microbes such as soil bacteria...<br>
      <br>
      Table 1 presents the results of these experiments. When the south
      pole magnetic energy was applied, biological oxidation rate was
      increased by a factor of two compared to the control run without
      magnetic energy present (from 0.656 to 1.545).<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 shows the effect of magnetic fields on the rate of oxygen
      consumption. It can be seen that the rate increased dramatically
      after 4 days of directional south pole magnetic field exposure as
      compared to north pole magnetic field exposure or control.<br>
      <br>
      Results obtained from studies under the influence of north pole,
      south pole and during the control run are tabulated in Table 1. It
      can be seen that the highest average rate of phenol biodegradation
      and oxygen consumption is found during the run when south pole is
      attached to the bioreactor. When the magnetic south pole was
      applied, it increased the biological oxidation activity (oxygen
      consumption rate) by a factor of two as compared to the control
      run without magnetic field (from 0.7 to 1.5). FIG. 3 shows the
      effect of magnetic field on the rate of O2 consumption. It can be
      seen that the rate increases dramatically after 4 days under the
      influence of south pole as compared to the control and north. One
      of the measures of biodegradation is the increase in activity that
      is the rate of oxygen consumption by the microbes in presence of a
      substrate like phenol. An increase in oxygen consumption indicates
      that it is being utilized by the microorganisms to break down
      phenol into its metabolic products which ultimately are CO2 and
      water.<br>
      <br>
      The phenol consumption rate is faster by nearly 30% in case of the
      run with the south pole as compared to the control run.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 indicates that the phenol concentration goes down rapidly
      under the influence of south pole comparison to the north pole and
      the control. These observations are consistent with those from the
      rate of oxygen consumption monitoring.<br>
      <br>
      Significant amounts of protein build-up in the liquid phase
      verified that biological activity was enhanced when magnetic south
      pole was applied to the system as compared to the control as shown
      in FIG. 5. Microorganisms release enzymes extracellularly which in
      turn attack the substrate. A higher amount of proteins in the
      reaction medium is a positive measure of biodegradation. FIG. 5
      indicates that the south pole magnetic field greatly enhanced the
      concentration of protein in this reactor (protein is produced from
      phenol degradation). In this experiment it was observed that the
      pH changed from 7.9 to 8.5.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 shows the effect of repeatedly changing the south pole
      magnetic field to a north pole magnetic field and a north pole
      magnetic field to a south pole magnetic field in the bioreactor.
      The south pole field was consistently activating whereas the north
      pole field was inhibitory.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 and 8 show the effect of magnetic field on the rate of
      biodegradation and protein concentration under 1500 and 3500 gauss
      magnetic south pole. The highest rate of biodegradation is 25.6
      ppm/h and the highest protein concentration8s 2250 ug/ml after 11
      days under 1500 gauss.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9 shows the effect of magnetic field on the rate of O2
      consumption. It indicates that the highest rate of O2 consumption
      is 1649 nmol/ml*hr after 10 days under the influence of 1500 gauss
      magnetic south pole...<br>
      <br>
      EXAMPLE 3<br>
      <br>
      A polyester copolymer of hydroxybutric acid and hydroxyvaleric
      acid (PHBV) is produced by bacteria in a reactor by fermenting a
      carbon source as shown in FIG. 10. When a bacteria such as
      Alcaligenes eutrophus is depleted of the nitrogen it requires to
      multiply, growth is inhibited. The carbon source, such as glucose,
      can then be added to the fermenter, causing the organism to make
      granules of polyester with the abundant carbon instead of using it
      to grow. The conventional process is so slow as to be economically
      unfeasible. The process is repeated with the exception that a
      south unipolar magnetic field is applied to the organism during
      the glucose fermenation step. The rate of fermentation will be
      substantially enhanced.<br>
      <br>
      The effects of unipole application is further applicable in the
      field of biology. The application of a south magnetic field speeds
      up the reproduction of cells, while the north field slows
      reproduction.<br>
      <br>
      Fermentation, a simple, anaerobic method to generate energy in the
      cell, is commonly used in yeast products and to produce alcholoic
      beverages. Carbohydrate molecules breakdown into simpler molecules
      such as ethyl alcohol, lactic acid, or carbon dioxide, releasing
      energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). An applied
      south field dramatically speeds up the fermentation process.
      Chemostats, with their controlled environment, are ideal rapid,
      mass reproduction of cells, through fermentation, in combination
      with a unipolar magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the magnetic fields influence the growth rate of the
      aerobically reproduced cells. The application of a south magnetic
      field increases the production of enzymes without fracturing the
      cells. The permeability of the cell walls is increased which
      allows for the influx and efflux of enzymes.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetic fields affect the cells either of two ways. The first
      is through the cell wall and would include the production and
      expression of proteins, such as enzymes, insulin and other
      hormones, interferons and antibiotics. The second is affecting the
      cells intracellularly and retained the affect within the cell. The
      appropriate magnetic field is applied for a time period and an
      intensity which is based on the recepient of the field, the medium
      and the desired end result. Examples would be many new drugs under
      evaluation for their effectiveness against cancer and aids.<br>
      <br>
      Although research has been done on the affects of magnetism in
      both fermentation and other biological processes, they have used
      bipolar, complex or rotating fields. The instant invention relates
      to the consistent use of either a north or south magnetic field to
      produce a desired result. Thus, the cell reproduction can be
      decreased or increased dependent on the requirements.<br>
      <br>
      Although the invention has been illustrated by the foregoing
      examples, it is not to be considered as being limited to the
      materials and processes employed therein, but rather, the
      invention relates to the generic area as herein before disclosed.
      Various modifications can be made without departing from the
      spirit or scope thereof.<br>

      A method is provided for focusing magnetic fields, reducing
      magnetic fields and shielding animate or inanimate subjects from
      magnetic fields. Further a media which has been subjected to a
      shielded or focused magnetic field is applied to a subject, as for
      example, topically. The method, in part, interposes between the
      subjects and the source of a magnetic field, at least one second
      magnetic field disposed in such a manner that the polarity of the
      second magnetic field cancels or at least partially neutralizes
      the magnetic strength of the first magnetic field. The second
      magnetic field can also be disposed so as to permit only a portion
      of the first magnetic field to escape shielding and thereby
      focused in a predetermined direction. Devices which normally emit
      magnetic energy and containing the shielding of the present
      invention are also provided.<br>

      <br>
      A gas proven deadly in chemical weapons could one day be used to
      put people into life-saving suspended animation.<br>
      <br>
      While hydrogen sulfide is toxic in large doses, small amounts of
      the gas have the potential to make animals appear dead for a while
      then allow them to wake up unharmed, according to biochemist Mark
      Roth.<br>
      <br>
      "In the future an emergency medical technician might give hydrogen
      sulfide to someone suffering serious injuries and they might
      become a little more immortal giving them time to get the care
      they need."<br>
      <br>
      Roth found that hydrogen sulfide in bonds in spots in bodies that
      would usually be occupied by oxygen, ostensibly becoming a sort of
      dimmer switch for metabolism. "We did it with a mouse; this was
      cosmic," Roth said.<br>
      <br>
      "We found a way to do this with a mammal. All you had to do was
      put it in room temperature and it was no worse for the wear."
      Roth's lab has completed early phase human trials but hasn't
      actually tried the process in a person. <br>

      <div align="center"><b>Metabolic Flexibility and Suspended
          Animation</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Our work in suspended animation derives from the fact that many
      animals exhibit what we call "metabolic flexibility," the ability
      to dial down their respiration and heartbeat and, in effect, "turn
      themselves off" in response to physical or environmental stress.
      Mammalian examples include hibernation — from ground squirrels to
      bears — as well as estivation (quiescence in response to heat) and
      embryonic diapause, a pause in embryonic development found in
      about 70 species of mammals. Meanwhile, many invertebrates can go
      dormant for days, months, and even years before reanimating.
      Finally, germ and somatic stem cells are well known to exit the
      cell cycle for extended periods of time and to re-enter only when
      it is favorable for the organism.<br>
      <br>
      Our approach to understanding this flexibility has been to develop
      the means to stop animals for given periods of time and then
      reanimate them to normal function. We use the term suspended
      animation to refer to a state where all observable life processes
      (using high resolution light microscopy) are stopped: the animals
      do not move nor breathe and the heart does not beat. We have found
      that we are able to put a number of animals (yeast, nematodes,
      drosophila, frogs, and zebrafish) into a state of suspended
      animation for up to 24 hours through one basic technique: reducing
      the concentration of oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      By examining the precise oxygen tensions needed to induce
      suspended animation, we also found discrete and lethal oxygen
      tensions exist just above the oxygen level that enables suspended
      animation. In other words, there is a range of oxygen levels that
      is too low to support life, but going below that causes the
      animals to suspend. We hypothesized that perhaps we could prevent
      death in low oxygen situations by adding agents that effectively
      inhibit oxygen utilization and induce suspended animation.<br>
      <br>
      Carbon monoxide, a well-known gas, is extremely toxic because it
      does exactly that: binds to sites where oxygen binds in the body.
      We found that we can successfully put nematodes into a state of
      suspended animation using carbon monoxide, and these results with
      invertebrate systems encouraged us to explore other systems and
      agents.<br>
      <br>
      Using another highly toxic gas, hydrogen sulfide, we found we can
      reversibly reduce the metabolic rate of mice: exposed to 80 ppm of
      hydrogen sulfide, mice enter into what we call a
      "hibernation-like" state, where their core temperature can be
      reduced as much as 11 degrees and their metabolic rate as judged
      by carbon dioxide production and oxygen consumption drops 10-fold.
      We've kept the animals in this state for 6 hours and they recover
      completely.<br>
      <br>
      Our success in altering the metabolic rate of these mammals has
      given us the tools to pursue several promising lines of research,
      including whether it might be possible to 'suspend' human organs
      (for transplant) or to 'buy time' for human patients in trauma.<br>

          Hypoxia-inducible Factor-1 Activity Independently of von
          Hippel–Lindau Tumor Suppressor-1 in C. elegans</b><br>
        <b>Mark W. Budde and Mark B. Roth</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>&nbsp;</b><br>
      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Rapid alteration of gene expression in response to environmental
      changes is essential for normal development and behavior. The
      transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 is well
      known to respond to alterations in oxygen availability. In nature,
      low oxygen environments are often found to contain high levels of
      hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Here, we show that Caenorhabditis elegans
      can have mutually exclusive responses to H2S and hypoxia, both
      involving HIF-1. Specifically, H2S results in HIF-1 activity
      throughout the hypodermis, whereas hypoxia causes HIF-1 activity
      in the gut as judged by a reporter for HIF-1 activity. C. elegans
      require hif-1 to survive in room air containing trace amounts of
      H2S. Exposure to H2S results in HIF-1 nuclear localization and
      transcription of HIF-1 targets. The effects of H2S on HIF-1
      reporter activity are independent of von Hippel–Lindau tumor
      suppressor (VHL)-1, whereas VHL-1 is required for hypoxic
      regulation of HIF-1 reporter activity. Because H2S is naturally
      produced by animal cells, our results suggest that endogenous H2S
      may influence HIF-1 activity.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>
      <br>
      In nature, oxygen and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) together create redox
      environments in which eukaryotes thrive (Fenchel and Finlay, 1995
      blue right-pointing triangle). In fiords, for example, ciliates
      and flagellates are most abundant at depths containing chemically
      reactive mixtures of oxygen and H2S. In the terrestrial
      atmosphere, where oxygen is abundant, animal cells produce H2S
      (Stipanuk and Beck, 1982 blue right-pointing triangle). Although
      the role of endogenous H2S is unclear, exposure to exogenous H2S
      has profound physiological effects including improved outcome
      after myocardial infarction in mammals (Elrod et al., 2007 blue
      right-pointing triangle; Simon et al., 2008 blue right-pointing
      triangle) and increased life span in nematodes (Miller and Roth,
      2007 blue right-pointing triangle).<br>
      <br>
      Mice exposed to trace amounts of H2S consume 10-fold less oxygen
      and exhibit a corresponding reduction in basal metabolic rate
      (Blackstone et al., 2005 blue right-pointing triangle). Treatment
      with H2S also improves survival of mice in hypoxia (Blackstone and
      Roth, 2007 blue right-pointing triangle). The response to hypoxia
      is coordinated by the evolutionarily conserved transcription
      factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 (Semenza, 2004 blue
      right-pointing triangle). First identified as the protein
      responsible for the hypoxia-dependent transcription of
      erythropoietin (Wang and Semenza, 1993 blue right-pointing
      triangle), HIF-1 activity increases as a function of decreasing
      oxygen levels. The activity of HIF-1 is contingent upon escaping
      degradation (Huang et al., 1998 blue right-pointing triangle),
      nuclear localization (Wang and Semenza, 1993 blue right-pointing
      triangle), and coactivator binding (Arany et al., 1996 blue
      right-pointing triangle). Degradation of HIF-1 is mediated by an
      oxygen-dependent hydroxylation event and subsequent
      ubiquitin-dependent degradation (Epstein et al., 2001 blue
      right-pointing triangle). In C. elegans, the enzymes regulating
      these events are the EGg Laying defective (EGL)-9 prolyl
      hydroxylase and the von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL)-1
      ubiquitin ligase, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      Here, we use C. elegans to study the influence of H2S on HIF-1. We
      find that hif-1 is required when nematodes are exposed to H2S. In
      addition, an elevated level of HIF-1 activity dramatically
      increases the maximum tolerable concentration of H2S. We show both
      H2S and hypoxia cause an increase of both HIF-1 protein
      concentration and nuclear localization throughout the animal.
      However, H2S and hypoxia treatments are distinct, with different
      patterns of HIF-1 transcriptional activity and H2S can activate
      HIF-1 in the absence of vhl-1...<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      RESULTS<br>
      <br>
      Survival of C. elegans in H2S<br>
      <br>
      We exposed C. elegans to atmospheres containing H2S in room air
      for 24 h. Animals either survived, seemed healthy, and were
      indistinguishable from untreated animals, or they died; sickly
      animals were not observed. Survival was dose dependent, with
      wild-type worms surviving 50 ppm H2S but not 150 ppm H2S.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hif-1 Mediates Survival of Worms in Hydrogen Sulfide</b><br>
      <br>
      C. elegans has a single conserved homologue of mammalian
      hypoxia-inducible factor a subunit, hif-1 (Jiang et al., 2001 blue
      right-pointing triangle). Animals with the hif-1(ia04) null
      mutation seem normal and are viable in normal culture conditions,
      but they display reduced embryonic and larval viability in hypoxia
      compared with wild-type animals (Jiang et al., 2001 blue
      right-pointing triangle; Padilla et al., 2002 blue right-pointing
      triangle; Nystul et al., 2003 blue right-pointing triangle). We
      observed that hif-1(ia04) worms cannot survive exposure to 15 ppm
      H2S (Table 1). In contrast, even at 50 ppm H2S, wild-type worms
      survive with high viability and no obvious changes on growth rate
      or morphology (Miller and Roth, 2007 blue right-pointing
      triangle). These results indicate that HIF-1 is necessary for
      responding appropriately to H2S...<br>
      <br>
      <b>DISCUSSION</b><br>
      <br>
      Increased H2S or decreased oxygen both constitute a net change in
      the redox balance to which cells are exposed. We have shown that
      nematodes rapidly respond to changes in H2S by HIF-1 activation.
      HIF-1 is also activated by decreased oxygen, which suggests that
      HIF-1 is important in coordinating the response to changes in
      environmental and organismal redox balance. Our results
      demonstrate that vhl-1 is not required for H2S-dependent increase
      in HIF-1 target gene expression. Previous studies in mammals show
      that the hypoxic HIF-1 response does require VHL (Iliopoulos et
      al., 1996 blue right-pointing triangle), suggesting that cells
      have multiple ways of activating the HIF responses.<br>
      <br>
      Increased HIF-1 activity is positively correlated with survival of
      nematodes exposed to H2S. C. elegans exposed to low levels of H2S
      absolutely require hif-1, and increased levels of HIF-1 facilitate
      quantal survival in otherwise lethal concentrations of H2S. Hif-1
      mutants are sensitive to H2S concentrations that have no effect on
      wild type (15 ppm). Furthermore, egl-9 and vhl-1 mutants have
      increased HIF-1 levels and can survive higher concentrations of
      hydrogen sulfide than wild type. Egl-9 mutant animals show
      elevated HIF-1 reporter activity compared with vhl-1 mutants
      worms, consistent with the finding that egl-9 mutant worms can
      tolerate higher H2S concentrations than vhl-1 mutant worms. The
      increased survival of egl-9 mutant worms in H2S is reminiscent of
      previous work which showed that a mutation in egl-9 protects
      nematodes from cyanide toxicity (Darby et al., 1999 blue
      right-pointing triangle; Gallagher and Manoil, 2001 blue
      right-pointing triangle). Both sulfide and cyanide disrupt
      cellular respiration as noncompetitive inhibitors of cytochrome
      oxidase (Cooper and Brown, 2008 blue right-pointing triangle).
      Thus, it is plausible that HIF-1 helps overcome the toxicity by
      relieving the stress of impeded cytochrome oxidase activity.
      Indeed, HIF-1 has been shown to increase expression of genes
      encoding glycolytic enzymes (Chen et al., 2001 blue right-pointing
      triangle; Minchenko et al., 2002 blue right-pointing triangle;
      Obach et al., 2004 blue right-pointing triangle) as well as to
      down-regulate tricarboxylic acid cycle entry and oxygen
      consumption in mammals (Papandreou et al., 2006 blue
      right-pointing triangle).<br>
      <br>
      The H2S-induced expression of a reporter for HIF-1 activity does
      not require vhl-1 but does require egl-9. This is in contrast to
      the increase of HIF-1 protein levels observed in both mutant
      backgrounds. This suggests that H2S may be involved in two steps
      of HIF-1 activation: protein stabilization and transcriptional
      activation. A recent article demonstrated the existence of an
      alternative HIF-1 regulatory pathway in C. elegans (Shen et al.,
      2006 blue right-pointing triangle). This pathway does not require
      vhl-1 but does require egl-9 and a novel protein, regulator of
      hypoxia-inducible factor (rhy-1). The exact function of rhy-1
      remains obscure, but perhaps it is important for responding to
      nonhypoxic impediments of the respiratory chain. In addition,
      VHL-independent, EGLN1-dependent HIF regulation has been noted in
      mammalian cells (Ozer et al., 2005 blue right-pointing triangle;
      To and Huang, 2005 blue right-pointing triangle); thus, it will be
      interesting to investigate the potential for H2S induction of
      HIF-1 activity in higher organisms.<br>
      <br>
      We observed that hypoxia and sulfide treatment result in different
      expression patterns of expression of a reporter for HIF-1
      activity. One possibility for the differences observed is that the
      gut is more easily made hypoxic and the hypodermis is more easily
      exposed to H2S. This model would predict that increasing the
      severity of hypoxia should increase the tissue with detectable
      HIF-1 activity. We were unable to find any concentrations of O2,
      including anoxia, which would result in HIF-1 activity detected in
      more tissues. Likewise, increasing the concentration of H2S also
      failed to increase HIF-1 activity in additional tissues. Also, the
      near perfect overlap of HIF-1 activity in hypoxia and vhl-1 null
      animals argues that the observed differences reflect something
      intrinsic to the tissue, perhaps involving additional
      transcription factors.<br>
      <br>
      Organisms survive transitions to new environments by changing
      their physiology to be better suited to the new environment,
      referred to here as acclimation. Acclimation to nonlethal
      environmental changes is known to improve the ability to survive
      otherwise lethal exposure to the same agent. For example,
      acclimation of nematodes to low concentrations of salt allows them
      survive subsequent exposure to high salt concentrations that are
      lethal for naïve animals (Lamitina et al., 2004 blue
      right-pointing triangle). We suggest that HIF-1 may be involved in
      acclimation to H2S containing environments. Wild-type nematodes
      acclimated to a sub-lethal concentration of H2S (50 ppm), are able
      to withstand a 10-fold increase in H2S concentration (500 ppm)
      that would kill all naïve animals. This is concordant with the
      increase in HIF-1 activity observed and suggests that HIF-1
      activity may be essential for the acclimation to H2S.<br>
      <br>
      Here, we have shown that H2S exposure increases HIF-1 activity and
      increases tolerance of further H2S exposure. This is reminiscent
      of investigations into hypoxia preconditioning, in which brief
      exposure to hypoxia increases HIF-1 activity and protects against
      subsequent hypoxia. We now know that animals produce H2S in a
      regulated manner and that the resultant sulfide is physiologically
      important (Kamoun, 2004 blue right-pointing triangle). In fact,
      endogenous H2S production has been suggested to be important
      during hypoxia preconditioning (Bian et al., 2006 blue
      right-pointing triangle). In addition, several recent studies have
      described a protective role of H2S with respect to hypoxia
      (Blackstone and Roth, 2007 blue right-pointing triangle),
      hemorrhage (Morrison et al., 2008 blue right-pointing triangle),
      and reperfusion injury (Elrod et al., 2007 blue right-pointing
      triangle). It has been shown that overexpression of a
      sulfide-generating enzyme, cystathionine gamma lyase, results in
      cardiac protection, suggesting a protective effect of endogenous
      H2S (Elrod et al., 2007 blue right-pointing triangle). Although
      all of these studies implicate H2S as a potentially useful
      therapeutic, the mechanism of action remains ill defined. Other
      studies have shown that increased HIF-1 levels also provide
      protection against reperfusion injury, and the data provided here
      provide a possible link between these phenomena.<br>

      <br>
      The orderly progression through the cell division cycle is of
      paramount importance to all organisms, as improper progression
      through the cycle could result in defects with grave consequences.
      Previously, our lab has shown that model eukaryotes such as
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Danio rerio
      all retain high viability after prolonged arrest in a state of
      anoxia-induced suspended animation, implying that in such a state,
      progression through the cell division cycle is reversibly arrested
      in an orderly manner. Here, we show that S. cerevisiae (both
      wild-type and several cold-sensitive strains) and C. elegans
      embryos exhibit a dramatic decrease in viability that is
      associated with dysregulation of the cell cycle when exposed to
      low temperatures. Further, we find that when the yeast or worms
      are first transitioned into a state of anoxia-induced suspended
      animation before cold exposure, the associated cold-induced
      viability defects are largely abrogated. We present evidence that
      by imposing an anoxia-induced reversible arrest of the cell cycle,
      the cells are prevented from engaging in aberrant cell cycle
      events in the cold, thus allowing the organisms to avoid the
      lethality that would have occurred in a cold, oxygenated
      environment.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention concerns the use of oxygen antagonists for
      inducing stasis in cells, tissues, and/or organs in vivo or in an
      organism overall. It includes methods and apparatuses for
      achieving stasis in any of these biological materials, so as to
      preserve and/or protect them. In specific embodiments, therapeutic
      methods and apparatuses for organ transplantation, hyperthermia,
      wound healing, hemorrhagic shock, cardioplegia for bypass surgery,
      neurodegeneration, hypothermia, and cancer is provided.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally
      to the field of cell biology. More particularly, it concerns
      methods and apparatuses for inducing stasis in cells, tissues,
      organs, and organisms using a substance that competes with oxygen.
      In certain embodiments, there are methods and apparatuses for
      treating, preventing, and diagnosing diseases and conditions in a
      subject exposed to an oxygen antagonist.<br>
      <br>
      2. Description of Related Art Stasis is a latin term meaning
      "standstill." In the context of stasis in living tissues, the most
      common fonus of stasis relate to the preservation of tissues for
      transplant or reattachment.<br>
      Typically, such tissues are immersed in a physiologic fluid, such
      as saline, and placed in the cold to reduce biochemical processes
      leading to cellular damage. This stasis is incomplete and cannot
      be relied upon for extended periods. In fact, the success of organ
      transplant and limb reattachments is inversely related to the time
      the organ or limb is out of contact with the intact organism.<br>
      <br>
      A more extreme version of stasis involves placing an entire
      organism into what is known colloquially as "suspended animation."
      Though still considered largely within the realm of science
      fiction, some notoriety has been achieved when wealthy individuals
      have sought to be cryopreserved after death in the hopes that
      future medical breakthroughs will permit their revival, and cure
      of their fatal ailments. Allegedly, more than one hundred people
      have been cryopreserved since the first attempt in 1967, and more
      than one thousand people have made legal and financial
      arrangements for cryonics with one of several organizations, for
      example, Alcor Life Extension Foundation. Such methods involve the
      administration of anti-ischemic drugs, low temperature
      preservation, and methods to perfuse whole organisms with
      cryosuspension fluids. It has not yet been substantiated that this
      form of.organismal stasis is reversible.<br>
      <br>
      The utility of inducing stasis in biological matter as
      contemplated by the compositions, methods or articles of
      manufacture described herein, is characterized by induction or
      onset of stasis followed by a period of time in which the stasis
      is maintained, followed then by reversion [0 to a normal or near
      normal physiological state, or a state that one skilled in the art
      would recognize as a state that is better than the state of the
      biological matter had it never undergone stasis, in whole or in
      part Stasis can also be defined as what it is not. Organismal
      stasis is not any of the following states: sleep, comatose, death,
      anesthetized, or grand mal seizure.<br>
      <br>
      There are numerous reports of individuals who have survived
      apparent cessation of pulse and respiration after exposure to
      hypothermic conditions, usually in cold-water immersion.<br>
      <br>
      Though not fully understood by scientists, the ability to survive
      such situations likely derives from what is called the "mammalian
      diving reflex." This reflex is believed to stimulate the iragal
      nervous system, which controls the lungs, heart, larynx and
      esophagus, in order to protect vital ?0 organs. Presumably,
      cold-water stimulation of nerve receptors on the skin causes
      shunting of blood to the brain and to the heart, and away from the
      skin, the gastro-intestinal tract and extremities. At the same
      time, a protective reflex bradycardia, or slowing the heart beat,
      conserves the dwindling oxygen supplies within the body.
      Unfortunately, the expression of this reflex is not the same in
      all people, and is believed to be a factor in only 10-20% percent
      of cold water inunersion cases.<br>
      <br>
      Compositions and methods that do not rely fully or at all on
      hypothermia and/or oxygen may be useful in the context of organ
      preservation, as well as for tissue or cell preservation. Cells
      and tissue are currently preserved using hypothermia, frequently
      at temperatures substantially below freezing, such as in liquid
      nitrogen. However, dependence on temperature can be problematic,
      as apparatuses and agents for producing such low temperatures may
      not be readily available when needed or they may require
      replacement. For example, tissue culture cells are often stored
      for periods of time in tanks that hold liquid nitrogen; however,
      these tanks frequently require that the liquid nitrogen in the
      unit be periodically replaced, otherwise it becomes depleted and
      the temperature is not maintained. Furthermore, damage to cells
      and tissue occurs as a result of the freeze/thaw process. Thus,
      improved techniques are needed.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the lack of ability to control cellular and physiologic
      metabolism in whole organisms subjected to traumas such as
      amputation and hypothermia is a key shortcoming in the medical
      field. On the other hand, the anecdotal evidence discussed above
      strongly suggests that if properly understood and regulated, it is
      possible to induce stasis in cells, tissues and whole organisms.
      Thus, there is a great need for improved methods for controlling
      metabolic processes under traumatic conditions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </b><br>
      <br>
      Therefore, the present invention provides methods, compositions,
      articles of manufacture, and apparatuses to induce stasis in
      cells, tissues and organs located within or derived from an
      organism, as well as in the organism itself. Such methods
      compositions, articles of manufacture, and apparatuses can be
      employed to protect biological matter, as well as to prevent,
      treat, or diagnose diseases and conditions in the organism.
      Details of such applications and other uses are described below.
      The invention is based on studies with compounds that were
      determined to have a protective function, and thus, serve as
      protective agents. Moreover, the overall results of studies
      involving different compounds indicate that compounds with an
      available electron donor center are particularly effective in
      inducing stasis. In addition, these compounds induce reversible
      stasis, meaning they are not so toxic to the particular biologic
      matter that the matter dies or decomposes.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention involves exposing biological matter to an
      amount of an agent, so as to achieve stasis of the biological
      matter. In some embodiments, the present invention concerns
      methods for inducing stasis in in vivo biological matter
      comprising: a) identifying an organism in which stasis is desired;
      and, b) exposing the organism to an effective amount of an oxygen
      antagonist to induce stasis in the in vivo biological matter.
      Inducing "stasis" in biological matter means that the matter is
      alive but is characterized by one or more of the following: at
      least a two fold reduction in the rate or amount of carbon dioxide
      production by the biological matter; at least a two-fold reduction
      in the rate or amount of oxygen consumption by the biological
      matter; and at least a 10% decrease in movement or motility
      (applies only to cells or tissue that move, ) such as sperm cells
      or a heart or a limb, or when stasis is induced in the entire
      organism) (collectively referred to as "cellular respiration
      indicators"). In methods of the invention, stasis is temporary
      and/or reversible, meaning that the biological matter no longer
      exhibits the characteristics of stasis at some later point in
      time...<br>
      <br>
      Thus, in some embodiments an oxygen antagonist inhibits or reduces
      the amount of cellular Z5 respiration occurring in the cells, for
      instance, by binding sites on cytochrome e oxidase that would
      otherwise bind to oxygen. Cytochrome c oxidase specifically binds
      oxygen and then converts it to water. Preferably, the binding to
      cytochrome oxidase c by the oxygen antagonist is specific. In some
      embodiments, such binding to cytochrome c oxidase is preferably
      releasable and reversible binding (e.g., has an in vitro
      dissociation constant, Kd, of at least 10-2, 10-, or 104 0 M, and
      has an in vitro dissociation constant, Kd, not greater than 10-,
      10, 10, 109 , 10-, or 10 M). In some embodiments, an oxygen
      antagonist is evaluated by measuring ATP and/or carbon dioxide
      output...<br>
      <br>
      For example, the biological matter may be exposed to a first
      oxygen antagonist and then exposed to a second oxygen antagonist.
      Alternatively, biological matter may be exposed to more than one
      oxygen antagonists at the same time or in an overlapping manner.
      Furthermore, it is contemplated that more than one oxygen
      antagonist may be comprised or mixed together, such 0 as in a
      single composition to which biological matter is exposed.<br>
      Methods and apparatuses of the invention involve a protective
      agent, that in some embodiments is an oxygen antagonist. In still
      farther embodiments, the oxygen antagonist is a 9 reducing agent.
      Additionally, the oxygen antagonist can be characterized as a
      chalcogenide compound.<br>
      <br>
      In certain embodiments, the chalcogenide compound comprises
      sulfur, while in others, it comprises selenium, tellurium, or
      polonium. In certain embodiments, a chalcogenide compound contains
      one or more exposed sulfide groups. It is contemplated that this
      chalcogenide compounds contains 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more exposed
      sulfide groups, or any range derivable therein. In particular
      embodiments, such a sulfide-containing compound is CS2 (carbon
      disulfide)...<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, in some methods of the invention, stasis is induced in
      cell(s) by exposing the cell(s) to a reducing agent that has a
      chemical structure of Rin R2m Xp wherein X is N, 0, Po, S, Se, or
      Te;<br>
      wherein Y is N or 0;<br>
      wherein R1 is H, C, lower alkyl, a lower alcohol, or CN;<br>
      wherein R 2 is H, C, lower alkyl, or a lower alcohol, or CN;<br>
      wherein n is 0 or 1;<br>
      wherein m is 0 or 1;<br>
      wherein k is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4; and, wherein p is I or 2...<br>
      <br>
      In still further embodiments, the reducing agent structure
      compound is selected from the 0 group consisting of H2S, H2Se,
      H2Te, and H2Po. In some cases, the reducing agent structure has an
      X that is an S. In others, X is Se, or X is Te, or X is Po, or X
      is 0. Furthermore, k in the reducing agent structure is 0 or 1 in
      some embodiments. In certain embodiments, the reducing agent
      structure compound is diniethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylsulfide
      (DMS), carbon monoxide, methylmercaptan (CH 3SH), mercaptoethanol,
      thiocyanate, hydrogen cyanide, methanethiol (MeSH), or CS2 .
      In-particular embodiments, the oxygen antagonist is H2S, H2Se, CS
      2, MeSH, or DMS. Compounds on the order of the size of these
      molecules are particularly contemplated (that is, within 50% of
      the average of their molecular weights).<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, it will be generally understood that any compound
      discussed herein as an oxygen antagonist can be provided in
      prodrug form to the biological matter, meaning that the biological
      matter or other substance(s) in the environment of the biological
      matter alters the prodrug into its active form, that is, into an
      oxygen antagonist.<br>
      <br>
      The oxygen antagonist is provided to the biological matter in a
      state that allows it to compete with oxygen. The oxygen antagonist
      may be a gas, semi-solid liquid (such as a gel or paste), liquid,
      or gas. It is contemplated that biological matter may be exposed
      to more than one oxygen antagonist and/or to an oxygen antagonist
      in more than one state...<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, the oxygen antagonist gas is carbon monoxide
      and the amount of carbon monoxide is about the same or exceeds any
      amount of oxygen in the oxygen gas mixture.<br>
      <br>
      In particular embodiments, carbon monoxide is employed with
      blood-free biological matter. The term "blood-free biological
      matter" refers to cells and organs whose oxygenation is not
      dependent, or no longer dependent, on the vasculature, such as an
      organ for transplant.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the atmosphere will be 100% CO, but as will be evident
      to one skilled in the art, the amount of CO may be balanced with
      gases other than oxygen providing that the amount of usable oxygen
      is reduced to a level that prevents cellular respiration. In this
      context, the ratio of carbon monoxide-to-oxygen is preferably
      85:15 or greater, 199:1 or greater or 399:1 or greater.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention also concerns a method of delaying the
      effects of trauma on or in an organism comprising exposing
      biological matter at risk for trauma to an effective amount of 0
      an oxygen antagonist.<br>
      In other aspects of the invention, there are methods for treating
      or preventing hemorrhagic shock in a patient comprising exposing
      the patient to an effective amount of an oxygen antagonist.<br>
      <br>
      Methods for reducing heart rate in an organism are also included
      as part of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      Such methods involve contacting the biological sample or organism
      with an effective amount of an oxygen antagonist.<br>
      <br>
      One embodiment of the invention relates to a method of inducing
      hibernation in a mammal comprising contacting the mammal with an
      effective amount of an oxygen antagonist.<br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment, there is a method of anesthetizing an
      organism comprising exposing biological matter in which anesthesia
      is desired to an effective amount of an oxygen antagonist. It is
      contemplated that the anesthesia may be similar to local or
      general anesthesia...<br>

      FIG. 4A - Metabolic rate decreases before body core temperature
      when mice are exposed to hydrogen sulfide. Exposure of mice to
      80ppm (at 0 minutes on the X axis) results in an approximately 3
      fold decrease in C02 production (black line) in less than five
      minutes. This precedes the drop in core temperature of the animal
      toward the ambient temperature (gray line).<br>

      trace represents a continuous measurement of core body temperature
      individual mouse exposed to either 80ppm of H2S, or to room air.
      Numbers on the vertical axis are temperature in 'Celsius. On the
      horizontal axis, the numbers reflect time in hours. The
      experiments were carried out for 6 hours followed by recordings of
      the recovery. The beginning point is at 1:00, and the end of the 6
      hr treatment is about 7:00.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5A - Exposure to 80 ppm hydrogen sulfide causes the core body
      temperature of a mouse to approach ambient temperature. Gas was
      turned on and temperature decreased starting at time 0:00.
      Atmosphere switched back to room air at time 6:00. Triangles
      indicate the core body temperature of the mouse as determined by
      radiotelemetry. This was approximately 39"C at time 0:00. Diamonds
      indicate the ambient temperature which was reduced from 23C to
      13'C 21 in the first 3 hours of the experiment, and then increased
      again toward 23C from hour 6:00 stabilizing at around hour 9:00.<br>

      represent core body temperature of a single mouse as determined by
      radiotelemetry. Mice subjected to 20ppm and 40ppm H2S exhibit
      minor drops in core temperature. Exposure to 60ppm induced a
      substantial drop in temperature beginning at approximately hour
      4:00. The mouse exposed to 80ppm exhibited a substantial drop in
      temperature beginning at approximately hour 2:00.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 - Lowest core body temperature. The lowest core body
      temperature recorded for a mouse exposed to 80ppm hydrogen sulfide
      was 10.7 0 C. Triangles indicate the core body temperature of the
      mouse as determined by radiotelemetry which started at
      approximately 39C at time 0. Diamonds indicate the ambient
      temperature which began at approximately 23oC and was dropped to
      less than lOoC by the mid-point of the experiment, after which it
      was then increased again toward room temperature.<br>

      Hamburger researchers find a way to bring water in less than a
      trillionth of a second to a boil. At its heart is a concentrated
      lightning so-called terahertz radiation: The flash brings the
      water molecules to vibrate violently in one fell swoop.<br>
      <br>
      The method may heat up to 600 degrees Celsius, a small amount of
      water in just half picosecond. This is much faster than a blink of
      the eye: A picosecond is to a second what a second is to nearly 32
      millennia. Thus, the method would be loud Desy the fastest kettle

      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The use of magnets is known to create a magnetic field to energize
      water so as to permit the magnetized properties to dissipate to
      the surrounding areas.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 6,164,332 discloses an apparatus to deliver water
      energized by a vortex flow of water through a magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 6,053,287 discloses a magnetic processing treatment
      facility for subjecting a fluid flow to magnetic energy that is
      integrated into an agricultural use to enhance activity in terms
      of crop growth and to increase the solubility of agricultural
      chemical agents to be used in a spray.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,411 discloses a magnetic treatment apparatus
      to "energize" water using at least two magnetic fields and an
      electrical current. The water is used to condition potable water,
      gardening water and recycled water.<br>

      water using reflected ultraviolet light.<br>
      There exists an AquaCharge(R) system for "energizing" water using
      paramagnetic material and Organite to clear harmful energy
      signatures from water. The system passes water through a
      concentrated paramagnetic system combined with quartz crystals in
      combination with orgone to provide the water with positive
      frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      The article of Gerecht et al entitled "A Passive Heterodyne Hot
      Electron Bolometer Imager Operating at 850 GHz" in IEEE
      Transactions on Microwave Theory and Technoques, Vol 56, No. 5,
      May 2008, describes means for producing and detecting Tetrahertz
      radiation at a frequency of 720-930 GHz.<br>
      <br>
      Light rays produced by the sun comprise electric and magnetic
      vibrations which are vibrating in more than one plane that is
      referred to as unpolarized light.<br>
      <br>
      The spectrum of electromagnetic radiation striking the earth on a
      daily basis originates from the sun including for example commonly
      known spectra such as the visible and ultraviolet regions. The
      full spectrum is characterized by the term EOF representing the
      electro optical frequencies of solar radiation. The bands of these
      frequencies are characterized based upon wavelengths into nine
      general regions illustrated by the Solar Spectrum. These nine
      categories of increasing wavelength from 100 nm to 1 mm include
      Ultraviolet C, Ultraviolet B, Ultraviolet A, Visible light,
      Infrared A, Infrared B, Infrared C, FAR Infrared, and Extreme Far
      Infrared, the latter of which is part of the Terahertz spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      This special region known as Terahertz spectrum radiation or the
      "Terahertz Gap" falls between electromagnetic frequencies
      (measured with antennas) and optical frequencies (measured with
      optical detectors). There are currently no known natural sources
      of Terahertz radiation in the Extreme Far Infrared region.<br>
      <br>
      Terahertz radiation is a non-ionizing sub-millimeter radiation and
      shares with X-rays the capability to penetrate a wide variety of
      non conductive materials. Terahertz radiation can pass through
      clothing, paper, cardboard, wood, masonry and plastic. It can also
      penetrate fog and clouds, but cannot penetrate metal or water.<br>
      <br>
      It is possible to transform unpolarized light into polarized
      light. Polarized light waves are light waves in which the
      vibrations occur in a single plane. The process of transforming
      unpolarized light into polarized light is known as polarization.
      There are a variety of methods of polarizing light. The most
      common method of polarization involves the use of a Polaroid
      filter. Polaroid filters are made of a special material which is
      capable of blocking one of the two planes of vibration of an
      electromagnetic wave. A Polaroid serves as a device which filters
      out one-half of the vibrations upon transmission of the light
      through the filter. When unpolarized light is transmitted through
      a Polaroid filter, it emerges with one-half the intensity and with
      vibrations in a single plane; it emerges as polarized light.<br>
      <br>
      A Polaroid filter is able to polarize light because of the
      chemical composition of the filter material. The filter can be
      thought of as having long-chain molecules that are aligned within
      the filter in the same direction. During the fabrication of the
      filter, the long-chain molecules are stretched across the filter
      so that each molecule is aligned in the vertical direction. As
      unpolarized light strikes the filter, the portion of the waves
      vibrating in the vertical direction are absorbed by the filter.
      The general rule is that the electromagnetic vibrations which are
      in a direction parallel to the alignment of the molecules are
      absorbed.<br>
      <br>
      The alignment of these molecules gives the filter a polarization
      axis. This polarization axis extends across the length of the
      filter and only allows vibrations of the electromagnetic wave that
      are parallel to the axis to pass through. Any vibrations which are
      perpendicular to the polarization axis are blocked by the filter.
      Thus, a Polaroid filter with its long-chain molecules aligned
      horizontally will have a polarization axis aligned vertically.
      Such a filter will block all horizontal vibrations and allow the
      vertical vibrations to be transmitted. On the other hand, a
      Polaroid filter with its long-c chain molecules aligned vertically
      will have a polarization axis aligned horizontally; this filter
      will block all vertical vibrations and allow the horizontal
      vibrations to be transmitted.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention, there is provided a means for
      radiating in a closed chamber Terahertz radiation and imprinting
      water containing inorganic salts and/or minerals with wavelengths
      of about 100 micrometers to 1 micrometer or frequencies from 300
      GHz to 3 THz, preferably radiation at a frequency of about 720 to
      930 GHz, most preferably of about 850 GHz which is placed in a
      geometrically suitable transparent container to effect the
      environment in the chamber. Preferably, the chamber is
      environmentally controlled.<br>
      <br>
      As seen in FIG. 1 of the drawing, a source (10) of Terahertz
      radiation which generates the desired Terahertz radiation, such as
      disclosed in aforementioned IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory
      and Techniques or naturally from the sun, is beamed to a metal
      reflector (11). The electro-optical frequencies generated are
      reflected onto a polarization filter (12). The polarized rays are
      then directed into a tank containing ionized water (22) which
      contains inorganic salts and/or minerals to absorb the polarized
      Terahertz radiation and store imprinted information.<br>
      <br>
      The tank of water contains a vortex generator (13) to create a
      spinning turbulent flow of water in the tank. The turbulence is
      produced for at least one hour in a tank containing about 125
      liters of the polarized water. The irradiated polarized water is
      then rested for about one hour to allow imprinting of the
      Terahertz radiation. The vortex generated is preferably rotated in
      a counterclockwise direction.<br>
      <br>
      The imprinted water can then be placed in a geometrically
      acceptable transparent container (14), for example, an egg shaped
      transparent container, which when placed into an environmentally
      controlled chamber (15) transmits the desired Terahertz radiation.
      The container can also be placed in a non controlled environment
      such as an insulated container.<br>
      <br>
      When using sunlight as the source of Terahertz radiation,
      consideration is taken as to the amount of sunlight available. One
      of the properties of sunlight is its wave particle duality. The
      main property used in the process encompasses the particle aspect
      of the waves of sunlight. Using the high photonic energy of the
      unobstructed sunlight the polarized light has the ability to
      change the electromagnetic spin of the electrons in the water
      molecules containing the inorganic salts and/or minerals such as
      found in spring water. The process synchronizes the water
      molecules into certain formations allowing the water to absorb the
      Terahertz radiation, especially those in the Far Infrared end of
      the spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      As seen in FIG. 2, proper geometrically shaped containers (20),
      for example, egg shaped transparent containers (21) containing the
      energized water (22) are placed on a stand (23). Proper
      geometrically shaped containers are well known to transmit various
      energies whereby the wavelengths do not interfere with each other.
      Containers which are egg shaped have this capability. Pyramid
      configurations are considered to channel energies in the proper
      direction as well. Tubular containers also permit the energizing
      properties of the water to dissipate therefrom in proper order.<br>
      <br>
      Use of the radiation emitting devices of the invention can reduce
      oxidation and retain moisture in food that are stored in chambers
      such as refrigerators, refrigeration vehicles, coolers, pantries
      and the like which causes odors and food spoilage.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><br>
      <br>
      A comparison study was made wherein three controlled environment
      chambers were used. One chamber contained 25 fresh picked Gala
      apples. A second chamber contained 25 fresh picked Gala apples
      treated with gaseous 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) which is
      commercially available under the trademark Smart Fresh(R). A third
      chamber contained 25 fresh picked Gala apples and the egg shaped
      device with the Terahertz radiation treated water of the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      After 6 weeks the apples were tested to firmness, acid levels,
      color, taste and aroma.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><br>
      <br>
      The non-treated apples had soft spots, brown spots when sliced,
      tasted as being stale and not fresh. The color was only slightly
      faded.<br>
      The apples treated with 1-MCP were crunchy, fresh tasting and
      similar to the fresh picked apples.<br>
      The apples from the third chamber had the same quality and
      characteristics as the apples from the second chamber.<br>

      The present disclosure provides methods wherein water-clusters'
      molecular vibrations in the 0.5 - 32 terahertz (THz) frequency
      range are coupled to the clusters' electronic states, generally
      referred to "vibronic interactions", to promote water clusters as
      active agents in a range of applications. The present disclosure
      also describes the various natural and engineered systems where
      these water clusters are present and/or produced and whose unique
      vibronic interactions can be activated to carry out the desired
      applications. In addition, methods and systems of using the
      vibronic interactions of water clusters are disclosed, including
      applications for environmental remediation, clean energy

      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present disclosure generally relates to methods and
      systems of using water clusters and specifically to methods and
      systems of utilizing water clusters and their vibronic
      interactions in a plurality of applications.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Water covers two-thirds of the globe and constitutes
      seventy percent of our body weight.<br>
      <br>
      Life on Earth would not exist without it. Water vapor in Earth's
      atmosphere may be one of the most significant greenhouse gases
      (see LM. Held and B.J. Soden, "Water vapor feedback and global
      warming", Annual Review of Energy and the Environment. 25, 441-475
      2000). Small polyhedral clusters of water molecules, for example,
      as illustrated in FIGs. 1 and 2, have been experimentally
      identified as being potentially significant to the hydration and
      stabilization of bio-molecules (see M.M. Teeter, Proc. Natl. Acad.
      Sci. 81, 6014, 1984), proteins (see T. Baker et al.,
      Crystallography in Molecular Biology, D. Moras et al., Eds.,
      Plenum, New York), DNA (see L.A. Lipscomb et al., Biochemistry 33,
      3649, 1994), and DNA-drug complexes (see S. Neidle, Nature 288,
      129, 1980). Such examples indicate the tendency of water
      pentagons, illustrated in FIG. 1, to form closed geometrical
      structures like the pentagonal dodecahedron illustrated in FIG. 2.
      It has also been suggested that water clusters may play a
      fundamental role in determining biological cell architecture (see
      J.G. Watterson, Molec. And Cell. Biochem. 79, 101, 1988). While
      much of the human body is water by weight, much of that water may
      not be ordinary bulk liquid, but instead, nano-clustered or
      "restructured" water which affects bio-molecular processes ranging
      from protein stability to enzyme activity (see Finney et al., "The
      role of water perturbations in biological processes", Water and
      Aqueous Solutions, pp. 227-244, 1986). For example,
      nano-structured water in the form of water clusters has been found
      to congregate in the confined cavities of proteins and other
      bio-molecules, as illustrated in FIG. 3, where a cluster of water
      molecules interacts with a protein amino-acid group.<br>
      <br>
      4379139vl Attorney Docket No.: 2007135-0007 (HYDR) [0004] An area
      of scientific interest in water clusters centers around their
      possible role in atmospheric and environmental phenomena,
      including global warming (see, for example, H. Carlon, J. Appl.
      Phys. 52, 3111, 1981), as well as by their relevance to the
      structure and properties of liquid water and ice (see F. N.
      Keutsch and R. J. Sakally, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 98, 10533,
      2001). Experiment and theory seem to indicate that not only can
      water clusters be produced, but they also exist optimally in
      certain "magic numbers" and configurations of water molecules
      (see, for example, Haberland et al., Electronic and Atomic
      Collisions, Elsevier, NY, 597, 1984). More prominent among the
      magic-number water clusters are those possessing an approximately
      pentagonal dodecahedral structure. Ideally, these water clusters
      have a closed, icosahedral symmetry formed by twenty
      hydrogen-bonded water molecules, for example, with their oxygen
      atoms at the vertices of 12 concatenated pentagons and with 10
      free exterior hydrogen atoms. FIG. 2 depicts a protonated water
      cluster, (H2O)2iH&lt;+&gt;, which occurs as the dominant molecular
      species in a variety of experiments (see, for example, M. Miyazaki
      et al., Science 304, 1135, 2004). Its clathrate structure - a
      hydronium ion, H3O&lt;+&gt;, or neutral water molecule plus proton
      H&lt;+&gt; trapped in the dodecahedral cage (see, for example, M.
      Miyazaki et al., Science 304, 1135, 2004) - is the typical
      protonated water cluster prototype.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Density-functional molecular-orbital calculations for the
      archetype (H2O)2IH&lt;+&gt; cluster of FIG. 2 yielded a set of
      molecular-orbital energies, shown in FIG. 4. In this embodiment,
      the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels
      correspond to the large, delocalized "S"-, "P"-, "Z&lt;)&gt;"- and
      "F'-like cluster wave-functions illustrated in FIG. 5. The iS-like
      LUMO level is separated from the highest occupied molecular
      orbital (HOMO) level by an energy gap of nearly 3 electron-volts
      (eV). The low-frequency vibrational modes of the (H2O)2iH&lt;+&gt;
      cluster have also been computed, producing, in one embodiment, the
      spectrum illustrated in FIG. 6 Of particular interest is the
      lowest frequency manifold of cluster modes between 1.5 and 6
      terahertz (THz) (about 50 to 200 cm&lt;"1&gt;). The vectors in
      FIG. 7 illustrate the 1.56 THz "squashing" mode of the otherwise
      ideally symmetrical dodecahedral cluster (illustrated by FIG. 8),
      with a large-amplitude vibration of the clathrated hydronium
      oxygen atom coupled to breathing vibrations of the cluster
      "surface" oxygen atoms. O-H "stretching" and "bending" vibrational
      modes occur at much higher frequencies (not shown) spanning the
      broad infrared region of the spectrum. The 0.5-32 THz (about 50 to
      1060 cm&lt;"1&gt;) manifold is thought to be due to water molecule
      clustering. Density-functional calculations for larger water
      clusters such as that illustrated in FIG. 9, and even for the
      simple pentamer in FIG. 1 , indicate similar manifolds of cluster
      terahertz vibrational modes, except that they extend to as low as
      0.5 THz for the largest clusters.<br>
      <br>
      Anomalous emission and absorption of far-infrared and
      sub-millimeter (THz) radiation from the atmosphere were first
      identified by Gebbie (see H. A. Gebbie, Nature 296, 422, 1982), as
      possibly associated with aerosols of water clusters undergoing
      solar optical pumping. It is thought that at sea-level densities,
      such aerosols are separated by 10&lt;4&gt; times their cluster
      radii and, under this condition of isolation, can be pumped by
      photons into vibrational modes of lowest frequency analogous to a
      Bose-Einstein condensation, thus acquiring giant electric dipoles.
      Their interaction with radiation is thereby greatly enhanced. For
      example, atmospheric aerosol absorption at 50 cm&lt;"1&gt; is
      comparable with that of a water molecule rotation line at 47
      cm&lt;"1&gt;, which has a dipole moment of 1.85 Debyes in an air
      sample containing 10&lt;17&gt; cm&lt;"3&gt; water molecules. Even
      if the aerosol density of water clusters is only approximately
      10&lt;4&gt; cm&lt;"3&gt; (see H. Pruppacher and J. D. Klett,
      Microphysics of Clouds and Precipitation, Reidel, Dordrecht,
      1978), then an effective aerosol transition moment of 10&lt;6&gt;
      Debyes can be inferred. In other words, this greatly enhanced
      submillimeter (THz) absorption and emission from comparatively
      low-density aerosols can be attributed to solar optical pumping,
      cooperative stimulated emission, and maser action of the
      constituent water clusters.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The electronic structure (as illustrated in FIGs. 4 and 5)
      and vibrational spectrum (as illustrated in FIG. 6) of the
      (H2O)2IH&lt;+&gt; and other similar clusters can satisfy the
      conditions for intense optical absorption and Terahertz emission.
      First, the near-ultraviolet optical pumping of an electron from
      the HOMO to LUMO can put the electron into the bound S-like
      cluster molecular orbital mapped in FIG. 5. This is a stable
      excited state of the cluster. Near-infrared absorption can then
      excite the LUMO S-like electron to the nearby unoccupied /Mike
      orbital (as illustrated in FIGs. 4 and 5). There are three nearly
      degenerate P-like cluster molecular orbitals, analogous to the
      degenerate p[tau], py, and pz orbitals of an atom. Unlike an atom,
      however, the Px, Py, P2 near-degeneracy in the water cluster
      subjects it to the dynamic Jahn- Teller (DJT) effect (see I.
      Bersuker et al, "Vibronic Interactions in Molecules and Crystals",
      Springer- Verlag, 1989), where the cluster attempts to remove the
      degeneracy and lower its energy through vibronic coupling and
      symmetry breaking. Near-infrared promotion of the optically pumped
      electron between the closely spaced P-like and D-like cluster
      energy levels (illustrated in FIG. 4) may also be likely.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Even in the absence of DJT coupling, excitations within the
      LUMO manifold can decay vibronically due to the mixing of
      electronic states. The vibrations here are the Terahertz modes
      that are the lowest-frequency (H2O)2IH&lt;+&gt; cluster modes,
      like the 1.56 THz "squashing mode" illustrated in FIGs. 7 and 8.
      The predicted electric dipole moment of the (H2O)2iH&lt;+&gt;
      cluster in its optically pumped state is nearly 10 Debyes, as
      compared with the 1.85 Debye moment for a single water molecule.
      As shown by the vectors in FIG. 7, the large-amplitude Terahertz
      vibration of the clathrated hydronium oxygen atom, coupled to
      breathing modes of the cluster "surface" oxygen atoms, produces an
      oscillating large electric dipole moment that constitutes the
      transition moment for Terahertz emission when the cluster is
      optically pumped. The excited electron in the LUMO manifold may be
      weakly bound compared to the cluster hydrogen-bonded "valence"
      electrons below the LUMO level. In fact, the occupied cluster
      molecular orbital levels below the HOMO (as illustrated in FIG. 4)
      are, in some embodiments, analogous to the 'Valence band" of a
      semiconductor, whereas the LUMO manifold is, in some embodiments,
      analogous to a semiconductor "conduction band". Thus in<br>
      <br>
      (or similar) clusters, the ensemble of optically pumped electrons
      in the LUMO manifolds, loosely bound to the vibrationally
      activated, positively charged (H2O)2IH&lt;+&gt; molecular ion
      "cores", can effectively constitutes a "plasma". An alternative
      scenario is to view an electron in the LUMO manifold "conduction
      band", responsible for the large dipole moment of the clusters, as
      oscillating in the reference frame of the (H2O)2IH&lt;+&gt; ion
      core. Since the positive charge of the (H2O)2IH&lt;+&gt; cluster
      is due to the "extra" proton, an even simpler picture is a
      "hydrogenic plasma" model, in which the aerosol is modeled as
      electrons loosely bound to protons in large-radius "Rydberg-like"
      S-, P-, D- or F-like orbits.<br>

      become more apparent from the detailed description set forth below
      when taken in conjunction with the drawings, in which like
      reference characters identify corresponding elements throughout.
      In the drawings, like reference numbers generally indicate
      identical, functionally similar, and/or structurally similar
      elements.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0041] The present disclosure discusses certain preferred
      embodiments of water clusters wherein their molecular vibrations
      are coupled to the water clusters' electronic states (hereafter
      referred to as "vibronic interactions"). In some embodiments, the
      molecular vibrations are in the 0.5 - 32 terahertz (THz) frequency
      range. Water clusters characterized by such interactions may be
      leveraged as active agents in various applications. They can be
      found in solid, liquid and gaseous states of water, both on earth
      and in space, and can be distinguished from typical masses or
      molecules of water by having properties, such as those
      characterized by vibronic interactions. Due to these properties,
      the water clusters of this disclosure may also be considered as
      representing a fourth state or phase of water, and is
      distinguished from a simple collection of water molecules such as
      a droplet. Water clusters may be found in natural systems, which
      includes the earth's atmosphere, in biological systems and
      reservoirs of water. Water clusters may also be produced in
      engineered systems, including, but not limited to, pressurized
      water vapor cells, nano- electrospray apparatus, jet nozzle
      systems, ion mobility drift tube apparatus, water-in-oil
      nano-emulsion formulations (see, for example, US Patents 5,800,576
      and 5,997,590), molecular beam apparatus and supercritical water
      cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In some embodiments, the water clusters may have high
      symmetry and possess pentagonal or pentagonal dodecahedral
      structures, as illustrated in FIGs. 1 and 2 respectively. In some
      of these embodiments, water clusters are globular clusters
      containing up to 100 water molecules (as illustrated in FIG. 9).
      Preferred embodiments of a water cluster may include twenty or
      twenty-one water molecules. In one embodiment, a pentagonal
      dodecahedral cluster can have a closed, icosahedral symmetry
      formed by twenty hydrogen-bonded water molecules. The associated
      oxygen atoms are at the vertices of twelve concatenated pentagons
      and there are ten free exterior hydrogen atoms. FIG. 2 shows an
      embodiment of a protonated water cluster, (H2O^oH3O&lt;+&gt; or
      (H2O)2IH&lt;+&gt;. This has been identified as a dominant
      molecular species in a variety of experiments (see, for example,
      Hermann et al., Chem. Phys. 76, 2031, 1982).<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Calculated density-functional molecular-orbital levels for
      the (H2[theta])2iH&lt;+&gt; cluster are shown in FIG. 4. The
      lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels
      correspond to the large, delocalized "S"-, "F'-, "D"- and "F'-like
      cluster wave-functions depicted in FIG. 5. The "5"-like LUMO level
      is separated from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
      level by an energy gap of nearly 3 eV. The vibrational modes of
      this cluster have also been computed, an embodiment of the
      spectrum shown in FIG. 6. Of particular relevance to certain
      applications of this disclosure is the lowest frequency manifold
      of cluster modes between 1.5 and 6 THz (about 50 to 200
      cm&lt;"1&gt;). The vectors in FIG. 7 show a typical "squashing"
      mode of the dodecahedral cluster, with a large-amplitude vibration
      of the clathrated hydronium oxygen atom coupled to breathing
      vibrations of the cluster "surface" oxygen atoms. Water-cluster
      "librational modes" are shown in FIG. 6 to occur at higher
      frequencies up to 32 THz. The 1.5-32 THz (about 50 to 1060
      cm&lt;"1&gt;) manifolds may be characteristic of water molecule
      clustering. Density-functional molecular-orbital calculations for
      larger water clusters, for example, the embodiment shown in Fig 9,
      result in similar manifolds of terahertz modes extending to 0.5
      THz for the larger clusters.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Water clusters containing stable pentagonal dodecahedral
      water structures may be produced by a variety of methods. In
      liquid water, pentagonal dodecahedral structures may form
      transiently, but can be unstable. Liquid water can, in one
      embodiment, be modeled as a collection of pentagonal dodecahedra
      in which inter-structure interactions are approximately as strong
      as, or stronger than, intra-structure interactions. To produce
      stable pentagonal dodecahedral water structures from liquid water,
      the long-range inter-structure interactions present in liquid
      water may be disrupted in favor of the intra-structure
      association. Any of a variety of methods, including physical,
      chemical, electrical, and electromagnetic methods, can be used to
      accomplish this. For example, a method of isolating a pentagonal
      dodecahedral water structure is simply to extract twenty or
      twenty-one water molecules into a single nano-droplet. Water
      clusters of twenty or twenty- one water molecules are two
      preferred embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Other methods of producing pentagonal dodecahedral water
      structures include passing water vapor through a hypersonic nozzle
      (see, for example, Lin, Rev. Sci. Instrum. 44:516, 1973). Other
      methods of hypersonic nozzling may also apply. For example, an
      improved hypersonic nozzling method for preparing pentagonal
      dodecahedral water structures may include a hypersonic nozzle with
      a catalytic material such as nickel or a nickel alloy positioned
      and arranged so that, as water passes through the nozzle, the
      water comes into contact with reacting orbitals on the catalytic
      material. The catalytic material may&nbsp; disrupt inter-cluster
      bonding by sending electrons into anti-bonding orbitals without
      interfering with intra- cluster bonding interactions.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Chemical methods for producing water clusters comprising
      pentagonal dodecahedral structures can include the use of
      surfactants and/or clathrating agents. Electrical methods may
      involve inducing electrical breakdown of inter-cluster
      interactions by providing an electrical spark of sufficient
      voltage and appropriate frequency. Electromagnetic methods can
      include application of microwaves of appropriate frequency to
      interact with the "squashing" vibrational modes of inter-cluster
      oxygen-oxygen interactions. Also, since it is known that
      ultrasound waves can cavitate (produce bubbles in) water, it is
      predicted that inter-cluster associations can be disrupted
      ultrasonically without interfering with intra-cluster
      interactions. Finally, various other methods have been reported
      for the production of pentagonal dodecahedral water structures.
      Such methods include ion bombardment of ice surfaces (see
      Haberland, Electronic and Atomic Collisions, ed. by Eichler et al,
      Elsevier, Ansterdam, pp. 597-604, 1984), electron impact
      ionization (see, for example, Lin, Rev. Sci. Instrum. 44:516,
      1973), and near-threshold vacuum-UV photoionization of neutral
      clusters (see, for example, Shinohara et al. Chem. Phys. 83:4183,
      1985).<br>
      <br>
      [0047] In some embodiments, it may be desirable to ionize the
      pentagonal dodecahedral water structures (e.g., by passing them
      through an electrical potential after they are formed) to increase
      their kinetic energy and reactivity through coulombic repulsion.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Water cluster vibrational modes such as that illustrated in
      FIG. 6 may be induced or promoted through application of an
      external electromagnetic field and/or through the intrinsic action
      of the dynamical Jahn-Teller (DJT) effect using methods including
      photoelectric stimulation, addition of electronic charge, exposure
      to terahertz radiation, design of specific water-in-oil
      nano-emulsion formulations, design of certain clathrates in water
      cluster cages (i.e. silver) and contact with certain electron
      donning materials (i.e. nickel). The Jahn-Teller (JT) effect is
      known to cause symmetrical structures to distort or deform along
      symmetry-determined vibrational coordinates (Qs) as illustrated in
      FIG. 10. Potential energy minima corresponding to the
      broken-symmetry forms can arise, and the structure may either
      settle into one of these minima (static Jahn-Teller effect), or
      oscillate between or among such minima, such as vibrating along
      the relevant vibrational coordinates (DJT effect).<br>
      <br>
      [0049] DJT-induced vibrational oscillations in certain water
      clusters can significantly lower the energy barrier for chemical
      reactions involving such clusters (illustrated in FIG. 10).
      Specifically, the present disclosure teaches that water clusters
      (or aggregates thereof) having a ground-state electronic structure
      characterized by a manifold of fully occupied molecular orbitals
      (HOMO) separated from a manifold of unoccupied molecular orbitals
      (LUMO) by an energy gap (as illustrated in FIG. 4) can be made to
      have enhanced reactivity characteristics if the degenerate LUMO
      states (as illustrated in FIG. 5) are occupied via HOMO-to-LUMO
      electromagnetic (optical) excitation or through the external
      addition of electronic charge. This can lead to distortive
      symmetry breaking and DJT-induced vibronic oscillations.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] A large-amplitude Terahertz vibration of the clathrated
      hydronium oxygen atom, coupled to breathing modes of the cluster
      "surface" oxygen atoms (as illustrated in FIG. 6), can produce an
      oscillating large electric dipole moment that constitutes the
      transition moment for Terahertz emission when the cluster is
      optically pumped. Thus water vapor populated by such water
      clusters may be strong sources of terahertz radiation between
      approximately 1.5 and 32 TFIz (as illustrated in FIG. 7).<br>
      <br>
      [0051] To estimate the Terahertz emission power of a water cluster
      at 1.5 THz, we begin with the standard formula for electromagnetic
      radiation power emission from an oscillating electric dipole (in
      cgs units), P = p&lt;2&gt;[omega]&lt;4&gt;/3c&lt;3&gt;, where p is
      the dipole moment, [omega] is the (angular) frequency of the
      dipole vibration - in a protonated water cluster (as illustrated
      in FIG. 2)and the "squashing vibration shown in FIG. 7 - and c is
      the velocity of light. The dipole moment of a protonated water
      cluster (H2O)2iH&lt;+&gt; in its ground state is approximately 10
      Debyes (IDebye = 10&lt;~18&gt; esu-cm). Under electromagnetic
      (optical) excitation across the HOMO-LUMO energy gap of such a
      cluster or by external addition of electrons to the LUMOs (as
      illustrated in FIG. 3), p can approach 50 Debyes, i.e. the
      effective dipole moment of an optically pumped or
      negatively-charged water cluster is much larger than that of the
      ground state. Therefore at Terahertz frequencies, e.g. 1.5 THz,
      the emission power output of a single water cluster is typically
      of the order of (converting cgs to MKS units) 10&lt;"21&gt;
      watt/cluster. For a room-temperature, 40 torr pressure density of
      10&lt;12&gt; water clusters/cm&lt;3&gt;, this yields a potential
      Terahertz emission power of approximately 10&lt;"9&gt; watt or one
      nanowatt/cm&lt;3&gt;. Therefore a one cubic meter water- vapor
      chamber containing such a density of water clusters could
      potentially produce a milliwatt of Terahertz radiation, i.e.
      comparable to that produced by a commercially available
      semiconductor Terahertz source. Raising the pressure of the
      chamber should significantly increase the water cluster
      population, approaching 10&lt;15&gt; /cm&lt;3&gt; at 100 torr.
      This would imply 10&lt;"6&gt; watt/cm&lt;3&gt; or one
      watt/m&lt;3&gt;, which may exceed the power output of most
      commercially available Terahertz sources.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] In this disclosure, embodiments of methods and systems of
      utilizing water clusters and their vibronic interactions are
      disclosed in connection with a number of applications. Areas of
      interest include environmental remediation, clean energy
      production, terahertz radiation technologies, chemical synthesis
      and reactivity, and pharmaceutical and biomedical technologies.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0053] Atmospheric water can be a significant contributor to
      global warming, compared with carbon dioxide and methane. In one
      report, water vapor causes 36-70% of the greenhouse effect on
      Earth, excluding clouds, while carbon dioxide (CO2) causes only
      9-26%, and Methane (CH4), only 4-9%. Although increases of CO2 are
      known to elevate the greenhouse effect and thus global warming,
      the contribution of atmospheric water is not as commonly discussed
      partly because unlike most other gases, the distribution of
      atmospheric water can vary greatly with altitude, terrestrial
      location, and across time, and water vapor can change between the
      liquid and solid phases at terrestrial temperatures. For example,
      slight increases of ocean temperature may produce significant
      increases in the evaporation of water molecules into the
      atmosphere. This is in addition to growing man-made combustion
      sources of water vapor, such as from industry, terrestrial
      vehicles, ships and aircraft. Even fuel cells, such as used in
      "clean energy" vehicles, produces water vapor.<br>
      [0054] Water vapor is typically viewed as a gas comprising
      distinct H2O molecules. However, from experimental research at the
      UK Rutherford Appleton Laboratories and theoretical models
      developed at MIT and HydroElectron Ventures, Inc. (HEV),
      atmospheric water vapor can be a natural source of clusters of
      water molecules, especially protonated water clusters such as
      (H2[theta])2iH&lt;+&gt;. A water cluster, such as that illustrated
      in FIG. 7, may store more heat than the sum total from separate
      water molecules because of the water cluster's vibrational degrees
      of freedom, which may be shown by unique cluster "surface"
      vibration vectors. The heat storage capacities of such clusters
      can approach that of bulk water. Thus, even a modest collection of
      water clusters in the troposphere can contribute significantly to
      the greenhouse effect and may explain why water vapor can be a
      significant greenhouse gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] While increases of atmospheric CO2 can contribute to
      warming of the oceans and therefore increases in atmospheric water
      clusters, CO2 can directly interact with and be captured by water
      clusters, forming clusters such as (H2O)nC(V, the analogue of
      solvated CO2. The capture of CO2 by water clusters increases the
      cluster heat storage capacities because of the additional
      vibrational modes OfCO2. Water clusters, including clusters such
      as (H2[theta])nC[theta]2&lt;~&gt;, have the unique property that
      their vibrational frequencies can extend into the terahertz (THz)
      region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Thus, atmospheric water
      vapor including such clusters can be a strong absorber of
      Terahertz radiation. Water clusters in general are relatively
      strong absorbers and emitters in the terahertz region and
      relatively strong absorbers of infrared (heat) radiation. However,
      water clusters in general do not radiate heat as efficiently. We
      leverage these properties of water clusters in applications that
      may help reduce global warming.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] A method for reducing the greenhouse effect and global
      warming may involve removing water clusters from the atmosphere.
      In some embodiments, the addition of electrons to water clusters
      can break the water clusters down into separate water molecules.
      This can reduce the contribution of water molecule clustering to
      atmospheric heat storage. In one embodiment, a method for removing
      at least one water cluster from the atmosphere includes injecting
      one or more electrons into the atmosphere, the atmosphere
      including a plurality of water clusters. The one or more injected
      electrons interacts with the plurality of water clusters causing
      one or more water clusters to break down. Each of these water
      clusters can be a protonated water cluster or any other embodiment
      of a water cluster.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In another embodiment, the method may target the
      troposphere component of the Earth's atmosphere, the troposphere
      including the plurality of water clusters. In still another
      embodiment, one or more atmospheric layers in the Earth's
      atmosphere may be targeted for electron injection. In some
      embodiments, the method includes injecting at least one electron
      from a photoelectron-emitting material. The photoelectron-emitting
      material may be mounted on an aircraft, balloon, or any
      high-altitude structures or media. Any type or form of aircraft,
      balloon and structures may be located in the appropriate
      atmospheric layer or layers. The photoelecfron-emitting material
      releases one or more electrons when subject to radiation. The
      photoelectron-emitting material may be fabricated as a panel or
      any form or type of structure or coating. In one embodiment, the
      radiation is solar radiation. This method could be accomplished,
      for example, safely from the many commercial aircraft flying daily
      through the troposphere by exposing photoelectron-emitting panels
      that would release electrons under solar radiation once the
      aircraft reaches a specific altitude. Ozone may be a byproduct of
      this process but tropospheric ozone is known to be beneficial. In
      addition, deployment of Terahertz radiation sources in certain
      embodiments may also assist in breaking down the atmospheric,
      heat-storing water clusters.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Through research collaboration between the Center for
      Terahertz Research at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) and
      HEV, it is shown that terrestrial ambient water vapor can also be
      a strong emitter of harmless (non-ionizing) Terahertz radiation
      which may be associated with water cluster Terahertz vibrational
      modes like that shown in FIG. 7. Therefore, a method of converting
      heart to terahertz radiation may be beneficial to mitigating
      atmospheric warming. As described above, CO2 molecules can
      directly interact with and be captured by water clusters. A method
      of reducing heat stored in CO2 may help reduce the greenhouse
      effect. In one embodiment, the method includes injecting one or
      more electrons into the atmosphere, the atmosphere including a
      number of water clusters. In another embodiment, the method may
      specifically focus on the troposphere of the Earth's atmosphere,
      the troposphere including the plurality of water clusters. In
      still another embodiment, one or more atmospheric layers in the
      Earth's atmosphere may be targeted for electron injection. The one
      or more injected electrons may attach onto at least one water
      cluster to form at least one charged water cluster. A charged
      water cluster, as formed, can attract and absorb carbon dioxide
      from the atmosphere. The heat stored in the carbon dioxide can
      then be converted into Terahertz radiation. Here, heat can be
      converted vibronically to Terahertz radiation and harmlessly
      removed from the atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In some embodiments, Terahertz radiation is applied to the
      plurality of water clusters, the applied radiation at a frequency
      in the range of 0.5 terahertz to 32 terahertz. The applied
      radiation can help CO2 interact with the water clusters, for
      example, forming water clusters such as (H2O)nCO2&lt;"&gt;.
      Moreover, the applied radiation may help activate the removal of
      heat through Terahertz radiation. In one of these embodiments,
      after the removal of an amount of heat through radiation, the
      water clusters may be removed. One method of removing such
      clusters is the method of injecting electrons into water clusters
      to break up the clusters, as discussed above. Some of these water
      clusters may absorb and retain heat in the atmosphere if they
      remain in sufficient concentration in the atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CLEAN ENERGY PRODUCTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0061] A water cluster can store more energy than do the separate
      water vapor molecules because of the many vibrational degrees of
      freedom. The water cluster may be in a 1.5 THz mode, as shown in
      FIG. 7, with large-amplitude excursions of the "surface oxygen"
      atoms. It is possible to identify the significant vibrational
      energy exchange between such clusters and their ambient
      surroundings, as well as the catalytic vibronic energy exchanges
      that occur when such clusters chemically interact with other
      molecules and at material interfaces.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Biofuel Production</b><br>
      <br>
      [0062] In the oxidation/combustion of carbon compounds such as
      hydrocarbon fuels, water-cluster orbitals on the cluster surface
      oxygen atoms can overlap with the reactive fuel carbon (e.g.
      p[pi]) orbitals, promoting oxidation. Because of the potentially
      significant displacements (large Qs) of water-cluster surface
      oxygen atoms in the Terahertz vibrational modes, the energy
      barrier for an expulsion of water oxygen or OH radicals and their
      oxidative and reactive carbon atoms may be lowered from Ebamerto
      E'bamer, as illustrated in FIG. 10. The use of water clusters in
      nano-emulsions along with their direct injection to increase
      efficiency of diesel combustion while reducing pollutants are
      described in U.S. Patents 5,800,576 and 5,997,590. Biological
      enzymes may not be able to function without at least a monolayer
      (clusters) of water molecules at the interface, which is key to
      the hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose. Water clusters may also be
      used to catalyze the breakdown of biological material, such as
      switchgrass cellulose. In one embodiment, the water clusters'
      vibronic interactions may be activated to allow for the efficient
      breakdown of bio-fuel stocks, or more generally, biological
      material. This method can be a more efficient process for
      producing bio-fuels.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hydrogen Production</b><br>
      <br>
      [0063] In some embodiments, a system and method for producing
      hydrogen fuel from water involves nano-electrolysis. In this clean
      energy production application, experiments performed at McGiIl
      University indicates that mass-spectrometrically selected
      protonated water clusters impacting thin, negatively charged
      metallic membranes can strip hydrogen from the clusters. The
      water-cluster and membrane interface represents part of a
      nano-electrolytic system for the nano-electrolysis.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In one embodiment, a method for producing hydrogen gas from
      water vapor includes impacting at least one water cluster onto an
      electrically-charged palladium surface, the surface catalyzing the
      dissociation of the at least one water cluster to produce hydrogen
      gas. In another embodiment, the water cluster may be a protonated
      water cluster or any other type of water cluster. The hydrogen gas
      may pass through the membrane and be collected. The collected
      hydrogen gas can then be used as fuel.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Terahertz Radiation Energy</b><br>
      <br>
      [0065] Water clusters have the unusual property that their
      vibrational frequencies extend into the Terahertz region of the
      electromagnetic spectrum. Through research collaboration between
      the Center for Terahertz Research at RPI and HEV, it is shown that
      laser-stimulated water vapor is a strong emitter of Terahertz
      radiation, and believed to be associated with water cluster
      Terahertz vibrational modes like the 1.5 THz mode shown in FIG. 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] In one embodiment, a method for clean energy production
      includes applying laser stimulation to water vapor to generate
      Terahertz radiation energy from at least one water cluster
      included in the water vapor, and extracting the Terahertz
      radiation energy from the at least one water cluster. The
      Terahertz radiation energy from the water clusters may be
      extracted either directly or through frequency conversion, and
      utilized. Any form or type of frequency conversion process may be
      used, for example, four wave mixing. In particular, non-degenerate
      four-wave mixing (ND-FWM) may be used.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Nuclear Fusion</b><br>
      <br>
      [0067] In some embodiments, a method for clean energy production
      includes applying stimulation to at least one water cluster to
      induce vibration of the at least one water cluster at a frequency
      in the range of 0.5 terahertz and 32 terahertz. . In one
      embodiment, each of the water clusters is a heavy water cluster
      with Deuterium instead of Hydrogen. For example, ordinary hydrogen
      water clusters may be replaced with their heavy-water counterparts
      such as (D2O)2iD&lt;+&gt;. In another embodiment, the water
      clusters do not include Deuterium. Conditions for the water
      clusters may be induced, for example, to undergo significant low
      energy nuclear reactions. The conditions may include, for example,
      temperature, radiation and use of a catalyst. The nuclear water
      cluster Terahertz vibrations may be internally or externally
      stimulated.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] In one embodiment, water clusters can be impacted onto a
      hydride surface to induce nuclear fusion. The impacted water
      clusters may be protonated water clusters. Energy released from
      the nuclear fusion may then be collected and utilized as a clean
      energy. The fusion may be either Deuterium-Deuterium fusion or
      Hydrogen-Hydrogen fusion. Such a use of water clusters may be a
      practical method of inducing nuclear fusion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Gas Hydrate Liberation</b><br>
      <br>
      [0069] One aspect of water cluster vibronic interaction relates to
      methods and systems for extracting gases, including methods and
      systems for extracting methane and other trapped gas from their
      hydrate cages. Gas hydrates, also referred to as clathrate
      hydrates, are crystalline combinations of one or more gases such
      as methane, natural gas and other hydrocarbon gas molecules of
      small linear dimension (i.e., C i -C 4 or larger carbon containing
      molecules which have a maximum linear dimension of about 10
      nanometers (100 Angstroms) such as neopentane) and water formed
      into a substance that may look like ice but can be unstable at
      standard temperature and pressure. The gas hydrate also may
      contain other light gases (CO 2 , H 2 S5 N 2 , etc.). The gas
      molecules may be physically entrapped or engaged in the expanded
      lattice of the water network comprising hydrogen bonded molecules.
      The structure may be stable due to weak Van der Waals bonding
      between the gas and the water molecules and hydrogen-bonding
      between water molecules within the cage structure.<br>
      <br>
      Gas hydrates may be found under the ocean floor and in permafrost.
      Gas hydrate is increasingly being considered as a source of fuel
      to be tapped. Gas hydrates may occur abundantly in nature, both in
      Arctic regions and in marine sediments. Methane hydrate can be
      stable in ocean floor sediments at water depths greater than 300
      meters and, where it occurs, it is known to cement loose sediments
      in a surface layer several hundred meters thick.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Natural gas may be produced economically from the methane
      and other gas hydrates on a large scale. The U.S. Geological
      Survey (USGS) estimates that the methane hydrates beneath U.S.
      waters can hold some 200 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and
      may be enough to supply all the nation's energy needs for more
      than 2,000 years at current rates of use. These immense amounts of
      natural gas can have significant implications for energy resources
      and climate, but the nature of hydrates and their impacts on the
      environment are generally not well understood.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The presence of gas hydrates has several hazardous
      implications and environmental concerns. In the Gulf of Mexico,
      oil companies are drilling into water more than 1,000 meters deep
      and are starting to drill through layers of methane hydrate. This
      can cause the hydrate to dissociate. If the focus is limited to
      extracting the oil beneath the gas hydrate layers and/or
      appropriate precautions are not taken, gas may be released which
      can explode and cause drilling crews to lose control of their
      wells. Engineers are worried that unstable hydrate layers could
      give way beneath oil platforms or even play a role in triggering
      tsunamis. There is also concern that global warming could melt
      some shallow methane deposits, releasing millions of tons of this
      potent greenhouse gas into the air.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Gas hydrates have not been typically economical to harvest
      using other existing methods. Supplying heat as steam at the
      bottom of a drill hole can be inefficient because of heat loss to
      the wall of the hole. Supplying electrical heat can also be
      inefficient because transmission of that heat to the water-hydrate
      interface would require a higher temperatures in the area of the
      heater. Physically mining the deposits and releasing/capturing the
      gas at the surface may be technically possible but can be
      economically prohibitive. Since the days of plentiful oil and gas
      may be numbered, and countries will require new energy sources to
      keep their economies moving, gas hydrates could be an answer. The
      worldwide amounts of carbon-based fuel bound in gas hydrates is
      estimated to total twice the amount of carbon-based fuel found in
      other known fossil fuels on Earth. This estimate was made with
      available information from U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and other
      studies. Extraction of methane from hydrates could provide a
      useful energy resource. Additionally, other conventional gas
      resources currently trapped beneath methane hydrate layers in
      ocean sediments may yet be released.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Research efforts have been directed to reducing the
      problems of gas hydrates in petroleum product lines, by either
      inhibiting the formation thereof or dissociating gas hydrates
      which are present and/or recovering the gases from the hydrates
      for beneficial use. For example, PCT application number
      PCT/US97/24202 reviews a variety of prior art research focused
      upon these. This reference discloses the use of electromagnetic
      radiation over a broad frequency range 100 megahertz (MHz) to 3000
      gigahertz (GHz) (wavelength roughly ranging from 0.1 millimeter
      (mm) to 3 meter (m)) to heat and dissociate hydrocarbon gas
      hydrates, with microwave radiation stated as being preferred.
      Microwave radiation, which has a wavelength in the 0.1 mm to 1 mm
      range, is widely used to transfer energy to materials containing
      liquid water (e.g., as in a conventional microwave oven wherein
      food is heated by the resultant heating of the aqueous component
      of the food). In the case of a hydrate, sufficient microwave
      exposure can impart energy to the water molecules and cause the
      breaking of the hydrogen bonds of the water in the clathrate
      structure in addition to heating the water molecules.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Energy of a targeted wavelength may be applied to release a
      contained gas within a gas hydrate by electromagnetically inducing
      collective vibrational modes of the gas hydrate. In one
      embodiment, a method is provided for selectively releasing trapped
      gas molecules from their hydrate cages and harvesting the released
      gas molecules. The trapped gas in the gas hydrate may be methane
      or any other gas, including hyrocarbons. Sub-millimeter wavelength
      radiation in the 0.5 - 32 THz region of the electromagnetic
      spectrum may be applied to the gas hydrate. At least a portion of
      the trapped gas is released, via energy gap reduction associated
      with the clathrate hydrate and induced by the radiation. The
      released gas may then be harnessed as fuel energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] In further detail, sub-millimeter radiation in the 0.5 - 32
      THz region of the electromagnetic spectrum may be applied to
      methane or other trapped hydrocarbon gas hydrate to excite the
      large-amplitude gas-hydrate vibrations (i.e., instead of simply
      imparting heat energy directly to the water molecules). In one
      embodiment, this directly impacts the hydrogen-bonding between the
      water molecules in the hydrate. The vibrations induced by the
      electromagnetic radiation can cause the energy gap between the
      highest-energy occupied gas-hydrate bonding molecular orbitals
      (HOMOs) and lowest-energy, otherwise unoccupied gas- hydrate
      anti-bonding molecular orbitals (LUMOs) to close. This can result
      in the pouring of electrons from the bonding into the anti-bonding
      gas-hydrate orbitals, thereby causing the release of the gas from
      its water- clathrate cages. This vibronic process can be more
      efficient in releasing the gases from the clathrate structure than
      broad frequency microwave or other electromagnetic heating
      process.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Spacecraft Propulsion</b><br>
      <br>
      [0077] Gridded electrostatic ion thrusters for interplanetary and
      interstellar spacecraft propulsion typically utilize xenon gas as
      a source for ions. This gas has no charge and is ionized by
      bombarding it with energetic electrons. The electrons are provided
      from a hot cathode filament and accelerated in the electrical
      field between a cathode and an anode. In another embodiment, the
      electrons may be accelerated by the oscillating electric field
      induced by an alternating magnetic field of a coil, which results
      in a self-sustaining discharge (radiofrequency ion thruster).
      Positively charged water cluster ions, such as occurring naturally
      in water vapor or harvested from interstellar space (see W. W.
      Duley, Molecular Clusters in Interstellar Clouds, Astrophys. J.
      471, L57, 1996), may be used instead of ionized xenon.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] The positively charged water cluster ions are extracted by
      a system consisting of a plurality of multi-aperture grids. After
      entering the grid system via the plasma sheath, the cluster ions
      are accelerated due to the potential difference between the first
      and second grids. In some embodiments, the first grid is referred
      to as a screen and the second grid referred to as an accelerator
      grid. The water cluster ions can be accelerated to an ion energy
      of at least one keV, generating the thrust. This embodiment of an
      ion thruster emits a beam of positive charged water cluster ions.
      In order to avoid a charge-up of the spacecraft, a cathode placed
      near the engine emits additional electrons (the electron current
      is basically the same as the ion current) into the ion beam. This
      also prevents the beam of ions from returning to the spacecraft
      and thereby canceling the thrust. Therefore, neutral water
      clusters may also emitted can contribute to the thrust.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] In another embodiment, negatively charged water clusters
      are harvested or generated and used in place of the positively
      charged water clusters. The system of multi-aperture grids are
      similarly used to extract and accelerate the negatively charged
      water clusters, by adjusting the potential differences between the
      grids. This embodiment of an ion thruster emits a beam of
      negatively charged water cluster ions. In order to avoid the
      charging-up of the spacecraft an anode may be placed near the
      engine. Therefore, neutral water clusters may also emitted can
      contribute to the thrust.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TERAHERTZ RADIATION TECHNOLOGIES </b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Terahertz Radiation Generation</b><br>
      <br>
      [0080] In modern terahertz sensing and imaging spectroscopy, water
      can, in some embodiments, be a barrier due to radiation absorption
      in the Terahertz frequency range. Water clusters, however can also
      be used in the generation of intense broadband Terahertz
      radiation. In one embodiment, a method for generating terahertz
      radiation includes applying a laser pulse to water clusters in
      water vapor. The laser pulse may be of any intensity necessary to
      activate the vibronic properties, notably the terahertz-frequency
      vibrations and the large electric dipole moments of water clusters
      of the water clusters. The water vapor may be contained in a gas
      cell or injected from a gas jet nozzle. The large oscillating
      electric dipole moments of water clusters present in the water
      vapor in either systems can significantly contribute to the
      generation of intense Terahertz radiation. The peak power levels
      and broadband frequency range of the Terahertz radiation generated
      from these systems can then be applied to non-linear spectroscopy,
      imagining, communications, and biomedical diagnostics and
      treatments.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Terahertz Frequency Communications</b><br>
      <br>
      [0081] The term "Terahertz communications" can mean effective data
      rates exceeding 1 Terabit per second (usually on an optical
      carrier), or communication with a Terahertz carrier wave. Although
      greater bandwidths may be obtained at optical wavelengths with
      point-to-point optical communications, a number of reasons can
      make communications at Terahertz frequencies attractive. One
      reason may be the availability of the frequency band and the
      communications bandwidth. Frequencies above 300 GHz are currently
      unallocated by the Federal Commission. Terahertz communications is
      in the early stages of development, with first data transmission
      in this frequency range reported in the last few years. The
      disadvantages of communications at Terahertz frequencies arise
      through strong absorption through the atmosphere caused by water
      vapor as well as low efficiency and relatively low power available
      from currently available sources.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Water vapor can be a strong emitter of Terahertz radiation,
      as discussed in US Patent Application 11/582,817. Since water
      vapor can be a strong emitter of Terahertz radiation due to the
      stimulation of water clusters' vibronic properties present in
      water vapor in the atmosphere, this property may be used to
      promote wireless communications both in land based and satellite
      systems. Terahertz radiation can be generated from water clusters
      present in the atmosphere and space and then tuned to specific
      frequencies that match up with the known "atmospheric windows" in
      the water vapor spectrum, around the 1.3 THz and 1.5 THz
      frequencies. The Terahertz radiation can be of varying intensity,
      and may be controlled, for example, by stimulation of water
      clusters' vibronic properties. Such terahertz frequencies do not
      suffer from strong absorption through the atmosphere and can be
      utilized to produce astronomical data from ground based Terahertz
      telescopes. These frequencies can also function as the carrier
      frequencies for communications signals over long distances.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Advanced Defense Systems Design</b><br>
      <br>
      [0083] The interaction between high-intensity, ultra-short laser
      pulses and water-cluster plasmas generated from water vapor can
      lead to an emission of intense, coherent, short-pulse radiation at
      terahertz frequencies (see Johnson et al, "Water Vapor: An
      Extraordinary Terahertz Wave Source Under Optical Excitation",
      Physics Letters A 372, 6037, 2008). A system and method of using
      short-pulse radiation at terahertz frequencies to deactivate an
      electronic system is disclosed. The system and method may be used
      to target an electronic system a substantial distance away. The
      system and method may be adapted to create a virtual shield for
      any advancing army, navy or air force. The delivery of the
      Terahertz radiation pulses may be silent, invisible, smokeless and
      odorless. The short pulse radiation may be used to destroy enemy
      weapon systems, command and control structures and bases. By
      adjusting the frequency of the Terahertz radiation, human beings
      may be unharmed.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] An embodiment of such a defense system may be implemented
      to emit Terahertz radiation from any vantage point, such as from
      space satellites, from aircraft, or from a tower. Beaming the
      short- pulse radiation at terahertz frequencies from a vantage
      point can provide an electronic shield for or against an advancing
      army, airforce or navy. The electronic shield may create a zone
      within which electronic devices are disabled or partially
      disabled. The zone may also prevent enemy transport vehicles and
      projectiles to advance past the zone by disabling any electronic
      devices on board the vehicles or projectiles. In some embodiments,
      the vehicles or projectiles may not be fully disabled but enemy
      activities can be disrupted. Another embodiment of the same
      technology may be used to create distortions in the radar
      detection systems of an enemy. Application of the technology can
      be made possible from a distance away, based in part on relatively
      low atmospheric absorption described above. This application can
      also be adapted to counter- terrorism, for example, for use in the
      airport or other public areas. For example, using terahertz
      radiation pulses to disable electronic devices suspected to be
      involved in terror acts may be safer than conventional methods.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS AND REACTIVITY </b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Oxidation Applications</b><br>
      <br>
      [0085] The water clusters described in this patent can have highly
      reactive oxygen components. These water clusters can be used in
      various methods, particularly in "oxidative" reactions (i.e.
      reactions that involve transfer of an oxygen from one molecule to
      another) though not limited to such reactions. The clusters can be
      employed in any oxidative reaction, including but not limited to
      the combustion applications mentioned in the clean energy
      production applications. The water clusters, in combination with
      any appropriate reaction partner, can increase chemical reaction
      rates and chemical synthesis. In some embodiments, a method of
      increasing reactive behavior in chemical reactions associated with
      water includes applying radiation, at a frequency in the range of
      0.5 terahertz to 32 terahertz, to a plurality of water clusters in
      the chemical reaction. In other embodiments, other types of
      stimulus to activate the vibronic interactions of water clusters
      can also improve reactive behavior in chemical reactions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Biocidal Applications</b><br>
      <br>
      [0086] Negatively charged water clusters and water clusters
      clathrating biocatalytic elements such as silver (Ag) in the form
      of nano-sprays and nano-emulsions can exhibit biocidal activity.
      For example, they may kill pathogenic bacteria such as
      Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Salmonella, E. CoIi, as well as the
      spore-forming bacterium. Bacillus Anthracis, responsible for
      Anthrax. A bicatalytic element can disable an enzyme of a
      bacteria, virus, fungi, or any other form and type of pathogenic
      agent. When clathrated by water clusters, the vibronic
      interactions helps to activate the bicatalytic element's catalytic
      interaction with the enzyme of a pathogenic agent, disabling the
      pathogenic agent.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] These biocidal formulations may be delivered via various
      media and using various methods. For example, an oil-based medium
      may be used to deliver a biocidal emulsion. The emulsion can be
      injected or directly applied to a mass afflicted with a bacteria
      for example. In one embodiment, nano-emulsions of
      silver-clathrated water clusters can be applied directly to the
      skin and function as an "over-the-counter" antiseptic.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] In one embodiment, a method for imparting a biocidal
      property to a water-based spray or emulsion against a pathogenic
      agent includes applying at least one negatively-charged water
      cluster to a pathogenic agent. In another embodiment, a method for
      imparting a biocidal property against a pathogenic agent includes
      clathrating a bicatalytic element with a water cluster. The
      negatively-charged water cluster or clathrated bicatalytic element
      is then applied to the pathogenic agent to kill or disable the
      pathogenic agent. In one embodiment, the bicatalytic element is
      silver. The negatively-charged water cluster or clathrated
      bicatalytic element may be further stimulated by radiation to
      improve the biocidal activity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PHARMACEUTICAL &amp; BIOMEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES </b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Pharmaceutical Drug Development</b><br>
      <br>
      [0089] Water cluster vibronic interactions may be used to design
      novel drugs that accelerate electron-transfer, proton transfer and
      chemical reactions. These vibronically active water clusters may
      be present within the body naturally or delivered in water vapor
      or water-in-oil nano-emulsions. Such water clusters can lower the
      energy barrier for the reactions along the cluster
      Terahertz-frequency vibrational modes. This method may be used in
      conjunction with stimulated Terahertz radiation to further enhance
      drug-biomolecule resonance. A method of delivering pharmaceuticals
      to diseased cells and bio-molecules includes using water-cluster
      micelles of the type shown schematically in FIG. 11. A micelle is
      an aggregate of surfactant molecules dispersed in a liquid
      colloid, in this case, water clusters. The unique THz-frequency
      vibrations of these water cluster (or nano-cluster) micelles can
      facilitate their resonance interaction with diseased cell and
      other biomolecules, including DNA and proteins. Stabilizing
      surfactants for the micelle can include fatty acid and alcohol
      ethoxylates.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Transdermal Delivery</b><br>
      <br>
      [0090] The pharmaceutical industry has devoted a significant part
      of its resources towards the development of drugs that can be
      delivered transdermally to the bloodstream (through the stratum
      corneum and deeper skin layers) for the treatment of afflictions
      ranging from skin disorders to bodily disease. Transdermal drug
      delivery systems provide for the controlled release of drugs
      directly into the bloodstream through intact skin. Transdermal
      drug delivery can be an attractive alternative when oral drug
      treatment is not possible or desirable. In particular, with
      transdermal administration, therapeutic activity may be prolonged
      and controlled activity can be achieved.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] First-principles quantum-chemical computations of the
      electronic structure and vibrational modes of water nano-clusters
      like the one, (H2O)2IH&lt;+&gt; shown in FIG. 7 suggests
      application of water clusters to transdermal delivery. Such
      permeating water clusters can (1) clathrate and deactivate lipid
      hydrophobes responsible for the stratum corneum hydration barrier,
      (2) thereby enable transdermal delivery of clathrated
      pharmaceuticals, (3) scavenge free radicals that damage epidermal
      cells and interfere with drug delivery, and (4) be subject to less
      water evaporation from the skin because of the intrinsic
      stabilities of the water nanoclusters.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] Water clusters' vibration frequencies extend into the
      terahertz (THz) region of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as
      the 1.5 THz vibrational mode shown in FIG. 7 for the
      (H2O)2IH&lt;+&gt; cluster&nbsp; by the oxygen atomic displacement
      vectors. Water cluster "surface" Terahertz vibrational modes like
      the one above can be important because they couple or "resonate"
      with Terahertz-frequency vibrations of the amino- acid residues in
      epidermal proteins. Water in the form of small clusters is
      therefore not merely a solvent for epidermal proteins and other
      bio-molecules but helps to activate them through the resonant
      dynamics of the clustered water molecules at the skin cellular
      interfaces.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] In U.S. Patents 5,800,576 and 5,997,590, and US Patent
      Application US2006/0110418, it was shown that small clusters of
      water molecules can be created in water-in-oil (W/O)
      nano-emulsions, providing a medium for delivering active water
      clusters to the skin to yield high epidermal permeability and
      improved delivery of water to within the outer layer of human
      skin. Pharmaceutical ingredients that can be transdermally
      delivered by nano-emulsions include FDA-approved transdermally
      deliverable "classic" drugs such as hormonally active
      testosterone, progesterone, and estradiol, glycyril trinitrate
      (e.g., for treatment of angina), hyoscine (e.g., for seasickness),
      nicotine (e.g., for smoking cessation); prostaglandin El (e.g.,
      for treatment of erectile dysfunction); proteins and peptides; DNA
      and oligo-nucleotides (e.g., for gene therapy; DNA vaccines).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Water Cluster Micelles for Drug Delivery to the Brain</b><br>
      <br>
      [0094] The problem of delivering pharmaceutical agents to targeted
      areas of the brain is a known challenge in the treatment of brain
      disorders. This is due to the blood-brain barrier, which prevents
      the efficient and effective delivery of many diagnostic and
      therapeutic agents. A method of delivering such agents across the
      blood-brain barrier includes using water-cluster micelles of the
      type shown schematically in FIG. 11. A micelle is an aggregate of
      surfactant molecules dispersed in a liquid colloid, in this case,
      water clusters. The unique THz-frequency vibrations of these water
      cluster (or nano-cluster) micelles can facilitate their
      penetration through the blood-brain barrier. Such micelles can
      deliver pharmaceuticals, such as antineoplastic drugs, to brain
      tumors and other disorders. Stabilizing surfactants for the
      micelles can include fatty acids and alcohol ethoxylates.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Biomedical Treatments</b><br>
      <br>
      [0095] Many diseases are associated with the conformational
      "misfolding" of proteins. Water "restructured" as water clusters,
      or "nano-clusters" can play a role in the proper folding of
      proteins. The "misfolding" of proteins, making them dysfunctional
      and disease-causing may be associated with the failure of water
      molecules to associate in clusters that properly interact with the
      protein amino-acid residues. The 4379139vl Attorney Docket No.:
      2007135-0007 (HYDR) development of drugs to treat such diseases
      should therefore be focused on the restoration of water clustering
      at the protein interfaces.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] Water clusters' vibration frequencies extend into the
      terahertz (THz) region of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as
      the 1.5 Terahertz vibrational mode shown in FIG. 7 for the cluster
      by the oxygen atomic displacement vectors. Water cluster "surface"
      Terahertz vibrational modes like the one shown in FIG. 7 can be
      important because they couple or "resonate" with
      Terahertz-frequency vibrations of the amino-acid residues in
      proteins. This property may be key to optimizing the delivery of
      drugs to and their interaction with drug-receptor sites, where
      Terahertz vibrations of water clusters clathrating the drug in our
      proprietary nano-emulsions may provide the resonance need to
      restore the interfacial water restructuring necessary for proper
      protein folding. Formation of hydrogen bonds between a drug
      molecule and a water molecule will polarize the latter, resulting
      in former hydrogen bonding to other water molecules and the
      formation of water clusters that play a key role in drug receptor
      identification. Even in the absence of hydrogen bonding, drug
      molecules may tend to cause water restructuring and the formation
      of cage-like structures, which implies that the drug molecule will
      have a "water signature".<br>
      <br>
      [0097] Additionally, the application of intense 1.5 THz radiation
      externally (or internally via "nanobots") to restructure water
      near cancerous tissue, which is known to harbor more "liquid-like"
      water, can possibly complement drug treatment. For example, skin
      or sub-coetaneous tumors may treated with an intense external
      Terahertz radiation source, alone or in combination with a
      water-in-oil nanoemulsion formulation to restructure the bulk
      water-like properties of cancerous tissue into vibronically active
      water clusters, restoring healthy cell and tissue functioning.
      Instead of an intense external Terahertz radiation source, other
      stimuli may be applied to promote the vibronic interactions of
      water clusters.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] Having described certain embodiments of methods and systems
      for utilizing the vibronic interactions of water clusters, it will
      now become apparent to one of skill in the art that other
      embodiments incorporating the concepts of the disclosure may be
      used. Therefore, the disclosure should not be limited to certain
      embodiments, but rather should be limited only by the spirit and
      scope of the following claims.<br>

      As you probably know, from sucking down cans of Coke and
      masticating on candy, sugar — glucose, fructose, sucrose, dextrose
      — is an excellent source of energy. Biologically speaking, sugar
      molecules are energy-dense, easy to transport, and cheap to
      digest. There is a reason why almost every living cell on Earth
      generates its energy (ATP) from glucose. Now, researchers at
      Virginia Tech have successfully created a sugar-powered fuel cell
      that has an energy storage density of 596 amp-hours per kilo — or
      “one order of magnitude” higher than lithium-ion batteries. This
      fuel cell is refillable with a solution of maltodextrin, and its
      only by products are electricity and water. The chief researcher,
      Y.H. Percival Zhang, says the tech could be commercialized in as
      soon as three years.<br>
      <br>
      Now, it’s not exactly news that sugar is an excellent energy
      source. As a culture we’ve probably known about it since before we
      were Homo sapiens. The problem is, unless you’re a living organism
      or some kind of incendiary device, extracting that energy is
      difficult. In nature, an enzymatic pathway is used — a production
      line of tailor-made enzymes that meddle with the glucose molecules
      until they become ATP. Because it’s easy enough to produce enzymes
      in large quantities, researchers have tried to create fuel cells
      that use artificial “metabolism” to break down glucose into
      electricity (biobatteries), but it has historically proven very
      hard to find the right pathway for maximum efficiency and to keep
      the enzymes in the right place over a long period of time.<br>

        are enzymes.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Now, however, Zhang and friends at Virginia Tech appear to have
      built a high-density fuel cell that uses an enzymatic pathway to
      create a lot of electricity from glucose. There doesn’t seem to be
      much information on how stable this biobattery is over multiple
      refills, but if Zhang thinks it could be commercialized in three
      years, that’s a very good sign. Curiously, the research paper says
      that the enzymes are non-immobilized — meaning Zhang found a
      certain battery chemistry that doesn’t require the enzymes to be
      kept in place… or, alternatively, that it will only work for a
      very short time.<br>

      <i>Energy densities of various battery types. “15% Maltodextrin”,
        in dark blue, is the battery being discussed here.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      The Virginia Tech biobattery uses 13 enzymes, plus air (it’s an
      air-breathing biobattery), to produce nearly 24 electrons from a
      single glucose unit. This equates to a power output of 0.8 mW/cm,
      current density of 6 mA/cm, and energy storage density of 596
      Ah/kg. This last figure is impressive, at roughly 10 times the
      energy density of the lithium-ion batteries in your mobile
      devices. [Research paper: doi:10.1038/ncomms4026 - "A
      high-energy-density sugar biobattery based on a synthetic
      enzymatic pathway"]<br>
      <br>
      If Zhang’s biobatteries pan out, you might soon be recharging your
      smartphone by pouring in a solution of 15% maltodextrin. That
      battery would not only be very safe (it produces water and
      electricity), but very cheap to run and very green. This seems to
      fit in perfectly with Zhang’s homepage, which talks about how his
      main goals in life are replacing crude oil with sugar, and feeding
      the world.<br>
      <br>
      The other area in which biobatteries might be useful is powering
      implanted devices, such as pacemakers — or, in the future,
      subcutaneous sensors and computers. Such a biobattery could feed
      on the glucose in your bloodstream, providing an endless supply of
      safe electricity for the myriad implants that futuristic
      technocrats will surely have.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      High-energy-density, green, safe batteries are highly desirable
      for meeting the rapidly growing needs of portable electronics. The
      incomplete oxidation of sugars mediated by one or a few enzymes in
      enzymatic fuel cells suffers from low energy densities and slow
      reaction rates. Here we show that nearly 24 electrons per glucose
      unit of maltodextrin can be produced through a synthetic catabolic
      pathway that comprises 13 enzymes in an air-breathing enzymatic
      fuel cell. This enzymatic fuel cell is based on non-immobilized
      enzymes that exhibit a maximum power output of 0.8?mW?cm-2 and a
      maximum current density of 6?mA?cm-2, which are far higher than
      the values for systems based on immobilized enzymes. Enzymatic
      fuel cells containing a 15% (wt/v) maltodextrin solution have an
      energy-storage density of 596?Ah?kg-1, which is one order of
      magnitude higher than that of lithium-ion batteries. Sugar-powered
      biobatteries could serve as next-generation green power sources,
      particularly for portable electronics.<br>

      Dr Haruko Obokata - A young researcher in Japan has been facing
      the world's media after her stem cell studies were heralded as a
      "major scientific discovery."<br>
      <br>
      Dr Haruko Obokata's work, published in the journal Nature, showed
      stem cells can now be made quickly just by dipping blood cells
      into acid.<br>
      <br>
      The breakthrough at the Riken Centre for Developmental Biology was
      achieved in mouse blood cells, but could have the potential to
      start a new age of personalised medicine.<br>

      Stem cell researchers are heralding a "major scientific
      discovery", with the potential to start a new age of personalised
      medicine.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists in Japan showed stem cells can now be made quickly just
      by dipping blood cells into acid.<br>
      <br>
      Stem cells can transform into any tissue and are already being
      trialled for healing the eye, heart and brain.<br>
      <br>
      The latest development, published in the journal Nature, could
      make the technology cheaper, faster and safer.<br>
      <br>
      The human body is built of cells with a specific role - nerve
      cells, liver cells, muscle cells - and that role is fixed.<br>
      <br>
      However, stem cells can become any other type of cell, and they
      have become a major field of research in medicine for their
      potential to regenerate the body.<br>
      <br>
      Embryos are one, ethically charged, source of stem cells. Nobel
      prize winning research also showed that skin cells could be
      "genetically reprogrammed" to become stem cells (termed induced
      pluripotent stem cells).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Acid bath</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Now a study shows that shocking blood cells with acid could also
      trigger the transformation into stem cells - this time termed STAP
      (stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency) cells.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Haruko Obokata, from the Riken Centre for Developmental Biology
      in Japan, said she was "really surprised" that cells could respond
      to their environment in this way.<br>
      <br>
      She added: "It's exciting to think about the new possibilities
      these findings offer us, not only in regenerative medicine, but
      cancer as well."<br>
      <br>
      The breakthrough was achieved in mouse blood cells, but research
      is now taking place to achieve the same results with human blood.<br>
      <br>
      Chris Mason, professor of regenerative medicine at University
      College London, said if it also works in humans then "the age of
      personalised medicine would have finally arrived."<br>
      <br>
      He told the BBC: "I thought - 'my God that's a game changer!' It's
      a very exciting, but surprise, finding.<br>
      <br>
      "It looks a bit too good to be true, but the number of experts who
      have reviewed and checked this, I'm sure that it is.<br>
      <br>
      "If this works in people as well as it does in mice, it looks
      faster, cheaper and possibly safer than other cell reprogramming
      technologies - personalised reprogrammed cell therapies may now be
      viable."<br>
      <br>
      For age-related macular degeneration, which causes sight loss, it
      takes 10 months to go from a patient's skin sample to a therapy
      that could be injected into their eye -and at huge cost.<br>
      <br>
      Prof Mason said weeks could be knocked off that time which would
      save money, as would cheaper components.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Haruko Obokata explains how she nearly gave up on the project
      when fellow researchers didn't believe what she had found<br>
      <br>
      <b>'Revolutionary'</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The finding has been described as "remarkable" by the Medical
      Research Council's Prof Robin Lovell-Badge and as "a major
      scientific discovery" by Dr Dusko Ilic, a reader in stem cell
      science at Kings College London.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Ilic added: "The approach is indeed revolutionary.<br>
      <br>
      "It will make a fundamental change in how scientists perceive the
      interplay of environment and genome."<br>
      <br>
      But he added: "It does not bring stem cell-based therapy closer.
      We will need to use the same precautions for the cells generated
      in this way as for the cells isolated from embryos or reprogrammed
      with a standard method."<br>
      <br>
      And Prof Lovell-Badge said: "It is going to be a while before the
      nature of these cells are understood, and whether they might prove
      to be useful for developing therapies, but the really intriguing
      thing to discover will be the mechanism underlying how a low pH
      shock triggers reprogramming - and why it does not happen when we
      eat lemon or vinegar or drink cola?" <br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The technology described herein relates to methods, assays, and
      compositions relating to causing a cell to assume a more
      pluripotent state, e.g. without introducing foreign genetic
      material.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Current methods of obtaining pluripotent cells rely
      primarily upon tissues of limited availability (e.g. embryonic
      tissue or cord blood) or the addition of reprogramming factors
      (Hanna, J. et al. Cell 2008 133, 250-264; Hockemeyer, D. et al.
      Cell stem cell 2008 3, 346-353; Kim, D. et al. Cell stem cell 2009
      4, 472-476; Kim, J. B. Nature 2009 461, 649-643; Okabe, M. et al.
      Blood 2009 114, 1764-1767), which involves introduction of
      exogenous nucleic acids. Methods of readily producing stem cells,
      particularly autologous stem cells, without the complications
      introduced by the addition of exogenous reprogramming factors,
      would accelerate research into cellular differentiation and the
      development of stem-cell based therapies. While it is hypothesized
      that damage to cells as a result of exposure to irritants, such as
      burns, chemical injury, trauma and radiation, may alter normal
      somatic cells to become cancer cells, there is no direct evidence
      that healthy adult somatic cells can be converted to other states
      without the specific manipulation of reprogramming factors.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Previously, researchers have reported finding "adult stem
      cells" in adult tissues (Reynolds, B. A. &amp; Weiss, S. Science
      1992 255, 1707-1710; Megeney, L. A. et al. ,Genes &amp;
      development 1996 10, 1173-1183; Caplan, A. I. Journal of
      orthopaedic research 1991 9, 641-650; Lavker, R. M. &amp; Sun, T.
      T. The Journal of investigative dermatology 1983 81, 121s-127s).
      Such reports remain controversial. For example, researchers
      looking for cells expressing the stem cell marker Oct4 failed to
      find Oct4-expressing cells in adult bone marrow in normal
      homeostasis, (Lengner, C. J. et al. Cell Cycle 2008 7, 725-728;
      Berg, J. S. &amp; Goodell, M. A. Cell stem cell 2007 1, 359-360),
      while others report the ability to isolate Oct4-expressing cells
      from different adult tissues (Jiang, Y. et al. Nature 2010 418,
      41-49; D'Ippolito, G. et al. Journal of cell science 2004 117,
      2971-2981; Johnson, J. et al. Cell 2005 122, 303-315; Kucia, M. et
      al. Leukemia 2006 20, 857-869; Kuroda, Y. et al. PNAS 2011 107,
      8639-8643; Obokata, H. et al. Tissue engineering. 2011 Part A 17,
      607-615; Rahnemai-Azar, A. et al. Cytotherapy 2011 13, 179-192;
      Huang, Y. et al. Transplantation 2010 89, 677-685; Zuba-Surma, E.
      K. et al. Journal of cellular and molecular medicine 2011 15,
      1319-1328; Paczkowska, E. et al. Annals of transplantation 2011
      16, 59-71). It has been hypothesized that these cells represent
      either a population of adult stem cells or are merely an artifact
      of the techniques being used. In either case, they remain rare and
      do not represent an adequate source of pluripotent cells for
      research and therapeutic purposes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[00176] Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [00177] All organisms appear to have a common instinct to survive
      injury related to stressful stimuli by adapting themselves to the
      environment and regenerating their bodies. In plants, ontogenesis
      is observed not only in zygotes but also in fully differentiated
      cells and immature pollen. In vertebrates, newts are capable of
      regenerating several anatomical structures and organs, including
      their limbs &lt;1&gt;. Of particular note is that the remarkable
      regenerative capacity demonstrated by both plants and newts is
      induced by external stimuli, which cause cellular
      dedifferentiation of previously fully differentiated somatic
      cells. While billions of years have passed from the earliest form
      of life, and different organisms have evolved in unique ways, this
      survival instinct may be inherited from a common ancestor to
      modern-era organisms. Although terminally differentiated mammalian
      cells are normally believed to be incapable of reversing the
      differentiation process, mammals may retain a previously
      unappreciated program to escape death in response to drastic
      environmental changes.<br>
      <br>
      [00178] The plant callus, a mass of proliferating cells formed in
      response to external stimuli, such as wounding, which can be
      stimulated in culture by the plant hormones . The callus contains
      reprogrammed somatic cells, referred to as callus cells, each of
      which is capable of clonally regenerating the entire body. Callus
      cells are not inherent in plants, but are generated from somatic
      cells in response to external stimuli. Although recent studies
      demonstrated that mammalian somatic cells can be reprogrammed by
      exogenous processes, such as gene induction 3- &lt;"&gt;7 ,
      reprogramming of mammalian somatic cells in response to external
      physical and or chemical stimuli, in a manner that parallels
      plants, has not been reported. Interestingly, it is believed that
      extreme external stimuli, such as exposure to irritants, including
      burns, chemical injury, trauma and radiation, may alter normal
      somatic cells to become cancer cells. Such experiences seem to
      indicate that external stimuli will result in mammalian cellular
      change.<br>
      <br>
      [00179] In this study, it was hypothesized that mammalian cells
      retain a mechanism to survive exposure to significant external
      stress, in the same manner as plants. This report presents
      evidence that application of significant physical and chemical
      stimuli can cause reprogramming of mature, fully differentiated
      mammalian somatic cells, procured from various tissues, and that
      such stress altered cells are capable of forming an animal callus
      containing "animal callus cells", which can regenerate the clonal
      body...<br>
