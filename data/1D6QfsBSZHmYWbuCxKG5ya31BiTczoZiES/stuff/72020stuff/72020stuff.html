            bodies so that these bodies will not allow the inclination
            towards spiritual ideas to develop and all their lives
            people will believe only in the physical world they perceive
            with the senses. These inoculations will affect the human
            body in a way that will make it refuse to give a home to the
            spirutal inclinations of the soul. People will be inoculated
            against the inclination to entertain spritual ideas... I
            have told you that the spirits of darkness are going to
            inspire their human hosts, in whom they will be dwelling, to
            find a vaccine that will drive all inclination towards
            spirituality out of people's souls when they are very
            young...<br>
            <br>
          </b><b> “In the future, we will eliminate the soul with
            medicine. Under the pretext of a ‘healthy point of view’,
            there will be a vaccine by which the human body will be
            treated as soon as possible directly at birth: So that the
            human being cannot develop the thought of the existence of
            soul and Spirit. To materialistic doctors, will be entrusted
            with the task of removing the soul of humanity. As today,
            people are vaccinated against this disease or that disease,
            so in the future: Children will be vaccinated with a
            substance that can be produced precisely in such a way that
            people, thanks to this vaccination, will be immune to being
            subjected to the “madness” of spiritual life.&nbsp; He would
            be extremely smart, but he would not develop a conscience,
            and that is the true goal of some materialistic circles.
            With such a vaccine, you can easily make the etheric
            (spiritual) body loose in the physical body. Once the
            etheric body is detached, the relationship between the
            universe and the etheric body would become extremely
            unstable, and man would become an automaton, for the
            physical body of man must be polished on this Earth by
            spiritual will.<br>
            <br>
            So, the vaccine becomes a kind of arymanique force; man can
            no longer get rid of a given materialistic feeling. He
            becomes materialistic of constitution and can no longer rise
            to the spiritual “.<br>

          </b>This past autumn, a professor at Wuhan University named
          Jau Tang was hard at work piecing together a thruster
          prototype that, at first, sounds too good to be true.<br>
          <br>
          The basic idea, he said in an interview, is that his device
          turns electricity directly into thrust — no fossil fuels
          required — by using microwaves to energize compressed air into
          a plasma state and shooting it out like a jet. Tang suggested,
          without a hint of self-aggrandizement, that it could likely be
          scaled up enough to fly large commercial passenger planes.
          Eventually, he says, it might even power spaceships...<br>

          <br>
          In a test of antiviral effectiveness against the virus that
          causes COVID-19, an extract from edible seaweeds substantially
          outperformed remdesivir, the current standard antiviral used
          to combat the disease. Heparin, a common blood thinner, and a
          heparin variant stripped of its anticoagulant properties,
          performed on par with Remdesivir in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2
          infection in mammalian cells.<br>
          <br>
          Published online&nbsp; in Cell Discovery, the research is the
          latest example of a decoy strategy researchers from the Center
          for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies (CBIS) at
          Rensselear Polytechnic Institute are developing against
          viruses like the novel coronavirus that spawned the current
          global health crisis.In a test of antiviral effectiveness
          against the virus that causes COVID-19, an extract from edible
          seaweeds substantially outperformed Remdesivir, the current
          standard antiviral used to combat the disease.<br>
          <br>
          The spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 latches onto
          the ACE-2 receptor, a molecule on the surface of human cells.
          Once secured, the virus inserts its own genetic material into
          the cell, hijacking the cellular machinery to produce replica
          viruses. But the virus could just as easily be persuaded to
          lock onto a decoy molecule that offers a similar fit. The
          neutralized virus would be trapped and eventually degrade
          naturally.<br>
          <br>
          Previous research has shown this decoy technique works in
          trapping other viruses, including dengue, Zika, and influenza
          A. To hear the researchers discuss their findings, watch this
          video.<br>

          “We’re learning how to block viral infection, and that is
          knowledge we are going to need if we want to rapidly confront
          pandemics,” said Jonathan Dordick, the lead researcher and a
          professor of chemical and biological engineering at Rensselaer
          Polytechnic Institute. “The reality is that we don’t have
          great antivirals. To protect ourselves against future
          pandemics, we are going to need an arsenal of approaches that
          we can quickly adapt to emerging viruses.”<br>
          <br>
          The Cell Discovery paper tests antiviral activity in three
          variants of heparin (heparin, trisulfated heparin, and a
          non-anticoagulant low molecular weight heparin) and two
          fucoidans (RPI-27 and RPI-28) extracted from seaweed. All five
          compounds are long chains of sugar molecules known as sulfated
          polysaccharides, a structural conformation that the results of
          a binding study published earlier this month in Antiviral
          Research suggested as an effective decoy.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers performed a dose response study known as an
          EC50 — shorthand for the effective concentration of the
          compound that inhibits 50% of viral infectivity — with each of
          the five compounds on mammalian cells. For the results of an
          EC50, which are given in a molar concentration, a lower value
          signals a more potent compound.<br>
          <br>
          RPI-27 yielded an EC50 value of approximately 83 nanomolar,
          while a similar previously published and independent in vitro
          test of remdesivir on the same mammalian cells yielded an EC50
          of 770 nanomolar. Heparin yielded an EC50 of 2.1 micromolar,
          or about one-third as active as remdesivir, and a
          non-anticoagulant analog of heparin yielded an EC50 of 5.0
          micromolar, about one-fifth as active as remdesivir.<br>
          <br>
          A separate test found no cellular toxicity in any of the
          compounds, even at the highest concentrations tested.<br>
          <br>
          “What interests us is a new way of getting at infection,” said
          Robert Linhardt, a Rensselaer professor of chemistry and
          chemical biology who is collaborating with Dordick to develop
          the decoy strategy. “The current thinking is that the COVID-19
          infection starts in the nose, and either of these substances
          could be the basis for a nasal spray. If you could simply
          treat the infection early, or even treat before you have the
          infection, you would have a way of blocking it before it
          enters the body.”<br>
          <br>
          Dordick added that compounds from seaweed “could serve as a
          basis for an oral delivery approach to address potential
          gastrointestinal infection.”<br>
          <br>
          In studying SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data, Dordick and Linhardt
          recognized several motifs on the structure of the spike
          protein that promised a fit compatible with heparin, a result
          borne out in the binding study. The spike protein is heavily
          encrusted in glycans, an adaptation that protects it from
          human enzymes which could degrade it, and prepares it to bind
          with a specific receptor on the cell surface.<br>
          <br>
          “It’s a very complicated mechanism that we quite frankly don’t
          know all the details about, but we’re getting more
          information,” said Dordick. “One thing that’s become clear
          with this study is that the larger the molecule, the better
          the fit. The more successful compounds are the larger sulfated
          polysaccharides that offer a greater number of sites on the
          molecules to trap the virus.”<br>
          <br>
          Molecular modeling based on the binding study revealed sites
          on the spike protein where the heparin was able to interact,
          raising the prospects for similar sulfated polysaccharides.<br>
          <br>

          </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b><b>Background</b><b><br>
          </b>A country level exploratory analysis was conducted to
          assess the impact of timing and type of national health
          policy/actions undertaken towards COVID-19 mortality and
          related health outcomes.<br>
          <b>Methods</b><b><br>
          </b>Information on COVID-19 policies and health outcomes were
          extracted from websites and country specific sources. Data
          collection included the government's action, level of national
          preparedness, and country specific socioeconomic factors. Data
          was collected from the top 50 countries ranked by number of
          cases. Multivariable negative binomial regression was used to
          identify factors associated with COVID-19 mortality and
          related health outcomes.<br>
          <b>Findings</b><b><br>
          </b>Increasing COVID-19 caseloads were associated with
          countries with higher obesity (adjusted rate ratio [RR]=1.06;
          95%CI: 1.01–1.11), median population age (RR=1.10; 95%CI:
          1.05–1.15) and longer time to border closures from the first
          reported case (RR=1.04; 95%CI: 1.01–1.08). Increased mortality
          per million was significantly associated with higher obesity
          prevalence (RR=1.12; 95%CI: 1.06–1.19) and per capita gross
          domestic product (GDP) (RR=1.03; 95%CI: 1.00–1.06). Reduced
          income dispersion reduced mortality (RR=0.88; 95%CI:
          0.83–0.93) and the number of critical cases (RR=0.92; 95% CI:
          0.87–0.97). Rapid border closures, full lockdowns, and
          wide-spread testing were not associated with COVID-19
          mortality per million people. However, full lockdowns
          (RR=2.47: 95%CI: 1.08–5.64) and reduced country vulnerability
          to biological threats (i.e. high scores on the global health
          security scale for risk environment) (RR=1.55; 95%CI:
          1.13–2.12) were significantly associated with increased
          patient recovery rates.<br>
          <b>Interpretation</b><b><br>
          </b>In this exploratory analysis, low levels of national
          preparedness, scale of testing and population characteristics
          were associated with increased national case load and overall
          mortality.<br>

          <b>&nbsp;Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>In this research, we show that 5G millimeter waves could
          be absorbed by dermatologic cells acting like antennas,
          transferred to other cells and play the main role in producing
          Coronaviruses in biological cells. DNA is built from charged
          electrons and atoms and has an inductor-like structure. This
          structure could be divided into linear, toroid and round
          inductors. Inductors interact with external electromagnetic
          waves, move and produce some extra waves within the cells. The
          shapes of these waves are similar to shapes of hexagonal and
          pentagonal bases of their DNA source. These waves produce some
          holes in liquids within the nucleus. To fill these holes, some
          extra hexagonal and pentagonal bases are produced. These bases
          could join to each other and form virus-like structures such
          as Coronavirus. To produce these viruses within a cell, it is
          necessary that the wavelength of external waves be shorter
          than the size of the cell. Thus 5G millimeter waves could be
          good candidates for applying in constructing virus-like
          structures such as Coronaviruses (COVID-19) within cells.<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>Aim: In this research, we show that DNA waves have many
          applications in biology. DNA is formed by the joining of
          quantum particles like electrons and charged atoms. DNA has
          different motions during transcription, translation, and
          replication, in which the charged particles move, accelerate,
          and emit waves. Thus, DNA could emit quantum waves.<br>
          <br>
          Methods: Two methods are proposed to observe the effect of DNA
          waves. The first proposed method measures DNA waves emitted by
          bacteria suspended in the milk. The vessel of milk is placed
          in the interior of an inductor. One side of the vessel is
          connected to a generator and another side to a scope. By
          sending a current to the inductor, an input electromagnetic
          field is produced. Bacteria interact with the input field,
          change it and produce new output signals. Using the scope, the
          output signals are observed and compared with the input
          signals. The number of DNA waves produced also depends on
          temperature.<br>
          <br>
          Results: At lower temperatures, bacterial replication is less,
          and fewer DNA waves are produced. Conversely, more bacteria
          are generated at higher temperatures, and more DNA waves are
          produced. The second proposed method acquires and images of
          DNA signals of chick embryos. In this method, a circuit is
          constructed that consists of a graphene or metal tube,
          generator, inductor, scope, DNA in the interior of eggs and
          DNA exterior to the eggs. Magnetic waves pass the interior and
          exterior DNA as well as the graphene. The DNA is excited and
          the exciting interior/exterior DNA exchanges waves. Some of
          these waves interact with electrons in the graphene tube, and
          a current is generated. Properties of the chick embryo DNA can
          be explored by analysing changes in the waves that emerge from
          the eggs.<br>
          <br>
          Conclusion: It is concluded that DNA waves could be used
          extensively in imaging and provide for us the exact
          information about evolutions of DNAs interior of biological
          systems.<br>

          <b><br>
          </b>Covid-19 is one of the most "alien" viruses our modern
          health care system has encountered.<br>
          <br>
          Not because it came from extraterrestrials, but because of all
          of the various different ways it's able to wreak havoc on the
          human body. It's so novel that we don't have a good natural
          analog to compare it to.<br>
          <br>
          And it's still confounding us. While it looked as if we had
          contained it here in the US, it's now surging back so strongly
          that overwhelmed hospitals are convening "survival panels" to
          determine who gets treated and who gets sent home to likely
          die.<br>
          <br>
          We are learning more about it every day, and have a long way
          to go until we really understand well how it works and how to
          fight it. So we need to remain vigilant in our efforts to
          avoid it, or else the resurging death count may go a lot
          higher...<br>

          <strong></strong><br>
          <strong>Stage Three: Death Squads and Mass Casualty events</strong><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " There has never been a
          revolution that did not use death squads. False flag attacks
          become the strategy of the day as well. These events drive a
          stake into the heart of the economy and render a comeback
          impossible. We are about ready to find out why the Democrats
          wanted totally open borders as opposed to implementing
          reasonable immigration policies. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are an estimated 1.3 million
          terrorists in America. These sleeper cells have been awaiting
          the activation call. As the race war of Stage Two begins to
          fade in intensity, it will be time to drive up the intensity.
          In Pre-Nazi Germany, that mean burning down the Reichstag. In
          America, all targets are on the table.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to my Border Patrol sources,
          MS-13 was let into this country in 2014-15 during the height
          of the last immigration crisis. MS-13, in Central America,
          plays the exclusive role of assassins for public figures who
          do not bend to the will of the cartels. They were brought here
          for the same reason. We will soon see political hits on media
          figures, corporate executives and key opposition politicians.
          At this point, living in America will be a lot like living
          through the hell of the Bosnian Civil War. Most Americans
          cannot fathom how bad it will get. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hamas, ISIS and all the other terrorist
          groups are here in great numbers. These forces were jointly
          trained at paramilitary base camps in El Salvador and Honduras
          in paramilitary and terrorist tactics prior to coming the
          United States. This event has been covered from multiple
          perspectives on the CSS. This means that soon, we will see
          IED's on federal buildings in the spirit of the Oklahoma City
          bombings. It will mean mass execution of white people in malls
          and at sporting events as well concerts as they happen. Paul
          Preston had an embedded source at the CALEXIT meetings in
          which this was discussed and planned. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The net effect of this stage is to promote
          the conflict necessary in order to give the United Nations the
          justification to enter American soil with foreign troops,
          under the Kigali Principles, and subjugate our government. We
          are already seeing this in Stage One as the UN has repeatedly
          warned the US about the killing of unarmed black Americans.
          The UN is already posturing. Obama signed the US into the
          Kigali Principles in the lame duck period of December of 2016.
          This plan has been in effect for sometime. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be at the time of the UN forced
          intervention, we will find out about the loyalties of the
          various branches to the Republic or the globalist regime. In
          today's climate I would say that the Army and Air Force and
          all the intelligence agencies would side with the UN. The
          Marines and the Navy, especially the nuclear submarine fleet
          will likely protect the American people. This will be the
          beginning of the true civil war. Your personal M-16 will make
          no difference. Armies will decide the fate of this country. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Analysis</strong><br>
          Cetainly the attack on Judge Salas' family merely four days
          after she was assigned an aspect of the Epstein fiasco is
          telling. Assassination death squads are now active...<br>
          <br>
          Here is an analysis of Stages four and five which is beginning
          to kick in. <br>
          <strong></strong><br>
          <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stage Four: CHICOM Genocide</strong><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Civil War is not effective in
          producing an overthrow of the government and I have strong
          reasons to believe that the UN and their allies will fail. A
          weakened America will face the possiblity of a bioweapons
          attack with race-specific agents. Last July, I wrote a 5 part
          series on these plans as the last 3 Chinese Defense Ministers,
          the last being Wei Fenghe, bragged about doing this very
          thing. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No bioweapon attack will be totally
          successful. However, only a shell of America will remain.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stage Five: The Red Dawn Invasion</strong><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CHICOM led Red Dawn invasion will
          commence. The CHICOMS and their Latin American allies will
          enact genocide on the American people. As Wei Fenghe has
          stated, "we are not interested in joint occupancy of the
          United States. We need the Americans resources and we will not
          share with any Americans." Wei Fenghe stated that
          race-specific bioweapons are needed and will be employed and
          this will make the military occupation have an easy time of
          subjugating the United States. Did I mention that the CHICOMS
          will not be taking prisoners?<br>
          <strong></strong><br>
          <strong>Analysis</strong><br>
          I won't extensively belabor past reports here on the CSS about
          rampant Chinese activity on American soil except to say that I
          have authored over 40 articles on teh subject. Additionally,
          there was an event in Houston that points to the fact that
          China is preparing for war. They are expecting their Houston
          Consulate to be occuped, therefore, they have begun burning
          documents.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          This is what nations do right before war and this points to
          stages four and five in this model as being in play...<br>

      <div align="center"><b>In 1973, an MIT computer predicted when
          civilization will end</b><br>
        <b>Paul Ratner</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;</b><i>&nbsp; In 1973, a computer program was
        developed at MIT to model global sustainability. Instead, it
        predicted that by 2040 our civilization would end.</i><i><br>
      </i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many in history have made apocalyptic
        predictions that have so far failed to materialize.</i><i><br>
      </i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what the computer envisioned in the
        1970s has by and large been coming true. Could the machine be
        right? </i><b><br>
        <br>
        Why the program was created<br>
      </b><br>
      The prediction, which recently re-appeared in Australian media,
      was made by a program dubbed World One. It was originally created
      by the computer pioneer Jay Forrester, who was commissioned by the
      Club of Rome to model how well the world could sustain its growth.
      The Club of Rome is an organization comprised of thinkers, former
      world heads of states, scientists, and UN bureaucrats with the
      mission to “promote understanding of the global challenges facing
      humanity and to propose solutions through scientific analysis,
      communication, and advocacy."<br>
      <b><br>
        The predictions<br>
        <br>
      </b>What World One showed was that by 2040 there would be a global
      collapse if the expansion of the population and industry was to
      continue at the current levels.<br>
      <br>
      As reported by the Australian broadcaster ABC, the model's
      calculations took into account trends in pollution levels,
      population growth, the amount of natural resources and the overall
      quality of life on Earth. The model's predictions for the
      worsening quality of life and the dwindling natural resources have
      so far been unnervingly on target.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, 2020 is the first milestone envisioned by World One.
      That's when the quality of life is supposed to drop dramatically.
      The broadcaster presented this scenario that will lead to the
      demise of large numbers of people:<br>
      <br>
      "At around 2020, the condition of the planet becomes highly
      critical. If we do nothing about it, the quality of life goes down
      to zero. Pollution becomes so seriously it will start to kill
      people, which in turn will cause the population to diminish, lower
      than it was in the 1900. At this stage, around 2040 to 2050,
      civilised life as we know it on this planet will cease to exist."<br>
      <br>
      Alexander King, the then-leader of the Club of Rome, evaluated the
      program's results to also mean that nation-states will lose their
      sovereignty, forecasting a New World Order with corporations
      managing everything.<br>
      <br>
      “Sovereignty of nations is no longer absolute," King told ABC.
      “There is a gradual diminishing of sovereignty, little bit by
      little bit. Even in the big nations, this will happen."<br>
      <br>
      <b>How did the program work?</b><br>
      <br>
      World One, the computer program, looked at the world as one
      system. The report called it “an electronic guided tour of our
      behavior since 1900 and where that behavior will lead us." The
      program produced graphs that showed what would happen to the
      planet decades into the future. It plotted statistics and
      forecasts for such variables as population, quality of life, the
      supply of natural resources, pollution, and more. Following the
      trend lines, one could see where the crises might take place.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Can we stave off disaster?</b><br>
      <br>
      As one measure to prevent catastrophe, the Club of Rome predicted
      some nations like the U.S. would have to cut back on their
      appetites for gobbling up the world's resources. It hoped that in
      the future world, prestige would stem from “low consumption"—one
      fact that has so far not materialized. Currently, nine in ten
      people around the world breathe air that has high levels of
      pollution, according to data from the World Health Organization
      (WHO). The agency estimates that 7 million deaths each year can be
      attributed to pollution...<br>

      <div align="center"><b>By Greg Palast</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, Lord, please don't let me be
      misunderstood."<br>
      <br>
      I've been singing that Animals' tune for a month. I move my lips,
      but I'm not sure my words are understood.<br>
      <br>
      It begins with a stone-cold fact: Mail-in ballots are lost by the
      millions—especially the ballots of low-income young and minority
      voters, those folks often called, "Democrats."<br>
      <br>
      The seminal MIT study, Losing Votes by Mail, warns that 22% - more
      than one in five ballots - never get counted.<br>
      <br>
      As the study concludes:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If 20%, or even 10%, of voters who stood in
      line on Election Day were turned away, there would be national
      outrage. The estimates provided by this paper suggest that the
      equivalent may be happening among voters who seek to cast their
      ballots by mail, and yet there is nary a comment."...<br>
      <br>
      3.3 million absentee ballots were lost in 2016....<br>
      <br>
      A Caltech/MIT study, "Whose Absentee Votes Are Counted?" shows
      rejection rates higher for Democrats than Republicans, higher for
      younger than older voters, and higher for non-English ballots.
      Surprised?<br>
      <br>
      Thousands of Korean-Americans, per their rights under federal law,
      filled in Korean-language ballots which ask, in Korean, for the
      voter's signature. Not surprisingly, the voters signed in Korean.
      All these ballots went straight into the garbage.<br>
      <br>
      If you don't get a ballot you can't mail it in. Well, d'oh, Homer!
      According to the MIT study, most of the millions of absentee
      ballot lost are because one in nine voters never receive their
      ballot or it is received too late. Again, the "late" ballots are
      overwhelmingly slow-mailed to voters of color...<br>
      <br>
      One of the main reasons voters don't get their ballots is that, in
      the past two years, 16.7 million voters have been purged, erased
      from the voter rolls and most don't know it...<br>
      <br>
      16.7 million voters erased from the registration rolls in the past
      two years,..<b><br>
        <br>
        What can we do?<br>
      </b>Plenty, Jackson. First check your registration. Second, check
      your registration - again. Third, if you don't get your mail-in
      vote, contact your county registrar and demand it. One month
      before the election, Jackson, not November 2.<br>
      <br>
      Now's the hard part: filling out and mailing in your ballot...
      don't forget the witness signature. And make sure your witness is
      a verified voter - and verified virus free... find a notary to
      notarize your ballot... if you're a first time voter, don't forget
      to include a copy of your ID... If you're... a student — you can
      only use a student ID if you also enclose a letter of proof of
      your enrollment in good standing at your school...<br>
      <br>
      And if you include that extra paperwork, don't forget to add a
      stamp for the extra weight: the US Elections Assistance Commission
      reports 100,000 ballots in 2016 were rejected for postage due...<b><br>

      Background:During the 2003 severe acute respiratory
      distresssyndrome epidemic, healthcareworkers mandatorily wore
      theprotective N95 face-mask.Methods:We administered a survey
      tohealthcare workers to determine risk factors associated
      withdevelopment of headaches (frequency, headache subtypes and
      durationof face-mask wear) and the impact of headaches (sick days,
      headachefrequency and use of abortive/preventive headache
      medications).Results:In the survey, 212 (47 male, 165 female)
      healthcare workers ofmean age 31 years (range, 21–58)
      participated. Of the 79 (37.3%)respondents who reported
      face-mask-associated headaches, 26 (32.9%)reported headache
      frequency exceeding six times per month. Six (7.6%)had taken sick
      leave from March 2003 to June 2004 (mean 2 days;range 1–4 days)
      and 47 (59.5%) required use of abortive analgesicsbecause of
      headache. Four (2.1%) took preventive medications forheadaches
      during this period. Multivariate logistic regressionshowed that
      pre-existing headaches [P¼0.041, OR¼1.97 (95% CI1.03–3.77)] and
      continuous use of the N95 face-mask exceeding 4 h[P¼0.053, OR¼1.85
      (95% CI 0.99–3.43)] were associated withdevelopment of
      headaches.Conclusions:Healthcare providers maydevelop headaches
      following the use of the N95 face-mask. Shorterduration of
      face-mask wear may reduce the frequency and severity ofthese
      headaches.<br>

      from Portugal. Here we a 0.014% death rate attributed to Covid.
      However mortality reports show absolutely no excess death as

      <div align="center"><b>Engineers have taken their inspiration from
          shells and grapefruits to create what they say is the first
          manufactured non-cuttable material</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      This new material, which could be used in the security and health
      and safety industries, can turn back the force of a cutting tool
      upon itself.<br>
      <br>
      The lightweight material — named Proteus after the shape-changing
      mythical god — is made of ceramic spheres encased in a cellular
      aluminum structure that in tests could not be cut by angle
      grinders, drills, or high-pressure water jets.<br>
      <br>
      An international research team, led by Durham University, UK, and
      Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology IWU
      in Chemnitz in Germany, got the idea for the new material from the
      tough cellular skin of the grapefruit and the fracture-resistant
      shells of mollusks.<br>
      <br>
      Abalone sea creatures are built from tiles interlinked with a
      biopolymer material that make them resistant to fractures. To
      resist the most violent forcible entry tools, organic materials
      such as aragonite tiles — found in mollusk shells — were replaced
      in the new material with industrial, alumina ceramics, and an
      aluminum, metallic foam matrix.<br>
      <br>
      The new material is strong, light, and non-cuttable. The
      researchers say it could be used to make bike locks, lightweight
      armor, and in protective equipment for people who work with
      cutting tools.<br>
      <br>
      The findings are published in the journal Scientific Reports. The
      new material system is dynamic with an evolving internal structure
      that creates high-speed motion where it interacts with the cutting
      tools. The dynamic response is more akin to living structures.<br>
      <br>
      The material is made from a cellular aluminum structure wrapped
      around ceramic spheres and this has a doubly destructive effect on
      cutting tools. When cut with an angle grinder or drill, the
      vibrations created by the ceramic spheres inside the casing blunt
      the cutting disc or drill bit.<br>
      <br>
      The interaction between the disc and ceramic sphere creates an
      interlocking, vibrational connection that resists the cutting tool
      indefinitely.<br>
      <br>
      The blade is gradually eroded, and eventually rendered ineffective
      as the force and energy of the disc or the drill is turned back on
      itself, and it is weakened and destroyed by its own attack.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the ceramics fragment into fine particles, which fill
      the cellular structure of the material and harden as the speed of
      the cutting tool is increased due to interatomic forces between
      the ceramic grains. In this way the adaptive nature of the
      material further repulses any attack.<br>
      <br>
      Water jets were also found to be ineffective because the curved
      surfaces of the ceramic spheres widen the jet, which substantially
      reduces its speed and weakens its cutting capacity.<br>
      <br>
      Lead author Dr. Stefan Szyniszewski, Assistant Professor of
      Applied Mechanics, in the Department of Engineering, Durham
      University, said: “We were intrigued by how the cellular structure
      of the grapefruit and the tiled structure of mollusk shells can
      prevent damage to the fruit or the creatures inside, despite being
      made of relatively weak organic building blocks.<br>
      <br>
      “These natural structures informed the working principle of our
      metallic-ceramic material, which is based on dynamic interaction
      with the applied load, in contrast to passive resistance.<br>
      <br>
      “Essentially cutting our material is like cutting through a
      jelly-filled with nuggets. If you get through the jelly you hit
      the nuggets and the material will vibrate in such a way that it
      destroys the cutting disc or drill bit.<br>
      <br>
      “The ceramics embedded in this flexible material are also made of
      very fine particles which stiffen and resist the angle grinder or
      drill when you’re cutting at speed in the same way that a sandbag
      would resist and stop a bullet at high speed.<br>
      <br>
      “This material could have lots of useful and exciting applications
      in the security and safety industries. In fact, we are not aware
      of any other manufactured non-cuttable material in existence as of
      now.”<br>
      <br>
      Study co-author Dr. Miranda Anderson, Department of Philosophy,
      University of Stirling said: “Because the successful resistance of
      our material system requires it to undergo internal
      transformations, we chose the name Proteus.<br>
      <br>
      “In 1605, Francis Bacon compared natural materials to Proteus who
      ‘ever changed shapes’ and he argued that through experimentation
      we can reveal the metamorphic qualities of materials.”<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Szyniszewski added: “This is what we’ve achieved with this new
      material and we’re excited by its potential.”<br>
      <br>
      The researchers have a patent pending for their material
      technology and they hope to work with industry partners so it can
      be developed into products for the marketplace.<br>

          cases<br>
          <br>
        </b></div>
      I am going to come right out and say this, and it definitely is
      medical advice. This will work in a majority of cases. I know it
      is illegal to claim to provide medical advice, but I am not
      selling anything so they can stuff it.<br>
      <br>
      First of all, I am going to state the two SOLE causes of
      fibromyalgia that the scamming medical community will never admit
      because they want to rake in cash on your misery. They are the
      enemy, even the corona scam proves this (with false reporting of
      stats and outright murder to get them on top of it) no, you cannot
      trust your doctor.<br>
      The two SOLE causes of fibromyalgia and all ailements simiar, in
      people who were previously healthy are vaccines and quinolone
      based antibiotics. There is absolutely nothing else causing it.
      The medical community knows and it is being done on purpose.<br>
      <br>
      What are quinolone based antibiotics? The two most well known are
      Cipro and Levaquin but there are many more. They are DNA
      disruptors and the only antibiotics which actually have an
      aknowledged ability to destroy human DNA, and before that the
      mitochondria in cells. They impact mitochondria more than human
      DNA, but they do both. Because they do this, they should be banned
      yet doctors hand them out like candy for mundane urinary
      infections and it is malicious, there's no way out of it. One
      course of cipro for one week is enough to damage most people
      forever, but some people will get over it. Repeat doses or longer
      courses are near certain doom.<br>
      <br>
      Symptoms of being wrecked by quinolones:<br>
      <br>
      1. Always tired.<br>
      2. Loss of strength (but you may still feel OK)<br>
      3. Continuous pain in joints and tendons.<br>
      4. The above may appear to be neurological, but it is not
      neurological and the doctors know it. They'll call it that to cash
      in and may even dope you with antidepressants.<br>
      <br>
      How do you easily fix this? First, an explanation of what is going
      on in your cells after quinolones -<br>
      The main problem is caused by the shutdown of mitochondria in the
      cells that make up joints and tendons. Cipro and other quinolones
      interrupt calcium signaling which is essential for metabolism and
      all other cellular processes to take place. Calcium is literally
      the spark plug in the engine of a cell. Taking more calcium after
      getting damaged by quinolones will not fix the problem, the
      calcium channels are permanently destroyed. However taking
      magnesium which is a calcium antagonist somehow provides an
      alternative path for signaling, and mitochondria can then function
      again. Once they can function again, cells are again able to
      replicate, repair themselves, and produce energy. It is not a one
      time fix, you have to occasionally intentionally replace the
      magnesium. This can be done by taking a few grams of magnesium
      sulfate, or magnesium chloride at the same dosage and re-dosing
      with a couple grams per week thereafter.<br>

      </b>An anthropologist explores how the use of rats to clear
      ordnance in Cambodia is changing the culture of mine clearance.<br>
      <br>
      ...APOPO uses Gambian pouched rats, also known as giant African
      rats by their size, an animal that can be as heavy as 3 pounds and
      as long as 3 feet. While large for rats, they are weightless for
      the land mines and can walk safely across a live minefield. For
      the first nine months of their eight years of life,
      rats-in-training are taught to smell explosive powder using a
      clicker technique and positive intermittent reinforcement (not
      unlike dog training). In the field, the rats learn to scratch the
      soil twice when they detect explosive powder in the ground. Human
      handlers then mark that scratched point on a map of the
      minefield....<br>

      </div>
      There was a video that went viral a few months ago of something
      seemingly impossible. A real invisibility shield! So, naturally I
      was just as intrigued as everyone else that saw it, but I decided
      then and there that I would build one. <br>
      <br>
      How hard could it be, right? As it turns out, not hard at all.
      This is the result of some weeks of researching here and there and
      gathering the necessary materials. This is the real deal...<br>

      In this video I explore the physics of an 'invisibility shield',
      otherwise known as a Lubor's Lens. You may have seen viral clips
      of this type of material attached to a riot shield, advertised for
      police and military applications to provide an effective (but not
      perfect) cloak in certain environments. This video explores how
      that technology works.<br>

      Cochabamba Bolivia: This article shows how it is possible for a
      government to change their law so that they can better treat
      deseases like coronavirus. They are not only allowing this to be
      produced, but they will be making CD publically available for all.
      You can tell in the wording of their Director of Public Health
      official that they still cannot call CD a "medicine". They call it
      a "disinfectant". If they are basing their decision off of what
      they have seen in Equador (See my videos on their 100% success
      against corona) and other reports, it doesn't matter what they
      call CD. If it works, then it will save lives much faster and more
      effectively than traditional medical medicines. <br>

          TWO YEARS AGO that US cities would be locked down</b><br>
        <b>By Mike Adams on March 23, 2020</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Here’s the stunning proof this quarantine was planned years ago<br>
      <br>
      In late November of 2017, a high-level government-connected source
      described to me almost the exact scenario that is unfolding now
      across America: Quarantined cities, the collapse of food supplies,
      the acceleration of martial law and other shocking details you may
      have forgotten you read here on this website over two years ago.<br>
      <br>
      I published all the details on December 2, 2017 in a Natural News
      article entitled, “Nationwide civil unrest coming… and city
      dwellers are the LEAST prepared to survive.”<br>
      <br>
      The article, with selected quotes republished here, is so
      incredibly accurate in describing what’s happening right now that
      it’s practically a roadmap for 2020. Although at the time, I
      believed the context for this was a left-wing uprising. Little did
      I know the real plan was something far more sinister and deadly on
      a global scale.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, the fact that I was told all this two years ago — by a
      source I haven’t heard from since, by the way — is yet more proof
      that everything you are seeing unfold right now was pre-planned,
      engineered and initiated to achieve exactly what’s unfolding now.<br>
      <br>
      Here are some of the quotes and points from the 2017 article,
      which are now almost unbelievably accurate:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How military contractors are being told to
      prepare for domestic deployment inside the United States to
      prevent cities from being burned to the ground by raging, lunatic
      mobs.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “In much the same way that a viral pandemic
      must be contained to avoid it spreading, civil unrest will also be
      “firewalled” off to prevent its spread.” – my actual words from
      2017.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The military manning key transportation
      checkpoints such as those leading in and out of cities.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Destroying supply hubs (ammunition depots, fuel
      depots, etc.) of domestic enemies.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Large sections of many U.S. cities will be
      transformed into “war zones,” complete with arson, looting,
      gunfire and dead bodies.”<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Severe disruptions in food deliveries, fuel
      supplies, transportation and emergency services, “including
      hospitals.”<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Disruptions in all these services and supplies
      will only worsen the degree of panic and desperation among city
      dwellers. As I point out in the following podcast, city people
      tend to be the least prepared of all. This will add to the panic
      and cause the situation to escalate rapidly…”<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Local law enforcement units have been told
      over the last year or so that when inner cities collapse into
      chaos and rioting, police units will NOT be sent in to deal with
      many situations. Instead, in some cases the strategy will simply
      be to “contain” the chaos and prevent it from spreading. This
      means manning roadblock checkpoints while allowing certain sectors
      of some cities to burn to the ground.”<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “If you’re stuck in a war zone section of the
      city, you may very well be on your own for some time, unable to
      exit the city because all the egress routes are blocked as part of
      the containment strategy.”<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “If you don’t have this special permission, you
      may find yourself literally trapped in your own city zone, unable
      to receive any help from calling 9/11…”<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The No. 1 thing you need to be working on
      right now is getting out of the city. The most dangerous scenario
      in these potential events is being trapped in the city with no
      escape, no supplies and no means of self-defense.”<br>
      <br>
      In fact, I even recorded a podcast that was posted in late 2017
      which covered all this. Remember: At the time, I believed the
      context of this would be an Antifa uprising and an attempted
      violent Leftist revolution. Little did I know the real plan was
      something much, much bigger. And by releasing a pandemic,
      globalists have managed to convince all the mobs to stay home.<br>
      <br>
      The big realization in all this is that globalists have planned to
      exterminate humanity for many years, and they built the weapons to
      achieve that, then caused those weapons to be released. Now, it’s
      all proceeding like clockwork to line everybody up and euthanize
      the clueless masses with the coronavirus vaccine. From a globalist
      point of view, it’s so much easier to exterminate people when
      they’re begging for the vaccine, isn’t it? Hence the coordinated
      censorship of all voices that oppose mandatory vaccines…<br>
      <br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>An online system analyzes broadcast content viewed by
      individuals in a household. Each individual in the household is
      associated with a client device on which a software application
      module is executed. When the software application module detects
      one or more broadcasting signals of a content item broadcasted to
      the household, the software application module records the ambient
      audio, including audio from the broadcasting device. The software
      application module sends an identifier of the individual
      associated with the client device, an ambient audio fingerprint
      derived from the recorded ambient audio, and time information for
      the recorded ambient audio to the online system. The online
      system, based on the ambient audio data, identifies the
      corresponding individual and content item and logs an impression
      for the content item upon determination that there was an
      impression of the identified content item by the identified
      individual.<br>

      <b>United Nations Security Council Resolution 666</b><br>
      From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br>
      <br>
      In United Nations Security Council Resolution 666, adopted on
      September 13, 1990, after recalling resolutions 661 (1990) and 664
      (1990) which discussed the humanitarian situation in Iraq and
      Kuwait and the detention of nationals from foreign countries, the
      Council decided to ask the 661 Committee to determine if
      humanitarian needs have arisen and to keep the situation under
      review. At the same time, it expected Iraq to comply with its
      obligations under international law, including the Fourth Geneva
      Convention, relating to the safety and detainment of third-state
      nationals in Iraq and occupied Kuwait...<br>
      <br>
      Resolution 666 was adopted with 13 votes; Cuba and Yemen voted
      against the resolution, with Cuba stating that even through the
      use of disclaimers, the resolution amounted to "using starvation
      as a weapon of war", banned under Protocol 1 of the Geneva
      Conventions.[1] <br>

      <br>
      Texas family doctor Dr. Richard Bartlett joins Debbie Georgatos on
      her show American Can We Talk to discuss a potential COVID CURE!<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Bartlett describes how he has been treating Covid-19 patients
      with 100% success rate using an inexpensive safe treatment that is
      commonly used for people with asthma.<br>
      <br>
      The treatment is inhaling a steroid called budesonide using a
      nebulizer. Dr. Bartlett says many patients experience rapid relief
      from Covid symptoms after the first treatment.<br>
      <br>
      It’s the same treatment that worked in crowded countries like
      Taiwan, Singapore and Japan who’ve had very few deaths compared to
      countries that locked down. Therefore, Bartlett questions the
      effectiveness of mandatory masks, social distancing or a vaccine.<br>
      <br>
      He explained that a vaccine is unnecessary because the mortality
      rate is so low and effective treatments already exist. And he
      emphasized that vaccines would be ineffective because of constant
      mutations to the coronavirus.<br>
      <br>
      “The beautiful thing about the treatment that I’m using is that no
      matter how many times it mutates it’s universally going to work
      because it decreases the inflammation. It’s a respiratory
      anti-inlammatory solution to a respiratory inlammatory problem.”<br>

            ...Water has claimed to have developed a&nbsp; black
            box&nbsp; H2G water energy converter system that was
            designed to run up to 20 hp engines and draws&nbsp; 180
            milliamps of input power at 24 volts DC. Normally you would
            need around at least 100 litres per minute of Hydrogen to
            achieve 20 hp output from an internal combustion engine.
            Under normal electrolysis you would need t least 20 KW of
            energy to release that amount of hydrogen from the water...<br>
            &nbsp;Eventually, he was able to convert water to clean fuel
            with less than 180 milliamps of input power at 24 volts DC,
            and run engines entirely on the water fuel, a mix of up to
            97.5%&nbsp; water and just 2.5% gasoline...<br>
            His earlier version still used up to 5% gasoline, however
            the latest claim is now it possible to run a vehicle on 100%
            fuel derived from either fresh or saltwater....<br>
            The claims<br>

          <font color="#000000">Most water fuel researchers and
            developers are focused on methods to separate hydrogen and
            oxygen from water with electrolysis (running electrical
            current throug<br>
            <br>
            e other ways that are much more efficient and effective.
            With only hundreds of miliamps, Walt Jenkins can run an
            engine with 95%+ water.<br>
            <br>
            He isn’t using electrolysis, but he was heavily involved
            with that years ago and he is actually the original
            developer of the popular dry cell that most experimenters
            are using.<br>
            <br>
            Although this presentation is not a full disclosure, he does
            share some concepts regarding this method that point people
            in the right direction. Keep in mind that this is the first
            time he has given a presentation to the public.<br>
            <br>
            His entire process is patented and is still a work in
            progress, but being able to get 500 mpg on a scooter is
            quite an accomplishment and you can see his dune buggy is
            also quite advanced. It is not an attempt to replicate Stan
            Meyer’s dune buggy, which is a completely different process,
            but rather to make it easy for anyone to see that there are
            no hidden fuel lines, etc…<br>
            <br>
            Moray King considers Walt Jenkins to be the modern-day Stan
            Meyer and that is a very strong statement coming from a
            leading authority on water fuel technologies. Help us bring
            more awareness to the work of Walt Jenkins so we can have
            clean fuel for a clean future!<br>

          <font color="#660000"><font color="#000000"><br>
              From the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, it was taken for
              granted that the virus spread via respiratory droplets in
              the air and through contact. It was on this assumption
              that we were advised to wipe door handles, wear a mask and
              observe "social distancing".<br>
              <br>
              However, this mode of transmission was never proven.<br>
              <br>
              If Covid-19 is indeed a respiratory virus, then it should
              be deduced that it can only be transmitted by aerosol like
              all other viral respiratory diseases. In such a case, it
              is absurd to be cleaning door handles, absolutely useless
              to wear masks or to slip on a jumpsuit, and utterly
              ridiculous to keep social distancing. The only prevention
              is to ventilate as much as possible.<br>
              <br>
              This mode of transmission has also not been proven, but it
              is much more logical than the dominant assumption.<br>
              <br>
              This theory has been supported by numerous researchers
              since the beginning of the epidemic, but they have not
              been given a voice. It was in light of this hypothesis
              that Thierry Meyssan was prompted to deride the use of
              masks comparing them to those worn by the plague doctors
              in the XVIIth century [1].<br>
              <br>
              239 scientists have just published an open letter to this

              provoking revolts and changes in political regimes. In the
              panic, we are unable to think and we behave collectively
              in an animal-like manner. Many societies have not survived

          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>...First, diversity trainers informed white participants
          that “objectivity,” “individualism,” “intellectualization,”
          and “comfort” are all vestiges of internalized racial
          oppression...<br>
          <br>
          Sometimes both sides of the coin are “oppression.”<br>
          <br>
          Are white employees speaking too much? That’s probably the
          internalized racial superiority of “imposition” or
          “paternalism.”<br>
          <br>
          Are white employees speaking too little? That’s oppression,
          too, because “silence” is “violence.”<br>
          <br>
          What’s next?<br>
          <br>
          The City of Seattle diversity trainers encourage white
          employees to “practice self-talk that affirms [their]
          complicity in racism” and work on “undoing your own
          whiteness.”<br>
          <br>
          The trainers ask white employees to “let go” of “comfort,”
          “guaranteed physical safety,” “control over the land,” “social
          status,” and “relationships with some other white people.”<br>
          <br>
          Then they go through a flow chart that outlines how white
          people “cause harm to POC,” “show up small and inauthentic,”
          and are unable to access their “humanity.”<br>

          “Alhamdulillah” means “Thanks be to Allah” and is not usually
          said except by observant Muslims. Here again we see that
          radical Leftists have the same goal jihadis do: not just the
          removal of statues of Confederates, but much more. The
          targeting of Confederate statues is part of a larger effort to
          make Americans ashamed of our history as a whole, as the
          targeting of statues of Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and
          Frederick Douglass shows. The ultimate goal is the destruction
          of the U.S. as a free republic, and the replacement of that
          republic with an authoritarian state. The nature of that
          authoritarian state, however, will be determined by the group

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>The characterization of the blood virome is important for
          the safety of blood-derived transfusion products, and for the
          identification of emerging pathogens. We explored non-human
          sequence data from whole-genome sequencing of blood from 8,240
          individuals, none of whom were ascertained for any infectious
          disease. Viral sequences were extracted from the pool of
          sequence reads that did not map to the human reference genome.
          Analyses sifted through close to 1 Petabyte of sequence data
          and performed 0.5 trillion similarity searches. With a lower
          bound for identification of 2 viral genomes/100,000 cells, we
          mapped sequences to 94 different viruses, including sequences
          from 19 human DNA viruses, proviruses and RNA viruses
          (herpesviruses, anelloviruses, papillomaviruses, three
          polyomaviruses, adenovirus, HIV, HTLV, hepatitis B, hepatitis
          C, parvovirus B19, and influenza virus) in 42% of the study
          participants. Of possible relevance to transfusion medicine,
          we identified Merkel cell polyomavirus in 49 individuals,
          papillomavirus in blood of 13 individuals, parvovirus B19 in 6
          individuals, and the presence of herpesvirus 8 in 3
          individuals. The presence of DNA sequences from two RNA
          viruses was unexpected: Hepatitis C virus is revealing of an
          integration event, while the influenza virus sequence resulted
          from immunization with a DNA vaccine. Age, sex and ancestry
          contributed significantly to the prevalence of infection. The
          remaining 75 viruses mostly reflect extensive contamination of
          commercial reagents and from the environment. These technical
          problems represent a major challenge for the identification of
          novel human pathogens. Increasing availability of human
          whole-genome sequences will contribute substantial amounts of
          data on the composition of the normal and pathogenic human
          blood virome. Distinguishing contaminants from real human
          viruses is challenging...<br>

              Review </b><b><br>
              by John Hardie, BDS, MSc, PhD, FRCDC</b><br>

          <div align="center"><b>&nbsp;</b><i>&nbsp; " Yesterday’s
              Scientific Dogma is Today’s Discarded Fable "</i><br>
          </div>
          <b> Introduction<br>
          </b>The above quotation is ascribed to Justice Archie Campbell
          author of Canada’s SARS Commission Final Report. 1 It is a
          stark reminder that scientific knowledge is constantly
          changing as new discoveries contradict established beliefs.
          For at least three decades a face mask has been deemed an
          essential component of the personal protective equipment worn
          by dental personnel. A current article, “Face Mask
          Performance: Are You Protected” gives the impression that
          masks are capable of providing an acceptable level of
          protection from airborne pathogens. 2 Studies of recent
          diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS),
          Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the Ebola
          Crisis combined with those of seasonal influenza and drug
          resistant tuberculosis have promoted a better understanding of
          how respiratory diseases are transmitted. Concurrently, with
          this appreciation, there have been a number of clinical
          investigations into the efficacy of protective devices such as
          face masks. This article will describe how the findings of
          such studies lead to a rethinking of the benefits of wearing a
          mask during the practice of dentistry. It will begin by
          describing new concepts relating to infection control
          especially personal protective equipment (PPE)...<br>
          <br>
          <b>Conclusions<br>
          </b>The primary reason for mandating the wearing of face masks
          is to protect dental personnel from airborne pathogens. This
          review has established that face masks are incapable of
          providing such a level of protection. Unless the Centers for
          Disease Control and Prevention, national and provincial dental
          associations and regulatory agencies publically admit this
          fact, they will be guilty of perpetuating a myth which will be
          a disservice to the dental profession and its patients. It
          would be beneficial if, as a consequence of the review, all
          present infection control recommendations were subjected to
          the same rigorous testing as any new clinical intervention.
          Professional associations and governing bodies must ensure the
          clinical efficacy of quality improvement procedures prior to
          them being mandated. It is heartening to know that such a
          trend is gaining a momentum which might reveal the
          inadequacies of other long held dental infection control
          assumptions. Surely, the hallmark of a mature profession is
          one which permits new evidence to trump established beliefs.
          In 1910, Dr. C. Chapin, a public health pioneer, summarized
          this idea by stating, “We should not be ashamed to change our
          methods; rather, we should be ashamed not to do so.” 36 Until
          this occurs, as this review has revealed, dentists have
          nothing to fear by unmasking...<br>

          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>...Back in April, even the mainstream media was
          questioning what Newsom was up to when it was revealed that he
          had wired half a billion dollars to an electric car company in
          China to supposedly purchase “N-95 masks” for the Wuhan
          coronavirus (COVID-19). This decision was never voted on or
          approved by legislators, and when pressed about the details of
          the deal, Newsom refused to disclose them.<br>
          <br>
          By selling Californians down the river and giving China the
          beachhead it has been trying to establish on America’s western
          coast, Newsom is ensuring that he will remain on China’s good
          side once the dust settles and the new world order emerges.<br>
          <br>
          As we reported, Newsom is directly facilitating the transfer
          of weapons and ammunition from China to the United States,
          where much of it is now being stored at the Easy End Complex
          in Sacramento. Pallets upon pallets of Chinese munitions are
          being stockpiled right underneath our noses, and Americans
          have Newsom the traitor to thank for what is soon to
          transpire...<br>

          <b><br>
          </b>An outbreak of a virus that is known as “bunny ebola”
          erupted in the southwestern United States in April, and since
          that time it has “moved like mad” from one location to
          another.&nbsp; At this point, cases have been confirmed at 146
          different locations in the states of Arizona, California,
          Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah.&nbsp; The good
          news is that this virus does not infect humans, but it is
          absolutely deadly for rabbits, hares, and pikas.&nbsp;
          Thousands have already died, and it appears that this pandemic
          is just getting started.<br>
          <br>
          Once rabbits start exhibiting symptoms, it is usually already
          too late to do anything.&nbsp; According to one expert in New
          York, the cases that he personally witnessed earlier this year
          all ended horribly…<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Someone saw them spasming and yelled,”
          recalled Lorelei D’Avolio, LVM, a certified veterinary
          practice manager with a veterinary-technician specialty in
          exotics at the Center for Avian and Exotic Medicine in
          Manhattan. “We tried to do CPR, but these rabbits were dead
          within minutes. They would convulse, scream horribly, and
          die.” ...<br>

          book reveals a logical way to restore youth and dramatically

          August Dunning, a former NASA Space Station scientist, will

          </b>Words are spells which is why the forming of words from
          letters is called SPELLing. To innerstand why words are spells
          on a deeper, we need to tumble down the rabbit hole to explore
          what words are on a spiritual level. This magical journey will
          show you evidence that words are spells and therefore can be

          reporting that 43 percent of all US COVID deaths are occurring
          in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities for the
          elderly. In at least 24 states, more than 50 percent of all
          COVID deaths are occurring in these facilities. The Times
          fails to mention deaths of the elderly at hospitals or, at
          home, cut off from family and friends. The situation is far
          worse than the Times makes it out to be.]...<br>
          <br>
          You want to see some astonishing numbers? Let’s go to the
          “epicenter.” New York City.<br>
          <br>
          Using worldometers.info for data, I looked at the latest
          figures available.<br>
          <br>
          As of May 13, take these two age groups—65 to 74, and 75 and
          older—and together they account for a staggering 73.6 percent
          of all COVID deaths in the city.<br>
          <br>
          The 75 and older group accounts, all on its own, for 48.7
          percent of all COVID deaths in the city.<br>
          <br>
          For THIS, New York is on lockdown. Boarded up. Imprisoned.
          Economically torpedoed and devastated. With two
          ignoramus-vampires—Governor Cuomo and Mayor De Blasio—hovering
          over its shoulders.<br>
          <br>
          If you subtracted the premature and forced deaths of the

          </b>We now have mortality data for the first few months of
          2020 for many countries, and, as you might expect, there were
          steep increases associated with the beginning of the COVID-19
          pandemic in each one.<br>
          <br>
          Surprisingly, however, these increases did not begin before
          the lockdowns were imposed, but after. Moreover, in almost
          every case, they began immediately after. Often, mortality
          numbers were on a downward trend before suddenly reversing
          course after lockdowns were decreed.<br>
          <br>
          This is an astonishing finding. But before I discuss its full
          import, and pose some questions to those who still defend the
          utility of lockdowns, I want to present the data that proves
          it.<br>
          <br>
          Here’s a series of charts by the Financial Times showing
          overall mortality and “deaths in excess of normal levels” in
          2020 for a number of countries:<br>
          Source. Note: I removed the chart in the bottom right corner
          which represented “13 countries/cities combined” and replaced
          it with the FT chart for New York City.<br>
          <br>
          As you can see, in every country there were significant
          increases in overall mortality beginning some time in February
          or March.<br>
          <br>
          Now let’s add the lockdown dates in green for each country:<br>
          <br>
          You will notice that only after each country (or city) was
          locked down did the increases begin. Moreover, they began
          immediately, and in nearly every case, precipitously.<br>
          <br>
          Now let’s examine the data for a few of these countries and
          cities in greater detail...<b><br>

          A high-profile European pathologist is reporting that he and
          his colleagues across Europe have not found any evidence of
          any deaths from the novel coronavirus on that continent.<br>
          <br>
          Dr. Stoian Alexov called the World Health Organization (WHO) a
          “criminal medical organization” for creating worldwide fear
          and chaos without providing objectively verifiable proof of a
          pandemic.<br>
          <br>
          Another stunning revelation from Bulgarian Pathology
          Association (BPA) president Dr. Alexov is that he believes
          it’s currently “impossible” to create a vaccine against the
          virus.<br>
          <br>
          He also revealed that European pathologists haven’t identified
          any antibodies that are specific for SARS-CoV-2.<br>
          <br>
          These stunning statements raise major questions, including
          about officials’ and scientists’ claims regarding the many
          vaccines they’re rushing into clinical trials around the
          world.<br>
          <br>
          They also raise doubt about the veracity of claims of
          discovery of anti-novel-coronavirus antibodies (which are
          beginning to be used to treat patients).<br>
          <br>
          Novel-coronavirus-specific antibodies are supposedly the basis
          for the expensive serology test kits being used in many
          countries (some of which have been found to be unacceptably
          inaccurate).<br>
          <br>
          And they’re purportedly key to the immunity certificates
          coveted by Bill Gates that are about to go into widespread use
          — in the form of the COVI-PASS — in 15 countries including the
          UK, US, and Canada.<br>
          <br>
          Dr. Alexov made his jaw-dropping observations in a video
          interview summarizing the consensus of participants in a May
          8, 2020, European Society of Pathology (ESP) webinar on
          COVID-19.<br>
          <br>
          The May 13 video interview of Dr. Alexov was conducted by Dr.
          Stoycho Katsarov, chair of the Center for Protection of
          Citizens’ Rights in Sofia and a former Bulgarian deputy
          minister of health. The video is on the BPA’s website, which
          also highlights some of Dr. Alexov’s main points.<br>
          <br>
          We asked a native Bulgarian speaker with a science background
          to orally translate the video interview into English. We then
          transcribed her translation. The video is here and our English
          transcript is here.<br>
          <br>
          Among the major bombshells Dr. Alexov dropped is that the
          leaders of the May 8 ESP webinar said no
          novel-coronavirus-specific antibodies have been found.<br>
          <br>
          The body forms antibodies specific to pathogens it encounters.
          These specific antibodies are known as monoclonal antibodies
          and are a key tool in pathology. This is done via
          immunohistochemistry, which involves tagging antibodies with
          colours and then coating the biopsy- or autopsy-tissue slides
          with them. After giving the antibodies time to bind to the
          pathogens they’re specific for, the pathologists can look at
          the slides under a microscope and see the specific places
          where the coloured antibodies — and therefore the pathogens
          they’re bound to – are located.<br>
          <br>
          Therefore, in the absence of monoclonal antibodies to the
          novel coronavirus, pathologists cannot verify whether
          SARS-CoV-2 is present in the body, or whether the diseases and
          deaths attributed to it indeed were caused by the virus rather
          than by something else.<br>
          <br>
          It would be easy to dismiss Dr. Alexov as just another crank
          ‘conspiracy theorist.’ After all many people believe they’re
          everywhere these days, spreading dangerous misinformation
          about COVID-19 and other issues.<br>
          <br>
          In addition, little of what Dr. Alexov alleges was the
          consensus from the May 8 webinar is in the publicly viewable
          parts of the proceedings.<br>
          <br>
          But keep in mind that whistleblowers often stand alone because
          the vast majority of people are afraid to speak out publicly.<br>
          <br>
          Also, Dr. Alexov has an unimpugnable record and reputation.
          He’s been a physician for 30 years. He’s president of the BPA,
          a member of the ESP’s Advisory Board and head of the
          histopathology department at the Oncology Hospital in the
          Bulgarian capital of Sofia.<br>
          <br>
          On top of that, there’s other support for what Dr. Alexov is
          saying.<br>
          <br>
          For example, the director of the Institute of Forensic
          Medicine at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in
          Germany said in media interviews that there’s a striking
          dearth of solid evidence for COVID-19’s lethality.<br>
          <br>
          “COVID-19 is a fatal disease only in exceptional cases, but in
          most cases it is a predominantly harmless viral infection,”
          Dr. Klaus Püschel told a German paper in April. Adding in
          another interview:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In quite a few cases, we have also found
          that the current corona infection has nothing whatsoever to do
          with the fatal outcome because other causes of death are
          present, for example, a brain hemorrhage or a heart attack […]
          [COVID-19 is] not particularly dangerous viral disease […] All
          speculation about individual deaths that have not been
          expertly examined only fuel anxiety.”<br>
          <br>
          Also, one of us (Rosemary) and another journalist, Amory
          Devereux, documented in a June 9 Off-Guardian article that the
          novel coronavirus has not fulfilled Koch’s postulates.<br>
          <br>
          These postulates are scientific steps used to prove whether a
          virus exists and has a one-to-one relationship with a specific
          disease. We showed that to date no one has proven SARS-CoV-2
          causes a discrete illness matching the characteristics of all
          the people who ostensibly died from COVID-19. Nor has the
          virus has been isolated, reproduced and then shown to cause
          this discrete illness.<br>

          For the first time, researchers have created the 'branched
          flow' phenomenon in visible light, previously only seen in
          other types of wave like sound. Using nothing but a laser and
          a simple soap bubble, scientists caused light to twist and
          fork along its path. They hope that the new set up could help
          shed more light on the phenomenon.<br>

          <b> Abstract<br>
          </b>When waves propagate through a weak disordered potential
          with correlation length larger than the wavelength, they form
          channels (branches) of enhanced intensity that keep dividing
          as the waves propagate1. This fundamental wave phenomenon is
          known as branched flow. It was first observed for
          electrons1,2,3,4,5,6 and for microwave cavities7,8, and it is
          generally expected for waves with vastly different
          wavelengths, for example, branched flow has been suggested as
          a focusing mechanism for ocean waves9,10,11, and was suggested
          to occur also in sound waves12 and ultrarelativistic electrons
          in graphene13. Branched flow may act as a trigger for the
          formation of extreme nonlinear events14,15,16,17 and as a
          channel through which energy is transmitted in a scattering
          medium18. Here we present the experimental observation of the
          branched flow of light. We show that, as light propagates
          inside a thin soap membrane, smooth thickness variations in
          the film act as a correlated disordered potential, focusing
          the light into filaments that display the features of branched
          flow: scaling of the distance to the first branching point and
          the probability distribution of the intensity. We find that,
          counterintuitively, despite the random variations in the
          medium and the linear nature of the effect, the filaments
          remain collimated throughout their paths. Bringing branched
          flow to the field of optics, with its full arsenal of tools,
          opens the door to the investigation of a plethora of new ideas
          such as branched flow in nonlinear media, in curved space or
          in active systems with gain. Furthermore, the labile nature of
          soap films leads to a regime in which the branched flow of
          light interacts and affects the underlying disorder through
          radiation pressure and gradient force.<b><br>

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>Oxygen vacancies in complex oxides are indispensable for
          information and energy technologies. There are several means
          to create oxygen vacancies in bulk materials. However, the use
          of ionic interfaces to create oxygen vacancies has not been
          fully explored. Herein, we report an oxide nanobrush
          architecture designed to create high-density interfacial
          oxygen vacancies. An atomically well-defined (111)
          heterointerface between the fluorite CeO2 and the bixbyite
          Y2O3 is found to induce a charge modulation between Y3+ and
          Ce4+ ions enabled by the chemical valence mismatch between the
          two elements. Local structure and chemical analyses, along
          with theoretical calculations, suggest that more than 10% of
          oxygen atoms are spontaneously removed without deteriorating
          the lattice structure. Our fluorite–bixbyite nanobrush
          provides an excellent platform for the rational design of
          interfacial oxide architectures to precisely create, control,
          and transport oxygen vacancies critical for developing
          ionotronic and memristive devices for advanced energy and
          neuromorphic computing technologies.<br>

          </b>...“I started researching and [found that] it destroys
          viruses, bacteria, candida, parasites, reduces overall body
          inflammation, and neutralizes heavy metals, so I’m all in,
          [because] that’s what autism is,” Rivera said, adding that she
          then prepared a dose, which she then gave to her son.<br>
          <br>
          What happened next was nothing short of a breakthrough.<br>
          <br>
          “I gave it to my son and on that same first day – I started
          with a full dose – he said things he never said before and he
          looked me in the eye like he hadn’t looked at me in eight
          years.”<br>
          <br>
          That was when the ball started rolling.<br>
          <br>
          “Nothing ever really worked for him, so when I saw this
          happening, I knew it had to be something. And at the clinic,
          people were like, ‘What are you doing?’ ‘What are you doing
          with him?’ and I was like, ‘well, there are these drops that I
          bought from this doctor in this city and you could order them
          from him,’ and it just started like that,” Rivera said, noting
          that more families and parents then adopted the use of
          chlorine dioxide for their autistic children soon after that.<br>
          <br>
          The results were astounding.<br>
          <br>
          “Within like six months, there were 28 recoveries from just
          the people I was working with.”<br>
          <b><br>
            Authorities turn down new findings<br>
            <br>
          </b>Rivera soon learned, however, that not everyone was
          receptive to new ideas regarding autism. She was turned down
          by authorities when she tried sharing her discovery with them.<br>
          <br>
          “I said I will contact the ARI, which is the Autism Research
          Institute started by Dr. [Bernard] Rimland in 1970 and of
          course, they’re going to want to know this information,” she
          said, noting that she did not know that this was going to be
          the first of many signs that people would not be as receptive
          to her ideas as she first thought.<br>
          <br>
          “I contacted them and they were like ‘oh no if there is no
          double-blind, side-by-side study we’re not really interested
          in those 28 recoveries in those few months.’”...<br>

          <br>
          As a teacher of Pranayama Yoga deep-breathing techniques for
          over a decade, I am regularly asked about a man named Wim Hof
          and the breath-work practice he has labeled "The Wim Hof
          Method." This video is a response to this constant question I
          am asked, is intended to elucidate my position on the matter,
          and not meant as an attack on Mr. Hof who I appreciate for
          bringing widespread attention to the importance of proper
          breathing. Wim Hof has shown that through prolonged
          breath-work practice many seemingly super-human feats such as
          extreme cold resistance and rapid healing of illnesses is
          possible<b>. The main issue I have with what I call "the Wim
            Hof Mouth-Breating Hyper-Ventilation Technique" is that he
            has essentially rebranded a less effective version of the
            Pranayama Yoga Breath of Fire and given it a new title after
            his own name calling it "The Wim Hof Method."</b> To begin
          with, there are many beneficial breathing techniques known and
          taught by ancient Yogis for thousands of years, most of them
          focusing on slow, full, deep inhales through the nose and
          exhales through the mouth. Wim Hof focuses on only one such
          technique (the Breath of Fire) and irresponsibly tells
          everyone to breathe through their mouth! This is absolutely
          not beneficial for your health/lungs long-term. <br>

              Evaporative Cooling and Low-Grade Heat Energy Harvesting</b><br>

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>Efficient heat removal and recovery are two conflicting
          processes that are difficult to achieve simultaneously. Here,
          in this work, we pave a new way to achieve this through the
          use of a smart thermogalvanic hydrogel film, in which the ions
          and water undergo two separate thermodynamic cycles:
          thermogalvanic reaction and water-to-vapor phase transition.
          When the hydrogel is attached to a heat source, it can achieve
          efficient evaporative cooling while simultaneously converting
          a portion of the waste heat into electricity. Moreover, the
          hydrogel can absorb water from the surrounding air to
          regenerate its water content later on. This reversibility can
          be finely designed. As an applicative demonstration, the
          hydrogel film with a thickness of 2 mm was attached to a cell
          phone battery while operating. It successfully decreased the
          temperature of the battery by 20 °C and retrieved electricity
          of 5 μW at the discharging rate of 2.2 C.<br>

          <b><br>
          </b>This passive device relies on a layer of material that
          blocks incoming sunlight but lets heat radiate away.<br>
          <br>
          A device was developed that can sit outside under blazing
          sunlight on a clear day without using any power to cool things
          down by more than 23 °F (13 °C). The device, which has no
          moving parts, works by a process called radiative cooling. It
          blocks incoming sunlight to keep from heating it up, and at
          the same time, efficiently radiates infrared light — which is
          essentially heat — that passes straight out into the sky and
          into space, cooling the device significantly below the ambient
          air temperature.<br>
          <br>
          The key to the function of the inexpensive system is
          insulation made of a polyethylene foam called an aerogel. This
          lightweight material blocks and reflects the visible rays of
          sunlight so that they don’t penetrate through it. But it’s
          highly transparent to the infrared rays that carry heat,
          allowing them to pass freely outward. Such a system could be
          used, for example, as a way to keep vegetables and fruit from
          spoiling, potentially doubling the time the produce could
          remain fresh in remote places where reliable power for
          refrigeration is not available.<br>
          <br>
          Radiative cooling is the main process that most hot objects
          use to cool down. They emit mid-range infrared radiation,
          which carries the heat energy from the object straight off
          into space because air is highly transparent to infrared
          light. The new device is based on a concept that also uses
          radiative cooling but employs a physical barrier (a narrow
          strip of metal) to shade the device from direct sunlight to
          prevent it from heating up. That device worked but it provided
          less than half the amount of cooling power that the new system
          achieves because of its highly efficient insulating layer.<br>
          <br>
          The biggest input of heat preventing the earlier device from
          achieving deeper cooling was from the heat of the surrounding
          air. The problem is that almost all insulating materials are
          also very good at blocking infrared light and so would
          interfere with the radiative cooling effect. The solution came
          through the development of a new kind of aerogel. Aerogels are
          lightweight materials that consist mostly of air and provide
          very good thermal insulation, with a structure made up of
          microscopic foamlike formations of some material. The new
          insight was to make an aerogel out of polyethylene, the
          material used in many plastic bags. The result is a soft,
          squishy, white material that’s so lightweight that a given
          volume weighs just 1/50 as much as water.<br>
          <br>
          The key to its success is that while it blocks more than 90
          percent of incoming sunlight, thus protecting the surface
          below from heating, it is very transparent to infrared light,
          allowing about 80 percent of the heat rays to pass freely
          outward. The result is that it can dramatically cool down a
          plate, made of a material such as metal or ceramic, placed
          below the insulating layer, which is referred to as an
          emitter. That plate could then cool a container connected to
          it or cool liquid passing through coils in contact with it to
          provide cooling for produce or air or water.<br>
          <br>
          The system could be used to provide an initial cooling stage
          for electric refrigeration, thus minimizing the load on those
          systems to allow them to operate more efficiently with less
          power.<br>

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>More than 600 GW of photovoltaic panels are currently
          installed worldwide, with the predicted total capacity
          increasing very rapidly every year. One essential issue in
          photovoltaic conversion is the massive heat generation of
          photovoltaic panels under sunlight, which represents 75–96% of
          the total absorbed solar energy and thus greatly increases the
          temperature and decreases the energy efficiency and lifetime
          of photovoltaic panels. In this report we demonstrate a new
          and versatile photovoltaic panel cooling strategy that employs
          a sorption-based atmospheric water harvester as an effective
          cooling component. The atmospheric water harvester
          photovoltaic cooling system provides an average cooling power
          of 295 W m–2 and lowers the temperature of a photovoltaic
          panel by at least 10 °C under 1.0 kW m–2 solar irradiation in
          laboratory conditions. It delivered a 13–19% increase in
          electricity generation in a commercial photovoltaic panel in
          outdoor field tests conducted in the winter and summer in
          Saudi Arabia. The atmospheric water harvester based
          photovoltaic panel cooling strategy has little geographical
          constraint in terms of its application and has the potential
          to improve the electricity production of existing and future
          photovoltaic plants, which can be directly translated into
          less CO2 emission or less land occupation by photovoltaic
          panels. As solar power is taking centre stage in the global
          fight against climate change, atmospheric water harvester
          based cooling represents an important step toward
          sustainability.<br>

              noteworthy presence of (poly)phenols in hemp seeds has
              been long overshadowed by the essential polyunsaturated
              fatty acids and digestible proteins, considered
              responsible for their high nutritional benefits. Instead,
              lignanamides and their biosynthetic precursors,
              phenylamides, seem to display interesting and diverse
              biological activities only partially clarified in the last
              decades. Herein, negative mode HR-MS/MS techniques were
              applied to the chemical investigation of a
              (poly)phenol-rich fraction, obtained from hemp seeds after
              extraction/fractionation steps. This extract contained
              phenylpropanoid amides and their random oxidative coupling
              derivatives, lignanamides, which were the most abundant
              compounds and showed a high chemical diversity, deeply
              unraveled through high resolution tandem mass spectrometry
              (HR-MS/MS) tools. The effect of different doses of the
              lignanamides-rich extract (LnHS) on U-87 glioblastoma cell
              line and non-tumorigenic human fibroblasts was evaluated.
              Thus, cell proliferation, genomic DNA damage, colony
              forming and wound repair capabilities were assessed, as
              well as LnHS outcome on the expression levels of
              pro-inflammatory cytokines. LnHS significantly inhibited
              U-87 cancer cell proliferation, but not that of
              fibroblasts, and was able to reduce U-87 cell migration,
              inducing further DNA damage. No modification in cytokines'
              expression level was found. Data acquired suggested that
              LnHS acted in U-87 cells by inducing the apoptosis
              machinery and suppressing the autophagic cell death.</font></font></font><b><font

              threshold was reached two months ago ...Several points are
              noteworthy:<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recorded new cases continued rising
              until mid-April, and after gently declining from then
              until late May have doubled since then. All or most of
              that increase appears to have been be due to a decision on
              5 June to expand testing. By the end of June testing was
              at about double the rate in May, which in turn averaged
              approximately 25% higher than in April.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allowing for the increase in testing
              over time, the incidence of COVID-19 appears to have
              declined by about 30% from mid-April until the late May
              and has since remained broadly stable.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deaths peaked in mid-April and have
              fallen by two-thirds since then.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It follows that the infection fatality
              rate has fallen substantially since early in the epidemic.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deaths have been remarkably high in
              relation to confirmed cases. To a substantial extent this
              reflects Swedish policy of focussing testing in hospital,
              where the disease is severe, prior to June. It also
              reflects the spread of infections to care homes, where
              death rates are very high, relatively early in the
              epidemic.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Far more people have died than have
              been put into an intensive care unit (ICU). This likely
              reflects a combination of deaths outside hospital and an
              apparent Swedish policy of not generally putting people
              aged 80+ into intensive care.[2] For admissions before
              late April, 49% of 70+ year old patients (who only

            color="#660000"><font color="#000000">Cannabis and its
              pharmacologically active constituents, phytocannabinoids,
              have long been reported to have multiple medicinal
              benefits. One association often reported by users is
              sedation and subjective improvements in sleep. To further
              examine this association, we conducted a critical review
              of clinical studies examining the effects of cannabinoids
              on subjective and objective measures of sleep. PubMED, Web
              of Science, and Google Scholar were searched using terms
              and synonyms related to cannabinoids and sleep. Articles
              chosen included randomized controlled trials and open
              label studies. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to
              assess the quality of trials that compared cannabinoids
              with control interventions. The current literature focuses
              mostly on the use of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and/or
              cannabidiol (CBD) in the treatment of chronic health
              conditions such as multiple sclerosis, posttraumatic
              stress disorder (PTSD), and chronic pain. Sleep is often a
              secondary, rather than primary outcome in these studies.
              Many of the reviewed studies suggested that cannabinoids
              could improve sleep quality, decrease sleep disturbances,
              and decrease sleep onset latency. While many of the
              studies did show a positive effect on sleep, there are
              many limiting factors such as small sample sizes,
              examining sleep as a secondary outcome in the context of
              another illness, and relatively few studies using
              validated subjective or objective measurements. This
              review also identified several questions that should be
              addressed in future research. These questions include
              further elucidation of the dichotomy between the effects
              of THC and CBD, as well as identifying any long-term
              adverse effects of medicinal cannabinoid use.</font></font></font><b><font

              been plodding behind the scenes for years in preparing of
              their veiled entrance into the cannabis industry. With
              patented ‘odorless’ strains, weed connoisseurs could soon
              be smoking genetically engineered pot without even
              realizing it.<br>
              <br>
              A Canadian company called CannabCo Pharmaceutical Corp.
              seeks to be the first of such companies to produce fully
              genetically modified (GM) cannabis. Similar to the
              non-browning apple developed by Okanagan Specialty Fruits
              Inc., CannabCo has developed a form of cannabis with
              technology which “greatly reduces” odor.<br>
              <br>
              “A number of users, and people that are around cannabis
              smokers, complain about the smell, especially in enclosed
              areas, condos and apartments, and this technology
              addresses those concerns.” – CannabCo President Mark
              Pellicane<br>
              <br>
              However, no trials have been conducted to determine
              whether smoking genetically modified cannabis causes any
              adverse effects on its user’s health. There have been no
              animal studies to date, and certainly no long-term studies
              on humans showing that the product is safe to use.<br>
              <br>
              “How would they know that? I mean, you couldn’t do a
              randomized placebo-controlled trial because people would
              taste the difference.” – Peter Grinspoon, a doctor at
              Massachusetts General Hospital..</font></font></font><b><font

              coronavirus cases in Chicago appeared in January, they
              bore the same genetic signatures as a germ that emerged in
              China weeks before.<br>
              <br>
              But as Egon Ozer, an infectious-disease specialist at the
              Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine,
              examined the genetic structure of virus samples from local
              patients, he noticed something different.<br>
              <br>
              A change in the virus was appearing again and again. This
              mutation, associated with outbreaks in Europe and New
              York, eventually took over the city. By May, it was found
              in 95% of all the genomes Ozer sequenced.<br>
              <br>
              At a glance, the mutation seemed trivial. About 1,300
              amino acids serve as building blocks for a protein on the
              surface of the virus. In the mutant virus, the genetic
              instructions for just one of those amino acids - number
              614 - switched in the new variant from a "D" (shorthand
              for aspartic acid) to a "G" (short for glycine)...<br>

              power harvesting device invented by Shawn Frayn in 2004
              for converting wind power to electricity.[1][2] It
              consists of a flexible polymer ribbon stretched between
              supports transverse to the wind direction, with magnets
              glued to it. When the wind blows across it, the ribbon
              vibrates due to aeroelastic flutter, similar to the action
              of an aeolian harp. The vibrating movement of the magnets
              induces current in nearby pickup coils by electromagnetic
              induction.<br>

              Columbia Engineering researchers have been refining their
              unconventional desalination approach for hypersaline
              brines—temperature swing solvent extraction (TSSE)—that
              shows great promise for widespread use. TSSE is radically
              different from conventional methods because it is a
              solvent-extraction-based technique that does not use
              membranes and is not based on evaporative phase-change: it
              is effective, efficient, scalable, and sustainably
              powered. In a new paper, published online June 23 in
              Environmental Science &amp; Technology, the team reports
              that their method has enabled them to attain
              energy-efficient zero-liquid discharge (ZLD) of ultrahigh
              salinity brines—the first demonstration of TSSE for ZLD
              desalination of hypersaline brines.<br>
              <br>
              “Zero-liquid discharge is the last frontier of
              desalination,” says Ngai Yin Yip, an assistant professor
              of earth and environmental engineering who led the study.
              “Evaporating and condensing the water is the current
              practice for ZLD but it’s very energy intensive and
              prohibitively costly. We were able to achieve ZLD without
              boiling the water off—this is a major advance for
              desalinating the ultrahigh salinity brines that
              demonstrates how our TSSE technique can be a
              transformative technology for the global water industry.”<br>
              <br>
              Yip’s TSSE process begins with mixing a low-polarity
              solvent with the high salinity brine. At low temperatures
              (the team used 5 °C), the TSSE solvent extracts water from
              the brine but not salts (which are present in the brine as
              ions). By controlling the ratio of solvent to brine, the
              team can extract all the water from the brine into the
              solvent to induce the precipitation of salts—after all the
              water is “sucked” into the solvent, the salts form solid
              crystals and fall to the bottom, which can then be easily
              sieved out.<br>
              <br>
              After the researchers separate out the precipitated salts,
              they warm up the water-laden solvent to a moderate
              temperature of around 70 °C. At this higher temperature,
              the solvent’s solubility for water decreases and water is
              squeezed out from the solvent, like a sponge. The
              separated water forms a layer below the solvent and has
              much less salt than the initial brine. It can be readily
              siphoned off and the regenerated solvent can then be
              reused for the next TSSE cycle...<br>
              <br>
              With a simulated (lab-prepared) brine feed of 292,500
              part-per-million total dissolved solids, Yip’s group was
              able to precipitate more than 90% of the salt in the
              original solution. In addition, the researchers estimated
              that the process used only about a quarter of the energy
              required for evaporation of water—a 75% energy savings
              compared to thermally evaporating the brine. They reused
              the solvent for several cycles with no noticeable loss in
              performance, demonstrating that the solvent was conserved
              and not expended during the process...</font></font></font><b><font

                  hypersaline brines is technically and energetically
                  challenging. This study demonstrates ZLD of ultrahigh
                  salinity brines using temperature swing solvent
                  extraction (TSSE), a membrane-less and non-evaporative
                  desalination technology. TSSE utilizes a low-polarity
                  solvent to extract water from brine and then release
                  the water as product with the application of
                  low-temperature heat. Complete extraction of water
                  from a hypersaline feed simulated by 5.0 M NaCl
                  solution (≈292 g/L TDS) was achieved using
                  diisopropylamine solvent. Practically all the salt is
                  precipitated as mineral solid waste and the product
                  water contains &lt;5% of NaCl relative to the
                  hypersaline feed brine. Consistent ZLD performance of
                  high salt removals and product water quality was
                  maintained in three repeated semibatch TSSE cycles,
                  highlighting recyclability of the solvent. Practical
                  applicability of the technique for actual field
                  samples was demonstrated by ZLD of an irrigation
                  drainage water concentrate. This study establishes the
                  potential of TSSE as a more sustainable alternative to
                  current thermal evaporation methods for zero liquid
                  discharge of ultrahigh salinity brines.</font></font><br>

              France intensified the controversy on safety of
              foodborne‐TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs). This study determines
              the biological effects of TiO2 NPs and TiO2 (E171) in
              obese and non‐obese mice. Oral consumption (0.1 wt% in
              diet for 8 weeks) of TiO2 (E171, 112 nm) and TiO2 NPs (33
              nm) does not cause severe toxicity in mice, but
              significantly alters composition of gut microbiota, for
              example, increased abundance of Firmicutes phylum and
              decreased abundance of Bacteroidetes phylum and
              Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus genera, which are
              accompanied by decreased cecal levels of short‐chain fatty
              acids. Both TiO2 (E171) and TiO2 NPs increase abundance of
              pro‐inflammatory immune cells and cytokines in the colonic
              mucosa, indicating an inflammatory state. Importantly,
              TiO2 NPs cause stronger colonic inflammation than TiO2
              (E171), and obese mice are more susceptible to the
              effects. A microbiota transplant study demonstrates that
              altered fecal microbiota by TiO2 NPs directly mediate
              inflammatory responses in the mouse colon. Furthermore,
              proteomic analysis shows that TiO2 NPs cause more
              alterations in multiple pathways in the liver and colon of
              obese mice than non‐obese mice. This study provides

              According to a study about the research published in the
              Journals of Gerontology, cellular function declines with
              age due to lower densities of mitochondria in the retina’s
              photoreceptor cells. Mitochondria are — as you may have
              learned in school — the powerhouse of the cell, producing
              energy and boost cell function. Photoreceptor cells are
              particularly power hungry — but after being exposed to
              near-infrared light with a wavelength of 670 nanometers,
              their performance improved, along with study subjects’
              eyesight.<br>

              It was surrounded by a liquid according to the recipe of
              the primeval soup, with a temperature of 40 to 80°C and

              <br>
              With this experimental setup, chemist Christian Mayer from
              the Center for Nanointegration (CENIDE) and geologist
              Ulrich Schreiber, also a professor at the UDE, have
              simulated water-filled crevices in the Earth's bowels as
              well as geothermal sources. In their laboratory
              experiment, they created and disintegrated a total of
              1,500 vesicle generations within two weeks.<br>
              <br>
              The researchers discovered that some vesicles survived the
              generation change because they had embedded certain
              protein precursors from the primordial soup into their
              membrane. This made them more stable, smaller and—most
              importantly—their membrane became slightly more permeable.<br>
            </font><font color="#000000"><br>
              Forwarding functions to subsequent generations<br>
            </font><font color="#000000">"We concluded that this way,
              the vesicles were able to compensate for destructive
              pressure. As a survival strategy, if you will," explains
              Mayer. Even if such a vesicle was destroyed, the next
              generation took up the protein structure. In this way, it
              adopted a function from its predecessors—similar to
              classical inheritance.<br>
              <br>
              Mayer and Schreiber are certain that they have at least
              shown the way to a preliminary stage of life. "As we have
              simulated in time-lapse, billions of years ago, such
              vesicles might have become stable enough to come to the
              surface during geyser eruptions," said Schreiber. Over
              time, other functions might have been added until the
              first cell was formed.<br>
              <br>
              Mayer summarizes: "We suspect that this type of molecular
              evolution in depth took place parallel to other mechanisms
              or temporally displaced from them."<br>
              <br>
              Mayer and Schreiber's book, "The First Cell—The Mystery
              Surrounding the Beginning of Life," will be published in
              July 2020. <br>

            color="#660000"><font color="#000000">Scientists at the U.S.
              Department of Energy's Ames Laboratory have discovered
              that skyrmions— a type of quasiparticle with properties
              that could lead to the next generation of data storage and
              transfer— reproduce by splitting in a way very similar to
              biological cell division.<br>
              <br>
              Skyrmions are nanoscale magnetic vortices, a type of
              quasiparticle that are driven by ultra-low electrical
              current. As a quasiparticle, they have no real mass, yet
              form a periodic pattern very similar to the symmetrical
              arrangement of atoms inside a crystal, or crystal lattice.<br>
              <br>
              "In order to integrate skyrmions into future devices,
              science must have an accurate understanding of their
              formation mechanism" said Lin Zhou, a scientist who
              employs cutting-edge microscopy techniques for measuring
              local magnetic properties in materials at Ames
              Laboratory's Sensitive Instrument Facility. "In this
              research, we directly proved that skyrmion crystal grows
              from a conical magnetic phase in the same way as real
              nanocrystals grow from solution."<br>
              <br>
              Unlike those real crystal structures, however, the
              skyrmions can annihilate imperfections in the lattice
              pattern by self-splitting (similar to cell reproduction),
              a kind of self-healing process that has never been
              described before...</font></font></font><b><font <hr=""

              economic, and societal chaos.<br>
              <br>
              But surprisingly, one scientist predicted our particularly
              hellish year a full decade ago. University of Connecticut
              researcher Peter Turchin published an article in the
              journal Nature, back in 2010, in which he predicted that
              social and economic turmoil would come to a boiling point
              in or around 2020.<br>

            </font><font color="#000000">Turchin, who studies math,
              ecology and evolutionary biology, and anthropology at the
              University of Connecticut, identified multiple cycles of
              economic growth and turmoil, rises in public debt, and
              disgruntled 20-somethings — all of which were set to
              converge this year in the U.S.<br>
              <br>
              “Quantitative historical analysis reveals that complex
              human societies are affected by recurrent — and
              predictable — waves of political instability,” Turchin
              wrote in the paper.<br>
              <br>
              Turchin identified 50-year cycles in political instability
              and 40 to 60-year cycles of economic growth and turmoil,
              called Kondratiev waves, that suggested particularly
              severe recessions were coming. To be fair, he didn’t guess
              that a deadly pandemic would also happen at the same time.<br>
              <br>
              “Records show that societies can avert disaster,” Turchin
              wrote. “We need to find ways to ameliorate the negative
              effects of globalization on people’s well-being. Economic
              inequality, accompanied by burgeoning public debt, can be
              addressed by making tax rates more progressive. And we
              should not expand our system of higher education beyond
              the ability of the economy to absorb university
              graduates.”</font></font></font></font><font

              everywhere. Not much engineering use has been found for
              shadows, and this ubiquitous effect is strenuously avoided
              in optoelectronic applications. In this work, we present a
              shadow-effect energy generator (SEG) that scavenges the
              illumination contrast that arises on the device from
              shadow castings, and generates a direct current, simply by
              placing a part of the generator in shadow. The
              shadow-effect mechanism is experimentally validated by
              Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM). The SEG is capable
              of harvesting energy from illumination contrasts arising
              under weak ambient light. Without any optimization, our
              generator has a power density of 0.14 μW cm−2 under indoor
              conditions 0.001 sun, where shadows are persistent. Our
              SEG performs 200% better than that of commercial silicon
              solar cells under the effects of shadows. The harvested
              energy from our generator in the presence of shadows
              arising at a very low intensity (0.0025 sun) can drive an
              electronic watch (1.2 V). In addition, the SEG can serve
              as a self-powered sensor for monitoring moving objects by
              tracking the movement of shadows. With its
              cost-efficiency, simplicity and stability, our SEG offers
              a promising architecture to generate green energy from
              ambient conditions to power electronics, and as a part of
              a smart sensor systems, especially in buildings.</font></font></font><b><font

              the University of Virginia (UV) has found that hand
              sanitizers do practically nothing to prevent the
              transmission of viruses like influenza and rhinovirus, a
              major cause of the common cold.<br>
              <br>
              Dr. Ronald B. Turner and his colleagues from UV evaluated
              212 volunteers as part of their study, 116 of which were
              instructed to carry with them an "enhanced antiviral
              activity" hand sanitizer to be used every three hours
              throughout the day. The other 96 volunteers simply lived
              their routine lives with no interventions.<br>
              <br>
              For ten weeks, researchers collected periodic samples from
              both groups to test the presence of influenza and
              rhinovirus. They also collected samples whenever any
              volunteer indicated flu or cold symptoms. At the end of
              the ten-week period, the hand sanitizer group had only
              slightly less cold and flu cases than did the control
              group. According to researchers, the difference was
              statistically insignificant....</font></font></font></font><font

              hyperprolactinemia, a condition that, in men, causes

            Seattle boy solved the problem of the ages and realized the
            dream of science since electrical invention had birth? Has
            Alfred M. Hubbard, son of Mr. and Mrs. William Hubbard
            tapped the inexhaustible reservoirs of nature’s energy and
            harnessed to the use of man the illimitable power that
            permeates the universe?<br>
            <br>
            Hubbard has announced the perfection of an invention he
            terms an “atmospheric power generator” and made claims that
            last night caused Seattle’s leading electrical engineers to
            doubt the evidences of their senses and to pause before they
            condemned as folly the assertions of the youth. With the
            apparatus, in appearance a small coil of wire about six
            inches in diameter surrounding a permanently magnetic core
            eight inches long, the entire contrivance easily carried in
            a man’s hand. Hubbard gave a demonstration yesterday
            afternoon miles from his laboratory that, regardless of the
            principals involved, several Seattle engineers declared
            without parallel in electrical history.</font></font><b><font

              <b>MARVELOUS ANYWAY</b><br>
            </font></font></b><font <hr="" width="100%"><font
            color="#000000">An ordinary incandescent electric light
            connected with the two terminals of the atmospheric power
            generator glowed a cherry red for nearly one hour, and
            Hubbard volunteered to permit the lamp to burn for as many
            hours as was necessary to satisfy the most skeptical.<br>
            <br>
            The young inventor claims that there are no moving parts
            connected with his generator; that there are no hidden
            batteries, storage or primary; and those who witnessed the
            demonstration made sure that there was no outside connection
            with any source of power.<br>
            <br>
            Hubbard’s explanation of the phenomenon is that he has
            succeeded in transforming the earth lines of magnetic force
            into electrical energy available for use. While electrical
            engineers were highly skeptical last night, and held to the
            possibility of fraud, as George Quinan, superintendent of
            the electrical operations of the Puget Sound Traction Light
            and Power company, said “no matter what the lad has done, it
            is a marvelous demonstration”. All of the experts agreed
            that if as Hubbard declares, there are no moving parts and
            no concealed batteries, the invention was revolutionary.
            They had no explanation to offer for its operation.<br>
            <br>
            J.D. Ross, superintendent of the municipal lighting
            department, and one of the foremost authorities on
            experimental electricity in the northwest, declared it
            possible that Hubbard had stumbled upon the answer to the
            question of the ages – can the power of the atmosphere be
            utilized?</font></font><b><font <hr="" width="100%"><font

          </font></b><font <hr="" width="100%"><font color="#000000">“It
            is hard to believe”, said Ross, “that this boy has done what
            the world’s scientists have failed to do, yet there is much
            in the statement that in the field of electricity nothing is
            impossible. I am inclined to believe, since I have not seen
            the device, that there is some trickery, but those who have
            seen it tell me that such is apparently not the case, and I
            must confess that I have no alternative but to admit the
            demonstration is almost unbelievable”.<br>
            <br>
            Carl Edward Magnusson, acting dean of the University of
            Washington college of engineering declined to even hazard a
            guess as to the principal involved in the device. “It sounds
            like trickery to me and I can hardly believe that the
            experiment as it has been described to me actually took
            place” he said. “I will not venture an opinion until I have
            seen it”.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            C.F. Uhden, special engineer of the city, in charge of the
            Skagit River power development, declared himself intently
            interested in the invention and after canvassing the
            possibilities of chicanery, admitted that he wouldn’t dare
            form an opinion until he has seen the apparatus in
            operation. “It’s always possible” he said, “though there
            have been many to make the claim and no one to substantiate
            it in the past”.</font></font><b><font <hr="" width="100%"><font

            patented, owing to complications arising with his backers,
            it is said, has refused to allow technical men more than a
            glimpse at the apparatus. Hubbard appears untrained in
            business, and like many inventors, cautious. He has no
            appearance of the charlatan and made the blanket statement
            that any of the seemingly extravagant claims for his
            invention he was willing to prove by operation under test
            conditions. All that could be learned from Hubbard regarding
            the construction of the instrument follows:</font></font><font
          color="#000000"><b><font <hr="" width="100%"><br>
              <br>
              <b>BURNS LAMP LONG TIME</b><br>
            </font></b><font <hr="" width="100%">Hubbard’s claims for
            the invention bring into being a host of dreams. If, as he
            says, he can obtain four kilowatts, equivalent to more than
            five horse power, from a contrivance weighing less than
            twelve pounds, then his claim that he can build a generator
            less than eighteen feet in length to develop 18,000 horse
            power of sufficient electrical energy to drive the new
            battleship New Mexico is not unreasonable, in the opinion of
            the engineers.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Hubbard offers to build for $50 a generator large enough to
            drive an automobile and much smaller than present engines
            (it ended up costing $90). He offers also to build a
            generator and equip it with a motor to drive an airplane and
            to weigh about as much as the present motor without fuel.
            The tank and gasoline at present are one of the greatest
            weight factors of the airplane. The Hubbard generator,
            according to its inventor, would give the airplane unlimited
            flying range. Hubbard, who says he has a laboratory at his
            home with apparatus valued at $10,000, declares that he
            worked 18 hours a day for two years before he came to
            Seattle and (has continued working) during the year since
            perfecting the apparatus. His first model was built a year
            and a half ago, he said. Hubbard asserts that his
            four-kilowatt machine has continuously excited the
            equivalent of 120 ordinary 25watt house lamps to full
            brilliancy for three months. The device during this time,
            (he says he is ready to take an oath on it), did not receive
            outward stimulus, and at the time of the test was completed
            the lights were burning at the same brilliancy. The machine,
            he said, is composed of several layers of wire about a steel
            core, which is magnetized after the construction is
            complete. Once magnetized, the core needs no further
            attention, he said, and the entire device will deliver
            energy unremittingly for an indefinite length of time. “I
            place a maximum of fifty years on the life of the generator”
            said Hubbard, “simply because one must fix a maximum. I know
            no reason why it would not last until time rots the
            insulation away from the wires”. Hubbard denies that his
            device is a perpetual motion machine. He maintains that it
            taps the vast storehouses of cosmic energy and the apparatus
            is founded upon sound scientific principles. (Which ones are
            those?)</font><b><font <hr="" width="100%"><br>

              <b>GOT THE IDEA FROM A SPARK</b><br>
            </font></b><font <hr="" width="100%">“I have hitched my
            wires to the tail of the universe you might say”, he said.
            Hubbard has a high school education. His father is an
            electrical engineer, he said, and the family formerly lived
            in Spokane. It was while he was in charge of the air
            compressor at the Hercules mine near Coeur d’Alene, Idaho,
            that he first became interested in the problem. “I watched a
            great belt flit by me day after day, he related, and I noted
            thousands before me had that I could draw an electrical
            spark from the belt with my finger. I had always been
            interested in electricity and had studied a great deal from
            books since I was a small boy. The spark of the belt
            fascinated me. One night I conceived the idea that developed
            later into the generator. I will not say that it utilizes in
            any way the current derived by friction as from the belt.
            That is not accurate. I am not prepared to divulge the
            nature of the actual translation of energy. </font><b><font

              <b>SMALL SIZE PUZZLES</b><br>
            </font></b><font <hr="" width="100%">He also said that eight
            such lights had been kept burning from electricity furnished
            by the apparatus while locked into a safety deposit box for
            seventy-two hours. This is an unheard-of feat, according to
            the men of science. Hubbard was reticent concerning the
            whole matter, declining to tell more than a little under
            pressure and consenting to a demonstration only after much
            persuasion. Electrical engineers who were not privileged to
            witness the demonstration last night ventured theories at
            the operation. They said that while there were theories that
            the apparatus seemed to coincide with, if Hubbard has what
            he says that he has, he has accomplished what most
            hard-nosed savants have believed impossible. Most of the
            engineers inquired as to the possibility of hidden springs
            driving a small dynamo, but most of them abandoned this when
            they learned that approximately 85V had been delivered by
            the machine under test conditions for almost one hour. Other
            believed that a varying of a powerful magnetic field by a
            paraffin or fiber disc might produce this effect but
            admitted this highly improbable. They doubted that so great
            a pressure could be obtained from a contrivance of so small
            a size.</font><b><font <hr="" width="100%"><br>

          SEATTLE, Wash. –</font></b><font <hr="" width="100%">
        Experiments even more baffling than those witnessed by local
        electrical experts recently when Alfred M. Hubbard, 19-year old
        inventor, demonstrated his atmospheric power generator, were
        shown later when the young man threw the switch into place on a
        twenty-five horse power electric motor and instantly the motor
        jumped to life , developing its full capacity of power. Skeptics
        present said the motor was connected by unseen wires. Hubbard
        hoisted his motor with a block and tackle and allowed those
        present to make examinations and tests to assure themselves that
        no wires extended from the motor. The result of the
        demonstration was an even greater mystery regarding the young
        man’s discovery, if it is one. Hubbard went even further. He
        told how the motor was made to operate, took it apart and showed
        those present just what it consisted of. He would not tell,
        however, how he had arranged the parts to change the polarity at
        the rate of 120 times per second, which he says is the secret of
        his invention.</font><b><font <hr="" width="100%"><br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>ORDINARY MOTOR USED</b><b><br>
          </b></font></b><font <hr="" width="100%">The motor was an
        ordinary alternating current motor of twenty-five horse power,
        equipped with the usual armatures and fields. Hubbard’s change
        on the motor was to insert six rods of manganese steel wrapped
        with wire in the head of each of the two armatures and a change
        in the wrapping of the two fields. This is the same principal
        upon which he says his small model works. In the center of the
        inserted wrapped rods Hubbard places a steel core which, when
        first put in place, is then magnetized. These rods and the steel
        core make up the physical construction of the power unit.
        Hubbard says the secret of his discovery lies in the wrapping of
        the coils. Last July 4th, Hubbard says he had a boat equipped
        with a similar twenty-five horse power motor. With this power it
        was much faster than a gasoline engine boat. He entered races at
        Union City on Hood’s canal. He won by a big margin. His success
        attracted the attention of many boat owners who were curious as
        to the engine that drove his craft. Hubbard told them freely he
        says, of his discovery and inventions, knowing the secret could
        not be read from an exhibition of the motor. Hubbard says his
        backers became alarmed at his free-handed manner of displaying
        his invention and insisted that he dismantle the boat. </font><b><font

          <br>
          <b>NEW MODEL PROMISED</b><br>
        </font></b><font <hr="" width="100%">Hubbard is loath to give a
        public demonstration, as many here want him to do, until he has
        completed his patents, he says. He will, however, show his new
        model on its completion within the next two weeks. Hubbard’s
        mail since his announcement of the invention has contained
        several bona-fide offers from large corporations in the east now
        using gasoline motors, to adopt his device if it proves
        satisfactory. Hubbard smiles at these letters and replies
        courteously and remarks to his friends that the day is not far
        distant when the writers will be forced by competition to adopt
        his device. <br>
        <br>
        Hubbard’s smiles are not saved alone for enterprising
        corporation representative’s letters. He smiles at the experts
        and university professors when they accuse his of having a
        battery somewhere in the device. Hubbard’s mail also contains
        letters from women, accompanied by photographs, offering
        proposals of marriage. Several attorneys have written offering
        legal advice. One letter offers the theory that Hubbard’s device
        is operate by personal magnetism. <br>
        <br>
        While engineers have not yet given Hubbard’s device their
        endorsement, scientific circles here have been aroused to a
        discussion of age-old master problems of science. Theories
        unnumbered are offered to account for the performance of
        Hubbard’s device, but Hubbard persists that he has told and
        shown all there is to tell and see about. Within the next two
        months, Hubbard says, he will fit one of his discoveries to an
        automobile. He says the device will continue in operation until
        shut-off by a switch, or if left running continuously, until the
        metal it is composed off disintegrates.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

                  Major auto-hemotherapy is an effective countermeasure
                  against a wide range of viruses, bacteria and other
                  pathogens. It also works against cancer, which has an
                  anaerobic metabolism. Physicians in many countries
                  have used this treatment for several decades. The
                  reference that provided us with the most information
                  on this is “The Use of Ozone in Medicine” by Drs.
                  Siegfried Rilling and Renate Viebahn. An astonishing
                  range of conditions were resolved through this
                  treatment.<br>
                  <br>
                  The basic procedure is this:<br>
                  <br>
                  A medical ozone and oxygen gas mixture is added to 50
                  to 100 ml of&nbsp; venous blood from the patient in a
                  sterile vacuum flask, using a micro-bubble process
                  that allows ozone to contact all blood cells. <br>
                  <br>
                  Sodium citrate is included to ensure against
                  coagulation. As the ozone molecules dissolve into the
                  blood they give up their third oxygen atoms, releasing
                  considerable energy which disables any viruses, while
                  leaving blood cells unharmed.<br>
                  <br>
                  The treated blood is then returned to the patient via
                  drip infusion. <br>
                  <br>
                  This treatment is given from twice a week to twice a
                  day, depending on how advanced the disease is. The
                  infusion strengthens the rest of the patient's blood
                  as it disperses.<br>
                  <br>
                  Ozone was previously shown to destroy the SARS
                  coronavirus which has a similar structure to the one
                  currently causing so many problems.<br>
                  <br>
                  To be clear, ozone therapy involves a completely
                  different principle than pathogen-specific vaccines,
                  and does not require months of development and
                  testing. It exploits a fundamental structural weakness
                  that all pathogens have in common. It has already been
                  proven effective over many years of successful
                  treatments.<br>
                  <br>
                  (A related set of treatments, first reported over a
                  century ago, involve highly diluted food-grade
                  hydrogen peroxide, either ingested at 0.1% strength or
                  less, starting with very low dosages, absorbed through
                  the skin in a bath, or administered as a slow IV, at
                  0.035%. Oxygen baths at up to 0.1% are safe,
                  invigorating and offer a mild immunity boost. For the
                  other methods, study the literature before
                  experimenting.)<br>
                  <br>
                  An explanation from more than eighty years ago still
                  applies. In 1939 Dr. William Frederick Koch summarized
                  the feature shared by the chemistries of all disease
                  organisms, that leaves every one of them vulnerable on
                  the same front: “Molecular structures that
                  catalytically quench the normal oxidation catalysis
                  possess rather heavy molecular weight which
                  contributes inertia. At the same time they possess an
                  ethylene, quinone, imide or amino group, the free
                  valencies of which actively absorb the energy of the
                  positive oxidation catalyst and thus remove its
                  activity from the reaction field. The toxins of
                  pathogenic germs and allergenic substances are all
                  built up along this plan. They therefore possess a
                  common mechanism of action which offers a single means
                  of attack whereby they can be completely destroyed so
                  far as their toxic action is concerned. One agent,
                  therefore, can serve specifically destructive to all
                  of them and this agent is a vigorous oxidation
                  catalysis.” See “Blood Chemistry in Malignancy”, “The
                  Function of Cancer”, “Clinical Demonstration of the
                  Laws of Chemical Structure that Determine Immunity to
                  Disease”, and “The Survival Factor in Neoplastic and
                  Viral Diseases” (advises cancer patients to drink
                  dilute H2O2).<br>
                  <br>
                  This same vulnerability would also apply to viruses
                  that perhaps did not occur naturally.<br>
                  <br>
                  Ozone can also be dispersed in air to decontaminate
                  infected spaces and surfaces, though people should
                  wait at least forty minutes before re-entering the
                  treated area, since high concentrations can harm lung
                  tissues. <br>
                  <br>
                  Ozone therapy has still not been mentioned in the
                  daily briefings. Recent references to benefits of
                  sunlight and ultraviolet light have come close, since
                  ozone is formed naturally by the action of UV on
                  oxygen. Ozone therapy could very loosely be described
                  as “getting light inside the body” since it is a
                  product of light and oxygen. It has long been
                  recognized as a powerful disinfectant.<br>
                  <br>
                  This suggests a rather obvious downside to keeping
                  people indoors for long periods, away from sunlight
                  and fresh air.<br>
                  <br>
                  Medical-grade ozone generators produce it from pure
                  oxygen by corona discharge. Since it also occurs
                  naturally it cannot be patented. So there's been no
                  financial incentive to repeat in the US the
                  large-scale studies conducted in other countries. It
                  is still not acknowledged by any mainstream news
                  sources that depend on advertising from orthodox
                  medical corporations. <br>
                  <br>
                  During previous administrations, the FDA categorized
                  treatment studies from other countries as "anecdotal",
                  stalling approval. Principal media generally ignored
                  ozone and other bio-oxidative therapies, including
                  self-treatment with dilute H2O2. Official information
                  on this subject is still scarce or contains serious
                  misrepresentations. As a result there are only about
                  four hundred doctors in the US, that we know of,
                  offering any form of ozone therapy. (There could be
                  others, choosing not to be listed as such.)<br>
                  <br>
                  For this treatment option to be widely deployed
                  against the present crisis, we would need to scale up
                  production of ozone generators considerably. As far as
                  we know, the company with the longest track record as
                  a source of medical-grade ozone generators and
                  technical guidance for using them is Ozonosan, started
                  by Dr. Hansler sixty years ago.
                  www.ozonosan.de/eng/en01.html<br>
                  <br>
                  This is not an arcane procedure. Medical personnel
                  should be able to learn to perform major
                  auto-hemotherapy without much difficulty. The core
                  concepts can be absorbed in a day or less.
                  Understanding how oxygen depletion makes people more
                  susceptible to both viral infections and cancer can
                  provide huge advantages in treatment and prevention. <br>
                  <br>
                  Consider, why do we breathe oxygen anyway? Why do our
                  cells contain peroxisomes? Why do our immune systems
                  rely on internally produced hydrogen peroxide? And why
                  have bio-oxidative therapies been so fiercely resisted
                  for so long by the owners of the entrenched medical
                  establishment? (Hint: it's not only about the money.)<br>
                  <br>
                  If it is true that regulations are being relaxed, that
                  until now have blocked adoption of treatments proven
                  effective elsewhere, ozone therapy should finally get
                  a fair hearing and show what it could do.<br>

                  In 1931 Otto Warburg won a Nobel Prize for his
                  explanation of the anaerobic cancer metabolism, so it
                  must have been considered an important discovery at
                  the time. Cancer cells derive energy from sugar by
                  fermentation instead of oxidation like normal cells.
                  Any cells deprived of sixty percent or more of their
                  oxygen supply will turn cancerous. If a healthy oxygen
                  tension is restored, the cells resume a normal

                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tapping into the water cycle and
                  generating electricity from rainy days could be one
                  way to grow our renewable energy use.<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, scientists have been
                  unable to get water droplets to produce a significant
                  amount of power - but we may finally have a
                  breakthrough.<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we're still a long way from
                  umbrellas that double up as generators, the latest
                  approach shows there might be a way to get power from
                  rain showers at a level of efficiency that makes these
                  systems practical.<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New research has found a method
                  that could generate enough power from a single droplet
                  of rain to light up 100 LED bulbs. That's a big jump
                  forward in efficiency, in the region of several
                  thousand times.<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our research shows that a drop of
                  100 microlitres of water released from a height of 15
                  centimetres [5.9 inches] can generate a voltage of
                  over 140V, and the power generated can light up 100
                  small LED lights," says biomedical engineer Wang
                  Zuankai from the City University of Hong Kong (CityU).<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That sounds like a surprising
                  amount of voltage, but the engineers used some
                  ingenious tricks to make it happen.<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scientists have been looking into
                  this type of power production for years, but the
                  physics of converting the energy of raindrops into
                  electricity are much harder to do than harvesting the
                  energy from a rising tide or a flowing stream.<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the improvements the team
                  built into their droplet-based electricity generator
                  (DEG) was the use of a polytetrafluoroethylene or PTFE
                  film, which is able to accumulate a surface charge as
                  it's continuously hit by water droplets, until it
                  gradually reaches saturation.<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The team found that as water
                  droplets hit the surface and spread out, the drops act
                  as a 'bridge' that connects two electrodes: an
                  aluminium electrode and an indium tin oxide (ITO)
                  electrode (with the PTFE on top).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  (Wanghuai et al., Nature, 2020)<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The droplet bridge in turn creates
                  a closed-loop surface so that all of the collected
                  energy can be released – droplets act as resistors,
                  and the surface coating acts as a capacitor.<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This approach could eventually be
                  applied anywhere that water hits a solid surface, the
                  researchers say – the hull of a boat, the inside of a
                  water bottle, or the top of an umbrella.<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The significance of this
                  technology is the much enhanced electric power per
                  falling rain droplet, which makes the device much more
                  efficient to convert energy from a falling droplet to
                  electricity," chemist Xiao Cheng Zeng, from the
                  University of Nebraska-Lincoln, told Sarah Wells at
                  Vice.<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's plenty of work still to do
                  to get this ready for practical use however, with the
                  researchers hoping to have a prototype ready in the
                  next five years.<br>

                  protect this young nation from an insidious influence
                  and penetration. The menace, gentlemen, is the Jews.
                  In whatever country Jews have settled in any great
                  numbers, they have lowered its moral tone; depreciated
                  its commercial integrity; have segregated themselves
                  and have not been assimilated; have sneered at and
                  tried to undermine the Christian religion upon which
                  that nation is founded by objecting to its
                  restrictions; have built up a state within a state;
                  and when opposed have tried to strangle that country
                  to death financially, as in the case of Spain and
                  Portugal.<br>
                  <br>
                  If you do not exclude them from these United States,
                  in this Constitution in less than 200 years they will
                  have swarmed in such great numbers that they will
                  dominate and devour the land, and change our form of
                  government, for which we Americans have shed our
                  blood, given our lives, our substance and jeopardized
                  our liberty.<br>
                  <br>
                  If you do not exclude them, in less than 200 years our
                  descendants will be working in the fields to furnish
                  them sustenance, while they will be in the counting
                  houses rubbing their hands. I warn you, Gentlemen, if
                  you do not exclude the Jews for all time, your
                  children will curse you in your graves." -- Benjamin

                  <b>... Results:</b> The rates of all infection
                  outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, with the
                  rate of ILI statistically significantly higher in the
                  cloth mask arm (relative risk (RR)=13.00, 95% CI 1.69
                  to 100.07) compared with the medical mask arm. Cloth
                  masks also had significantly higher rates of ILI
                  compared with the control arm. An analysis by mask use
                  showed ILI (RR=6.64, 95% CI 1.45 to 28.65) and
                  laboratory-confirmed virus (RR=1.72, 95% CI 1.01 to
                  2.94) were significantly higher in the cloth masks
                  group compared with the medical masks group.
                  Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97%
                  and medical masks 44%.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Conclusions:</b> This study is the first RCT of
                  cloth masks, and the results caution against the use
                  of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform
                  occupational health and safety. Moisture retention,
                  reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in
                  increased risk of infection. Further research is
                  needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks
                  globally. However, as a precautionary measure, cloth
                  masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly
                  in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be
                  updated. </font><br>

                  </b><b>...Conclusion</b><b><br>
                  </b>By making mask-wearing recommendations and
                  policies for the general public, or by expressly
                  condoning the practice, governments have both ignored
                  the scientific evidence and done the opposite of
                  following the precautionary principle.<br>
                  <br>
                  In an absence of knowledge, governments should not
                  make policies that have a hypothetical potential to
                  cause harm. The government has an onus barrier before
                  it instigates a broad social-engineering intervention,
                  or allows corporations to exploit fear-based
                  sentiments.<br>
                  <br>
                  Furthermore, individuals should know that there is no
                  known benefit arising from wearing a mask in a viral
                  respiratory illness epidemic, and that scientific
                  studies have shown that any benefit must be residually
                  small, compared to other and determinative factors.<br>
                  <br>
                  Otherwise, what is the point of publicly funded
                  science?<br>
                  <br>
                  The present paper about masks illustrates the degree
                  to which governments, the mainstream media, and
                  institutional propagandists can decide to operate in a
                  science vacuum, or select only incomplete science that
                  serves their interests. Such recklessness is also
                  certainly the case with the current global lockdown of
                  over 1 billion people, an unprecedented experiment in
                  medical and political history.<br>

                  Jewish Marxist regimes around the Globe have been

                  mankind, the death toll totals more than 94 million.

                  ...So now I am going to tell you exactly as how I
                  received it from the Father God.<br>
                  <br>
                  [The part that answers the “What’s next after
                  coronavirus?” question begins here—2:07:27.]<br>
                  <br>
                  “Another great wind is going to sweep all over the
                  world.”<br>
                  <br>
                  And when He spoke the word “wind,” it was made for me
                  to know this. Another great wind, worse than
                  coronavirus pandemic is going to sweep this whole
                  world. The world is shaken with fear and trembling
                  because of coronavirus, but the word of the Lord came
                  to say, another, worse than coronavirus, is going to
                  come. When that comes, it will make this coronavirus
                  look like child’s play.<br>
                  <br>
                  So when this great wind comes, it will sting people
                  like a hornet’s stinger. When a hornet stings a
                  person, a person feels hot, with fire-like sensation
                  and swelling like boils appears on their bodies. In
                  the same manner, when this wind stings a person, that
                  person will feel hot like fire over them, and their
                  temperature will rise above 100°F, above 38°C. So, the
                  feelings will be hot like fire burning all over their
                  body, and fever will shoot up in their bodies, more
                  than 100°F, and boils will develop all over their
                  faces and bodies, especially in the chest area. These
                  are the physical symptoms when this virus stings.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now doctors and scientists will be baffled and
                  perplexed at not being able to discover at all any
                  medicine or vaccine for this. This morning I read in
                  the news, a scientific report about this coronavirus,
                  that the scientists are still trying to understand the
                  DNA of this virus. And they say, a vaccine will still
                  a long time away. So there is no medicine; there is no
                  vaccine. And by that time they claim that they have
                  found something, this hornet will come to sting. But
                  this time, the doctors and the scientists will not be
                  able to discover any way how this virus works, and
                  they will not be able to discover any medicine or
                  vaccine.<br>
                  <br>
                  I now remember something I heard the late prophet of
                  God Neville Johnson say something. A few years ago the
                  Lord revealed to him, plagues will appear in the last
                  days, and their mutations will be so different that
                  doctors will not be able to understand how they work.
                  The DNA structure in the virus will mutate itself. And
                  the latest medical scientific report says similar
                  things about the coronavirus. And a worse thing will
                  come next.<br>
                  <br>
                  The worse… the plague that is going to come, its
                  strain will be similar to the present Covid-19
                  coronavirus. Perhaps you may have seen pictures of how
                  the virus looks like. This, the virus that’s going to
                  come, its strain will look a little similar to that,
                  but there will be something different. There will be
                  lot of stingers all around that virus strain...<br>
                  <br>
                  when this virus enters into a person’s body,
                  especially flowing in their blood stream, the stingers
                  that are all over the virus strain, it will begin to
                  sting on the blood vessels, and the poison is released
                  into the blood stream. That will cause great amount of
                  fatalities...<br>

                  Yep... That's right. With my friends Ienergysupply and
                  some tinkering into cavitation processes myself and a
                  challenge from a space agency that I believe they
                  figured that I wouldn't be able to figure out I
                  believe that I have a model of a cavitation device
                  that should emit radiation and combining this with the
                  I energy supply group Tesla turbine dual vacuum system
                  we essentially you would have made a garage based
                  nuclear power plant that the by-product is diamonds
                  I'm not even kidding LOL and then furthering on that
                  irradiation with the help of electromagnetism could be
                  turned into what is called nucells basically nuclear
                  batteries they normally don't have a very high voltage
                  and amperage but they last centuries at a time so
                  basically would be creating diamond radioactive
                  batteries as a byproduct of our pretty damn small
                  nuclear fusion plant built in garage.<br>

                  <font color="#000000"> <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
                    </b>Imagine a stock market in which buyers and
                    sellers couldn't find out the prices at which anyone
                    else sold a share of stock. If you wanted to buy (or
                    sell) a share of stock, you'd have to guess what it
                    was worth. The result, everyone would agree, would
                    be massively inefficient. Willing buyers and sellers
                    would often miss each other. Patents, however, exist
                    in just such a blind market. Want to know if you're
                    getting a good deal on a patent license, or
                    acquiring rights in a technology? Too bad. Even if
                    that patent or ones like it have been licensed
                    dozens of times before, the terms of those licenses,
                    including the price itself, will almost invariably
                    be confidential. Patent owners who want to put their
                    rights up for sale face the same problem.<br>
                    <br>
                    The result? Willing licensors and licensees can't
                    find each other. Patent auctions often fizzle,
                    because without a thick market - one with an array
                    of buyers and sellers bidding on price - no one can
                    know whether they are getting a steal or being had.
                    When parties do license patents, the prices are (to
                    the extent we can tell) all over the map. And the
                    rest of the world has no idea what those prices are.
                    This in turn means that courts lack adequate
                    benchmarks to determine a ¿reasonable royalty¿ when
                    companies infringe patents.<br>
                    <br>
                    The solution is straightforward: require publication
                    of patent assignment and license terms. Doing so
                    won't magically make the market for patents work
                    like a stock exchange; there will still be
                    significant uncertainty about whether a patent is
                    valid and what it covers. But it will permit the
                    aggregate record of what companies pay for rights to
                    signal what particular patents are worth and how
                    strong they are, just as derivative financial
                    instruments allow markets to evaluate and price
                    other forms of risk. It will help rationalize patent
                    transactions, turning them from secret, one-off
                    negotiations into a real, working market for
                    patents. And by making it clear to courts and the
                    world at large what the normal price is for patent
                    rights, it will make it that much harder for a few
                    unscrupulous patent owners to hold up legitimate
                    innovators, and for established companies to
                    systematically infringe the rights of others. </font><font
