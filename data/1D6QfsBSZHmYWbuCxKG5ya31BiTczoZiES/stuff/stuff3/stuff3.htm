      <b>Cultivation</b><br>
      <br>
      In cultivation, S. undulata is an easily grown, but moisture
      hungry herb. It is tolerant of extreme heat (&gt;40 °C) and
      moderate cold (-5 °C). A moisture retentive seedbed is essential.
      The fragrant flowers open at night and close in the day. It is a
      biennial to short lived perennial and the root can be harvested
      after the second year.<br>
      Uses[edit]<br>
      <br>
      S. undulata is regarded by the Xhosa people as a sacred plant. Its
      root is traditionally used to induce vivid (and according to the
      Xhosa, prophetic) lucid dreams during the initiation process of
      shamans, classifying it a naturally occurring oneirogen similar to
      the more well-known dream herb Calea zacatechichi.[1]<br>

      Engineers have demonstrated the world's first three-dimensional

      The phenomenon works in all three dimensions, no matter which

      located, and holds potential for future applications such as sonar

      Using little more than a few perforated sheets of plastic and a
      staggering amount of number crunching, Duke engineers have
      demonstrated the world's first three-dimensional acoustic cloak.
      The new device reroutes sound waves to create the impression that
      both the cloak and anything beneath it are not there.<br>
      <br>
      The acoustic cloaking device works in all three dimensions, no
      matter which direction the sound is coming from or where the
      observer is located, and holds potential for future applications
      such as sonar avoidance and architectural acoustics.<br>
      <br>
      The study appears online in Nature Materials.<br>
      <br>
      "The particular trick we're performing is hiding an object from
      sound waves," said Steven Cummer, professor of electrical and
      computer engineering at Duke University. "By placing this cloak
      around an object, the sound waves behave like there is nothing
      more than a flat surface in their path."<br>
      <br>
      To achieve this new trick, Cummer and his colleagues turned to the
      developing field of metamaterials -- the combination of natural
      materials in repeating patterns to achieve unnatural properties.
      In the case of the new acoustic cloak, the materials manipulating
      the behavior of sound waves are simply plastic and air. Once
      constructed, the device looks like several plastic plates with a
      repeating pattern of holes poked through them stacked on top of
      one another to form a sort of pyramid.<br>
      <br>
      To give the illusion that it isn't there, the cloak must alter the
      waves' trajectory to match what they would look like had they had
      reflected off a flat surface. Because the sound is not reaching
      the surface beneath, it is traveling a shorter distance and its
      speed must be slowed to compensate.<br>
      <br>
      "The structure that we built might look really simple," said
      Cummer. "But I promise you that it's a lot more difficult and
      interesting than it looks. We put a lot of energy into calculating
      how sound waves would interact with it. We didn't come up with
      this overnight."<br>
      <br>
      To test the cloaking device, researchers covered a small sphere
      with the cloak and "pinged" it with short bursts of sound from
      various angles. Using a microphone, they mapped how the waves
      responded and produced videos of them traveling through the air.<br>
      <br>
      Cummer and his team then compared the videos to those created with
      both an unobstructed flat surface and an uncloaked sphere blocking
      the way. The results clearly show that the cloaking device makes
      it appear as though the sound waves reflected off an empty
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      Although the experiment is a simple demonstration showing that the
      technology is possible and concealing an evil super-genius'
      underwater lair is a long ways away, Cummer believes that the
      technique has several potential commercial applications.<br>
      <br>
      "We conducted our tests in the air, but sound waves behave
      similarly underwater, so one obvious potential use is sonar
      avoidance," said Cummer. "But there's also the design of
      auditoriums or concert halls -- any space where you need to
      control the acoustics. If you had to put a beam somewhere for
      structural reasons that was going to mess up the sound, perhaps
      you could fix the acoustics by cloaking it."<br>

      Russian inventor patents invisibility technique<br>
      <br>
      A professor from the department of quantum and optical electronics
      of the Ulyanovsk State University in western Russia has patented a
      method of making things invisible, Interfax news agency reported.
      The so-called invisibility cloak, created by Oleg Gadomsky, is
      called “The method of conversion of optical radiation” in the
      patent. Gadomsky had been long experimenting on nanoparticles of
      gold. He now claims to have invented a sub-micron stratum of
      microscopical colloid golden particles that makes an object placed
      behind it invisible to an observer. “Only static objects can be
      made invisible for the time being, as during motion the radiation
      frequency changes. But soon it will be possible to create a cap of
      darkness and a magic cloak like Harry Potter’s,” the scientist
      believes.<br>

      The technology for atomic level invisibility might be closer than
      you'd think<br>
      <br>
      MosNews and NewsRU are reporting that Russian professor Oleg
      Gadomsky has patented a new method of optical camouflage.&nbsp;
      The professor, versed in both quantum and optical electronics,
      uses gold nanoparticles arranged in a stratum that cloaks the
      image of an object to the other side of the stratum.&nbsp; The
      patent, unfortunately, does not show a scale demonstration of this
      technology or even if the technology works yet. <br>
      <br>
      Gadomsky's technology is completely different than existing
      methods of optical camouflage that exist today.&nbsp; In 2003, the
      TACHI laboratory of the University of Tokyo demonstrated an
      "invisibility cloak" -- which was actually no more than a
      projection of the image behind the cloak projected back onto the
      cloak.&nbsp; Gadomsky plans to actually disrupt the radiation in
      such a manner to "bend" light around the stealthed object behind
      the nanoparticle wall. <br>

      <b>Abstract </b><br>
      <br>
      An antireflective coating applied onto a substrate in the form of
      at least one layer of nanoparticles arranged on the aforementioned
      substrate at equal distances from each other in accordance with a
      specific nanostructure. The nanoparticles are made from a material
      that under effect of incident light generates between the
      neighboring particles optical resonance interaction with a
      frequency that belongs to a visible optical range. The interaction
      between the nanoparticles reduces reflection of the incident
      light. The nanoparticles have a radius in the range of 10 to 100
      nm and a pitch between the adjacent particles that ranges between
      1.5 diameters to several diameters.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] An antireflective coating may be defined as a coating that
      has a very low coefficient of reflection. The antireflection
      coating reduces unwanted reflections from surfaces and is commonly
      used on spectacles and photographic lenses.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Whenever a ray of light moves from one medium to another
      (e.g., when light enters a sheet of glass after traveling through
      air), some portion of the light is reflected from the surface
      (known as the interface) between the two media. The strength of
      the reflection depends on the refractive indices of the two media
      as well as the incidence angle. The exact value can be calculated
      using the Fresnel equations.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] When the light meets the interface at normal incidence
      (i.e. perpendicularly to the surface), the intensity of the
      separated light is characterized by the reflection coefficient or
      reflectance, R:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where n0 and nS are the refractive indices of the first and
      second media, respectively. The value of R varies from 0.0 (no
      reflection) to 1.0 (all light reflected) and is usually quoted as
      a percentage. Complementary to R is the transmission coefficient
      or transmittance, T. If the effects of absorption and scatter are
      neglected, then the value T is always 1-R. Thus if a beam of light
      with intensity I is incident on the surface, a beam of intensity
      RI is reflected, and a beam with intensity TI is transmitted into
      the medium.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] For a typical situation with visible light traveling from
      air (n0 1.0) into common glass (nS 1.5), the value of R is 0.04,
      or 4%. Thus only 96% of the light (T=1-R=0.96) actually enters the
      glass, and the rest is reflected from the surface. The amount of
      light reflected is known as the reflection loss. Light also may
      bounce from one surface to another multiple times, being partially
      reflected and partially transmitted each time it does so. In all,
      the combined reflection coefficient is given by 2R/(1+R). For
      glass in air, this is about 7.7%.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In the case of a single-layer coating of the glass, the
      light ray reflects twice, once from the surface between air and
      the layer, and once from the layer-to-glass interface.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] From the equation above with refractive indices being
      known, reflectivities for both interfaces can be calculated, and
      denoted R01 and R1S, respectively. The transmission at each
      interface is therefore T01=1-R01 and T1S=1-R1S. The total
      transmittance into the glass is thus T1ST01. Calculating this
      value for various values of n1, it can be found that at one
      particular value of optimum refractive index of the layer, the
      transmittance of both interfaces is equal, and this corresponds to
      the maximum total transmittance into the glass.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] This optimum value is given by the geometric mean of the
      two surrounding indices, i.e.:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      n1=[square root of]{square root over (n0nS)}.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] For the example of glass (nS 1.5) in air (n0 1.0), this
      optimum refractive index is n1 1.225. The reflection loss of each
      interface is approximately 1.0% (with a combined loss of 2.0%),
      and an overall transmission T1ST01 is approximately 98%. Therefore
      an intermediate coating between the air and glass can reduce the
      reflection loss by half of its normal (uncoated) value.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Practical antireflection coatings, however, rely on an
      intermediate layer not only for its direct reduction of reflection
      coefficient, but also on use of the interference effect of a thin
      layer. Assume that the layer thickness is controlled precisely
      such that it is exactly one-quarter of the wavelength of the light
      deep ([lambda]/4), forming a quarter-wave coating. If this is the
      case, the incident beam I, when reflected from the second
      interface, will travel exactly half its own wavelength further
      than the beam reflected from the first surface. If the intensities
      of the two beams, R1 and R2, are exactly equal, then since they
      are exactly out of phase, they will destructively interfere and
      cancel each other. Therefore, there is n0 reflection from the
      surface, and all the energy of the beam must be in the transmitted
      ray, T.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Real coatings do not reach perfect performance, though they
      are capable of reducing a surface's reflection coefficient to less
      than 0.1%. Practical details include correct calculation of the
      layer thickness; since the wavelength of the light is reduced
      inside a medium, this thickness will be [lambda]0/4n1, where
      [lambda]0 is the vacuum wavelength. Also, the layer will be the
      ideal thickness for only one distinct wavelength of light. Other
      difficulties include finding suitable materials, since few useful
      substances have the required refractive index (n 1.23) that will
      make both reflected rays exactly equal in intensity. Magnesium
      fluoride (MgF2) is often used, since this is hard-wearing and can
      be easily applied to substrates using physical vapor deposition,
      even though its index is higher than desirable (n=1.38).<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Further reduction is possible by using multiple coating
      layers, designed such that reflections from the surfaces undergo
      maximum destructive interference. One way to do this is to add a
      second quarter-wave-thick higher-index layer between the low-index
      layer and the substrate. The reflection from all three interfaces
      produces destructive interference and antireflection. Other
      techniques use varying thicknesses of the coatings. By using two
      or more layers, each of a material chosen to give the best
      possible match of the desired refractive index and dispersion,
      broadband antireflection coatings that cover the visible range
      (400-700 nm) with maximum reflectivities of less than 0.5% are
      commonly achievable.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The exact nature of the coating determines the appearance
      of the coated optics; common anti-reflective coatings on
      eyeglasses and photographic lenses often look somewhat bluish
      (since they reflect slightly more blue light than other visible
      wavelengths), though green-and-pink-tinged coatings are also used.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] If the coated optic is used at non-normal incidence (i.e.
      with light rays not perpendicular to the surface), the
      antireflection capabilities are degraded somewhat. This occurs
      because a beam travelling through the layer at an angle "sees" a
      greater apparent thickness of the layer. There is a
      counter-intuitive effect at work here. Although the optical path
      taken by light is indeed longer, interference coatings work on the
      principle of "difference in optical path length" or "phase
      thickness". This is because light tends to be coherent over the
      very small (tens to hundreds of nm) thickness of the coating. The
      net effect of this is that the anti-reflection band of the coating
      tends to move to shorter wavelengths as the optic is tilted.
      Coatings can also be designed to work at a particular angle; beam
      splitter coatings are usually optimized for 45[deg.] angles.
      Non-normal incidence angles also usually cause the reflection to
      be polarization dependent.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Known in the art are methods of imparting antireflective
      properties to optical devices by coating them with single-layered
      or multilayered interferential coatings.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Application of N sequential layers provides 2N parameters
      (i.e., N refractive indices and N thicknesses). Such a coating
      makes it possible to efficiently suppress reflection in a
      predetermined angular range by selecting predetermined
      combinations of reflective indices and thicknesses. Thus, at high
      angles of incidence for N wavelengths the coefficient of
      reflection from the coating can be reduced to [a value close to]
      zero. By arranging the minimums of reflection over the spectrum,
      it becomes possible to obtain a coating with a predetermined
      integral reflective capacity. In order to obtain an antireflective
      coating with efficient achromatization, it is necessary to have a
      wide assortment of substances that differ in dispersions and
      indices of refraction. Therefore, an essential problem associated
      with improvement of interferential coatings is broadening of the
      assortment of transparent substances suitable for application onto
      substrates in the form of homogeneous films [M. Born, E. Wolf.
      Principles of Optics, Pergamon Press, 1968, Chapter 1; and Ph.
      Baumester, et al. Optical Interference Coatings, Scientific
      American 223 (6), 58 (1970)].<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Thus, known methods of forming antireflective coatings
      possess the following disadvantages.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] 1) They cannot provide the minimal reflective capacity in a
      wide range of wavelengths of visible light spectrum, i.e., from
      400 nm to 800 nm, and in a wide range of angles of incidence 0 to
      90[deg.].<br>
      <br>
      [0019] 2) The known processes are limited in the choice of
      substances for application of alternating layers. These substances
      must be transparent in the visible part of the optical spectrum;
      films made from these substances must be homogeneous and possess
      appropriate mechanical properties and high adhesive capacity.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] 3) Widening of an antireflection spectrum requires an
      increase in the number of layers, and this leads to accelerated
      aging of interferential coatings.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] 4) The known interferential antireflective coatings do not
      provide minimal reflection in a wide range of wavelengths and
      incidence angles when such coatings are applied onto surfaces of
      opaque media.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] 5) A common disadvantage of conventional interferential
      coating is that their structure, properties, and design must
      always be considered with reference to the nature, properties, and
      characteristics of the substrate onto which the coating is
      applied.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Recent development of nanotechnology opened a new avenue
      for improving properties of the coatings based on the use of new
      physical phenomena inherent only to nanostructures.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Nanometer-scaled layers and structures are becoming more
      and more important in optics and photonics. Very thin layers are
      routinely used as anti-reflective coatings for displays, lenses
      and other optical elements. High-grade anti-reflective coatings
      can be created using nanoporous polymer films. Ultrathin layers
      are being increasingly utilized in solar cells and are a key
      element in the realization of large and brilliant displays based
      on organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) merged with nanoparticle
      coatings. Tiny nanoclusters make possible not only silicon-based
      light emission which can be used in optocouplers but also novel
      sensor devices and integrated optical systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Patterning of nanoparticles for controlling optical
      properties of coatings is known. For example, US Patent
      Application Publication No. 20050118411 (inventor C. Horne)
      published in 2005 describes nanoscale particles, particle
      coatings/particle arrays and corresponding consolidated materials
      based on an ability to vary the composition involving a wide range
      of metal and/or metalloid elements and corresponding compositions.
      In particular, metalloid oxides and metal-metalloid compositions
      are described in the form of improved nanoscale particles and
      coatings formed from the nanoscale particles. Compositions
      comprising rare earth metals and dopants/additives with rare earth
      metals are described. Complex compositions with a range of host
      compositions and dopants/additives can be formed using the
      approaches described herein. The particle coating can take the
      form of particle arrays that range from collections of disbursable
      primary particles to fused networks of primary particles forming
      channels that reflect the nanoscale of the primary particles.
      Suitable materials for optical applications are described along
      with some optical devices of interest.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] This new technique is based on the fact that when
      nanoparticles of certain metals or dielectrics are introduced into
      coating layers, the nanoparticles change or improve properties. In
      the field of optical coatings, the technique based on the use of
      nanoparticles is used as a new approach for obtaining
      antireflective coatings that impart new properties to optical
      elements, e.g., optical filters. The introduction of the
      aforementioned new technique makes it possible to improve quality
      and reduce the number of coating layers.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Other methods of arranging nanoparticles into
      nanostructures are described, e.g., in European Patent Application
      Publication EP 1510861A1 published Feb. 03, 2003 (Inventors: O.
      Harnack, Et al.); US Patent Application Publication 2006/0228491A1
      published 10o.12.2006, (inventors M. Choi, et al.), etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] However, the inventor herein is not aware of any published
      material teaching that interaction between patterned and closely
      arranged nanoparticles may be used for reducing reflection in an
      optical coating.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0029] It is an object of the invention to provide antireflective
      optical coatings with minimal possible reflective capacity in the
      entire range of visible wavelengths of 400 nm to 800 nm. It is
      another object to provide an antireflective coating that
      effectively works irrespective of the direction of light that is
      incident in an arbitrary direction in the limits of a hemisphere,
      i.e., in the range +-90[deg.] from the perpendicular to the
      surface of the aforementioned reflective coating. It is a further
      object to provide an antireflective coating capable of providing a
      coefficient of reflection close to zero based on the use of
      nanoparticles of metals or dielectrics arranged in a specific
      pattern in the material of a coating.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The invention relates to an optical coating with
      light-reflective capacity reduced practically to zero due to
      interaction of specially patterned nanoparticles. The invention is
      based on the effect found by the inventor and consists of
      suppressing reflective capacity of an optical system due to
      interaction between nanoparticles arranged at very short distances
      from each other in the form of specific patterns. Such a system
      has several parameters that can be used for changing reflective
      capacity of the system from 0 to 1, thus converting the system
      from an ideal mirror to an absolutely transparent body in a wide
      range of the optical spectrum. The effect results from conversion
      of frequency of optical radiation due to interaction between
      neighboring nanoparticles. The invention can be used for applying
      antireflective coatings onto optical lenses, filters, etc. The
      coatings are composed of substantially identical nanoparticles of
      a predetermined material with a radius in the range of 10 to 100
      nm, which are arranged with a predetermined structure on the
      surface of a body. Such coatings can reduce reflective capacity of
      a transparent optical medium, e.g., of quartz glass, practically
      to zero in the wavelength range of 400 nm to 800 nm.
      Antireflective coatings of the invention in the form of a
      monolayer of nanoparticles are noticeably superior to conventional
      multilayered interferential wide-band reflective coatings. The
      coatings may also be used for application onto non-transparent
      bodies of different shapes and configuration for reducing
      reflection from the surfaces of such bodies...<br>
      <br>
      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The nanoparticles form a predetermined structure that
      maintains the aforementioned anti-reflective effect provided by
      the nanoparticle interaction. Types of such nanostructures are
      determined by specific requirements of coating. Examples of the
      nanostructures are described below.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The nanostructured system may be located on the surface of
      a body 32 which is an object of reflective capacity decrease, or
      may be located inside of the body 32.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] In order to reduce optical reflection from transparent or
      non-transparent bodies, it is required that absorption in the
      nanostructure be minimal. Reflection from the surface of the
      coating 30 also should be minimal, while the transmission of light
      through this surface should be maximal. As has been mentioned
      above, the effect of decrease in reflective capacity is achieved
      due to interaction between the nanoparticles and depends on the
      structure of the nanoparticle system.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The nature of interaction between identical (or different)
      nanoparticles is described below.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] When the body 32 coated with the coating 30 is irradiated
      with an external light L, the impurity atoms or valence electrons
      contained in the system are subject to quantum transitions that
      generate in isolated nanoparticles optical resonance with certain
      frequency [omega]0 that belongs to a visible optical range. When
      distances R between the centers of nanoparticles are comparable in
      size with radii a of the nanoparticles, this leads to the
      formation of optical near-field resonances in the field of natural
      light. Frequencies w of these resonances to a great extent depend
      on distances R and on the radii a of the nanoparticles.
      Mathematical substantiation of the effect of the near-field
      resonance is disclosed by O. N. Gadomsky in "JETP, vol. 97, No. 3,
      pp. 466-478 (2003); by O. N. Gadomsky, in Journal
      "Physics-Uspekhi", 43(1), 1071-1102 (2000); and O. N. Gadomsky, et
      al. "Optics and Spectroscopy", Vol. 98, No. 2, (2005). Frequencies
      of secondary radiation depend on the concentration of impurity
      atoms for dielectric nanoparticles and on the concentration of
      valence electrons for metallic nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Dissipation of light from a pair of silver nanoparticles on
      a glass substrate was experimentally realized as described by N.
      Tamaru, et al. in Applied Physics Letters, 80, No. 10, 1826 (2002)
      (Resonant light scattering from individual Ag nanoparticles and
      particle pairs). This situation can also be easily explained on
      the basis of optical neaqr-field resonances.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The physical meaning of the reflection minimization effect
      in a nanostructured system with reference to interaction between
      nanoparticles can be conveniently demonstrated with an example of
      a semi-infinite nanocrystal composed of pairs of nanoparticles.
      Such a situation was considered in the work of O. N. Gadomsky, et
      al., with an example of interaction between glass nanospheres with
      sodium atoms as the impurity. (See O. N. Gadomsky, et al.,
      Metastructural systems of activated nanospheres and optical
      near-polar resonances [Optics and Spectroscopy, 98, 300 (2005)]).
      Subsequent numerical calculations showed that the aforementioned
      optical effect of antireflection can also be obtained in a pair of
      gold nanoparticles...<br>
      <br>
      [0060] The coating of the present invention is based on the
      above-described effect of antireflective action. This effect can
      be realized on superthin nanocrystals composed of one or several
      monolayers. The aforementioned nanocrystals are in principle
      different from photonic and globular crystals in which dimensions
      of the globules are comparable with the wavelength of the external
      optical radiation. In nanocrystals, dimensions of nanoparticles
      are considerably smaller than the wavelength of light. However,
      these particles are not points. As seen in FIGS. 2a, 2b,
      dependence from radii of particles is significant. A review of
      photonic and globular crystals is presented by I. S. Fogel et al.
      in "Pure Appl. Opt.", 7, 393, 1998.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The effect revealed by the inventor in a system of
      interacting nanoparticles indicates that for a given material of
      nanoparticles the reflective and light-transmissive capacity of
      the optical system are effected mostly by the following three main
      parameters: a radius of nanoparticles, a distance between the
      neighboring nanoparticles, and a structural factor.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The physical antireflective effect described above may be
      used in practice, e.g., for applying antireflective coatings of
      the invention onto surfaces of optical lenses, filters, or other
      optical elements made from transparent materials, e.g., glass. It
      should be noted in this connection that when a light beam passes
      through interfaces, e.g., between glass and air, then, depending
      on the type of glass, reflection of light from the interface
      reduces the power of the light beam at least by 4 to 9%. If the
      light falls onto the surface at an angle, the loss of light power
      is even higher. Since, as a rule, modern optical devices and
      instruments contain a significant number of interfaces between
      light-refractive elements, reflection of light from multiple
      interfaces may in some cases lead to losses of light power as high
      as 80% or more. Such significant losses not only affect light
      power but, even worse, also generate a diffuse background that
      produces a significant masking action after several reflections of
      light that passes through the system. Use of the antireflective
      coating of the invention makes it possible to alleviate the above
      problem by reducing reflective capacity of a multiple-interface
      optical system...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Application Example of the Antireflective Nanostructured
        Coating</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0077] It is understood that practical realization of the
      above-described monolayered nanostructure composed of identical
      nanoparticles arranged in a regular lattice is not a trivial task.
      One of the methods that can be employed for the preparation of
      such structure is advanced electron-beam lithography (E-Beam
      lithography) with an electron beam diameter of about several
      nanometers (see . . . ). In general, the procedure performed by
      means of E-Beam lithography consists of sequential exposure to an
      electron beam in selected areas of a positive electron-beam resist
      on a substrate. The exposed areas have a pattern corresponding to
      the pattern of the required nanostructure, and dimensions of the
      exposed areas correspond to transverse dimensions of the
      nanoparticles. The exposed areas of the resist are
      lithographically developed, whereby a relief structure is obtained
      in which recesses of the profiled resist layer correspond to the
      locations designated for the particles. The next stage of the
      process is coating of the developed surface with the material of
      the nanoparticles, e.g., gold. The coating is carried out by
      sputtering. The sputtered material coats the bottoms of the
      recesses as well as the raised, i.e., non-developed, areas. The
      following process is secondary development that removes the raised
      portions while leaving the material of the coated recesses intact.
      The product obtained after this stage is a substrate that supports
      a plurality of nanoparticles arranged into a specific
      nanostructure. The procedure described above is well known in
      semiconductor technology as a lift-off process...<br>
      <br>
      [0089] Nanoparticles formed by the above-described particles may
      have transverse diameters of 10 nm to 100 nm, and pitches P and P'
      may have dimensions ranging from 1.5 diameters to several
      diameters...<br>

      </b><b>US7060121</b><br>
      Abstract ---&nbsp; A method for producing gold nanoparticles is
      disclosed. When gold salt solution is mixed with an absorbent,
      gold in the form of complexes is adsorbed onto the surface of the
      absorbent. The gold-loaded absorbent, after being separated from
      the solution by screening, filtration, settling or other methods,

      impurities such as oxides of sodium, potassium and calcium. The

          for Osteoarthritis</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>by Maria Seyrig </b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Electromagnetic pulses significantly decrease pain and
      inflammation associated with osteoarthritis of the knee, according
      to Henry Ford Hospital researchers.<br>
      <br>
      In the double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study, 34
      patients used a portable battery-operated device that emits a
      low-intensity pulsating electromagnetic frequency and experienced
      more than 40 percent pain relief on their first day.<br>
      <br>
      "Our results show pulsed electromagnetic fields caused a
      significant decrease in pain" says Fred Nelson, M.D., associate
      program director for research and director of the Osteoarthritis
      Center, Department of Orthopaedics, Henry Ford Hospital.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Nelson will present the results this week at the Orthopaedic
      Research Society's annual meeting in New Orleans.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Nelson explains that in the laboratory, electromagnetic
      signals have been shown to decrease calcium in cartilage cells.
      This sets off a series of chemical events that can lead to reduced
      inflammation. Previously, the electromagnetic fields have been
      used to control pain related to cosmetic surgery.<br>
      <br>
      "We are really fine-tuning what we are doing to the cell
      environment with a very specific pulse sequence and frequency,"
      says Dr. Nelson.<br>
      <br>
      Patients strapped the small, ring-shaped plastic device around
      their knees for 15 minutes, twice daily for six weeks. The device
      was lightweight and patients could position the device directly
      over clothing. All participants were given a device with a coil
      that appeared to work but some were assigned active coils and
      others were given non-active coils. The electromagnetic device was
      developed by Ivivi Health Sciences of Montvale, New Jersey.<br>
      <br>
      Osteoarthritis of the knee is a leading cause of disability and
      loss of independence. It is a slow, progressively degenerative
      disease in which the joint cartilage gradually wears away due to
      trauma, aging or infection. As the cartilage thins, the
      surrounding bone thickens and often bones rub against one another,
      causing additional wear. Normal activity becomes painful and
      difficult.<br>
      <br>
      Current treatments include drug therapies like anti-inflammatory
      medication or pain relievers; physical therapy; support devices;
      health and behavioral modifications such as weight loss; surgery
      and joint replacement.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Nelson explains that medications often have variable success
      and can produce considerable side effects such as changes in
      kidney and liver function, a reduction in the ability of blood to
      clot as well as abdominal pain, nausea and indigestion.<br>
      <br>
      "The exciting thing about this new approach is that it has been
      found to have no side effects, it is relatively low-cost in the
      long-run and the onset of pain relief is immediate," says Dr.
      Nelson. "We look at electromagnetic pulses as a potential way to
      improve quality of life and independence for those who suffer from
      osteoarthritis of the knee." Dr. Nelson says researchers will
      continue to look at the consistency of the relief, how long the
      pain relief lasts and if electromagnetic pulses might affect other
      joints.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Ivivi PEMF Technology Accelerates Wound
          Healing in Laboratory Animals, Study Reports</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Ivivi Technologies, Inc.’s (AMEX: II) non-invasive, pulsed
      electromagnetic field (PEMF) technology increased tensile strength
      in a standard wound model in rats by 59% after 21 days,
      researchers reported in the August 2007 journal of Plastic and
      Reconstructive Surgery. The study was conducted at the Montefiore
      Medical Center, in The Teaching Hospital of the Albert Einstein
      College of Medicine in New York. PEMF signals have accelerated the
      physiological processes involved in healing in multiple clinical
      studies.<br>
      <br>
      “PEMF signals accelerate biomechanical wound healing. These wounds
      healed faster and were stronger, earlier, than those that weren’t
      treated,” said Dr. Berish Strauch, of the Department of Plastic
      and Reconstructive Surgery at Albert Einstein, in whose lab the
      study was done. “This study represents the first objective data on
      the effect of PEMF on healing rates of cutaneous wounds at the
      cellular level. Although the mechanisms of action are not fully
      known, previous studies have shown that PEMF enhances the
      production of wound healing factors that reduce the time of the
      inflammatory phase as well as accelerates the production of the
      animal’s own growth factors including Vascular Endothelial Growth
      Factor (VEGF), which modulates new blood vessel growth. This study
      shows that a specifically configured PEMF signal yields the best
      result.”<br>
      <br>
      “As we get a clearer picture of the transduction properties of the
      physiological pathways involved in tissue repair, we can configure
      new PEMF signals,” said Dr. Arthur Pilla, Professor of Biomedical
      Engineering at Columbia University, Ivivi Science Director, and a
      co-author of the study. “We are increasingly able to fine-tune the
      configuration of PEMF signals to achieve a more optimal ‘dose’ for
      different indications, as evidenced in this study.” Dr. Pilla
      invented the bone-growth stimulator, an early medical application
      of PEMF technology.<br>
      <br>
      “If a patient can be discharged earlier after surgery, not only
      can that patient return to an active lifestyle more rapidly, but
      healthcare costs can be reduced,” commented Andre’ DiMino, Vice
      Chairman and Co-CEO of Ivivi Technologies, Inc. “Thus, if we can
      increase the strength of a wound at an earlier stage in the
      postoperative period, we can offer an absolute improvement on
      patient outcomes with a simple non-invasive technology with no
      known side effects.”<br>

      The study involved 100 rats, each with a linear skin incision on
      their dorsum that was subsequently sutured and treated with
      non-invasive PEMF signals. The study was prospective,
      placebo-controlled and double blinded and designed to test
      different PEMF signal configurations for 21 days. Four different
      signals were used targeting the calcium/calmodulin pathway which
      is at the start of the anti-inflammatory and growth factor stages
      of tissue repair. PEMF has been shown to accelerate the binding of
      calcium to calmodulin. At the end of the 21 day period, one
      specific signal had the most significant effect on wound repair,
      demonstrating a 59% increase in wound tensile strength compared to
      control, leading researchers to conclude that exposing wounds to
      PEMF of very specific configurations accelerated wound repair in
      the early, most critical phases of healing in this animal model.<br>

      <br>
      This unique invention relates to the field of electrotherapy,
      bioelectricity, bioelectromagnetics, sports performance
      enhancement, medical electricity and electromedicine.
      Particularly, the invention involves the novel implementation of
      electrotherapy for those suffering from osteopenia or
      osteoporosis. This amazing product comprises the specific,
      patented signal for resonating with the bone calcium channels to
      open them for transport across the cell membrane, thus simulating
      the performance of weight-bearing exercise. Its patents have
      expired but the three medical doctors never created the present
      product though all three Drs. Robert Becker, Andrew Bassett, and
      Arthur Pilla knew it will prevent and reverse osteoporosis from
      clinical trials and numerous journal articles. However, they claim
      that no "funding" ever arrived for creating the consumer
      electrotherapy unit which we now call the "OsteoPad". It is easy
      to use, with a flat pancake magnetic coil in a pad connected to
      the simple control panel which can be set on the nightstand for
      all-night treatments. This product will no doubt be a great seller
      since "1 out of every 2 people" in the US suffers or will suffer
      from bone loss as they age, which is called osteoporosis since the
      bones become porous without weight-bearing exercise to stimulate
      the piezoelectric bone to open calcium channels naturally. The
      OsteoPad signal does the work for the elderly person and lets
      their bones absorb calcium and magesium directly. - Available in

      Abstract -- The growing body of clinical and experimental data
      regarding electromagnetic field (EMF) bioeffects and their
      therapeutic applications has contributed to a better understanding
      of the underlying mechanisms of action. This study reports that
      two EMF modalities currently in clinical use, a pulse-modulated
      radiofrequency (PRF) signal, and a static magnetic field (SMF),
      applied independently, increased the rate of deoxygenation of
      human hemoglobin (Hb) in a cell-free assay. Deoxygenation of Hb
      was initiated using the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) in an
      assay that allowed the time for deoxygenation to be controlled
      (from several min to several hours) by adjusting the relative
      concentrations of DTT and Hb. The time course of Hb deoxygenation
      was observed using visible light spectroscopy. Exposure for 10–30
      min to either PRF or SMF increased the rate of deoxygenation
      occurring several min to several hours after the end of EMF
      exposure. The sensitivity and biochemical simplicity of the assay
      developed here suggest a new research tool that may help to
      further the understanding of basic biophysical EMF transduction
      mechanisms. If the results of this study were to be shown to occur
      at the cellular and tissue level, EMF-enhanced oxygen availability
      would be one of the mechanisms by which clinically relevant
      EMF-mediated enhancement of growth and repair processes could
      occur...<br>
      <br>
      ...Although much further work is required to ascertain the
      clinical relevance of the results reported here, enhanced oxygen
      delivery using PRF or SMF may be important non-invasive,
      non-pharmacologic therapeutic modalities by which clinically
      relevant EMF-mediated enhancement of growth and repair processes
      can occur.<br>

      Abstract -- This study shows that a non-thermal pulse-modulated RF
      signal (PRF), configured to modulate calmodulin (CaM) activation
      via acceleration of Ca(2+) binding kinetics, produced an immediate
      nearly 3-fold increase in nitric oxide (NO) from dopaminergic MN9D
      cultures (P &lt; 0.001). NO was measured electrochemically in
      real-time using a NO selective membrane electrode, which showed
      the PRF effect occurred within the first seconds after
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Further support that the site
      of action of PRF involves CaM is provided in human fibroblast
      cultures challenged with low serum and exposed for 15 min to the
      identical PRF signal. In this case a CaM antagonist W-7 could be
      added to the culture 3 h prior to PRF exposure. Those results
      showed the PRF signal produced nearly a two-fold increase in NO,
      which could be blocked by W-7 (P &lt; 0.001). To the authors'
      knowledge this is the first report of a real-time effect of
      non-thermal electromagnetic fields (EMF) on NO release from
      challenged cells. The results provide mechanistic support for the
      many reported bioeffects of EMF in which NO plays a role. Thus, in
      a typical clinical application for acute post operative pain, or
      chronic pain from, e.g., osteoarthritis, EMF therapy could be
      employed to modulate the dynamics of NO via Ca/CaM-dependent
      constitutive nitric oxide synthase (cNOS) in the target tissue.
      This, in turn, would modulate the dynamics of the signaling
      pathways the body uses in response to the various phases of
      healing after physical or chemical insult or injury.<br>

      Abstract -- A potential treatment modality for joint pain due to
      cartilage degradation is electromagnetic fields (EMF) that can be
      delivered, noninvasively, to chondrocytes buried within cartilage.
      A pulsed EMF in clinical use for recalcitrant bone fracture
      healing has been modified to be delivered as a pulsed electric
      field (PEF) through capacitive coupling. It was the objective of
      this study to determine whether the PEF signal could have a direct
      effect on chondrocytes in vitro. This study shows that a 30-min
      PEF treatment can increase DNA content of chondrocyte monolayer by
      approximately 150% at 72 h poststimulus. Studies intended to
      explore the biological mechanism showed this PEF signal increased
      nitric oxide measured in culture medium and cGMP measured in cell
      extract within the 30-min exposure period. Increasing calcium in
      the culture media or adding the calcium ionophore A23187, without
      PEF treatment, also significantly increased short-term nitric
      oxide production. The inhibitor W7, which blocks
      calcium/calmodulin, prevented the PEF-stimulated increase in both
      nitric oxide and cGMP. The inhibitor L-NAME, which blocks nitric
      oxide synthase, prevented the PEF-stimulated increase in nitric
      oxide, cGMP, and DNA content. An inhibitor of guanylate cyclase
      (LY83583) blocked the PEF-stimulated increase in cGMP and DNA
      content. A nitric oxide donor, when present for only 30 min,
      increased DNA content 72 h later. Taken together, these results
      suggest the transduction pathway for PEF-stimulated chondrocyte
      proliferation involves nitric oxide and the production of nitric
      oxide may be the result of a cascade that involves calcium,
      calmodulin, and cGMP production.<br>

      Abstract -- The purpose of this research was to investigate
      whether the effects of pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF)
      stimulation on the osteoblast proliferation and differentiation
      are mediated by the increase in the nitric oxide (NO, nitrogen
      monoxide) synthesis. The osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1 cell line) were
      cultured in the absence (-NMMA group) or in the presence (+NMMA
      group) of the NO synthase inhibitor L-NMMA. First, osteoblasts
      were subjected to PEMF stimulation (15 Hz and 0.6 mT) up to 15
      days. The DNA content and the NO concentration in the conditioned
      medium were determined on the 3rd, 7th, and 15th days of culture.
      Following, osteoblasts were stimulated in the proliferation
      (P-NMMA and P+NMMA groups) or in the differentiation (D-NMMA and
      D+NMMA groups) stages of maturation, and the alkaline phosphatase
      (AlPase) activity was determined on the 15th day of culture for
      all groups. PEMF stimulation increased significantly the nitrite
      concentration in the -NMMA group on the 3rd, 7th, and 15th days of
      culture. However, this effect was partially blocked in the +NMMA
      group. The DNA content in the -NMMA group, but not in the +NMMA
      group, increased significantly on the 3rd and 7th days of culture.
      The AlPase activity in the P-NMMA and D-NMMA groups, but not in
      the P+NMMA and D+NMMA groups, also increased significantly. In
      conclusion, the PEMF stimulatory effects on the osteoblasts
      proliferation and differentiation were mediated by the increase in
      the NO synthesis.<br>

      Abstract -- Nitric oxide (NO) is an important intracellular and
      intercellular messenger, critically affecting bone metabolism. The
      purpose of this research is to investigate whether the effect of
      sinusoidal electromagnetic field (SEMF) on the differentiation and
      maturation of osteoblasts is mediated by the NO-cGMP-PKG signal
      pathway. We examined the impact of SEMF on nitric oxide synthase
      (NOS) activity, and found that L-NAME, nitric oxide synthase's
      inhibitor, prevents SEMF-mediated increase in NOS activity and NO
      levels. We showed that an inhibitor of soluble guanylyl cyclase
      (ODQ) blocks the increase in cGMP levels triggered by exposure to
      SEMF. The inhibitor PDE5, which hydrolyzes 3',5'-cyclic-GMP to
      5'-GMP, prevents the SEMF's stimulation of PKG activity. We also
      blocked the NO-cGMP-PKG pathway to determine whether the
      maturation and mineralization of osteoblasts, stimulated by SEMF,
      would be inhibited. This was evaluated by measuring alkaline
      phosphatase (ALP) activity, osterix gene expression and
      mineralized bone modulus. After treatment with SEMF, the NOS
      activity increases in comparison with the control group
      (P&lt;0.01), reaching the highest level after 0.5h. Osterix gene
      expression, ALP activity and mineralized bone nodules in the SEMF
      experimental group also increase significantly. However, these
      effects are partially blocked in the L-NAME treated cultures.
      Surprisingly, all the osteogenic markers in the SEMF+L-NAME group
      were slightly higher than in the control culture, but lower than
      in the cells exposed to SEMF only. We conclude that the
      NO-cGMP-PKG signal pathway is activated by SEMF treatment, the
      stimulatory effect of SEMF on the differentiation and
      mineralization of osteoblasts is attenuated when the pathway is
      blocked.<br>

      Abstract -- Blood viscosity is a major factor in heart disease.
      When blood viscosity increases, it damages blood vessels and
      increases the risk of heart attacks. Currently, the only method of
      treatment is to take drugs such as aspirin, which has, however,
      several unwanted side effects. Here we report our finding that
      blood viscosity can be reduced with magnetic fields of 1 T or
      above in the blood flow direction. One magnetic field pulse of 1.3
      T lasting ~1 min can reduce the blood viscosity by 20%-30%. After
      the exposure, in the absence of magnetic field, the blood
      viscosity slowly moves up, but takes a couple of hours to return
      to the original value. The process is repeatable. Reapplying the
      magnetic field reduces the blood viscosity again. By selecting the
      magnetic field strength and duration, we can keep the blood
      viscosity within the normal range. In addition, such viscosity
      reduction does not affect the red blood cells' normal function.
      This technology has much potential for physical therap<br>

      Abstract -- The kinetics of an electromagnetic field (EMF) target
      pathway are used to estimate frequency windows for EMF bioeffects.
      Ion/ligand binding is characterized via first order kinetics from
      which a specific electrical impedance can be derived. The
      resistance/capacitance properties of the binding pathway
      impedance, determined by the kinetics of the rate-determining
      step, define the frequency range over which the target pathway is
      most sensitive to external EMF. Applied signals may thus be
      configured such that their spectral content closely matches that
      of the target, using evaluation of the signal to thermal noise
      ratio to optimize waveform parameters. Using the approach proposed
      in this study, a pulsed radio frequency (PRF) waveform, currently
      employed clinically for soft tissue repair, was returned by
      modulation of burst duration, producing significant bioeffects at
      substantially reduced signal amplitude. Application is made to
      Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent myosin phosphorylation, for which the
      binding time constants may be estimated from reported kinetics,
      neurite outgrowth from embryonic chick dorsal root explants and
      bone repair in a fracture model. The results showed that the
      retuned signal produced increased phosphorylation rates, neurite
      outgrowth and biomechanical strength that were indistinguishable
      from those produced by the clinical signal, but with a tenfold
      reduction in peak signal amplitude, approximately 800-fold
      reduction in average amplitude and approximately 10(6)-fold
      reduction in average power.<br>

      Abstract -- Previous studies of pulsed magnetic fields have
      reported enhanced fracture and chronic wound healing, endothelial
      cell growth, and angiogenesis. This study characterizes the
      biomechanical changes that occur when standard cutaneous wounds
      are exposed to radiofrequency pulsed magnetic fields with specific
      dosage parameters, in an attempt to determine whether return to
      functional tensile strength could be accelerated in wound healing.<br>
      <br>
      The mean tensile strength of treated groups in phase 1 was 48
      percent (p &lt; 0.001) greater than that of controls at 21 days;
      there was no significant difference at 60 days. In phase 2, the
      treated groups showed 18 percent (not significant), 44 percent,
      and 59 percent (p &lt; 0.001) increases in tensile strength over
      controls at 21 days.<br>
      <br>
      The authors successfully demonstrated that exposing wounds to
      pulsed magnetic fields of very specific configurations accelerated
      early wound healing in this animal model, as evidenced by
      significantly increased wound tensile strength at 21 days after
      wounding.<br>

      </b>Abstract -- Apparatus and methods for delivering
      electromagnetic signals configured specifically to accelerate the
      asymmetrical kinetics of the binding of intracellular ions to
      their respective intracellular buffers, to enhance the biochemical
      signaling pathways plant animal and human molecules, cells,
      tissues, organs, portions of entire organisms and entire organisms
      employ for growth, repair and maintenance. Described herein are
      devices and methods that utilize repetitive bursts of waveforms
      configured to maximize the bound concentration of intracellular
      ions at their associated molecular buffers to enhance the
      biochemical signaling pathways living systems employ for growth,
      repair and maintenance. For example the systems and methods
      described herein may drive the binding of calcium to calmodulin
      (CaM), thereby enhancing the CaM-dependent nitric oxide
      (NO)/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling pathway.<br>
