          [0003] This invention relates generally to electrical

          generators. <br>

          <b>[0004] 2. Background </b><br>
          <br>
          [0005] The Searl Effect provides a way for extracting clean
          and sustainable electrical energy. The Searl Effect Generator
          provides three uniquely magnetized fixed stator rings having
          patterns setup to generate continual motion of similarly
          magnetized cylindrical rollers. The rollers have both freedom
          of spin and rotation around the stator which generates both
          mechanical and electrical power. <br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <br>
          [0006] The present invention relates to electron spin and the
          field of spintronics and provides for a spintronic generator.
          The present invention utilizes the application of large
          magnetic fields pulsed to micro sized magnetic fields to take
          advantage of magnetic tunnel junctions (hereinafter “MTJ”).
          Additional motive power is attained from Multiple Exciton
          Generation (hereinafter “MEG”), whereby a single absorbed
          photon of appropriately high energy can produce more than one
          electron-hole pair per absorbed photon. <br>
          <br>
          [0007] The present invention provides electrical power with
          the motive force of natural electron spin. The utilization of
          natural electron spin can be enhanced with carefully matched
          materials, weights, and magnetic waveforms which provide
          precise pulsed frequencies in resonance with the materials.
          This resonance of the magnetic pulses coordinates the newly
          defined spintronics, MTJ, and MEG to provide clean abundant
          power. A utilization of the Zero Point Energy results in a
          local environment temperature drop which can be one of the
          sources of motive force. The harvesting of electricity can be
          via standard induction pick up coils controlled by direct
          current motor controllers using an LRC tank circuit... <br>

              Disclosure</b><br>

          <div align="center"><b>THE SELF-RECHARGING BATTERY SUPPLY OF
              CARLOS F. BENITEZ BY PETER LINDEMANN</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          John Bedini has shown a "three-battery" circuit on his website
          for over 20 years, which works by the potential difference
          between the positives of three batteries in a specific
          arrangement. It shows that potential difference is what
          matters and not necessarily polarity. Ed Gray had a motor that
          ran on a process called "Splitting the Positive" and this is
          directly related to the three-battery system in principle. The
          well-known "Tesla Switch", which came from Ronald Brandt has
          nothing to do with Tesla, but is related to what Peter is
          presenting on and it operates a load between two negatives. I
          presented on a cold electricity circuit a couple years ago and
          it also operates a load between two negatives. These are all
          overunity circuits, which have one thing in common, they all
          appear to have their roots in one man's work and that is the
          Self-Recharging Battery Supply of Carlos F. Benitez.<br>
          <br>
          Peter demonstrated a large SG, which kept itself charged up a
          couple years ago - that was the "Beyond SG" presentation. Last
          year, RS Stafford repeated this demonstrated with a "poor
          man's" method that only required breakers from the hardware
          store. It also kept itself charged up and demonstrated more
          work than the net loss from the batteries. These are all
          related to the Benitez system.<br>
          <br>
          Conversations and replication attempts of Benitez's system
          have been going on for quite some time but only a few have
          made it work such as a few members in Energetic Forum.<br>
          <br>
          Peter Lindemann demonstrated a system at the 2018 ESTC that
          ran on one battery bank, while charging another and it ran a
          motor/generator. The batteries charged up more than they
          discharged and that was with low quality garden start
          batteries, which is the worst case scenario. That shows that
          this system will shine with real deep cycle batteries that are
          larger and have very low impedance. Low impedance batteries
          are the key and this has been proven by John Bedini and Peter
          Lindemann over many years.<br>
          <br>
          What you are about to see is the SIMPLEST, CHEAPEST and LOWEST
          TECH method to replicate the Carlos F. Benitez system that has
          ever been disclosed. After this, it will be hard for anyone to
          have an excuse to not have a self-charging system. This
          presentation shows the circuit, diagrams, patents and it
          includes a PDF companion guide to support your efforts. You're
          free to search Carlos F. Benitez and try to figure it out
          yourself, but unless you can decipher his language of what
          means what, then you will not get very far. Hence, the fact
          that besides Peter, only two others that we know of have
          achieved overunity with this concept - and that is over quite
          a few years.<br>
          <br>
          Peter's presentation is about 45 minutes and is the only time
          Benitez's system has been disclosed in this manner for what it
          is - an intro to the history, the operating theory, some
          revelations that Peter had that made it make sense and Peter's
          very specific schematics on how to build the system. Our hope
          is that replicating this exact method will take off and will
          become even more popular than the Bedini SG. This is SCALABLE,
          which means you can build this as big as you want!<br>

          I have reviewed many devices over the years, some in person
          and others just over the internet. I am often asked do I know
          of any that work. The answer is no . I was reading up on
          another gravity motor claim when I came across this list. This
          is just the tip of the iceberg<br>
          <br>
          Simon has posted some great papers on work and energy. To me,
          it really come down to some simple questions.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where does the energy come from?<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How was it measured<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can it self run?<br>
          <br>
          I am considered a skeptic and have been called many colorful
          names by the true believers over the years. I have been
          threatened (so have my children) in a variety of ways overt he
          years and traveled hundreds of flights.<br>
          <br>
          I have no regrets, but it really becomes as simple as the
          questions I asked above. Scientists and engineers are often
          needed to undertake testing and to generate data. I still do
          this and give advice freely to many inventors.&nbsp; I am not
          sure why I do. Perhaps I am driven having first hand witnessed
          people who invested with the scam artists often losing their
          life savings.<br>
          <br>
          The truth is the truth , and we should always embrace it no
          matter the cost. Will I ever find anything? Who knows.<br>

          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scientists have developed an accelerated
          way to produce magnesite, a mineral which can capture the
          greenhouse gas carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, at room
          temperature. Removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere would
          slow global warming. This work takes a different approach to
          existing processes, and may make it economically viable, but
          it is at an early stage and is not yet an industrial process.
          <br>
          <br>
          Project leader, Professor Ian Power (Trent University,
          Ontario, Canada) said: "Our work shows two things. Firstly, we
          have explained how and how fast magnesite forms naturally.
          This is a process which takes hundreds to thousands of years
          in nature at Earth's surface. The second thing we have done is
          to demonstrate a pathway which speeds this process up
          dramatically."<br>
          <br>
          The researchers were able to show that by using polystyrene
          microspheres as a catalyst, magnesite would form within 72
          days. The microspheres themselves are unchanged by the
          production process, so they can ideally be reused.<br>
          <br>
          "Using microspheres means that we were able to speed up
          magnesite formation by orders of magnitude. This process takes
          place at room temperature, meaning that magnesite production
          is extremely energy efficient."...<br>

          <br>
          The team is led by members of the Inspired Nanomaterials and
          Tissue Engineering Lab in the Department of Biomedical
          Engineering. They have developed technology that introduces a
          new type of two-dimensional clay, also known as nanosilicates,
          that delivers multiple specialized proteins called growth
          factors into the body to stimulate new blood vessel formation.
          To allow blood vessels time to form, the clay is designed to
          prolong the release through its high surface area and charged
          characteristics, according to biomedical engineering assistant
          professor Dr. Akhilesh K. Gaharwar.<br>
          <br>
          "Clay nanoparticles work like tiny weak magnets that hold the
          growth factors within the polymeric hydrogels and release very
          slowly," Gaharwar said. "Sustained and prolonged release of
          physiologically relevant doses of growth factors are important
          to avoid problems due to high doses, such as abrupt tissue
          formation."<br>

              Proangiogenic Factors Stimulate Endothelial Sprouting</b><br>

          </div>
          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          Therapeutic angiogenesis remains a major clinical challenge
          due to lack of biomaterials to sequester and deliver
          proangiogenic therapeutics. Here, 2D nanosilicates are
          introduced as a platform technology to sequester and deliver a
          multitude of proangiogenic growth factors to stimulate
          angiogenesis. The high surface area and charged
          characteristics of nanosilicates prolong release of
          proangiogenic molecules. Interestingly, nanosilicates can
          maintain bioavailability compared to exogenously delivered
          biomolecules. Incorporation of therapeutics-loaded
          nanosilicates within collagen hydrogels stimulates endothelial
          cell invasion in a 3D in vitro models of angiogenesis. The
          results show that endothelial cell invasion is controlled
          predominately by the type of growth factors conjugated to the
          nanosilicates. Overall, this work illustrates the importance
          of nanosilicates as a platform technology to noncovalently
          conjugate proangiogenic therapeutics to direct angiogenesis.<br>

              that CBDs are actually found in other plants and foods as
              well, leading to the possibility of medical grade CBD
              being available to those in areas where CBD products
              derived from hemp and cannabis are still outlawed.
              Researchers working for a San Francisco company, Peak
              Health Foundation, have recently discovered a new source
              of CBD not derived from cannabis or hemp, opening the door
              to more options for the development of CBD based tinctures
              and medicines. The plant is a variety of humulus, commonly
              known as hops, a grain commonly used in the production of
              beer and other alcoholic products, has been found to
              contain high levels of CBDs. A San Francisco company, Peak
              Health Foundation, recently announced its first CBD
              product derived from a strain of humulus, more commonly
              known as hops. Not the ones used to make beer, but a
              strain discovered in India that contains no THC but
              high&nbsp;levels of CBD and is not derived from a plant
              that remains illegal.<br>
              <br>
              Once a variety of hops was found in the wild with a
              reasonably high CBD content, Peak Health founder Bomi
              Joseph cross-bred the plants to create a new variety known
              as Kriya brand humulus. Joseph has patented the plant,
              which has a CBD concentration of around 18%.</font><b><font

              know it is governed by Newton's laws of motion and gravity
              - what goes up, must come down.<br>
              <br>
              But a team of physicists from Columbia University have put
              forward a theoretical paper that turns this idea on its
              head. They say there might actually be particles with
              negative mass - which under gravity, move up, instead of
              down - and they're all around us.<br>
              <br>
              According to their paper, it's not any weird subatomic
              particle that has these properties, but the particles of
              sound we hear and produce every day - phonons - that are
              rebelling against the force of gravity.<br>
              <br>
              So far, so strange, right? After all, sound isn't even a
              physical object, so how can the force of gravity have any
              impact on it?<br>
              <br>
              This paradox is at the heart of the new hypothesis - what
              if, the researchers say, sound waves actually did carry
              mass. Negative mass. And that negative mass created its
              own tiny negative gravitational fields that push them up
              instead of down...<br>

              student Renyuan Li and his supervisor Peng Wang from KAUST
              have analyzed the efficacy of commonly available salts to
              harvest water vapor from the air at night and, when placed
              under sunlight, release drinking water.<br>
              <br>
              Although techniques like engineered-cold surface-induced
              condensation or fog harvesting are used around the world,
              low year-round relative humidity levels and a lack of
              power to run condensers often prevent the harvesting of
              atmospheric water for many regions. Stated Renyuan Li, PhD
              Student<br>
              <br>
              The scientists analyzed 14 common hydrated and anhydrous
              salt couples for their chemical and physical stability and
              for their water-vapor capturing and releasing capacity to
              discover that three of the salts – <b>copper sulfate,
                copper chloride, and magnesium sulfate</b> – were
              efficacious in harvesting water from air with relative
              humidity as low as 15%. Moreover, upon being subject to
              even weakened sunlight, the salts released the whole
              amount of their water to produce clean, fresh water.<br>
              <br>
              We found that these salts not only work when the sunlight
              is strongest, at noon or early afternoon, but that they
              also perform well during other times of the day, such as
              morning and late afternoon. This is important because the

              The study presents an efficient and inexpensive technique
              for capturing water from the atmosphere with the help of
              commonly used salts as an absorbent and sunlight as an
              energy source, which could prove advantageous in various
              poor and dry regions.<br>
              <br>
              “We are now working on salt-based composite materials with
              significantly enhanced water-uptake capacity, which we
              consider to be the second-generation of our atmospheric
              water generator,” stated Wang.<br>

              point or another, turned to the Plan B pill to prevent an
              unplanned pregnancy, but a new study is claiming that
              natural ingredients can be just as effective as emergency
              birth control, without having to mess with a woman’s
              hormones.<br>
              <br>
              The study, done by scientists from the University of
              California at Berkeley, discovered that components of
              dandelions and mangoes can interrupt the meeting of sperm
              and egg. The researchers analyzed the behavior of sperm
              cells and their reactions to certain chemicals,
              DailyMail.co.uk reported. The results of their analysis
              showed that the chemicals lupeol and pristimerin were able
              to limit the whip from sperm’s tails, inhibiting its
              ability to reach the egg and penetrate the cells
              surrounding it, making the chemicals effective at
              preventing pregnancy even after sperm has entered the
              female reproductive system.<br>
              <br>
              Lupeol and pristimerin can be found in dandelions and
              mangoes, as well as in aloe vera, tomato vines, olives and
              grapes, and Thunder God root. The scientists are now
              working towards using these compounds in various forms of
              emergency contraception, from pills, patches, and vaginal
              rings for women. With more research, birth control made
              from these ingredients could be made effective for men as
              well, making it potentially the first unisex birth control
              pill.<br>
              <br>
              Once available, the pill would need to be taken at least
              six hours after unprotected sex, as this is the amount of
              time it takes for human sperm to mature after being
              released into the female reproductive system....</font><b><font

                <br>
              </font></b><font color="#000000">&nbsp;A 2015 study found
              85% of all cotton products sampled (including tampons,
              sterile gauzes and so forth) were tested positive for
              glyphosate. The glyphosate cannot be washed out due to the
              seeds being contaminated; therefore purchasing organic
              tampons, organic cotton pads is imperative. Sleeping in
              organic cotton sheets is also important!<br>
              <br>
              Roundup has been found to cause DNA damage to erythrocytes
              (red blood cells); this was established in a study
              conducted in 1997 by Clements, Ralph and Petras. Roundup’s
              surfactant POEA is known to cause haemolysis (destruction
              of red blood cells). Individuals who sustained poisoning
              by Roundup experiences chest pains, difficulty breathing,
              impaired cognitive function and impaired blood oxygen
              transport. The impairment of red blood cell’s ability to
              transfer adequate oxygen to the brain and body results in
              problematic tissue perfusion and hypoxia. Poor transport
              and/or utilisation of oxygen can cause rapid and major
              neuronal damage.<br>
              <br>
              “Independent scientific studies have shown that Roundup is
              toxic to earthworms, beneficial insects, birds and
              mammals, plus it destroys the vegetation on which they
              depend for food and shelter. Although Monsanto claims that
              Roundup breaks down into harmless substances, it has been
              found to be extremely persistent, with residue absorbed by
              subsequent crops over a year after application. Roundup
              shows adverse effects in all standard categories of
              toxicological testing, including medium-term toxicity,
              long-term toxicity, genetic damage, effects on
              reproduction, and carcinogenicity... </font><b><font

                  mirrors are installed in such a way as to create a
                  closed space in which there is a weakening of the
                  magnetic field of the Earth, and which thereby
                  provides more human access to solar and galactic
                  information. Through numerous experiments using the
                  mirrors with this intention, the ISRICA has focused
                  studies in a number of areas, including human
                  psychophysiology, pathology of disease and health, and
                  the evolvement of telepathic fields and remote
                  sensing. In 1990-91, a precursor of the rainbow bridge
                  experiment was conducted entitled, “The ‘Aurora
                  Borealis’ Global experiment on Investigation of
                  Distant-Informational Interactions in the Noosphere
                  and their Role in the Planet-Biospheric Homeostasis of
                  the Earth.” The conclusions the ISRICA scientists have
                  drawn from the experiments with the Kozyrev Mirrors
                  are often startling to the Western mind, and can best
                  be understood within the context of the Russian school
                  of thought known as Cosmism.</font></font><br>

                  and seeing it change colors as you changed your
                  thoughts. This exact situation led Russian medical
                  doctor Alexander V. Trofimov into his groundbreaking
                  research on human consciousness, in collaboration with
                  Vlail P. Kaznacheev, and following in the footsteps of
                  the great 20th century physicist Nikolai Kozyrev.</font></font><br>

              <font color="#660000"><font color="#000000"> Essentially,
                  Kozyrev devised reproducible experiments that prove
                  the existence of a “torsional energy field” beyond
                  electromagnetism and gravity, which travels much
                  faster than light. He called it the “flow of time.”
                  Others, Einstein among them, have called it “ether.”
                  Others call it “zero point energy.”</font></font><br>

                  “flow of time,” the past, present, and future all
                  exist at the same time, and in every place. This
                  discovery sets the stage for all psychic phenomena to
                  be scientifically explainable. Trofimov and Kaznacheev
                  have, for the past thirty years, been experimentally
                  developing the practical explanations, and have made
                  some surprising discoveries.</font></font><br>

                  Scientific Research Institute for Cosmic
                  Anthropo-Ecology in Novosibirsk, where he is general
                  director, he enthusiastically showed us his two main
                  experimental apparati — two hollow, metal,
                  person-sized tubes, equipped with mattresses and
                  drinking water.</font></font><br>

                  dubbed “Kozyrev’s Mirrors,” reflects thought energy
                  (which exists within the “flow of time”) back to the
                  thinker. This apparatus, invented by Kozyrev, gives
                  access to intensified consciousness and altered
                  states, including non-linear time — similar to a deep
                  meditational state.</font></font><br>

              <font color="#660000"><font color="#000000"> Trofimov’s
                  work has consisted of “remote viewing” experiments
                  across both distance and time. They discovered that
                  results are more positive when the “sender” is in the
                  far north, where the electromagnetic field is less
                  powerful. So they invented a second apparatus that
                  shields an experimental subject from the local
                  electromagnetic field. Within this apparatus, their
                  subjects can reliably access all place and time —
                  past, present, and future — instantaneously.
                  Construction specifications for these apparati are
                  published in Russian scientific literature.</font></font><br>

              <font color="#660000"><font color="#000000"> 1) our
                  planet’s electromagnetic field is actually the “veil”
                  which filters time and place down to our everyday
                  Newtonian reality — enabling us to have the human
                  experience of linear time,</font></font><br>

              <font color="#660000"><font color="#000000"> 2) in the
                  absence of an electromagnetic field, we have access to
                  an energy field of “instantaneous locality” that
                  underlies our reality,</font></font><br>

              <font color="#660000"><font color="#000000"> 3) that the
                  limiting effect of the electromagnetic field on an
                  individual is moderated by the amount of solar
                  electromagnetic activity occurring while that person
                  was in utero, and</font></font><br>

              <font color="#660000"><font color="#000000"> 4) that once
                  a person has accessed these states, his or her
                  consciousness remains so enhanced.</font></font><br>
              <font color="#660000"><font color="#000000"> </font></font><br>
              <font color="#660000"><font color="#000000"> The
                  implication is that the global electromagnetic soup of
                  cell phones, radio, television and electric appliances
                  actually impedes our innate communication abilities.
                  The further implication is that expanded human
                  consciousness is mechanically producible now, which
                  raises the vast ethical question of how these apparati
                  can be most beneficially used.</font></font><br>

                  theoretical physics to investigate the electromagnetic
                  response of the Great Pyramid to radio waves.
                  Scientists predicted that under resonance conditions
                  the pyramid can concentrate electromagnetic energy in
                  its internal chambers and under the base. The research
                  group plans to use these theoretical results to design
                  nanoparticles capable of reproducing similar effects
                  in the optical range. Such nanoparticles may be used,
                  for example, to develop sensors and highly efficient
                  solar cells. The study was published in the Journal of
                  Applied Physics. ...</font></font><br>

              <font color="#660000"><font color="#000000"> To answer
                  that question, we need to know what studies have been
                  done on the safety of microwave-frequency digital
                  radio transmissions.</font></font><br>
              <font color="#660000"><font color="#000000"> We need to
                  look at WiFi, Bluetooth, 3G, and 4G studies, as well!</font></font><br>
              <font color="#660000"><font color="#000000"> After all,
                  much of the concern about 5G is based on the results
                  of those studies.</font></font><br>
              <font color="#660000"><font color="#000000"> It turns out
                  that there ARE a ton of studies out there that
                  indicate that yes, it looks bad.</font></font><br>
              <font color="#660000"><font color="#000000"> Of course,
                  there is also the SAR “heating effect” argument, which
                  is part of the problem as we’ll see…</font></font><br>
              <font color="#660000"><font color="#000000"> Now, as bad
                  as this stuff sounds, the fact is we need more studies
                  – or rather, a thorough, long-term study with control
                  groups, the proper consideration of other toxins, and
                  so on.</font></font><br>
              <font color="#660000"><font color="#000000"> In short, we
                  need a continuation of the studies mentioned in these
                  papers. At the moment, that seems unlikely to happen.</font></font><br>

                  by Gerardo Ceballos, Paul R. Ehrlich &amp; Rodolfo
                  Dirzo was published in 2017. “Dwindling population
                  sizes and range shrinkages amount to a massive
                  anthropogenic erosion of biodiversity and of the
                  ecosystem services essential to civilization. This

                  for humanity of Earth’s ongoing sixth mass extinction
                  event.” Gerado Ceballos, the lead author gave an
                  example from close to home: “We used to have swallows
                  nesting every year in my home in Mexico City – but for
                  the last ten years there are none”. (Guardian Damian
                  Carrington 10/7/2017) “The serious warning in our
                  paper needs to be heeded because civilisation depends
                  utterly on the plants, animals, and microorganisms of
                  Earth that supply it with essential ecosystem services
                  ranging from crop pollination and protection to
                  supplying food from the sea and maintaining a liveable
                  climate. Other ecosystem services include clean air

                measured were just 1-2/1,000th the FCC’s allowable
                “safe” limits for non-ionizing radiation. In other
                words, the FCC considers radiation levels 1,000 times

                It’s worth re-telling here the little-known is the story
                of John Patterson, who was a senior telecommunications
                officer for Telstra in Australia, responsible for the
                deployment of thousands of towers. When he discovered
                that these towers are capable of emitting microwave
                radiation 50,000 times the legal limit, he wrote a
                report to his seniors – and was promptly fired. In order
                to get the word out, he says he took his friend’s tank
                and destroyed 8 tower sites and served 20 months in
                jail. He says he doesn’t regret it because, “People need
                to know my story.”<br>

                    it's bad press, the gram-negative bacterial strain
                    E. coli&nbsp; is actually a healthy component of the
                    gut flora which is found in in everyone's digestive
                    tract. Whilst highly pathogen strains do exist, the
                    majority of strains make up our commensal flora.
                    Under ordinary conditions, and when in the right
                    amounts, E. coli contributes toward optimal
                    digestion, the synthesis of vitamins, and
                    maintaining balance within the gut. E. coli belongs
                    to the Enterobacteriaceae family, and
                    Enterobacteriacea may only constitute less than 1%
                    of the total gut flora in healthy individuals
                    (Eckburg et al., 2005). </font></font><br>

                  certain scenarios specific strains of E.coli can
                  become dominant and overgrown in a state of dysbiosis.
                  Interestingly, E.coli overgrowth has been implicated
                  in inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's and
                  ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and is
                  also associated with colorectal cancer. Furthermore,
                  in animal research it has been correlated with severe
                  gut inflammation. Based on the research available, I
                  think it is fair to conclude that any abnormal
                  overgrowth of E.coli may yield negative consequences
                  for the host (in some cases at least). </font></font><br>

              <font color="#660000"><font color="#000000"> With this
                  considered, it is important to note that research has
                  actually found that exposure to radiofrequency
                  electromagnetic radiation causes these bacteria to
                  grow a lot faster than normal. </font></font><br>

              <font color="#660000"><font color="#000000"> Taheri et al
                  compared the growth rate of different bacterial
                  species under conditions of exposure to
                  radio-frequencies similar to those emitted by mobile
                  devices or wifi. When compared with controls, E.coli
                  and Listeria monocytogenes (a potential pathogen)
                  showed significantly faster growth after radiation
                  exposure.&nbsp; </font></font><br>
              <font color="#660000"><font color="#000000"> </font></font><br>
              <font color="#660000"><font color="#000000"> To make
                  matters worse, they also showed that within a certain
                  window of exposure (around 6 hours), the E.coli
                  exposed to radiation became more resistant to
                  antibiotics. In the current age of
                  antibiotic-resistance, this is bad news. Furthermore,
                  it suggests a possible mechanism by which EMF exposure
                  could potentially lead to gut dysbiosis. To briefly
                  explain, our commensal gut bacteria produce their own
                  antibiotic called bacteriocin. Although the roles of
                  bacteriocin is not yet fully understood, it is
                  generally accepted that these endogenous antibiotics
                  function to kill off invading pathogens and prevent
                  the overgrowth of unwanted bacteria. They are tools
                  used by our own beneficial flora to keep everything
                  else in check. </font></font><br>

                  another study on E. coli measured the growth rate and
                  also the rate of glucose consumption. According the
                  authors, the bacteria was exposed to a 5G
                  electromagnetic field for 8 hours. Like the previous
                  study, they found a significant increase in growth
                  after radiation exposure and attributed these changes
                  to increased glucose uptake.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></font><br>

                  therapeutic benefits in healing the intestinal
                  barrier, whilst its counterpart Lactobacillus
                  Rhamnosus has a proven track record in improving
                  allergies, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and boosting
                  immunity&nbsp; Together, these probiotics are two of
                  the most well-researched and sought after strains
                  available. Unfortunately, they also appears to be
                  susceptible to the detrimental effects of radiation. A
                  study performed by Vasistha and Garg set to measure to
                  effects on these strains after exposure to 6.41 GHz,
                  7.5 GHz and 7.62 GHz radio frequency radiation. They
                  found a significant reduction in the amount of cells
                  belonging to both strains, and this effect increased
                  with the frequency of radiation. It was hypothesised
                  that the radiation could have exerted an oxidative
                  effect on the cells, increasing free radical damage
                  and destroying bacterial DNA...</font></font><br>

                  the gut, practically every other organ also hosts a
                  variety of bacteria which help to maintain balance.
                  One example is the skin, where different strains
                  function by fighting off pathogens and promoting skin
                  barrier integrity. Alterations in skin microbiota are
                  well associated with conditions like acne,&nbsp;
                  eczema, and many others. Again, a healthy balance of

                </font></b><font color="#000000">The human body
                literally glimmers. The intensity of the light emitted
                by the body is 1000 times lower than the sensitivity of
                our naked eyes. Ultraweak photon emission is known as
                the energy released as light through the changes in
                energy metabolism. We successfully imaged the diurnal
                change of this ultraweak photon emission with an
                improved highly sensitive imaging system using cryogenic
                charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. We found that the
                human body directly and rhythmically emits light. The
                diurnal changes in photon emission might be linked to
                changes in energy metabolism. <br>

                  you heard of Arctic Monsoons? No, because I just
                  invented the term for this video. Basically, these
                  long lived, extensive heat domes over land create
                  updrafts and thus low surface pressure, drawing in
                  moisture laden marine air from an ice-free region of
                  the Arctic, and will lead to monsoonal like torrential
                  rains in the Arctic. Thus, Arctic Monsoons. These
                  globally occurring heat waves stress people,
                  infrastructure, crops and thus global food supply.
                  They also lead to higher atmospheric CO2 levels
                  (carbon sinks decline), and cause wildfires north of
                  the Arctic Circle. Sounds like an Emergency to me; yet
                  ignored by politicians, some who salivate at the
                  thought of fossil fuel exploitation in an ice free
                  Arctic. Who cares if we cannot eat?</font></font></div>

              What accounts for the stark difference between how Western
              and Eastern European nations respond to Muslim
              migrants?&nbsp; The former—including Great Britain,
              Germany, and Scandinavia—have been welcoming, whereas the
              latter—including Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia—have
              not, often vociferously so.<br>
              <br>
              Part of the answer, which may surprise some, revolves
              around history: Eastern European nations have a long and
              intimate history with, and thus understand Islam better
              than Western nations.<br>
              <br>
              Consider Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orbán’s logic for
              rejecting Muslim migrants:<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those arriving have been raised in
              another religion, and represent a radically different
              culture. Most of them are not Christians, but
              Muslims.&nbsp; This is an important question, because
              Europe and European identity is rooted in
              Christianity….&nbsp; We don’t want to criticize France,
              Belgium, any other country, but we think all countries
              have a right to decide whether they want to have a large
              number of Muslims in their countries. If they want to live
              together with them, they can. We don’t want to and I think
              we have a right to decide that we do not want a large
              number of Muslim people in our country. We do not like the
              consequences of having a large number of Muslim
              communities that we see in other countries, and I do not
              see any reason for anyone else to force us to create ways
              of living together in Hungary that we do not want to see….<br>
              <br>
              The prime minister went on to invoke history: “I have to
              say that when it comes to living together with Muslim
              communities, we are the only ones who have experience
              because we had the possibility to go through that
              experience for 150 years.”<br>
              <br>
              Orbán was referring to Islam’s conquest and occupation of
              Hungary from 1541 to 1699.&nbsp; Then, persecution and
              terrorism were rampant.<br>
              <br>
              Nor was Hungary alone. Muslims conquered, occupied, and
              terrorized most of southeastern Europe—often in ways that
              make Islamic State atrocities seem tame.<br>
              <br>
              In 1354, the Ottomans—who were more committed to the
              principles of jihad than any of their Muslim
              predecessors—first crossed the Dardanelles and established
              a foothold in Eastern Europe.&nbsp; Immediately, “[w]here
              there were churches he [Suleiman, son of Sultan Orhan]
              destroyed them or converted them to mosques,” writes an
              Ottoman chronicler: “Where there were bells, Suleiman
              broke them up and cast them into fires. Thus, in place of
              bells there were now muezzins.”<br>
              <br>
              Before long the Balkans were conquered in the name of
              jihad.&nbsp; The atrocities committed before, during, and
              after these conquests are well documented.&nbsp; For
              example, writing around 1438, Bartolomeo de Giano
              highlighted the “calamitous and lamentable slaughter that
              we see in these days.” Everywhere they conquered, the
              jihadis erected “great mountains of [Christian] heads,”
              and “so great a quantity of bodies lay consumed, partially
              rotted, partially devoured by dogs, that it would seem
              unbelievable to anyone who had not seen it with their own
              eyes.”<br>
              <br>
              Survivors were either enslaved to “serve their [masters’]
              wicked and filthy pleasures” and/or forced into becoming
              “Saracens [Muslims] who will later be enemies of the
              Christians.” From Hungary, three hundred thousand were
              enslaved and “carried off in just a few days”; from Serbia
              and Transylvania one hundred thousand were hauled off.
              “The massive enslavement of slavic populations during this
              period gave rise, in fact, to our word ‘slave,’” comments
              one historian; “in Bartolomeo’s time, to be a slave was to
              be a Slav.”<br>
              <br>
              Young and old everywhere were seen being “led away in iron
              fetters tied to the backs of horses,” continues
              Bartolomeo, and “women and children were herded by dogs
              without any mercy or piety. If one of them slowed down,
              unable to walk further because of thirst or pain, O Good
              Jesus! she immediately ended her life there in torment,
              cut in half.”<br>
              <br>
              The slave markets of Adrianople, then-capital of the
              Ottoman sultanate, were so inundated with human flesh that
              children sold for pennies, “a very beautiful slave woman
              was exchanged for a pair of boots, and four Serbian slaves
              were traded for a horse.”<br>
              <br>
              Similarly, the Ottomans’ chief Muslim allies, the Tatar
              khanate of Crimea—described by Christians as the “heathen
              giant who feeds on our blood”—enslaved and sold “like
              sheep” some three million Slavs (Poles, Lithuanians,
              Russians, and Ukrainians) between 1450 and 1783.&nbsp; In
              1630, a Lithuanian described how Muslim masters
              “castrated” the men and “cut off their ears and nostrils,
              burned cheeks and foreheads with the burning iron and
              forced them to work with their chains and shackles during
              the daylight, and sit in the prisons during the night;
              they are sustained by the meager food consisting of the
              dead animals’ meat, rotten, full of worms, which even a
              dog would not eat. The youngest women are kept for wanton
              pleasures.”<br>
              <br>
              Muslim aggression and atrocities against Eastern Europeans
              culminated with the slaughter if not genocide of any
              Christian the sultan’s scimitar could reach (Serbians,
              Bulgarians, Greeks, Armenians, Assyrians), and ended only
              with the demise of the Ottoman sultanate soon after World
              War I.<br>
              <br>
              It is this long history of living with and under
              Islam—that is, personal and direct experience, as amply
              documented in Sword and Scimitar—that has caused several
              Eastern European nations to reject Muslim migrants.<br>
              <br>
              Of course, some will argue that the aforementioned history
              does not pertain to current realities.&nbsp; This would be
              a plausible position if not for the fact that every
              Western city that contains a large Muslim population has
              experienced a dramatic rise in terrorism and crimes in
              general—most of which are fueled by that old Islamic
              hostility for infidels.<br>
              <br>
              In Germany and the United Kingdom, crime and rape have
              soared in direct proportion to the number of Muslim
              “refugees” accepted.&nbsp; Sweden alone—where rape has
              increased by 1,472% since that country embraced
              “multiculturalism”—is reportedly on the verge of collapse.<br>
              <br>
              When it comes to considering its relationship with Islam,
              the West would do well to revisit and learn from
              history—over a millennium of it.&nbsp; Otherwise it will
              have to keep learning the hard way.<br>

          orders critic of jihad dropped<br>
          <br>
          The author of 18 bestselling books, Robert Spencer is known
          for regularly pointing out that the perpetrators of more than
          33,000 terrorist attacks since 9/11 have cited Islamic
          scripture as the motivation for their often deadly acts of
          violence.<br>
          <br>
          His critics charge, without evidence, that he hates Muslims,
          and now Spencer has been banned from the web-based funding
          site Patreon, which claims Mastercard demanded the move.<br>
          <br>
          On his Jihad Watch website Wednesday, Spencer said that after
          being denied access to Patreon without warning, he received an
          email from a customer-service person who said Patreon had been
          “notified by Mastercard that we must remove your account from
          Patreon, effective immediately.”..<br>

          </b>‘With Open Gates: The forced collective suicide of
          European nations’, a slick, hard-hitting film about the
          European migrant crisis is going viral in Europe, already
          watched at least half a million times.<br>
          <br>
          Although the 19-minute film may feel like a dispatch from the
          future, it is cut entirely from recent news reports, police
          camera footage, and interviews. Kicking off with scenes of a
          modern car ferry disgorging thousands of illegals into Greece,
          the film then cuts to dozens of aerial shots of columns of
          migrants marching north into Europe...<br>

              those enclosed in them to new perceptions.<br>
              <br>
              Those enclosed within these specially shaped concave
              aluminum mirrors have out of body experiences and see
              visions that far exceed even LSD. The Russians have done
              immense research on Kozyrev’s mirrors.<br>
              <br>
              Mystics and prophets of old were assured that the mirror,
              especially concave, can empower a person’s ability of
              clairvoyance. We faced today’s scientists with the unusual
              properties of these mirrors: physicists, biologists,
              geneticists, psychologists …<br>
              <br>
              Scientists from the Siberian Branch of the Academy of
              Medical Sciences of the USSR at the time decided to deal
              with the mysterious properties of concave mirrors. Based
              on experiments and theory of time from Leningrad
              astrophysicist Nikolai Alexandrovich Kozyrev, the
              researchers produced a special mirror design and the end
              of 1980 and started experimenting with a mental image
              transfer over large distances. In the global experiments
              twelve countries of the world were employed and nearly
              five thousand participants. The results exceeded all
              expectations. In most cases up to 95 percent of the
              telepathic information was received correctly. These
              results can not be attributed to accidental coincidences …
              <br>
              <br>
              What if the secrets of concave mirrors were carried away
              when their biggest expert died – a scientist in the
              thirteenth century called Roger Bacon. How did he manage
              to look for hundreds of years ahead and to predict the
              invention of the microscope and telescope, cars and
              airplanes, ships powered by engines? How did he knew about
              galaxies and extragalactic nebulae, the structure of
              biological cells and the process of embryo formation,
              composition and operation of gun powder?<br>
              <br>
              Is it a coincidence that during the experiments with
              Kozyrev mirrors over the laboratory UFOs were seen
              regularly? What about this so called the field of fear
              around the mirror setting? The glowing symbols that appear
              in it? What happens to a man once inside Kozyrev mirror?
              What is up with the “information space” (collective
              memory, akasha) and how researchers can obtain information
              not only from the distant past of humanity, but also from
              the future?<br>
              <br>
              What is the importance of a concave mirror on planetary
              scale, and how it can act on people and equipment? What
              are the prospects of the concave mirrors in medicine,
              aerospace, scientific knowledge of the world? And finally,
              why the sensational results of Siberian and Ural
              scientists are virtually unknown to the people?<br>
              <br>
              These are the questions that this documentary addresses.<br>
              <br>
              Ogledalo-Kozirjeva-Kozyrev-mirrors: Simple polished sheets
              of aluminium are all it takes.<br>
              <br>
              The Kozyrev mirrors are installed in such a way as to
              create a closed space in which there is a weakening of the
              magnetic field of the Earth, and which thereby provides
              more human access to solar and galactic information.
              Through numerous experiments using the mirrors with this
              intention, the ISRICA has focused studies in a number of
              areas, including human psychophysiology, pathology of
              disease and health, and the evolvement of telepathic
              fields and remote sensing. In 1990-91, a precursor of the
              rainbow bridge experiment was conducted entitled, “The
              ‘Aurora Borealis’ Global experiment on Investigation of
              Distant-Informational Interactions in the Noosphere and
              their Role in the Planet-Biospheric Homeostasis of the
              Earth.” The conclusions the ISRICA scientists have drawn
              from the experiments with the Kozyrev Mirrors are often
              startling to the Western mind, and can best be understood
              within the context of the Russian school of thought known
              as Cosmism.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;<b>Interview with Alexander Trofimov</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              Imagine standing under a vast, scintillating aurora
              borealis, and seeing it change colors as you changed your
              thoughts. This exact situation led Russian medical doctor
              Alexander V. Trofimov into his groundbreaking research on
              human consciousness, in collaboration with Vlail P.
              Kaznacheev, and following in the footsteps of the great
              20th century physicist Nikolai Kozyrev.<br>
              <br>
              Essentially, Kozyrev devised reproducible experiments that
              prove the existence of a “torsional energy field” beyond
              electromagnetism and gravity, which travels much faster
              than light. He called it the “flow of time.” Others,
              Einstein among them, have called it “ether.” Others call
              it “zero point energy.”<br>
              <br>
              Within this “flow of time,” the past, present, and future
              all exist at the same time, and in every place. This
              discovery sets the stage for all psychic phenomena to be
              scientifically explainable. Trofimov and Kaznacheev have,
              for the past thirty years, been experimentally developing
              the practical explanations, and have made some surprising
              discoveries.<br>
              <br>
              When I visited Trofimov’s laboratories at the
              International Scientific Research Institute for Cosmic
              Anthropo-Ecology in Novosibirsk, where he is general
              director, he enthusiastically showed us his two main
              experimental apparati — two hollow, metal, person-sized
              tubes, equipped with mattresses and drinking water.<br>
              <br>
              The first, dubbed “Kozyrev’s Mirrors,” reflects thought
              energy (which exists within the “flow of time”) back to
              the thinker. This apparatus, invented by Kozyrev, gives
              access to intensified consciousness and altered states,
              including non-linear time — similar to a deep meditational
              state.<br>
              <br>
              Trofimov’s work has consisted of “remote viewing”
              experiments across both distance and time. They discovered
              that results are more positive when the “sender” is in the
              far north, where the electromagnetic field is less
              powerful. So they invented a second apparatus that shields
              an experimental subject from the local electromagnetic
              field. Within this apparatus, their subjects can reliably
              access all place and time — past, present, and future —
              instantaneously. Construction specifications for these
              apparati are published in Russian scientific literature.<br>
              <br>
              Among Trofimov and Kaznacheev’s conclusions are:<br>
              <br>
              1) our planet’s electromagnetic field is actually the
              “veil” which filters time and place down to our everyday
              Newtonian reality — enabling us to have the human
              experience of linear time,<br>
              <br>
              2) in the absence of an electromagnetic field, we have
              access to an energy field of “instantaneous locality” that
              underlies our reality,<br>
              <br>
              3) that the limiting effect of the electromagnetic field
              on an individual is moderated by the amount of solar
              electromagnetic activity occurring while that person was
              in utero, and<br>
              <br>
              4) that once a person has accessed these states, his or
              her consciousness remains so enhanced.<br>
              <br>
              The implication is that the global electromagnetic soup of
              cell phones, radio, television and electric appliances
              actually impedes our innate communication abilities. The
              further implication is that expanded human consciousness
              is mechanically producible now, which raises the vast
              ethical question of how these apparati can be most
              beneficially used.<br>

              </font></b><font color="#000000">5G is coming, and people
              are worried. Well, should we be?<br>
              <br>
              To answer that question, we need to know what studies have
              been done on the safety of microwave-frequency digital
              radio transmissions.<br>
              <br>
              We need to look at WiFi, Bluetooth, 3G, and 4G studies, as
              well!<br>
              <br>
              After all, much of the concern about 5G is based on the
              results of those studies.<br>
              <br>
              It turns out that there ARE a ton of studies out there
              that indicate that yes, it looks bad.<br>
              <br>
              Of course, there is also the SAR “heating effect”
              argument, which is part of the problem as we’ll see…<br>
              <br>
              Now, as bad as this stuff sounds, the fact is we need more
              studies – or rather, a thorough, long-term study with
              control groups, the proper consideration of other toxins,
              and so on.<br>
              <br>
              In short, we need a continuation of the studies mentioned
              in these papers. At the moment, that seems unlikely to
              happen.<br>
              <br>
              So, there you have it: Why I don’t like to use and be
              saturated in WiFi, Bluetooth, and cell phone signals!<br>

              Rodolfo Dirzo was published in 2017. “Dwindling population
              sizes and range shrinkages amount to a massive
              anthropogenic erosion of biodiversity and of the ecosystem
              services essential to civilization. This “biological

              Earth’s ongoing sixth mass extinction event.” Gerado
              Ceballos, the lead author gave an example from close to
              home: “We used to have swallows nesting every year in my
              home in Mexico City – but for the last ten years there are
              none”. (Guardian Damian Carrington 10/7/2017) “The serious
              warning in our paper needs to be heeded because
              civilisation depends utterly on the plants, animals, and
              microorganisms of Earth that supply it with essential

              Svanborg has been paving the road to capitalizing on
              breast milk’s cancer-fighting abilities out of her lab at
              Lund University in Sweden. Specifically, the professor has
              been working on a way to bind a breast milk protein known
              as alpha-lactalbumin to oleic acid, a fatty acid found in
              olive oil, nuts and seeds.<br>
              <br>
              The cancer-killing combination she’s dubbed HAMLET (an
              acronym for human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor
              cells) has shown great success in laboratory applications,
              shrinking brain, bladder and colon tumors with ease. Tests
              involving animal and human cancer cell lines have shown
              that HAMLET is effective against at least 40 types of
              cancer....<br>

              California counties from San Francisco to Sacramento to
              Los Angeles, have reported severe neurological damage,
              headaches, insomnia, memory problems and confusion after
              5G towers were installed outside their stations. When
              tested, they were found to have brain abnormalities and
              measurable neurological deficits and firefighters have now
              filed to be exempt from the California law that would
              enforce the installment of 5G towers near their places of
              work.<br>
              <br>
              When their fire stations were relocated away from 5G
              transmitters, firefighters claimed their symptoms stopped.
              More shocking (no pun intended) was that the radiation
              levels measured were just 1-2/1,000th the FCC’s allowable
              “safe” limits for non-ionizing radiation. In other words,
              the FCC considers radiation levels 1,000 times higher than
              those which debilitated strapping firemen to be safe!.....<br>
              <br>
              It’s worth re-telling here the little-known is the story
              of John Patterson, who was a senior telecommunications
              officer for Telstra in Australia, responsible for the
              deployment of thousands of towers. When he discovered that
              these towers are capable of emitting microwave radiation
              50,000 times the legal limit, he wrote a report to his
              seniors – and was promptly fired. In order to get the word
              out, he says he took his friend’s tank and destroyed 8
              tower sites and served 20 months in jail. He says he
              doesn’t regret it because, “People need to know my story.”<br>

                A video that has been censored by Facebook is now
                available at this REAL.video link. The video, featuring
                Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. of the World Mercury Project,
                warns about the epidemic of vaccine-induced degenerative
                disease that’s sweeping across developed nations.<br>

              color="#000000">In the verboten video, he names ADHD,
              autism, auto-immune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis,
              juvenile diabetes, asthma and food allergies. “We know
              from the science that all of these diseases can be caused
              by ingredients in vaccines,” he warns. “And we know that
              the epidemic of these diseases exploded after the dramatic
              expansion of the vaccine schedule that took place in
              1989.”<br>
              <br>
              RFK, Jr. says that while it’s not rational to blame
              vaccines for every disease, “we ought to be doing the
              science” to find out the true impact of vaccines on
              causing degenerative disease in children. Yet the CDC, the
              vaccine industry and the entire fake news media have been
              running a decades-long vaccine cover-up to shut down any
              and all rational skepticism about the safety of vaccine
              ingredients. Those ingredients, of course, include known
              neurological poisons such as formaldehyde, monosodium

                EMF exposure makes some bugs grow more than others<br>
                <br>
              </font></b><font color="#000000">Despite it's bad press,
              the gram-negative bacterial strain E. coli&nbsp; is
              actually a healthy component of the gut flora which is
              found in in everyone's digestive tract. Whilst highly
              pathogen strains do exist, the majority of strains make up
              our commensal flora. Under ordinary conditions, and when
              in the right amounts, E. coli contributes toward optimal
              digestion, the synthesis of vitamins, and maintaining
              balance within the gut. E. coli belongs to the
              Enterobacteriaceae family, and Enterobacteriacea may only
              constitute less than 1% of the total gut flora in healthy
              individuals (Eckburg et al., 2005). <br>
              <br>
              However, in certain scenarios specific strains of E.coli
              can become dominant and overgrown in a state of dysbiosis.
              Interestingly, E.coli overgrowth has been implicated in
              inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's and ulcerative
              colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and is also associated
              with colorectal cancer. Furthermore, in animal research it
              has been correlated with severe gut inflammation. Based on
              the research available, I think it is fair to conclude
              that any abnormal overgrowth of E.coli may yield negative
              consequences for the host (in some cases at least). <br>
              <br>
              With this considered, it is important to note that
              research has actually found that exposure to
              radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation causes these
              bacteria to grow a lot faster than normal. <br>
              <br>
              Taheri et al compared the growth rate of different
              bacterial species under conditions of exposure to
              radio-frequencies similar to those emitted by mobile
              devices or wifi. When compared with controls, E.coli and
              Listeria monocytogenes (a potential pathogen) showed
              significantly faster growth after radiation
              exposure.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              To make matters worse, they also showed that within a
              certain window of exposure (around 6 hours), the E.coli
              exposed to radiation became more resistant to antibiotics.
              In the current age of antibiotic-resistance, this is bad
              news. Furthermore, it suggests a possible mechanism by
              which EMF exposure could potentially lead to gut
              dysbiosis. To briefly explain, our commensal gut bacteria
              produce their own antibiotic called bacteriocin. Although
              the roles of bacteriocin is not yet fully understood, it
              is generally accepted that these endogenous antibiotics
              function to kill off invading pathogens and prevent the
              overgrowth of unwanted bacteria. They are tools used by
              our own beneficial flora to keep everything else in check.
              <br>
              <br>
              Additionally, another study on E. coli measured the growth
              rate and also the rate of glucose consumption. According
              the authors, the bacteria was exposed to a 5G
              electromagnetic field for 8 hours. Like the previous
              study, they found a significant increase in growth after
              radiation exposure and attributed these changes to
              increased glucose uptake.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              The strain Lactobacillus Plantarum is well-known for it's
              therapeutic benefits in healing the intestinal barrier,
              whilst its counterpart Lactobacillus Rhamnosus has a
              proven track record in improving allergies,
              gastrointestinal dysfunction, and boosting immunity&nbsp;
              Together, these probiotics are two of the most
              well-researched and sought after strains available.
              Unfortunately, they also appears to be susceptible to the
              detrimental effects of radiation. A study performed by
              Vasistha and Garg set to measure to effects on these
              strains after exposure to 6.41 GHz, 7.5 GHz and 7.62 GHz
              radio frequency radiation. They found a significant
              reduction in the amount of cells belonging to both
              strains, and this effect increased with the frequency of
              radiation. It was hypothesised that the radiation could
              have exerted an oxidative effect on the cells, increasing
              free radical damage and destroying bacterial DNA...<br>
              <br>
              Aside from the gut, practically every other organ also
              hosts a variety of bacteria which help to maintain
              balance. One example is the skin, where different strains
              function by fighting off pathogens and promoting skin
              barrier integrity. Alterations in skin microbiota are well
              associated with conditions like acne,&nbsp; eczema, and
              many others. Again, a healthy balance of skin bacteria is
              necessary for overall skin health. <br>
              <br>
              And it turns out that radiofrequency radiation also screws
              with the bacteria on the skin, drastically altering the
              populations of Staphylococci such as S. pasteuri, S.
              lugdunensis and S. epidermidis.<br>
              <br>
              The authors of the study concluded:<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The growth of Staphylococci from
              certain individuals were enhanced under RF-EMF, and in
              some other cases the growth was suppressed, which means
              the disruption to the balanced skin microbiota make it
              more vulnerable to infection possibly by those
              opportunistic pathogens or foreign pathogens...<br>

              </font></b><font color="#000000">The human body literally
              glimmers. The intensity of the light emitted by the body
              is 1000 times lower than the sensitivity of our naked
              eyes. Ultraweak photon emission is known as the energy
              released as light through the changes in energy
              metabolism. We successfully imaged the diurnal change of
              this ultraweak photon emission with an improved highly
              sensitive imaging system using cryogenic charge-coupled
              device (CCD) camera. We found that the human body directly
              and rhythmically emits light. The diurnal changes in
              photon emission might be linked to changes in energy
              metabolism. <br>

              </font></b><font color="#000000">Have you heard of Arctic
              Monsoons? No, because I just invented the term for this
              video. Basically, these long lived, extensive heat domes
              over land create updrafts and thus low surface pressure,
              drawing in moisture laden marine air from an ice-free
              region of the Arctic, and will lead to monsoonal like
              torrential rains in the Arctic. Thus, Arctic Monsoons.
              These globally occurring heat waves stress people,
              infrastructure, crops and thus global food supply. They
              also lead to higher atmospheric CO2 levels (carbon sinks
              decline), and cause wildfires north of the Arctic Circle.
              Sounds like an Emergency to me; yet ignored by
              politicians, some who salivate at the thought of fossil
              fuel exploitation in an ice free Arctic. Who cares if we
              cannot eat?<br>
