            Life</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      Russian researchers developed an express-technique for testing
      toxicity of water with high and low deuterium concentration and
      discovered an interesting fact – deuterium is a crucial element
      for normal functioning of a living cell.<br>
      <br>
      Natural water normally contains two hydrogen isotopes: protium and
      deuterium, which concentration is about 156 parts per million
      (ppm). Light water (with low deuterium concentration) is believed
      to have positive effects on human health. Heavy water is toxic –
      it prevents cells from normal division, if its concentration in an
      organism is about 25-50%.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      Scientists suggested using a test organism, an infusorium
      Spirostomum ambiguum, which is very convenient to work with due to
      its size – about 1 mm. Experiments showed that deuterium
      concentration of 50-125 ppm had no effect on infusoria lifespan,
      but organisms had quickly died in water with lower or higher
      deuterium content. Researchers believe that some certain deuterium
      content is crucial for normal functioning of a living cell.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      Russian Institute for Biological Medicine launched production of
      light water, differing from ordinary water by stimulating all
      human systems’ activities through data-flow level. Institute’s
      vice-president claims such developments are unique and cannot be
      found anywhere else in the world.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      Natural light water is found in mountain rivers and melting
      glaciers. Scientists designed rectifying columns for water
      fractional distillation and derived water free from its heavy
      components.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      Light water normalizes any pathology found in an organism. It also
      improves body resistance to harmful effects of physical, chemical
      and biological origin. Clinical trials revealed light water’s
      ability to dissolve higher concentrations of various substances
      and to penetrate membranes easier than ordinary water. Light water
      showed anti-inflammatory effect and eliminated tissue puffiness.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      Recently developed “Langway” water is already available at the US
      market. Tests proved its potential to refine cell metabolic
      processes through accumulating energy inside a cell. Light water
      is highly recommended for skin regeneration stimulation. “Langway”
      tones the skin, reduces its greasiness, narrows skin pores, slows
      ageing and helps skin to resist negative environmental impact.
      Light water also regulates excretion of toxins, salts of heavy
      metals, cellular debris and infectious germs. Another positive
      aspect is that such water lowers blood sugar and cholesterol, thus
      it can be recommended for patients, suffering from diabetes,
      atherosclerosis, obesity and hypertension.<br>

      A new method enables scientists to create large, inexpensive and
      flexible surfaces that can emit light in the same way as an OLED
      TV screen. This could result in luminous clothes, glowing
      wallpaper and even radiant cereal packets.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Scientists have come up with a method for creating light-emitting
      surfaces using method that’s similar to the one used for printing
      newspapers. The picture shows flexible light sheets fabricated
      using the so-called roll-to-roll coating method. <br>
      <br>
      Genesis 1:3 – And God said, "let there be light,” and there was
      light.<br>
      <br>
      Now Nordic scientists are invading God’s turf by reinventing
      light.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU),
      together with Swedish colleagues, have devised a new and simple
      method for creating luminous surfaces with LECs (Light-emitting
      Electrochemical Cells).<br>
      <br>
      The new surfaces are flexible, inexpensive and can be produced in
      great sizes.<br>
      <br>
      This could revolutionise the future and give light in places we
      would normally never have thought possible.<br>
      <br>
      “What’s new about our invention is that we can fabricate
      light-emitting devices using roll-to-roll coating methods, which
      are similar to the way newspapers are produced,” says Henrik Friis
      Dam, a PhD student at DTU Energy Conversion, who together with
      Swedish colleagues invented the new method.<br>
      <br>
      “This makes the production of large light-emitting surfaces
      cheaper than could ever be achieved with e.g. OLED, which is used
      in some types of TV screens.”<br>
      <br>
      The invention has been published in the journal Nature
      Communications.<br>
      <br>
      <b>LEC can make clothes glow</b><br>
      <br>
      Due to its low production costs and its potentially unlimited
      size, surfaces with LEC can be used for rethinking the use of
      light.<br>
      <br>
      OLEDs are a variant of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), in which the
      top layer is a thin organic layer consisting of compounds of
      carbon, rather than an actual diode (pictured). This means that
      OLEDs can be made much thinner than is possible with LED. LED was
      introduced in TVs in 2009, but TV manufacturers have already
      started working on the next generation of displays with OLED,
      which provide a significantly improved viewer experience on a
      paper-thin TV. (Photo: PiccoloNamek)<br>
      <br>
      The researchers reckon that LECs can for instance be used to make
      glowing wallpaper and radiant traffic signs.<br>
      <br>
      It’s also conceivable that LECs can be used for making luminous
      clothing or to light up the inside of e.g. cereal packets,
      enabling people to see the contents in the dark.<br>
      <br>
      “With LEC, we can create completely new kinds of indoor and
      outdoor lighting. It’s also cheap and environmentally friendly to
      manufacture,” says Dam.<br>
      <br>
      <b>LEC overtakes OLED on the inside</b><br>
      <br>
      It’s long been hoped that the size of OLEDs (Organic Light
      Emitting Diodes) could be scaled up from television size to
      something much bigger.<br>
      <br>
      There has been no shortage of attempts to do so, but so far all
      attempts have failed. The problem with OLEDs is that they are
      costly and difficult to fabricate.<br>
      <br>
      The materials used for producing OLEDs are sensitive to substances
      such as air and water, which is why OLEDs invariably depend on the
      use of one or more time- and energy-consuming process steps under
      vacuum.<br>
      <br>
      The OLEDs also depend on an extremely controlled and uniform
      thickness to function.<br>
      <br>
      Against this background, it is natural to replace OLED with
      something new and less sensitive, say the researchers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>LEC can replace OLED</b><br>
      <br>
      Unlike OLEDs, LECs are notably less sensitive to thickness, oxygen
      and water. This means that LECs can be produced relatively easily
      and cheaply using the same technique used for printing newspapers
      – the so-called roll-to-roll coating method.<br>
      <br>
      LEC will be replacing OLED in future applications where size and
      price are important parameters – maybe as early as five to ten
      years from now.<br>
      <br>
      “With the roll-to-roll method, a liquid runs out of a crack down
      on the material you want to print it on.<br>
      <br>
      This could for instance be a transparent plastic sheet,” says Dam.<br>
      <br>
      “Since LEC screens don’t depend on the thickness in the same way
      as OLEDs do, much less precision is required in the manufacturing
      of it.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Successful trials, but some way yet to go</b><br>
      <br>
      The researchers have already put their new method to the test, and
      they have succeeded in creating luminous plastic.<br>
      <br>
      However, with a pixel size of 2 x 2 mm and a unit size of 1 x 4
      cm, we shouldn’t expect to see glowing wallpaper in the immediate
      future.<br>
      <br>
      ”I admit that our efficiency is not yet ideal. My Swedish
      colleagues are continuing to improve the resolution, size and
      efficiency, but we’ve shown that it’s possible.<br>
      <br>
      “LEC will be replacing OLED in future applications where size and
      price are important parameters – maybe as early as five to ten
      years from now,” says Dam.<br>

            coating</b></big><br>
        <br>
        <div align="left">The grand vision of manufacturing large-area
          emissive devices with low-cost roll-to-roll coating methods,
          akin to how newspapers are produced, appeared with the
          emergence of the organic light-emitting diode about 20 years
          ago. Today, small organic light-emitting diode displays are
          commercially available in smartphones, but the promise of a
          continuous ambient fabrication has unfortunately not
          materialized yet, as organic light-emitting diodes invariably
          depend on the use of one or more time- and energy-consuming
          process steps under vacuum. Here we report an
          all-solution-based fabrication of an alternative emissive
          device, a light-emitting electrochemical cell, using a
          slot-die roll-coating apparatus. The fabricated flexible
          sheets exhibit bidirectional and uniform light emission, and
          feature a fault-tolerant &gt;1-µm-thick active material that
          is doped in situ during operation. It is notable that the
          initial preparation of inks, the subsequent coating of the
          constituent layers and the final device operation all could be
          executed under ambient air.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] There is a need for materials for biomedical applications,
      especially in the field of tissue engineering.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0004] As described herein, biopolymer-based nanocomposites can be
      used, e.g., to replace synthetic polymer composites for various
      biomedical applications. This is because, e.g., many biopolymers
      are biocompatible and biodegradable. In the present work, a
      biopolymer-based nanocomposite including chitosan, montmorillonite
      (MMT) and hydroxyapatite (HAP) was developed. Such a composite is
      useful, e.g., for biomedical applications. The composite was
      prepared from chitosan, unmodified MMT, and HAP precipitate in
      aqueous media. The properties of the composites were investigated
      using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared
      spectroscopy (FTIR), atomic force microscopy (AFM),
      thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and nanoindentation. The
      biocompatibilities of the composites were investigated by seeding
      samples with osteoblasts. The XRD results reveal that an
      intercalated structure was formed with an increase in d-spacing.
      FTIR studies provide evidence of molecular interaction among the
      three different constituents of the composite. AFM images indicate
      a microstructure with well distributed nanoparticles in the
      chitosan matrix. The composites also exhibit a significant
      enhancement in nanomechanical property as compared to pure
      chitosan. The TGA results indicate that an intercalated
      nanocomposite was formed with improved thermal property. Cell
      culture test results indicated that MMT and MMT/HAP composites are
      highly biocompatible. From all these results it is concluded that
      the composites are useful for various biomedical applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Accordingly, certain embodiments of the present invention
      provide composite materials that comprise chitosan,
      montmorillonite, and hydroxyapatite, useful, e.g., for bone tissue
      engineering.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In some embodiments of the invention, the composite can be
      prepared by dispersing montmorillonite, e.g., unmodified
      montmorillonite, in a chitosan solution and by adding
      hydroxyapatite precipitate to the solution....<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Preparation of Hydroxyapatite</b><br>
      <br>
      [0061] Hydroxyapatite was prepared by wet precipitation method
      (Saeria et al., Mater Lett, 57, 4064-4069). 7.2 mM solution of
      Na2HPO4 was made in DI water. In another beaker, 12 mM solution of
      CaCl2 was made using DI water. Then 200 ml of CaCl2 solution was
      added slowly through a pipette to IL solution of Na2HPO4 with
      continuous stirring. The solution was adjusted to 7.4 pH using
      NaOH. After mixing the precipitate was allowed to settle down for
      24 hours. This precipitate was used to prepare the composites. All
      the experiments were done at room temperature.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Preparation of Composites</b><br>
      <br>
      [0062] 4.5 gm (90 wt %) of chitosan was dissolved in 225 ml of 1%
      acetic acid solution. 0.5 gm (10 wt %) of MMT was dispersed in 15
      ml of DI water. The MMT suspension was added to the chitosan
      solution and the solution was continuously stirred for overnight
      to obtain a good dispersion of clay in chitosan. This solution was
      then poured into a Petri dish and dried in an oven at 80[deg.] C.
      for 48 hours to form thin sheets. This composite was designated as
      chi/MMT.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] For synthesizing chitosan and hydroxyapatite composites, 40
      wt % of freshly prepared HAP precipitate was added to 60 wt % of
      chitosan solution followed by the same procedure as for chi/MMT
      composite. This composite was named as chi/HAP.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Similarly, for making chitosan, MMT and HAP composites
      first 50 wt % of chitosan solution was made. Then 10 wt % of MMT
      suspension was added to it followed by 40 wt % of HAP precipitate.
      After this again the same procedure as mentioned earlier was
      followed to make thin sheets of chi/MMT/HAP composites. Pure
      chitosan sheets were also made in the same way in order to compare
      with these composites. All the sheets were characterized using
      different characterization tools...<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Thus, clay has been successfully intercalated with an amino
      acid. This intercalation is demonstrated, e.g., using XRD. This
      modified clay can be used, e.g., in biopolymer-clay-hydroxyapatite
      nanocomposite scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. For example,
      the clay can be incorporated with hydroxyapatite into a polymer
      solution using a sonicator. A composite of this formulation can
      then be prepared using freeze drying, or electrospinning fibers.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Magnesium can Stop Blindness</b></big><br>
      </div>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Food rich in magnesium reduced the risk of developing diabetic
      retinopathy, glaucoma and cataracts. Also helps to combat aging
      and PMS.<br>
      <br>
      The food of the Brazilian is all wrong. Only 17% of the population
      consume the 400 grams recommended by WHO (World Health
      Organization) of fruits, vegetables and greens, as surveyed by the
      Ministry of Health. Outcome: no magnesium in our diet that
      protects the eyes and carries out more 300 vital metabolic
      functions.<br>
      <br>
      Just to give you an idea, a recent study published in the British
      Medical Journal shows that eating an extra portion and a half of
      green vegetables, an important source of magnesium, reduces by 14%
      the risk of contracting diabetes. A meta-analysis at the Institute
      of Metabolic Science in Cambridge (UK) shows that a diet rich in
      magnesium lowers blood pressure and the level of glucose in the
      blood. Therefore, it may deter the development of diabetic
      retinopathy, a major cause of blindness.<br>
      <br>
      According to the Institute ophthalmologists, Penido Burnier and
      Leoncio Queiroz Neto, the disease affects 75% of the 10 million
      Brazilians who are diabetic and in most cases leads to loss of
      vision. Although studies are not conclusive, the expert claims
      that the nutrient is essential for eye health. For example, he
      says, it acts as a blocker of calcium deposits on the inner walls
      of arteries. "These deposits cause the formation of neovessels
      that hinder the nutrition of the retina and leads to the death of
      its cells, the main characteristic of diabetic retinopathy" he
      explains. In addition to preventing calcification of arteries and
      vessels, he highlights, magnesium hinders the production of a
      potent vasoconstrictor, endothelin-1. So, those who have a diet
      low in magnesium are more likely to contract hypertension and
      primary open-angle glaucoma, due to the lower blood flow to the
      head of the optic nerve.<br>
      <br>
      The problems of nutritional deficiency do not stop there. The
      expert says that magnesium helps the absorption of vitamins E, C
      and B, essential nutrients for the health of the ocular tissues
      and other organs. It also protects against oxidative stress that
      can cause early cataracts, serious skin aging and the symptoms of
      PMS (premenstrual tension) among women, he says.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Signs of Deficiency and Sources</b><br>
      <br>
      The main signs of magnesium deficit are listed by the physician:<br>
      <br>
      Tremor in hands or eyelids<br>
      Cramping and involuntary movements in the face<br>
      Insomnia<br>
      Weakness<br>
      Tachycardia<br>
      Loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting.<br>
      <br>
      He says these discomforts do not appear simultaneously and may
      still be associated with other health concerms. Adopting
      supplementation on your own, should not even be considered.
      Queiroz Neto explains that the absorption of magnesium and calcium
      are compete. Therefore, consumption must be combined. Moreover,
      supplementation requires medical supervision because excess can
      cause drops in blood pressure, changes in bone calcification and
      respiratory problems.<br>
      <br>
      The main sources of magnesium are: leafy greens, seafood, nuts and
      whole grains.<br>
      <br>
      Diabetic retinopathy is seen only in its advanced stages<br>
      <br>
      There are no symptoms in its early stages. Diabetic retinopathy is
      the death of retinal cells, an ocular membrane eye where images
      are processed. The specialist says that half of the patients
      seeking their first consultation already have their visual acuity
      significantly compromised. The problem, he says, is that you
      cannot recover lost vision. To stop the evolution, it can be
      treated with laser applications for drying neovascularization,
      administration of anti-inflammatory drugs or surgery in more
      advanced cases.<br>
      <br>
      Half of the glaucomatous lose vision in one eye<br>
      <br>
      The glaucoma is also asymptomatic. This makes the those affected
      have similar behavior to that of patients affected by diabetic
      retinopathy.<br>
      <br>
      A disease characterized by loss of visual field is the second
      leading cause of blindness worldwide. The doctor says that the
      difficulty occurs when the outflow of aqueous humor, the fluid
      that fills the eyeball, causes the death of cells in the retina
      and optic nerve head. "It is common in glaucomatous to make their
      first visit after having lost sight in one eye or half of the
      axioms of the optic nerve that are unrecoverable" he says.
      Treatment is done with eyedrops, laser applications and,
      ultimately, surgery.<br>
      <br>
      Cataracts can be associated with habits<br>
      <br>
      Cataracts, the largest cause of treatable blindness, is the
      clouding of the lens, the natural lens of the eye responsible for
      focusing images on the retina. It is generally associated with
      aging. According to him, it may occur early due to nutritional
      deficiency, excessive sun exposure or trauma. To eliminate the
      disease, the only treatment is surgery that replaces the cloudy
      lens by an intraocular lens. Surgery is more advanced in recent
      years. So much so that it now allows a person over 60 years of age
      to see the same as another who is 20 years old. The increase of
      glucose into the blood in patients with diabetes makes the eyes
      become more vulnerable. To preserve vision, an ophthalmologist
      should be consulted annually or whenever a change of any type is
      perceived.<br>

      A group of researchers have figured out how to produce graphene
      using a DVD drive &lt;http://vimeo.com/51873011&gt;. This
      discovery helps clear thepath for mass production of the substance
      &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene&gt;, which was
      discovered in the late 1980's. More recently, the 2010 Nobel Prize
      for Physics was awarded to a team that produced two-dimensional
      graphene; a substance one just atom thick. One method of doing so
      used Scotch tape and is mentioned in<br>
      the video after the break as a technique that works but is not
      feasible for large-scale production.<br>
      <br>
      The process seen here starts with graphite oxide because it can be
      suspended in water. This allows a lab technician to evenly
      distribute the substance on a plastic surface. Note the use of
      optical discs. The second part of the process involves hitting the
      dried layer of graphite oxide with a laser. It just so happens
      that this can be done with a consumer DVD drive. The result is
      graphene that can be used in circuits and may have potential as a
      fantastic super-capacitor.<br>

      As near as I can tell, not much. They attach a thin PET substrate
      to the CD, drop on an aqueous graphite oxide solution,<br>
      presumably let it dry, put the resulting CD/PET/GO disc into the
      LightScribe DVD player, and at the end peel off the PET substrate
      with attached graphene layer. They use GO because it’s water
      soluble, so I suspect they wash it off, then cut up the PET to
      separate the graphene parts.<br>

      This is an exciting development, but perhaps a little out of the
      typical hobbyist’s league. I researched the papers when they first
      came out. Graphitic oxide is not generally available and ‘kinda
      tough to make.<br>
      <br>
      Reading the papers, IIRC (correct me if I’m wrong – it’s been
      awhile) they synthesized graphitic oxide and then made a few
      passes which “seived” out large granules in their product. It took
      several rounds and several days to get a solution fine enough to
      use for this process, and they had the equipment and expertise to
      measure the granularity.<br>
      <br>
      None of this is impossible, but my take is that it is beyond the
      reach of a casual hobbyist. One of the Chemist hobbyists on
      YouTube perhaps, but not something you can just cook up in your
      kitchen.<br>

      Bottles of aqueous graphene oxide can be purchased online these
      days, it’s not as difficult as it used to be to make, at least not
      for chemical supply companies. It’s still expensive but it is
      within reach.<br>

      So if the step of making your own GO is skipped, reading over the
      technical details, it’s possible to make this in a home lab. I
      read that the material is fairly flexible as to which electrolyte
      is used, so perhaps it is possible?<br>

      They use LightScribe (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LightScribe) as
      the technology for writing a grey-scale image to the disk. It
      requires special hardware and software, but both are readily
      available.<br>

      Stoutlimb says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      December 21, 2012<br>
      <br>
      From what I read, the thin plastic substrate is the insulator, and
      they sandwich the two open face treated graphene oxide sheets with
      a gel electrolyte compound between them so that the gel keeps the
      two graphene oxide sheets from making electrical contact.<br>

      Not a major issue. You can buy graphitic oxide 175ml for 100
      dollars<br>

      One of the papers I read told of Chinese researchers conducting
      the experiment using the flash adapter from a camera.<br>
      <br>
      They made an opaque stencil pattern, laid it on the deposited
      graphitic oxide, and &gt;FLASH&lt; instant graphene.<br>
      <br>
      From the description, anyone could do that step in the process.<br>
      <br>
      That's what the DVD burner is doing, really. They aren't using the
      DVD reading laser, they are using the "cover art burning" laser
      found in LightScribe drives. I would expect that any X-Y table
      with a relatively low-power laser head could scribe the patterns.<br>

      Blaise Pascal says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      According to their paper in Science (available at<br>
      <b>http://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/laser-scribing-of-high-performance-and-flexible-graphene-based-electrochemical-capacitors.pdf</b>
      )<br>
      <br>
      "...they made and tested multiple designs.<br>
      <br>
      The substrate was PET, which they drop-cast a thin layer of GO.
      For one design, they used an ion porous separator (Celgard 3501)
      as the separator and an aqueous electrolyte of 1M H3PO4
      (phosphoric acid). For another design, they used a polymer gel
      made from PVA and H3PO4, which acted as both an electrolyte and a
      separator. The two forms performed similarly, with about 1V
      maximum voltage, around 0.3 F/cm^3 capacitance at a current
      density of around 100mA/cm^2.<br>
      <br>
      They also tried using an organic electrolyte, tetraethylammonium
      tetrafluoroborate dissolved in acetonitrile, and achieved higher
      energy densities, as well as a 3V operating range. Another
      prototype used a “room temperature ionic liquid” (whatever that
      means), specifically 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
      tetrafluoroborate, that had the best performance of all, as well
      as a 4V operating range.<br>

      <br>
      Enville TN - George Mitchell expected to go back to work as a
      mill-wright welder after back surgery in 1992.<br>
      <br>
      But he never went back.&nbsp; He took the advice of his general
      practitioner, Reggie Henderson in Lexington, "He said, 'You've got
      a brain. Put it to use. Forget your back."<br>
      <br>
      While Mitchell was recuperating he saw a show about a Japanese man
      who invented a cellular phone that used magnetic repulsion instead
      of a battery, which gave him an idea for a creation of his own.<br>
      <br>
      "He said to me "I can make this so much better'" Mitchell's wife,
      Donna said.<br>
      <br>
      The Mitchell's then purchased miniature wheels - much like Ferris
      wheels 0 used by parakeets and shower curtains.<br>
      <br>
      He removed the magnets from the shower curtains and attached them
      to each end of the seats on the wheels, creating new magnetic
      repulsion wheels to produce clean electric power.&nbsp; Thus, his
      invention generates electrical power.<br>
      <br>
      "I didn't understand it," said Donna Mitchell who helped her
      husband file the patent application for the invention "Men and
      women speak a different language.&nbsp; I didn't care that much
      about mechanics."<br>
      <br>
      "I couldn't comprehend. All magnets were to me was that they stuck
      tot he refrigerator... It took many conversations and tapes (about
      magnetic repulsion)."<br>
      <br>
      George Mitchell called the National Aeronautics and Space
      Administration to see if it would be interested in a new
      electrical system.&nbsp; He was invited to Huntsville, Ala., on
      May 22, 1997.&nbsp; NASA told him he invented a magnetic bearing
      and toy, which could be used as a learning tool in engineering.<br>
      <br>
      "They wanted to see if all of them (wheels) were running together
      and how fast the revolutions per minute were," Mitchell said.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Mitchell's invention ran 1,100 rpms.</b><br>
      <br>
      NASA also wanted to see his paperwork and designs on the
      invention.&nbsp; He refused, because he was afraid NASA would
      steal the idea.<br>
      <br>
      Mitchell's patent is pending, but his invention is protected. His
      goal is to hook up his home with the generator and then go
      commercial.&nbsp; He said a state law allows a person to provide
      his own electricity and receive money back for any excess.<br>
      <br>
      "We're so hooked on fossil fuels when we don't have to be," said
      Mitchell, who would like to make a car that does not pollute.<br>
      <br>
      "We could feed our people and then some," Donna Mitchell added.<br>
      <br>
      Mitchell's inspiration has been inventors, Albert Einstein Nicola
      Tesla.&nbsp; The deaths of his father, mother-in-law, two cats and
      a dog also inspired him, he said.<br>
      <br>
      "I think the stress activated some chemical in the brain that
      innovated the invention," He said.<br>

      ENVILLE - The light finally came on.<br>
      <br>
      It was a night last March - George Mitchell kicks himself for not
      marking down the date. After years of trying and spending, his
      magnetic device finally turned on the light he had wired to it on
      a kitchen table.<br>
      <br>
      He woke up his wife, Donna, and brought her to the kitchen. They
      hugged.<br>
      <br>
      Then, the magnets flew off.<br>
      <br>
      He had hollowed out the rubber in lawnmower tires, glued the
      magnets inside, duct-taped over the wheel and attached it to a
      battery-powered motor. But as the wheels spun, some of the magnets
      broke through the tape and began to bullet through the kitchen.<br>
      <br>
      One left an indention on the ceiling; another split Donna's hair
      and got glue in it.<br>
      <br>
      "George," Donna told him, "no more in the house."<br>
      <br>
      Now his machine - with a bigger motor and aluminum parts replacing
      the lawnmower wheels - is in the back of a wood-paneled station
      wagon parked outside his house near Enville, a small town split
      between Chester and McNairy counties. The machine can power on two
      car headlamps propped behind it within a few minutes.<br>
      <br>
      Mitchell, an amateur inventor, sees the power his machine
      generates as a new, cleaner form of alternative energy, but he has
      faced setbacks and skepticism in the nearly decade and a half
      since his first homemade breakthrough.<br>
      <br>
      Despite the troubles, he keeps working toward bigger plans and
      says he is hopeful that people - like the lights plugged into his
      machine - will eventually turn on to his inventions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Sudden inspiration</b><br>
      <br>
      Mitchell has no college degree or formal scientific training,
      though he says he has been known to watch science shows on
      television deep into the night.<br>
      <br>
      A conversation with him about his inventions is equal parts
      wide-eyed profession of his passion for science and impassioned
      explanation of the patriotic philosophy that underpins his work.<br>
      <br>
      Finding better forms of energy requires open-minded urgency, but
      he thinks Americans can do it, he says.<br>
      <br>
      "We're the best when we get our backs up against the wall,"
      Mitchell said. "Our creativity, our ideas, just come pouring out."<br>
      <br>
      Now 53, he remembers playing with magnets when he was young,
      feeling the pull and repulsion they can generate with his hands.
      While attending junior high school in Jackson, he won a science
      fair for a mockup of an atom.<br>
      <br>
      He eventually found his way into professional welding, but back
      problems stifled that career in the early 1990s.<br>
      <br>
      His work as an inventor started as he coped with his injury and a
      spate of deaths in the mid-1990s. Within a short time, he lost his
      father, his mother-in-law - whom he describes as a dear friend -
      and a couple of pets.<br>
      <br>
      A doctor had told Mitchell to find a way to take his mind off his
      injury, and he found it while watching a cable news report about a
      Japanese man who tried to use magnets to power cell phones.<br>
      <br>
      A realization burst open in his mind.<br>
      <br>
      Mitchell says the idea must have come from God, who he thinks felt
      bad for him and wanted to give him something worthwhile to work
      on.<br>
      <br>
      "I thought about Ferris wheels, taking out the seats and replacing
      them with magnets," he said.<br>
      <br>
      Mitchell hurried to the store and bought several shower curtains
      and small, neon-colored plastic wheels meant to be parakeet toys.<br>
      <br>
      He cut out magnets meant to hold the shower curtains in place and
      attached them to the wheels, arranging them so that, when placed
      beside another wheel rigged as such, the magnets pushed against
      another magnet's opposing side.<br>
      <br>
      He attached a hand crank to one of the wheels and turned it. When
      he did, the repulsion caused by the magnets made the other wheels
      turn. He re-purposed the motor of a card-dealing machine powered
      by two AA batteries to replace the hand crank.<br>
      <br>
      His new machine, fine-tuned since its first success, is
      essentially a larger-scale version of his original design: A motor
      powered by a car battery spins an aluminum wheel that holds six
      square magnets - smooth, copper-colored and about the size and
      thickness of a candy-box chocolate - fastened along its outer
      edge.<br>
      <br>
      The force of those magnets cause identical wheels placed on both
      sides of the motor-powered wheel to spin, powering generators that
      turn on the two headlamps.<br>
      <br>
      Soon after finishing the first machine, Mitchell called NASA
      officials to ask them if they were interested in a new way of
      producing energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Setbacks</b><br>
      <br>
      Mitchell has said he's been frustrated with federal officials
      ranging from former Vice President Al Gore to U.S. Sen. John
      McCain. He said he wrote to President Barack Obama's campaign a
      few times before he was elected president last year but has never
      heard back.<br>
      <br>
      NASA officials invited him to demonstrate his first invention at
      the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., but were
      skeptical of the workings and usefulness of his device, Mitchell
      said.<br>
      <br>
      His work got media attention from as far away as California, but
      he has struggled since the 1990s getting support to expand his
      work, he said. He said he has applied for federal grants but has
      always been turned down.<br>
      <br>
      It took a decade to make significant progress in the next phase of
      his work - to expand his invention so that it could power the
      Mitchells' house in Enville. What was needed to make his new
      machine was expensive, and local businesses seemed reluctant to
      work with him to make his parts.<br>
      <br>
      "I'm like, 'Do I have some sort of virus or something?'" he said.<br>
      <br>
      Ed Gibson is a Milledgeville machinist who eventually helped make
      aluminum wheels for Mitchell's new machine.<br>
      <br>
      He said he thinks machinists have dealt with inventors in the past
      whose machines are unlikely to work. "I hate to take people's
      money and it turn out to be a flop," Gibson said.<br>
      <br>
      When Mitchell first approached him, Gibson said he was skeptical
      of the execution of his device and reluctant to help. He said when
      Mitchell recently returned to him, he seemed to have the operation
      of his machine better charted out than he did before.<br>
      <br>
      "That makes a lot of difference," Gibson said. "... (Potential
      danger) was one of the problems I had with it to begin (with). He
      was liable to kill somebody with it and they were likely to charge
      me with it."<br>
      <br>
      When officials rejected his grant applications, Donna Mitchell
      said they told George he was trying to build something
      scientifically impossible - a perpetual motion machine.<br>
      <br>
      Donna said that at times the stress he put himself through to make
      his machine operate made her hope he would give up.<br>
      <br>
      "There's been a couple of times when it's been on his mind so
      much," said Donna, who is 57. "I never told him I wanted him to
      quit, but there were times when it was too stressful or too
      whatever to be thinking about."<br>
      <br>
      She said that last year, after failing to get publicity and
      support for his project, George became extremely discouraged.<br>
      <br>
      "He just put it away," she said. "Something was said about it - I
      don't know if I mentioned it or he mentioned it. We were
      discussing about how you're going to (have to) prove it if anyone
      was going to be interested in it. You were going to have to turn
      on the light."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Looking ahead</b><br>
      <br>
      Finally, in March, George Mitchell got the light to come on -
      dangerous flying magnets and all.<br>
      <br>
      Attention has still been hard to come by, but despite the
      setbacks, Mitchell foresees a world where energy produced by
      machines like his is common place. In explaining how his latest
      invention works, he talks about replacing a magnet on an energy
      machine being as common one day as a repairman working on a broken
      heat pump.<br>
      <br>
      He still plans on building a machine that can power his house. He
      and a mechanic in Adamsville also have plans to build an electric
      car someday, Mitchell said.<br>
      <br>
      Until then, he keeps tweaking his latest device, working deep into
      the night.<br>

      <br>
      Did you know that there is a direct correlation between the
      incidence of arthritis and a deficiency of the trace mineral boron
      in the body? Research regarding the trace mineral boron and its
      connection to arthritis is finally starting to see the light of
      day! <br>
      <br>
      In a startling discovery, research conducted by Prof. Roger
      Wyburn-Mason (MD, PhD) identified an amoebae that parasitizes
      (infests) the joints of those people with rheumatoid arthritis.
      “In 1975, at the IXth International Chemotherapy Congress in
      London, England, the late (1983) Roger Wybum-Mason (M.D.,
      M.R.C.P., B. Chir., M.A., Ph.D.) astounded the medical world,
      announcing that he had found a new protozoon as the cause of
      Rheumatoid Disease.”<br>
      <br>
      Continuing with Prof. Wyburn-Mason’s work was Dr. Rex E. Newnham
      (PhD, DO and ND), an osteopathic doctor and naturopath, and author
      of “Beating Arthritis and Beating Osteoporosis”. What he found was
      amazing… <br>
      <br>
      Boron killed the amoebae that Prof. Wyburn-Mason had identified!<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Newnham also found quite a bit of evidence relating the
      correlation of boron concentration in certain geographical areas
      and the development of not just rheumatoid arthritis, but common
      arthritis as well. He found that in certain areas of Australia,
      where drinking water contained high levels of boron, there were no
      incidence of arthritis in humans and animals!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Incidence of Arthritis Depended Upon Boron</b><br>
      <br>
      Interestingly, the correlation between arthritis and boron was
      found in other areas as well.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Newnham found that in Israel, where boron is in high
      concentration in the soil, the incidence of arthritis was as low
      as 1-7%.<br>
      <br>
      Compared to the U.S., New Zealand and other parts of Australia
      where the concentration of boron is moderate, the incidence of
      arthritis is higher; 20-40%.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast, areas such as Jamaica where boron levels are
      extremely small, the incidence of arthritis is very high, reaching
      upwards to 70%.<br>
      <br>
      In conclusion, worldwide evidence is now starting to link low
      intake of boron with increased levels of arthritis — proof that
      arthritis is a symptom of nutritional deficiencies and not simply
      a “normal” process of aging, as the medical industry would have us
      believe.<br>
      <br>
      Now isn’t that interesting?!<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;With millions of people suffering from arthritis in the
      United States alone, maybe it’s time to start giving the trace
      mineral boron some attention, instead of just symptom-suppressing
      pharmaceuticals.<br>
      <br>
      Foods high in boron include: almonds, walnuts, avocados, broccoli,
      potatoes, pears, prunes, honey, oranges, onions, chick peas,
      carrots, beans, bananas, red grapes, red apples and raisins.<br>

      <b>From the editor….</b><br>
      <br>
      In the age of big-pharma, Dr. Michelle Kmiec’s take on health and
      healthcare is refreshing – to say the least. And her book
      ‘Healthcare Freedom Revolution: Exposing the Lies, Deceit and
      Greed of the Medical Profession’ is a unique publication that
      busts long-standing health myths in a straight forward way, and
      reveals how you can regain control of your health… regardless of
      what “they” may have told you.<br>
      <br>
      In telling her story, Dr. Michelle doesn’t pull any punches. And
      why should she? Ten years ago she was desperately sick with
      autoimmune and neurological symptoms, and the medical profession
      offered her nothing but prescription drugs and outrageous
      “healthcare” bills. Not willing to accept that as her future, Dr.
      Kmiec decided that if she was going to be healthy again, she would
      have to find the answers herself. That’s when her amazing journey
      began…<br>
      <br>
      Despite all her struggles and fears, Dr. Michelle regained her
      health completely – a result of natural means and sheer
      perseverance. And in the process, her research led her to discover
      just how corrupt the medical industry has become — an industry she
      describes as a ‘Big Pharma monopoly’.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Kmiec has now made it her personal mission in life to share
      her story, and hopes to help people find real answers to their
      healthcare needs as well as offering something very valuable to
      those in ill health… hope.<br>

            anti-aging properties</b></big><br>
        <br>
        <i>Who knew the Fountain of Youth would turn out to be an
          alcoholic beverage?</i><br>
        <br>
        <b>by</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Bryan Nelson</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      When Spanish explorer Ponce de León went looking for the Fountain
      of Youth, he probably didn't expect it to contain 5 percent
      alcohol, let alone that it would eventually be found in Japan. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      But according to claims made by the Japanese brewery Suntory, the
      Fountain of Youth can apparently be found in the form of beer,
      reports Popular Science. A new brew called "Precious" can make you
      younger and prettier with every sip, at least according to
      advertisements. And they don't mean because of beer goggles.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The beer contains collagen, a protein normally found in connective
      tissues that is believed by some to have anti-aging properties.
      The claims aren't entirely unfounded. Collagen levels decrease as
      we age, and the reduction of this protein can cause wrinkles to
      form. A 2014 study found that women who took 2.5 grams of a
      particular hydrolyzed collagen peptide (known as the brand name
      Verisol) once a day showed a 20 percent reduction in wrinkle depth
      around their eyes after eight weeks. Even so, most of the science
      on collagen is ambiguous at best.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Whether consuming collagen in the form of beer can make you look
      younger is certainly unproven, in spite of Suntory's claims. And
      there's more than enough reason to be skeptical. According to
      Gunma University nutrition scientist Kuniko Takahashi, “good
      protein contains sufficient amounts of all kinds of essential
      amino acids, and most animal protein falls into this category.
      Collagen is no better than average as a protein.”<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Regardless of what the science says about collagen, however, the
      Japanese beauty industry has become nothing short of
      collagen-crazed. Many Japanese women believe that using
      collagen-rich supplements, powders and foods can make their
      wrinkles disappear, and the list of products that cater to this
      belief continues to grow. The fact that this fad has even reached
      into the world of beer is amusing, but hardly surprising. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The official commercial for the beverage features model Anne
      Nakamura and comedian Ken Watanabe, who claims, “Guys can tell if
      a girl’s taking collagen or not!” You can watch the advertisement

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Dietary consumption of food supplements has been found to modulate
      skin functions and can therefore be useful in the treatment of
      skin aging. However, there is only a limited number of clinical
      studies supporting these claims. In this double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study, the effectiveness of the specific
      bioactive collagen peptide (BCP) VERISOL® on eye wrinkle formation
      and stimulation of procollagen I, elastin and fibrillin
      biosynthesis in the skin was assessed. A hundred and fourteen
      women aged 45-65 years were randomized to receive 2.5 g of BCP or
      placebo, once daily for 8 weeks, with 57 subjects being allocated
      to each treatment group. Skin wrinkles were objectively measured
      in all subjects, before starting the treatment, after 4 and 8
      weeks as well as 4 weeks after the last intake (4-week regression
      phase). A subgroup was established for suction blister biopsies
      analyzing procollagen I, elastin and fibrillin at the beginning of
      the treatment and after 8 weeks of intake. The ingestion of the
      specific BCP used in this study promoted a statistically
      significant reduction of eye wrinkle volume (p &lt; 0.05) in
      comparison to the placebo group after 4 and 8 weeks (20%) of
      intake. Moreover a positive long-lasting effect was observed 4
      weeks after the last BCP administration (p &lt; 0.05).
      Additionally, after 8 weeks of intake a statistically
      significantly higher content of procollagen type I (65%) and
      elastin (18%) in the BCP-treated volunteers compared to the
      placebo-treated patients was detected. For fibrillin, a 6%
      increase could be determined after BCP treatment compared to the
      placebo, but this effect failed to reach the level of statistical
      significance. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that the
      oral intake of specific bioactive collagen peptides (Verisol®)
      reduced skin wrinkles and had positive effects on dermal matrix
      synthesis.<br>

      occurring growth factors, synthetic growth factors, an active
      peptide segments of naturally occurring or synthetic growth
      factors, cell adhesion molecules, anti-adhesion molecule and
      mixture thereof is introduced into human or animal scar tissue or
      a tissue adjacent to the scar tissue. Further, the remedial
      composition includes a biodegradable or nonbiodegradable support
      matrix material (e.g. collagen) to continuously release the
      bioactive substance. The composition is especially effective for
      treating in case normal tissue function is impaired by presence of
      fibrous binding tissue or scar tissue, e.g. external teratosis,
      fiber scar tissue, adhesion, urinary stress incontinence,
      incontinence of the bowels or local myofunctional insufficiency.<br>

      <b>Method for preparing bioactive peptide of collagen from squid
        skin, and application</b><b><br>
      </b><b>CN101003827 </b><br>
      This invention discloses a method for preparing collagen active
      peptide from sleeve-fish skin. The method comprises: (1) washing
      sleeve-fish skin with clear water, soaking in NaOH aqueous
      solution, and washing repeatedly to neutrality; (2) soaking in
      diluted acid solution, and washing to neutrality; (3) extracting
      collagen in hot water under stirring, and filtering to remove
      insoluble substances; (4) adding enzyme, enzymolyzing at 40-50
      deg.C under stirring for 1-6 h, and killing enzyme at 90-100 deg.C
      for 4-10 min; (5) adjusting to neutrality with alkali solution,
      filtering, performing ultrafine filtration (molecular weight
      cutoff is 8 KD) and nanofiltration to desalt,
      vacuum-concentrating, and spray-drying. The method has such
      advantages as abundant sleeve-fish skin resources, high collagen
      content, simple process, low apparatus investment, and no
      pollution. The product has high bioactivity, and can be used to
      produce anti-oxidation, anti-hypertension, anti-atheroma or
      cosmetic healthcare food or medicine.<br>

            Breakwater</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A new type of breakwater consisting of nothing more than air
      bubbles recently was devices for quieting even the highest waves
      of the sea. It is the invention of Phillip Brasher, an American.
      One of the units is said to have been operated successfully at El
      Segundo, CA, to protect a concrete pier.<br>
      <br>
      The air breakwater consists of a perforated pipe that is laid
      along the sea bottom and connected with a land air-compressing
      station. In rough weather it is merely necessary to allow the
      compressed air to escape from the holes in the pipe, the air
      bubbles quickly rising to the surface. The wall of bubbles is said
      to break up the waves and retard their forward motion. When the
      water from a broken wave flows back to form a base for the next
      incoming wave, it finds no support and the next wave curls over
      and breaks.<br>
      <br>
      The repetition of this process is said to result in a smooth
      surface beyond the pipeline, no matter how rough the weather. A
      simple installation of the pipe system, the inventor says, is
      sufficient to provide a harbor of smooth water in exposed points
      around coasts that have caused trouble in the past. <br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Pump Up the Bass To Douse a Blaze: <br>
            Mason Students’ Invention Fights Fires</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A thumping bass may do more than light up a party—it could flat
      out extinguish it, thanks to a new sound-blasting fire
      extinguisher by George Mason University undergrads.<br>
      <br>
      The fire extinguisher uses low-frequency sound waves to douse a
      blaze. Engineering seniors Viet Tran and Seth Robertson now hold a
      preliminary patent application for their potentially
      revolutionizing device.<br>
      <br>
      The idea to fight fire with sound waves came when they were
      choosing a class project for ECE 492 and 493, Advanced Senior
      Design, where students produce and present a project for a final
      grade.<br>
      <br>
      Tran and Robertson’s 20-pound, Flash Gordon-style prototype was
      born through $600 of their own money and about as many trials.
      Their sound-wave device is free of toxic chemicals and eliminates
      collateral damage from sprinkler systems. If mounted on drones, it
      could improve safety for firefighters confronting large forest
      fires or urban blazes.<br>
      <br>
      “Fire also is a huge issue in space,” Tran says.<br>
      <br>
      “In space, extinguisher contents spread all over. But you can
      direct sound waves without gravity,” adds Robertson.<br>
      <br>
      Initially, both students thought big speakers and high frequencies
      would douse a fire.<br>
      <br>
      “But it’s low-frequency sounds — like the thump-thump bass in
      hip-hop that works,” says Tran, who joked that rappers like 50
      Cent could probably douse a fire, and that hip-hop celebrity
      endorsements might be just the ticket to hawk their fire
      extinguisher.<br>
      <br>
      It has taken time for their idea to catch on. In researching ideas
      for the class project, Tran learned that the Defense Advanced
      Research Projects Agency (DARPA) was working on the concept, and
      that West Georgia University was working on “Prometheus.” So Tran
      thought, “Why don’t we be the ones to make it happen?”<br>
      Seth Robertson and Viet Tran, electrical and computer engineering
      students, test their sound-blasting fire extinguisher prototype.

      <br>
      Robertson and Tran’s classmates said, “You guys will make us
      fail.” Several professors also threw cold water on their idea
      before they convinced Electrical and Computer Engineering
      Professor Brian Mark to mentor their project.<br>
      <br>
      “My initial impression was that it wouldn’t work,” he says. “Some
      students take the safe path, but Viet and Seth took the
      higher-risk option.”<br>
      <br>
      Mark knew nothing about fire extinguishers, so he took a wee step
      into the abyss himself.<br>
      <br>
      “They’re really special,” Mark says. “Viet is the idea man, and
      Seth is practical. At the final presentation, he wanted to use
      some fancy new presentation technology, but Seth convinced Tran to
      stick with a simple PowerPoint. They didn’t win the competition,
      but their presentation before a large audience was impressive.”<br>
      <br>
      The inventors make a powerful team. They met as freshmen. Tran, an
      admitted sub-stellar student in high school, and a pitiful
      culinary pupil who couldn’t tell a zucchini from a cucumber,
      learned study discipline from Robertson, a student athlete who
      mastered time management.<br>
      <br>
      “I’d wake up at six after we studied until three in the morning,
      and he’d already be at wrestling practice,” Tran says.<br>
      <br>
      Robertson works for the Department of Defense while studying, and
      he’s been offered a permanent position at Hanscom Air Force Base
      in Bedford, Mass. Tran has an internship at Zodiac Aerospace in
      Dulles with the promise of a full-time job upon graduation.<br>
      <br>
      Mason helped the inventors apply for a provisional patent.<br>
      <br>
      “The provisional patent application they filed gives them a year
      to talk publicly about the invention, to test the market and to
      determine whether pursuing the patent makes sense,” says Carolyn
      Klenner, intellectual property paralegal, in Mason’s Office of
      Technology Transfer, who assisted them with the patent
      application.<br>
      <br>

      ...Regarding the sound fire extinguisher, it reminded me of a few
      things.. one was your [ Norman Wootan ] demo at the Roundtable
      meeting where you and Bert I think sprayed negative ions on a
      napkin which refused to burn.<br>
      <br>
      Seems like you could blend the two, negative ion wind along with
      low freq sound...<br>
      <br>
      The second was this 1993 Electric Wind article on Keelynet;<br>

      <b>http://www.newphysics.se/archives/keelynet/ecology/elecwind.txt</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Here's an interesting bit of information, from the "Texas Co-Op
      Power" -&nbsp; Sept. 1993, issue, entitled "Israeli Electric Wind
      Extinguishes Fires".<br>
      <br>
      A novel, more&nbsp; environmentally&nbsp; sound method for
      extinguishing fires uses electricity instead of chemicals or
      water.<br>
      <br>
      The Technology, being&nbsp; marketed&nbsp; by&nbsp; a&nbsp;
      Tel-Aviv&nbsp; firm,&nbsp; directs&nbsp; an intense electrical
      field and/or gaseous plasma to&nbsp; the&nbsp; base&nbsp; of the
      fire.&nbsp; An "electric&nbsp; wind"&nbsp; cools&nbsp; the&nbsp;
      area&nbsp; in which combustion is occurring.&nbsp; The process
      also inhibits the fire's fuel supply.<br>
      <br>
      The technology should avoid some of&nbsp; the drawbacks of
      existing fire-fighting equipment, such as ozone damage to the
      environment, hazards to operating personnel,&nbsp; noise,&nbsp;
      and&nbsp; a&nbsp; high rate&nbsp; of&nbsp; costly&nbsp; fire
      alarms.<br>
      <br>
      A technical paper&nbsp; describing&nbsp; the new process was
      presented in late May by co-inventor Esther Jacobson to a meeting
      of the National Fire Prevention Association in Orlando.<br>
      <br>
      The equipment uses&nbsp; only&nbsp; 1000&nbsp; volts&nbsp;&nbsp;
      of&nbsp;&nbsp; electricity&nbsp; during&nbsp; an extinguishing
      operation, according to Jacobson.<br>
      <br>
      Spectrex Inc. of&nbsp;&nbsp; Cedar&nbsp; Grove,&nbsp; NJ,&nbsp;
      a&nbsp; subsidiary&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; Israel's Spectronix
      Ltd., is&nbsp; looking&nbsp; for a strategic partner in the U.S.
      to help it find suitable applications.<br>

      <b>http://www.sott.net/article/226530-Taming-the-flame-Electrical-wave-blaster-could-provide-new-way-to-extinguish-fires</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A 200-year-old observation that electricity can affect the shape
      of&nbsp; flames, making flames bend, twist, turn, flicker, and
      even snuffing them out. However, precious little research had been
      done over the years on the phenomenon.<br>
      <br>
      In the new study, they connected a powerful electrical amplifier
      to a wand-like probe and used the device to shoot beams of
      electricity at an open flame more than a foot high. Almost
      instantly, the flame was snuffed out. Much to their fascination,
      it worked time and again.<br>
      <br>
      The device consisted of a 600-watt amplifier, or about the same
      power as a high-end car stereo system. However, Cademartiri
      believes that a power source with only a tenth of this wattage
      could have similar flame-suppressing effect. That could be a boon
      to firefighters, since it would enable use of portable flame-tamer
      devices, which perhaps could be hand-carried or fit into a
      backpack.<br>
      <br>
      But how does it work? Cademartiri acknowledged that the phenomenon
      is complex with several effects occurring simultaneously. Among
      these effects, it appears that carbon particles, or soot,
      generated in the flame are key for its response to electric
      fields. Soot particles can easily become charged. The charged
      particles respond to the electric field, affecting the stability
      of flames, he said.<br>
      <br>
      "Combustion is first and foremost a chemical reaction - arguably
      one of the most important - but it's been somewhat neglected by
      most of the chemical community," said Cademartiri. "We're trying
      to get a more complete picture of this very complex interaction."<br>
      <br>
      Cademartiri envisions that futuristic electrical devices based on
      the phenomenon could be fixed on the ceilings of buildings or
      ships, similar to stationary water sprinklers now in use.
      Alternatively, firefighters might carry the flame-tamer in the
      form of a backpack and distribute the electricity to fires using a
      handheld wand. Such a device could be used, for instance, to make
      a path for firefighters to enter a fire or create an escape path
      for people to exit, he said.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      ... and it looks like this sound wave fire extinguisher has been
      discovered before :<br>
      <br>
      <b>https://keelynet.wordpress.com/2008/01/31/sound-waves-snuff-fire/</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      “In 1857, Irish scientist John Tyndall recognized that sound waves
      could extinguish flames. Now, scientists hope that phenomena could
      lead to the <br>
      development of new fire extinguishers that would be useful, say,
      in a spacecraft or terrestrially to avoid water damage from
      sprinklers.<br>
      <br>
      First though, they need to figure out why exactly sound can snuff
      fire. Most likely, the sound wave causes a drop in pressure that
      extinguishes the flame. From Scientific American: In 2004 Dmitriy
      Plaks and several of his fellow students at the University of West
      Georgia tested whether sound waves can douse fires in hopes of
      using sound to extinguish flames in a spacecraft.<br>
      <br>
      They placed a candle in a large topless chamber with three bass
      speakers attached to the walls. The candle was lit and the
      Canadian rock band Nickelback’s “How you remind me” was pumped
      through the subwoofers.<br>
      <br>
      Within roughly 10 seconds, once the song hit a low note, the flame
      was out, according to results published in 2005 in The Journal of
      the Acoustical Society of America.”<br>

      "Gulyaev, Popkov and Shebeko explained the effects seen as caused
      by the ionic&nbsp; wind.&nbsp; In the&nbsp; preheat zone of a
      flame, positive ions predominate; in&nbsp; the luminous zone,
      negative ions predominate.<br>
      <br>
      If a negative voltage is applied to the mesh, the hot positive
      ions are drawn to the outside of the flame and the negative ions
      are attracted to the center.&nbsp; The ionic wind is outward since
      the positive ions have a lower&nbsp; mobility than&nbsp; the&nbsp;
      negative ions,&nbsp; which are predominantly free electrons.<br>
      <br>
      The ionic wind thus draws hot combustion products and reaction
      centers out of the reaction zone, cooling the flame.&nbsp; At
      sufficiently high voltages (0.1 to 0.5 kV/cm) this cooling leads
      to flame extinction.<br>
      <br>
      Conversely, with a positive voltage on the mesh, the ionic wind is
      in toward the axis of the flame.&nbsp; This leads to flame
      stabilization."<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Engineers purify sea and wastewater in
            2.5 minutes</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A group of Mexican engineers from the Jhostoblak Corporate created
      technology to recover and purify seawater or wastewater from
      households, hotels, hospitals, commercial and industrial
      facilities, regardless of the content of pollutants and
      microorganisms in just 2.5 minutes.<br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      The system, PQUA, works with a mixture of dissociating elements,
      capable of separating and removing all contaminants, as well as
      organic and inorganic pollutants. "The methodology is founded on
      molecularly dissociating water pollutants to recover the minerals
      necessary and sufficient in order for the human body to function
      properly nourished," the researchers explained.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Notably, the engineers developed eight dissociating elements, and
      after extensive testing on different types of contaminated water,
      implemented a unique methodology that indicates what and how much
      of each element should be combined.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      "During the purification process, no gases, odors nor toxic
      elements that may damage or alter the environment, human health or
      quality of life are generated," said the engineers.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The corporation has a pilot plant in its offices that was used to
      demonstrate the purification process, which uses gravity to save
      energy. The residual water in the container is pumped to the
      reactor tank, where it receives a dosing of the dissociating
      elements in predetermined amounts.<br>
      <br>
      In this phase, solid, organic and inorganic matter and heavy
      metals are removed by precipitation and gravity; a sludge settles
      at the bottom of the reactor. This is removed and examined to
      determine if it is suitable to use as fertilizer or manufacture
      construction materials.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Subsequently, the water is conducted to a clarifier tank, to
      remove the excess charge of dissolved elements; then the liquid
      reaches a filter to remove turbidity and is finally passed by
      polishing tank that eliminates odors, colors and flavors. The
      treated water is transported to a container where ozone is added
      to ensure its purity, and finally is ready to drink. Indeed, the
      resulting liquid is fresh, odorless and has a neutral taste.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      "We have done over 50 tests on different types of wastewater and
      all have been certified and authorized by the laboratories of the
      Mexican Accreditation Agency (EMA). Also, the Monterrey Institute
      of Technology and Higher Education (ITESM), the College of Mexico
      and the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN) have given their
      validation that the water treated with our technology meets the
      SSA NOM 127 standard, which indicates the parameters and quality
      characteristics for vital liquid to be used for human
      consumption," says a Jhostoblak statement.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Moreover, the company reports that this development is protected
      under trade secret in America and will soon have the same status
      in Switzerland. Its implementation in the market will depend on
      the needs of users and the issue of new laws regarding use and
      consumption of water discharge.<br>

            Keystone pipeline with electric fields</b></big><br>
        <br>
        <b>by James Riordon</b><br>

      <b><br>
      </b>Researchers have shown that a strong electric field applied to
      a section of the Keystone pipeline can smooth oil flow and yield
      significant pump energy savings.<br>
      <br>
      Traditionally, pipeline oil is heated over several miles in order
      to reduce the oil's thickness (which is also known as viscosity),
      but this requires a large amount of energy and
      counter-productively increases turbulence within the flow. In 2006
      Rongjia Tao of Temple University in Pennsylvania proposed a more
      efficient way of improving flow rates by applying an electric
      field to the oil. The idea is to electrically align particles
      within the crude oil, which reduces viscosity and turbulence.<br>
      <br>
      To test this, Tao collaborated with energy company Save The World
      Air, Inc. to develop an Applied Oil Technology (AOT) device that
      links to oil pipelines and produces an electric field along the
      direction of the oil flow. Recent trials on oil pipelines in
      Wyoming and China verified that crude oil particles form short
      chains in an electric field. These chains reduce viscosity in the
      direction of flow to a minimum. At the same time the viscosity
      perpendicular to the flow increases, which helps suppress
      turbulence in the overall flow.<br>
      <br>
      This past summer Tao and his colleagues also successfully tested
      the AOT device on a section of the Keystone pipeline near Wichita,
      Kansas.<br>
      <br>
      "People were amazed at the energy savings when we first tested
      this device. They didn't initially understand the physics," said
      Tao. "A second test with an independent company was arranged and
      found the same thing." Tests on a section of the Keystone pipeline
      found that the same flow rate could be achieved with a 75 percent
      reduction of pump power from 2.8 megawatts to 0.7 megawatts,
      thanks to the AOT device. The device itself uses 720 watts.<br>
      <br>
      Once aligned, the oil retained its low viscosity and turbulence
      for more than 11 hours before returning to its original viscosity.
      But the process is repeatable and Tao and his colleagues envision
      AOT stations spaced along a pipeline, significantly reducing the
      energy necessary to transport oil. This work was published in
      January 2015 in Physical Review E and Tao will present the
      additional Keystone pipeline test results at the March Meeting
      2015.<br>
      <br>
      Previously Tao has also shown that the same technique applied with
      a magnetic field can reduce blood viscosity by 20 to 30 percent,
      published in 2011 in Physical Review E. With clinical trials, Tao
      says this could represent a future treatment for heart disease.<br>

          There’s a serious supply-and-demand problem when it comes to
          blood transfusions: Patients are in constant need of the
          bodily fluid, which delivers oxygen and nutrients to the
          cells, but because they need a specific type, hospitals and
          blood banks often experience shortages.<br>
          <br>
          Fortunately, chemists from the University of British Columbia
          and colleagues from the Center for Blood Research have created
          an enzyme that could potentially solve this problem by cutting
          off the antigens (sugars) found in Type A and Type B blood to
          make it more like Type O, which is universal and can be given
          to patients regardless of their blood types.<br>
          <br>
          UBC postdoctoral fellow David Kwan, lead author of a new
          Journal of the American Chemical Society study detailing the
          research, explained in a statement that their “mutant enzyme”
          is “very efficient” at cutting off antigens in A and B blood,
          and “much more proficient” at removing the A-antigen subtypes
          that the parent enzymes tend to struggle with.<br>
          <br>
          Using directed evolution to remove blood antigens<br>
          <br>
          Kwan, associate professor Jayachandran Kizhakkedathu,
          chemistry professor Steve Withers and their fellow researchers
          created the enzyme using a new technology known as directed
          evolution. In this method, mutations are inserted into the
          gene which codes for the enzymes, then selecting the mutants
          which are the most effective at cutting the antigens.<br>
          <br>
          “The defining difference between A, B and O blood types is the
          presence of slightly different sugar structures on the outside
          of the red blood cells of each type. Type A and B blood cells
          each have a single additional sugar attached to their surface
          (N-acetylgalactosamine and galactose respectively) beyond that
          present on O type red blood cells,” co-author Stephen G.
          Withers, a professor in the UBC Department of Chemistry,
          explained to redOrbit via email.<br>
          <br>
          “The idea of converting blood types by enzymatic removal of
          blood group antigens using specific sugar hydrolysing enzymes
          (glycosidases) has been around since the early 1980s, but a
          major limitation has always been the efficiency of the enzymes
          that can do this: impractically large amounts of enzyme were
          needed,” he added. “Our lab specializes in the mechanistic
          analysis and the engineering of glycosidases and has had
          considerable success at increasing rates of several of these
          enzymes through directed evolution.”<br>
          <br>
          Withers added that this directed evolution is a process that
          essentially “evolves” enzymes in the laboratory, doing the
          same thing that can be accomplished through natural selection,
          but doing it far more quickly than would ordinarily happen. He
          and his colleagues decided to apply this approach to
          increasing the activities of enzymes capable of removing A and
          B antigens.<br>
          <br>
          Promising research, but not quite ready for clinical use<br>
          <br>
          Over the span of five generations, the enzyme become 170 times
          more effective, the authors said. Using the enzyme, they were
          able to remove most of the antigens in A and B blood, but they
          emphasize that before the technique can be used in clinical
          settings, the enzyme would have to capable of removing all of
          the antigens. This is due to the sensitivity of the immune
          system, and the fact that even trace amounts of residual
          antigens could trigger a response.<br>
          <br>
          “As O-type blood is the universal donor type, there is high
          demand for O-type blood resulting in a shortage of supply.
          It’s possible to alleviate this demand and the resulting
          shortage if we have a means of converting A, B, and AB-type
          blood into a universal donor type,” Withers said, noting that
          “before our enzyme can be used clinically… further
          improvements by directed evolution will be necessary to effect
          complete removal of antigens.”<br>
          <br>
          “In this way we hope to be able to generate one or more
          enzymes that can be used to efficiently convert A or B blood
          to a generally acceptable type just like O. In practical terms
          this will take some time to come to fruition,” he said. “What
          we have done so far is to show that it is feasible to make
          these enzymes more efficient. We now need to broaden their
          abilities a little more so that they can handle all A-types.
          If we can do this, then the process will have to go through
          the lengthy and very important safety approval process.”<br>
          <br>
          Ultimately, Withers said that he envisions using the technique
          to pre-treat A or B type blood on an as-needed basis whenever
          hospitals or blood banks are faced with a shortage of
          compatible blood. However, he noted that it has taken a long
          time to this point, as he and his colleagues have been working
          on this specific process for roughly five years, and their
          work was built upon a foundation of more than three decades of
          basic research in the field.<br>
          <br>
          “I think the main take-home message is that it should be
          feasible to substantially improve the activities of enzymes to
          be used in antigen removal through methods of directed
          evolution, thereby decreasing the cost of the process,” he
          said. “We are not quite there yet, but the route forward is
          clear and that involves the evolution of the enzyme further to
          better cleave the other major sub-types of A blood.”<br>

          In the councils of government, we must guard against the
          acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or
          unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential
          for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will
          persist. We must never let the weight of this combination
          endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take
          nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry
          can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and
          military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and
          goals, so that security and liberty may prosper
          together.—President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1961 <br>
          <br>
          A standing army—something that propelled the early colonists
          into revolution—strips the American people of any vestige of
          freedom. How can there be any semblance of freedom when there
          are tanks in the streets, military encampments in cities,
          Blackhawk helicopters and armed drones patrolling overhead?<br>
          <br>
          It was for this reason that those who established America
          vested control of the military in a civilian government, with
          a civilian commander-in-chief. They did not want a military
          government, ruled by force. Rather, they opted for a republic
          bound by the rule of law: the U.S. Constitution.<br>
          <br>
          Unfortunately, with the Constitution under constant attack,
          the military's power, influence and authority have grown
          dramatically. Even the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which
          makes it a crime for the government to use the military to
          carry out arrests, searches, seizure of evidence and other
          activities normally handled by a civilian police force, has
          been weakened by both Barack Obama and George W. Bush, who
          ushered in exemptions allowing troops to deploy domestically
          and arrest civilians in the wake of alleged terrorist acts.<br>
          <br>
          Now we find ourselves struggling to retain some semblance of
          freedom in the face of police and law enforcement agencies
          that look and act like the military and have just as little
          regard for the Fourth Amendment, laws such as the NDAA that
          allow the military to arrest and indefinitely detain American
          citizens, and military drills that acclimate the American
          people to the sight of armored tanks in the streets, military
          encampments in cities, and combat aircraft patrolling
          overhead.<br>
          <br>
          Making matters worse, we find out that the military plans to
          use southwestern states as staging grounds for guerilla
          warfare drills in which highly-trained military troops
          equipped with all manner of weapons turn American towns and
          cities in quasi-battlefields. Why? As they tell us, it's so
          that special operations forces can get "realistic military
          training" in "hostile" territory.<br>
          <br>
          They've even got a name for the exercise: Jade Helm 15.<br>
          <br>
          Whether or not Americans have anything to fear from Jade Helm
          15, a covert, multi-agency, multi-state, eight-week military
          training exercise set to take place this summer from July 15
          through Sept. 15, remains to be seen.<br>
          <br>
          Insisting that there's nothing to be alarmed about, the
          Washington Post took great pains to point out that these
          military exercises on American soil are nothing new. For
          instance, there was Operation Bold Alligator, in which in
          which thousands of Marines and sailors carried out amphibious
          exercises against "insurgent" forces in Georgia and Florida.
          Operation Robin Sage had Green Beret soldiers engaging in
          guerrilla warfare in North Carolina. And Operation Derna
          Bridge sends Marine special forces into parts of South
          Carolina and the National Forest.<br>
          <br>
          Yet if Americans are uneasy about this summer's planned Jade
          Helm 15 military exercises, they have every right to be.<br>
          <br>
          After all, haven't we been urged time and time again to just
          "trust" the government to respect our rights and abide by the
          rule of law only to find that, in fact, our rights were being
          plundered and the Constitution disregarded at every turn?<br>
          <br>
          Let's assume, for the moment, that Jade Helm 15 is not a
          thinly veiled military plot to take over the country lifted
          straight out of director John Frankenheimer's 1964 political
          thriller Seven Days in May, as some fear, but is merely a
          "routine" exercise for troops, albeit a blatantly intimidating
          flexing of the military's muscles.<br>
          <br>
          The problem arises when you start to add Jade Helm onto the
          list of other troubling developments that have taken place
          over the past 30 years or more: the expansion of the military
          industrial complex and its influence in Washington DC, the
          rampant surveillance, the corporate-funded elections and
          revolving door between lobbyists and elected officials, the
          militarized police, the loss of our freedoms, the injustice of
          the courts, the privatized prisons, the school lockdowns, the
          roadside strip searches, the military drills on domestic soil,
          the fusion centers and the simultaneous fusing of every branch
          of law enforcement (federal, state and local), the stockpiling
          of ammunition by various government agencies, the active
          shooter drills that are indistinguishable from actual crises,
          the economy flirting with near collapse, etc.<br>
          <br>
          Suddenly, the overall picture seems that much more sinister.
          Clearly, as I point out in my new book Battlefield America:
          The War on the American People, there's a larger agenda at
          work here.<br>
          <br>
          Seven years ago, the U.S. Army War College issued a report
          calling on the military to be prepared should they need to put
          down civil unrest within the country. Summarizing the report,
          investigative journalist Chris Hedges declared, "The military
          must be prepared, the document warned, for a 'violent,
          strategic dislocation inside the United States,' which could
          be provoked by 'unforeseen economic collapse,' 'purposeful
          domestic resistance,' 'pervasive public health emergencies' or
          'loss of functioning political and legal order.' The
          'widespread civil violence,' the document said, 'would force
          the defense establishment to reorient priorities in extremis
          to defend basic domestic order and human security.'"<br>
          <br>
          At what point will all of the government's carefully drawn
          plans for dealing with civil unrest, "homegrown" terrorism and
          targeting pre-crime become a unified blueprint for locking
          down the nation?<br>
          <br>
          For instance, what's the rationale behind turning government
          agencies into military outposts? There has been a notable
          buildup in recent years of SWAT teams within
          non-security-related federal agencies such as Department of
          Agriculture, the Railroad Retirement Board, the Tennessee
          Valley Authority, the Office of Personnel Management, the
          Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
          Service and the Education Department. As of 2008, "73 federal
          law enforcement agencies... [employ] approximately 120,000
          armed full-time on-duty officers with arrest authority."
          Four-fifths of those officers are under the command of either
          the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or the Department of
          Justice.<br>
          <br>
          What's with all of the government agencies stockpiling hollow
          point bullets? For example, why does the Department of
          Agriculture need .40 caliber semiautomatic submachine guns and
          320,000 rounds of hollow point bullets? For that matter, why
          do its agents need ballistic vests and body armor?<br>
          <br>
          Why does the Postal Service need "assorted small arms
          ammunition"? Why did the DHS purchase "1.6 billion rounds of
          hollow-point ammunition, along with 7,000 fully-automatic
          5.56x45mm NATO 'personal defense weapons' plus a huge stash of
          30-round high-capacity magazines"? That's in addition to the
          FBI's request for 100 million hollow-point rounds. The
          Department of Education, IRS, the Social Security
          Administration, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
          Administration, which oversees the National Weather Service,
          are also among the federal agencies which have taken to
          purchasing ammunition and weaponry in bulk.<br>
          <br>
          Why is the federal government distributing obscene amounts of
          military equipment, weapons and ammunition to police
          departments around the country? And why is DHS acquiring more
          than 2,500 Mine-Resistant Armored Protection (MRAP) vehicles,
          only to pass them around to local police departments across
          the country? According to the New York Times:<br>
          <br>
          [A]s President Obama ushers in the end of what he called
          America's "long season of war," the former tools of combat —
          M-16 rifles, grenade launchers, silencers and more — are
          ending up in local police departments, often with little
          public notice. During the Obama administration, according to
          Pentagon data, police departments have received tens of
          thousands of machine guns; nearly 200,000 ammunition
          magazines; thousands of pieces of camouflage and night-vision
          equipment; and hundreds of silencers, armored cars and
          aircraft. The equipment has been added to the armories of
          police departments that already look and act like military
          units.<br>
          <br>
          Why is the military partnering with local police to conduct
          training drills around the country? And what exactly are they
          training for? In Richland, South Carolina, for instance, U.S.
          army special forces participated in joint and secretive
          exercises and training with local deputies. The public was
          disallowed from obtaining any information about the purpose of
          the drills, other than being told that they might be loud and
          to not be alarmed. The Army and DHS also carried out similar
          drills and maneuvers involving Black Hawk helicopters in
          Texas, Florida, and other locations throughout the U.S.,
          ostensibly in order to provide local police with "realistic"
          urban training.<br>
          <br>
          What is being done to protect the American populace from the
          threat of military arms and forces, including unarmed drones,
          being used against them? Policy analysts point to Directive
          No. 3025.18, "Defense Support of Civil Authorities" (issued on
          Dec. 29, 2010), as justification for the government's use of
          military force to put down civil unrest within the United
          States.<br>
          <br>
          Why is FEMA stockpiling massive quantities of emergency
          supplies? On January 10, 2014, FEMA made a statement enlisting
          the service of contractors who could "supply medical biohazard
          disposal capabilities and 40 yard dumpsters to 1,000 tent
          hospitals across the United States; all required on 24-48 hour
          notice." This coincides with other medical requests seeking
          massive amounts of supplies, such as "31,000,000 flu
          vaccinations," "100,000 each of winter shirts and pants and
          the same for summer" and other goods and services requests as
          well like tarps, manufactured housing units, and beverages.
          And why does the TSA need $21,000 worth of potassium chlorate,
          a chemical compound often used in explosives?<br>
          <br>
          Why is the Pentagon continuing to purchase mass amounts of
          ammunition while at the same time preparing to destroy more
          than $1 billion worth of bullets and missiles that are still
          viable?<br>
          <br>
          Moreover, what is really being done to hold the Pentagon
          accountable for its doctored ledgers, fraud, waste and
          mismanagement, which has cost the taxpayer trillions of
          dollars? According to Reuters, "The Pentagon is the only
          federal agency that has not complied with a law that requires
          annual audits of all government departments. That means that
          the $8.5 trillion in taxpayer money doled out by Congress to
          the Pentagon since 1996, the first year it was supposed to be
          audited, has never been accounted for. That sum exceeds the
          value of China's economic output."<br>
          <br>
          Given the similarities between the government's Live Active
          Shooter Drill training exercises, carried out at schools, in
          shopping malls, and on public transit, which can and do fool
          law enforcement officials, students, teachers and bystanders
          into thinking it's a real crisis, how much of what is being
          passed off as real is, in fact, being staged by DHS for the
          "benefit" of training law enforcement, leaving us none the
          wiser? These training exercises come complete with their own
          set of professionally trained Crisis Actors playing the parts
          of shooters, bystanders and victims in order to help schools
          and first responders create realistic drills, full-scale
          exercises, high-fidelity simulations, and interactive 3D
          films.<br>
          <br>
          Given that Americans are 110 times more likely to die of
          foodborne illness than in a terrorist attack, why is the
          government spending trillions of dollars on "national
          security"? How exactly is the $75 billion given to various
          intelligence agencies annually to keep us "safe" being spent?
          And why is the DHS giving away millions of dollars' worth of
          federal security grants to states that federal intelligence
          agencies ruled have "no specific foreign or domestic terrorism
          threat"?<br>
          <br>
          Why is the government amassing names and information on
          Americans considered to be threats to the nation, and what
          criteria is the government using for this database? Keep in
          mind that this personal information is being acquired and kept
          without warrant or court order. It's been suggested that in
          the event of nuclear war, the destruction of the U.S.
          Government, and the declaration of martial law, this Main Core
          database, which as of 2008 contained some 8 million names of
          Americans, would be used by military officials to locate and
          round up Americans seen as threats to national security, a
          program to be carried about by the Army and FEMA.<br>
          <br>
          Taken individually, these questions are alarming enough. But
          put them together and they add up to the kind of trouble that
          the American founding fathers not only warned against but from
          which they fought to free themselves.<br>
          <br>
          Indeed, when viewed collectively, they leave one wondering
          what exactly the U.S. government is preparing for and whether
          American citizens shouldn't be preparing, as well, for that
          eventuality when our so-called "government of the people, by
          the people, for the people" is no longer answerable to "we the
          people." <br>

          <br>
          Researchers from the University of Southern California say
          that they’ve come up with a sure-fire way for people to
          overcome procrastination and get to work on accomplishing
          their goals.<br>
          <br>
          The trick, they explain in the journal Psychological Science,
          is to change the way that you think about the future. Future
          goals have to feel as though they’re important now.<br>
          <br>
          “The simplified message that we learned in these studies is if
          the future doesn’t feel imminent, then, even if it’s
          important, people won’t start working on their goals,” said
          Oyserman, who was assisted on the research by co-author Neil
          Lewis Jr. of the University of Michigan.<br>
          <br>
          In a series of experiments, the duo presented study
          participants with different scenarios and found that those
          individuals looked at the future as something that was far
          more imminent when they evaluated goals and deadlines in terms
          of days rather than months or years.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Events appear closer when viewed in days</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Oysterman and Lewis recruited 162 men and women and asked them
          to imagine that they were preparing for future events, such as
          a wedding or a presentation at work, and were randomly told to
          think of the event in days, months, or years. The authors
          found that participants viewing the event in terms of days
          said that it would occur an average of 29.6 days sooner.<br>
          <br>
          A second set of studies investigated if this sense of time
          altered a person’s plans to begin saving money for the
          long-term. The authors recruited more than 1,100 participants,
          asking them when they planned to begin saving for college or
          retirement. In one case, they were either told college would
          start in 18 years or 6,570 days, while in the second, they
          were told retirement would start either 30-40 years or
          10,950-14,600 days in the future.<br>
          <br>
          Oysterman and Lewis found that participants planned to start
          saving four times sooner when they viewed the upcoming event
          in terms of days instead of years, and follow-up studies
          revealed that while participants believed that long-term
          saving was important, those assigned to count down to college
          or retirement in days instead of years felt more connected to
          their future selves.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers believe that this technique could be used by
          people to motive themselves to accomplish goals. “So when I
          think in a more granular way – when I use days rather than
          years – it makes me feel like the future is closer,” they
          explained. “If you see it as ‘today’ rather than on your
          calendar for sometime in the future, you’re not going to put
          it off.”<br>

              <div align="center"><b>Albert Pike</b></div>
              <br>
              ...Albert Pike received a vision, which he described in a
              letter that he wrote to Mazzini, dated August 15, 1871.
              This letter graphically outlined plans for three world
              wars that were seen as necessary to bring about the One
              World Order, and we can marvel at how accurately it has
              predicted events that have already taken place.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Pike's Letter to Mazzini</b><br>
              <br>
              It is a commonly believed fallacy that for a short time,
              the Pike letter to Mazzini was on display in the British
              Museum Library in London, and it was copied by William Guy
              Carr, former Intelligence Officer in the Royal Canadian
              Navy.&nbsp; The British Library has confirmed in writing
              to me that such a document has never been in their
              possession.&nbsp; Furthermore, in Carr's book, Satan,
              Prince of this World, Carr includes the following
              footnote:<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Keeper of Manuscripts recently
              informed the author that this letter is NOT catalogued in
              the British Museum Library.&nbsp; It seems strange that a
              man of Cardinal Rodriguez's knowledge should have said
              that it WAS in 1925".<br>
              <br>
              It appears that Carr learned about this letter from
              Cardinal Caro y Rodriguez of Santiago, Chile, who wrote
              The Mystery of Freemasonry Unveiled. <br>
              <br>
              To date, no conclusive proof exists to show that this
              letter was ever written.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the letter is
              widely quoted and the topic of much discussion.<br>
              <br>
              Following are apparently extracts of the letter, showing
              how Three World Wars have been planned for many
              generations.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The First World War must be brought
              about in order to permit the Illuminati to overthrow the
              power of the Czars in Russia and of making that country a
              fortress of atheistic Communism. The divergences caused by
              the "agentur" (agents) of the Illuminati between the
              British and Germanic Empires will be used to foment this
              war. At the end of the war, Communism will be built and
              used in order to destroy the other governments and in
              order to weaken the religions." 2<br>
              <br>
              Students of history will recognize that the political
              alliances of England on one side and Germany on the other,
              forged between 1871 and 1898 by Otto von Bismarck,
              co-conspirator of Albert Pike, were instrumental in
              bringing about the First World War.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Second World War must be fomented
              by taking advantage of the differences between the
              Fascists and the political Zionists. This war must be
              brought about so that Nazism is destroyed and that the
              political Zionism be strong enough to institute a
              sovereign state of Israel in Palestine. During the Second
              World War, International Communism must become strong
              enough in order to balance Christendom, which would be
              then restrained and held in check until the time when we
              would need it for the final social cataclysm." 3<br>
              <br>
              After this Second World War, Communism was made strong
              enough to begin taking over weaker governments. In 1945,
              at the Potsdam Conference between Truman, Churchill, and
              Stalin, a large portion of Europe was simply handed over
              to Russia, and on the other side of the world, the
              aftermath of the war with Japan helped to sweep the tide
              of Communism into China.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              (Readers who argue that the terms Nazism and Zionism were
              not known in 1871 should remember that the Illuminati
              invented both these movements.&nbsp; In addition,
              Communism as an ideology, and as a coined phrase,
              originates in France during the Revolution.&nbsp; In 1785,
              Restif coined the phrase four years before revolution
              broke out.&nbsp; Restif and Babeuf, in turn, were
              influenced by Rousseau - as was the most famous
              conspirator of them all, Adam Weishaupt.)<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Third World War must be fomented
              by taking advantage of the differences caused by the
              "agentur" of the "Illuminati" between the political
              Zionists and the leaders of Islamic World. The war must be
              conducted in such a way that Islam (the Moslem Arabic
              World) and political Zionism (the State of Israel)
              mutually destroy each other. Meanwhile the other nations,
              once more divided on this issue will be constrained to
              fight to the point of complete physical, moral, spiritual
              and economical exhaustion…We shall unleash the Nihilists
              and the atheists, and we shall provoke a formidable social
              cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the
              nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery
              and of the most bloody turmoil. Then everywhere, the
              citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world
              minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those
              destroyers of civilization, and the multitude,
              disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits
              will from that moment be without compass or direction,
              anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render
              its adoration, will receive the true light through the
              universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer,
              brought finally out in the public view. This manifestation
              will result from the general reactionary movement which
              will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism,
              both conquered and exterminated at the same time." 4<br>
              <br>
              Since the terrorist attacks of Sept 11, 2001, world
              events, and in particular in the Middle East, show a
              growing unrest and instability between Modern Zionism and
              the Arabic World. This is completely in line with the call
              for a Third World War to be fought between the two, and
              their allies on both sides. This Third World War is still
              to come, and recent events show us that it is not far off.

            Santiago, Chile said, that The Cause of World Unrest said,
            that the confessed hoaxer Gabriel Jogand-Pagès aka Dr.

            Mazzini in Le diable au XIXe siècle, v. II, 1892-1894, p.
            605 (but actually pp. 594-606). Got it?</i><i><br>
          </i><br>
          I don’t derive any satisfaction from a debunking. I really
          don’t. Discovering the truth is a reward in itself.<br>
          <br>
          Having a knack for getting to the bottom of a thing also helps
          with maintaining credibility. Historiography is among other
          things concerned with source criticism. And while I’m not an
          academically trained historian, I am quite aware that one
          should strive to consult the primary source as opposed to
          relying on the word of secondary or even tertiary accounts.<br>
          <br>
          The matter at hand deals with an alleged “three world war”
          prediction from famed Mason, Scottish Rite Sovereign Grand
          Commander Albert Pike. William Guy Carr was the key purveyor
          of the tale which, to me, was suspicious at the least.<br>
          <br>
          Off and on I’ve been working at it. And I’ve finally cracked
          the case.<br>
          <br>
          Let’s begin with the modern populariser of the Pike/Mazzini,
          1871 “letter.”<br>
          <br>
          In 2003, an Englishman by the name of Michael Haupt [fig 1]
          launched [fig 2] his website threeworldwars.com in response to
          Jihadist terrorism and the American invasion of Iraq. Backed
          by the knowledge gleaned from a conspiratorial view of history
          and an obvious impending cataclysm, the words of William Guy
          Carr, attributed to Albert Pike, seemed to precisely predict
          the dire circumstances unfolding in the Middle East.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One message that Albert Pike received from
          his “spirit guide,” and which in reality we know to be a
          demonic vision, he described in a letter that he wrote to
          Mazzini, dated August 15, 1871. This letter graphically
          outlined plans for three world wars that were seen as
          necessary to bring about the One World Order, and we can
          marvel at how accurately it has predicted events that have
          already taken place. This is not because the devil has powers
          of prophecy, but because his agents have undertaken to
          manipulate political events to closely follow his designs. For
          a short time, this letter was on display in the British Museum
          Library in London, and it was copied by William Guy Carr,
          former Intelligence Officer in the Royal Canadian Navy.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The First World
          War must be brought about in order to permit the Illuminati to
          overthrow the power of the Czars in Russia and of making that
          country a fortress of atheistic Communism. The divergences
          caused by the “agentur” (agents) of the Illuminati between the
          British and Germanic Empires will be used to foment this war.
          At the end of the war, Communism will be built and used in
          order to destroy the other governments and in order to weaken
          the religions.”<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students of history will recognize that the
          political alliances of England on one side and Germany on the
          other, forged between 1871 and 1898 by Otto von Bismarck,
          co-conspirator of Albert Pike, were instrumental in bringing
          about the First World War.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The Second World
          War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences
          between the Fascists and the political Zionists. This war must
          be brought about so that Nazism is destroyed and that the
          political Zionism be strong enough to institute a sovereign
          state of Israel in Palestine. During the Second World War,
          International Communism must become strong enough in order to
          balance Christendom, which would be then restrained and held
          in check until the time when we would need it for the final
          social cataclysm.”<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this Second World War, Communism was
          made strong enough to begin taking over weaker governments. In
          1945, at the Potsdam Conference between Truman, Churchill, and
          Stalin, a large portion of Europe was simply handed over to
          Russia, and on the other side of the world, the aftermath of
          the war with Japan helped to sweep the tide of Communism into
          China.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The Third World
          War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences
          caused by the “agentur” of the “Illuminati” between the
          political Zionists and the leaders of Islamic World. The war
          must be conducted in such a way that Islam (the Moslem Arabic
          World) and political Zionism (the State of Israel) mutually
          destroy each other. Meanwhile the other nations, once more
          divided on this issue will be constrained to fight to the
          point of complete physical, moral, spiritual and economical
          exhaustion…We shall unleash the Nihilists and the atheists,
          and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in
          all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of
          absolute atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody
          turmoil. Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend
          themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will
          exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the
          multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic
          spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction,
          anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its
          adoration, will receive the true light through the universal
          manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally
          out in the public view. This manifestation will result from
          the general reactionary movement which will follow the
          destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and
          exterminated at the same time.”<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the terrorist attacks of Sept 11,
          2001, world events in the Middle East show a growing unrest
          and instability between Jews and Arabs. This is completely in
          line with the call for a Third World War to be fought between
          the two, and their allies on both sides. This Third World War
          is still to come, and recent events show us that it is not far
          off.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; – Michael Haupt, “Who was Albert Pike?”
          (Jun 07, 2003 [fig 3]); [cf. the current page]<br>
          <br>
          Pawns in the GameNotice the quotes attributed to Carr, who in
          turn is supposedly citing Pike verbatim. Although there is no
          citation from Haupt, e.g. book and page number, it was pretty
          easy to track down from where it had originated. “The First
          World War must…,” “The Second World War must…,” and “The Third
          World War must…,” is a paraphrased excerpt from William Guy
          Carr’s book, Pawns in the Game, pp. xv-xvi (a reprint of the
          1958 edition). Only Carr doesn’t use quotes to signal a direct
          quote from the letter, as Haupt had deemed necessary to insert
          all by himself. The former does indeed claim that three world
          wars was prophesied in the letter, but he doesn’t actually go
          so far as to put quotations around it so as to definitively
          attribute those specific words as occurring verbatim in said
          letter.<br>
          <br>
          Carr maintains a curious middle ground. Observe the following:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between 1859, and 1871, he worked out the
          details of a military blue-print, for three world wars, and
          three major revolutions which he considered would further the
          conspiracy to its final stage during the twentieth century.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; […] Pike’s plan was as simple as it has
          proved effective. He required that Communism, Naziism,
          Political Zionism, and other International movements be
          organized and used to foment the three global wars and three
          major revolutions. The first world war was to be fought so as
          to enable the Illuminati to overthrow the powers of the Tzars
          in Russia and turn that country into the stronghold of
          Atheistic-Communism. The differences stirred up by agentur of
          the Illuminati between the British and German Empires were to
          be used to foment this war. After the war ended, Communism was
          to be built up and used to destroy other governments and
          weaken religions.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; World War Two, was to be fomented by using
          the differences between Fascists and Political Zionists. This
          war was to be fought so that Naziism would be destroyed and
          the power of Political Zionism increased so that the sovereign
          state of Israel could be established in Palestine. During
          world war two International Communism was to be built up until
          it equalled in strength that of united Christendom. At this
          point it was to be contained and kept in check until required
          for the final social cataclysm. Can any informed person deny
          Roosevelt and Churchill did not put this policy into effect?<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; World War Three is to be fomented by using
          the differences the agentur of the Illuminati stir up between
          Political Zionists and the leaders of the Moslem world. The
          war is to be directed in such a manner that Islam (the Arab
          World including Mohammedanism) and Political Zionism
          (including the State of Israel) will destroy themselves while
          at the same time the remaining nations, once more divided
          against each other on this issue, will be forced to fight
          themselves into a state of complete exhaustion physically,
          mentally, spiritually and economically. Can any unbiased and
          reasoning person deny that the intrigue now going on in the
          Near, Middle, and Far East isn’t designed to accomplish this
          devilish purpose?<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; – William Guy Carr, Pawns in the Game (CPA
          Book Publisher reprint n. d.; however Carr signs his
          introduction Oct. 13, 1958), p. XV [fig 4]<br>
          <br>
          As is obvious, these are not direct quotes, rather only a
          claim. And there is no citation for these revelations, either:
          When exactly did Pike supposedly lay out his master
          conspiracy? And where can one read the complete unedited
          original?<br>
          <br>
          On the next page, however, there is a small quote from the
          mysterious alleged letter dated August 15, 1871:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On August 15, 1871, Pike told Mazzini that
          after World War Three is ended, those who aspire to undisputed
          world domination will provoke the greatest social cataclysm
          the world has ever known. We quote his own written words
          (taken from the letter catalogued in the British Museum
          Library, London, Eng.):<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “We shall unleash
          the Nihilists and Atheists, and we shall provoke a formidable
          social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to
          the nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery
          and of the most bloody turmoil. Then everywhere, the citizens,
          obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of
          revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of
          civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with
          Christianity, whose deistic spirits will be from that moment
          without compass (direction), anxious for an ideal, but without
          knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true
          light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine
          of Lucifer brought finally out in the public view, a
          manifestation which will result from the general reactionary
          movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and
          Atheism, both conquered and exterminated at the same time.”<br>

          Book Publisher reprint n.d.), p. XVI [fig 5]<br>
          <br>
          Here we have a direct quote from the elusive letter, and
          again, with no precise citation – only the assertion that it
          is held in the British Museum.<br>
          Carr, Rodriguez and “The Cause of World Unrest”<br>
          <br>
          Apparently, Carr was called out on this, for in his last book
          published posthumously in 1959, he finally reveals his source:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pike explained what is intended to happen
          in a letter he wrote to his director (Mazzini) of the W.R.M.
          August 15, 1871. This letter is quoted elsewhere. It is
          catalogued in the Library of the British Museum, London,
          England [9] and has been quoted from and referred to by dozens
          of authorities and students of the W.R.M., including Cardinal
          Rodriguez of Chile. (See page 118 of The Mysteries of
          Freemasonry Unveiled, 1925. English translation,
          1957.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; […]<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [9] The Keeper of manuscripts recently
          informed the author that this letter is NOT catalogued in the
          British Museum Library. It seems strange that a man of
          Cardinal Rodriguez’s knowledge should have said it WAS in
          1925.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; – William Guy Carr, Satan: Prince of this
          World (pdf scan by Haupt), p. 22<br>
          <br>
          Mystery of Freemasonry UnveiledLet’s consult Cardinal
          Rodriguez’ book to pin it down further. Here are the relevant
          passages:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In The Cause, the work of Monseigneur
          Jouin, concerning the Protocols, and the work of Witchl, are
          given the names of all the Jews who have been in the
          government of the Soviet and thus it is shown that the Jews
          are realizing their plan, for which they counted on Masonry as
          a blind and servile instrument.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other indication of the participation
          of Masonry in the Revolution and the present upheaval in
          Russia is a letter in Le Diable au XIXème Siècle (1896),
          attributed to Albert Pike, “Sovereign Pontiff of Universal
          Masonry”, assisted by ten Ancients of the Grand Lodge of the
          Supreme Orient of Charleston to the very illustrious Joseph
          Mazzini, dated August 15, 1871. What I have said of the
          document previously mentioned, The Protocols, I say of this
          one: Authentic or not, the letter had been published long
          enough before the events, not to be an invention accommodated
          post factum. Its publication is catalogued in the British
          Museum of London and the plan attributed to Pike is also in
          part in Le Palladisme Of Margiotta, p. 186 published in 1895.
          It is a plan to destroy Catholicism, to throw the Pope out of
          Italy and force him to seek refuge in Russia; and then, when
          the autocratic empire had become the citadel of Papal
          Christianity, “we,” continues the author of the letter, “shall
          unleash the Nihilists and Atheists, and we shall provoke a
          formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show
          clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin
          of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil. Then everywhere,
          the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world
          minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers
          of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with
          Christianity, whose deistic spirits will be from that moment
          without compass, anxious for an ideal, but without knowing
          where to render its adoration, will receive the true light
          through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of
          Lucifer brought finally out in the public view, a
          manifestation which will result from the general reactionary
          movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and
          atheism, both conquered and exterminated at the same time”
          (The Cause, p. 77 ff).&nbsp;&nbsp; – The Cardinal of Chile,
          The Mysteries of Freemasonry Unveiled (Christian Book Club of
          America, 2006), pp. 115-6 [fig 6 and 7]<br>
          <br>
          I was pleased with the discovery that Cardinal Rodriguez
          provided adequate citation for further investigation. Some of
          the new information gleaned includes the fact, that 1) Carr
          quoted directly from Rodriguez’ meagre one-paragraph excerpt;
          2) the latter mentioned nothing about a prediction of three
          world wars; and that 3) Carr was confused about exactly what
          was “catalogued” in the British Museum. Furthermore, it
          appears that Cardinal Rodriguez was alluding to Le Diable au
          XIXème Siècle — “its publication” — as being catalogued at the
          Museum, not the letter itself (as our next source confirms).<br>
          <br>
          At any rate, Le Diable au XIXème Siècle [The Devil in the
          19th-century] is the source of the alleged letter.
          Unfortunately, however, Rodriguez omits which volume –
          Bataille (Dr.), Le Diable au XIXe siècle, 2 volumes (Delhomme
          &amp; Briguet: Paris-Lyon, 1892-1894), 1800pp – let alone
          which page or pages. Therefore, I had no other choice but to
          consult the secondary work called “The Cause.”<br>
          <br>
          On p. 8 in the aforementioned edition of The Mysteries of
          Freemasonry Unveiled, one encounters a helpful section
          entitled “References and Abbreviations.” Item number 19,
          reads: “The Cause of World Unrest 1920” [fig 8].<br>
          <br>
          Putting it mildly, both Carr and Rodriguez were hardly
          amicable toward the Jews, and the next source is no exception
          to the rule.<br>
          <br>
          The Cause of World Unrest is a compilation of articles that
          appeared in the London Morning Post in July of 1920, in the
          wake of the Bolshevik revolution and the publication of the
          Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion. Whoever penned these
          texts wished to remain anonymous. Certain researchers,
          however, conclude that its main authors were Ian Colvin,
          editor of the paper H. A. Gwynne, and Nesta Webster.<br>
          <br>
          The original 1920 copy of the book, as well as a recent
          reprint of it (precise date not specified), reveals that
          Cardinal Rodriguez was incorrect about the page numbers. The
          information on the Pike letter is found from page 50 to 52, as
          opposed to “77 ff”:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the year 1896 there appeared in Paris a
          curious publication called Le Diable au XIXe Siècle. It was an
          attack upon Freemasonry, and came out in parts, illustrated
          with grotesque and repulsive engravings. The name on the
          title-page is Dr. Bataille, but it is stated in the British
          Museum Catalogue that the real authors were Gabriel
          Jogand-Pagès and Charles Hacks [TM: this explains the
          “catalogued” business]. The book, with evident knowledge and a
          show of authority, set out to trace the connection between
          Freemasonry and revolutions, but its sensationalism and the
          extremely doubtful character of some of the documents produced
          brought it into disrepute. It is now forgotten, and yet it
          contains a good deal that can be verified from other sources,
          and some things also which seem to be verified by recent
          events. In particular there is a letter – or an alleged letter
          – said to have been written by Albert Pike, the “Sovereign
          Pontiff of Universal Freemasonry,” assisted by the Ten
          Ancients of the Grand Lodge of the Supreme Orient at
          Charleston, to “the very illustrious brother” Giuseppe
          Mazzini. This letter is dated (in Masonic style) August 15,
          1871, and sets forth an anti-clerical policy which Mazzini is
          to follow in Italy. The measures proposed, including secular
          education, the expulsion of the religious orders, and so
          forth, need not detain us. What is to our purpose occurs
          towards the end of the letter, on page 605 (vol. ii.). The
          writer explains that owing to the working out of this policy
          the Pope may be driven at some future time out of Italy, and
          that established religion will then find its last refuge in
          Russia. And the letter proceeds:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “That is why, when the autocratic Empire of
          Russia will have become the citadel of Papal Christianity
          (adonaïsme papiste), we shall unchain the revolutionary
          Nihilists and Atheists, and we shall provoke a formidable
          social cataclysm, which will demonstrate clearly to the
          nations, in all its horror, the effect of absolute unbelief,
          mother of savagery and of the most bloody disorder. Then,
          everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against
          the mad minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate these
          destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned
          of Christianity, whose deist soul will up to that moment be
          without compass, thirsting for an ideal, but not knowing where
          to bestow their worship, will receive the True Light, by the
          universal manifestation of the pure Luciferian doctrine, at
          last made public, a manifestation which will arise from the
          general movement of reaction following the destruction of
          Atheism and Christianity, both at the same time vanquished and
          exterminated.”<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this letter is at least as old as 1896
          (if it is a forgery); if it is genuine, it is as old as 1871.
          It must therefore be considered remarkable, whether as a
          forgery or as a genuine document. For it predicts what has
          happened in Russia, and it claims for its authors that they
          were preparing to bring about what has
          happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; – H. A. Gwynne (ed.), The Cause of
          World Unrest (no date, no publisher, no ISBN specified [cover

          Now we’re getting somewhere. The original book, volume, and
          page number for the letter has finally been identified.<br>

          We’ll look at the actual “letter” below. For now, however, it
          will suffice to comment on two things: 1) the confusion over a
          catalogue in the British Museum has been solved; and 2) the
          “Nihilists and Atheists” quotes are nearly identical
          translations from Carr to Rodriguez to the “anonymous” author
          in The Cause. (There are a few minor discrepancies, but this
          is surely due to Rodriguez’s book being translated from
          Spanish to English.) “The Cause” (1920) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

          <br>
          It was precisely 2 years ago that I had acquired the last
          source in the trail. I don’t usually do the inter-library
          thing: they give me the run-around, and endless excuses. I
          purchase books online, mostly through second hand dealers, and
          Le Diable au XIXème Siècle — any volume; any edition — was a
          little too rich for my blood.<br>
          <br>
          Google Books has indeed scanned the volume, searchable though
          presented only in snippet view. At one point I became aware of
          Michel Berchmans’ Le Diable au XIXe siècle: La mystification
          du Dr Bataille [The Devil in the 19th-century: The Hoax of Dr.
          Bataille] (Marabout, 1973), which includes lengthy excerpts
          along with a critical introduction. After getting the book
          into my hands, however, I quickly found that the famed 1871
          letter from Pike to Mazzini was unfortunately overlooked.<br>
          <br>
          Then, a few weeks ago, I had an idea. What if I type in “15
          août 1871” in the snippet search just get a semblance of what
          page 605 of the volume really contains? Sure enough, it was
          there. And from that tiny snippet view, I gleaned an entire
          sentence: “15 août 1871, ère vulgaire.”<br>
          <br>
          You can probably figure out what my next step was. I googled
          it in the hopes that someone, somewhere – surely by now – must
          have transcribed and posted portions, or hopefully the entire
          alleged letter.<br>
          <br>
          Voilà!<br>
          <br>
          Exceeding thanks therefore goes to “Hercule” — at a
          Rennes-le-Château research forum of all places! — who, after
          receiving it in an email, posted the entire chapter found in
          Le Diable, v. II, that pertains to the 1871 Pike/Mazzini
          exchange.<br>
          <br>
          I quickly snatched up the text, consolidated it, and compared
          it sentence by sentence in the search box provided at the
          Google book scan. It was a literal transcription.<br>
          <br>
          Let’s proceed then, with a translation of the twelve pages in
          question before remarking on the merits or validity of its

            establishment of Palladism (Supreme Rite), the “learned
            Luciferian Pontiff” Albert Pike received an important letter
            from Mazzini. The political action leader for Universal
            Freemasonry invited the supreme dogmatic leader of the sect

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The destruction of feeble Catholicism,
          cannot be accomplished all at once, and erecting good
          Catholicism also requires a lot of labour, working in tandem,
          which should be pursued simultaneously, so that, when the
          temple of Adonai, undermined on all sides, is ready to
          collapse in total ruin, the same impulse that annihilates will
          discover the temple, hitherto hidden from our Divine Master,

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “God-King Lucifer will have the whole world

          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The title of Catholic does not, in fact,
          belong to Roman superstition. Through revelation, it is
          certain that its number will never reach, at its apogee, a
          quarter of the world’s population; it is written in The Book
          of the Heavens. On the other hand, the religion of Adonai
          achieved that domination, and it is obvious that she is
          declining.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It is necessary that we consider the
          religious situation of humanity, if we want to safely proceed
          with the work of twice-over destroying the temple of Adonai
          and building the temple of Lucifer. This preliminary look will
          give us courage and hope in the realization of our divine
          plight; for we show that the future is ours, and the title
          Catholics is reserved for ourselves. [p. 596]<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “One billion, four hundred million
          inhabitants, this is the population of the globe. Of these,

          followers.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “However, we must classify religious
          followers by groups.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The Christian group is to be subdivided as
          follows: Roman Catholics, two hundred and ten million;
          Protestants, one hundred and twenty million; Orthodox, whom
          the pope of superstition called schismatics, eighty million.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The Indian group is subdivided as follows:

          hundred and sixty million.<br>

          hundred million.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Observe that the truth is known to the
          priests of Vedism (Indian Group), and the Mohammedans, without
          knowing the truth, have had a large number of their priests
          inspired by it.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Two hundred and thirty-three million
          idolaters, fetishists or worshipers of various idols, will
          disappear along with civilization, not individually but as
          religionists. The Roman Catholic missionaries want to win them
          over; yet it will be Roman Catholicism itself that disappears
          even before it attempts the conquest in a meaningful way.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The Jewish religion has seven million
          adherents; this small group has no tendency toward conversion
          to Roman Catholicism; revelation has promised it to us.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Finally, statisticians estimate that
          twenty-eight million deistic freethinkers are scattered
          throughout the globe, while atheists have two million. All
          others are mostly defectors from other Christian groups.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “But it is not appropriate to consider the
          whole Christian group as being alienated from true light to
          the same degree. Protestantism, its various factions, except a
          tiny minority, are composed of followers of reason, who
          understand and continuously seek truth, and, therefore, find
          it; is from them that we find the most numerous followers of
          the God-Good. On the other hand, the Orthodox schismatics fell
          prey to the promised Evil-God, as written in the Book of the
          Heavens. But when Orthodoxy is reunited with Roman
          Catholicism, they number less than three hundred million
          adherents.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The conversion of Protestants to the
          Temple of True Light will be gradual, sayeth the revelation;
          the fate of the Mohammedans will be entirely determined by a
          large and unexpected event occurring under the sixth sovereign
          pontificate of good Catholicism. It will follow from this that
          – far from being doomed to the cursed darkness of superstition
          – three hundred twenty million souls will be enlightened.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “According to the revelation, Roman
          Catholicism will always be in decline; [p. 597] either
          desertions or conquest of souls will increase the number of
          free-thinking deists, and we know that they are in a state of
          transition while we are finally promised.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “On the other hand, we needn’t worry about
          transitioning the state of the Indian group, for its priests
          already possess true light.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Therefore, at the appointed hour in the
          Book of the Heavens, that is to say, when Roman Catholicism
          reaches its maximum number of followers through by uniting
          with Orthodoxy or schismatics, more than one billion
          Luciferian Catholics will be found in opposition.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Consequently, the issue boils down to
          this: we must be ready when we find ourselves a billion or
          more, finally with our banners flying high, producing an
          explosion that will topple the Temple of Adonai; so, in other
          words, superstition should be weakened and ruined, so much so
          that its followers will themselves merge into our ranks, – we
          are promised that dazzling miracles will open their eyes – and
          that, if at that time some obstinate priests are left still
          insisting upon preaching the [word of the] Evil-God, their
          extermination can be accomplished without difficulty.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “How, then, should this unavoidable
          end-date, be directed and arrived at gradually and peacefully?<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “To speak here of the Christian group,
          tactics will vary as we maneuver in countries dominated by the
          Roman Catholic element or in countries dominated by the
          Protestant element.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The main work is one that aims to
          transform the Roman Catholics into freethinking Deists. We
          need to apply all our strength, and with that, persuade many.
          Experience has shown that too-few are the privileged souls who
          leap from the abyss of obscurantism to take their bold flight
          into the ether of divine and invigorating light.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “For this he must conquer the seats of
          government of his people; this is everything. Whether in the
          republics or the monarchist states, we must enact laws,
          destroying everywhere the influence of the priests of the
          superstition and their auxiliaries, the monks who mingle with
          the people and the nuns who maintain the soul in error, by the
          cloak of false charity. It will, first, be through the press
          that we inspire writers, demonstrating how the almsgiving of
          the Evil-Catholics is degrading to human dignity, and this by
          showing that the individual has the right to well-being
          through social reforms and not by routine charity; and,
          secondly, that for parliaments or legislatures to disperse
          unpopular congregations, to skillfully destroy those
          prejudices [p. 598] requires still, in a word, first the
          removal of every monk or nun.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “In the intellectual sphere, especially,
          the neutrality of the public schools must be secured so that
          it is no longer pervaded by priests, nor any of their agents;
          then, early in the stages of neutralization, we divert any
          thoughts the parents may have to give their children a Roman
          Catholic education outside of the neutralized schools. Indeed,
          keeping new generations from having their intelligence
          obliterated by the lies of evil dogma is crucial. But at the
          same time we must take serious steps to ensure that formal
          education is neutral and does not fall into atheism;
          neutrality is sufficient, that is to say the suppression of
          any tendency to insinuate young minds into the false dogma of
          adonaites. In fact, their exists in the human soul an innate
          sense that pushes the individual toward a divine ideal, which
          makes him instinctively understand the existence of a Supreme
          Being, the supernatural factor, the organizer and driving
          force of the universe. We’ll let this sentiment develop
          freely, that is to say, without criminally directing them
          against superstition, the religion of the Evil-God, but
          imported from abroad in the half-light of a vague deism, but
          uncontaminated by the pestiferous breath of Roman Catholicism;
          and when the hour of the Good-God manifests, truly worthy of
          humanity’s worship, the children turned men will address their
          aspirations to Him; and so, by removing the childhood and
          adolescence of Adonai, we devote ourselves to Lucifer, simply
          by natural inclination alone, and the maturity of new
          generations. It is therefore absolutely necessary that the
          atheist teacher clearly be removed from school, lest he try to
          introduce [his own dogma] after we have already driven out the
          adonaite priest, and the instruction books, placed in the
          hands of children after being purged of the lying dogmas of
          Roman Catholicism, posit, but without precise definition, the
          existence of a Supreme Being.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “While the new generations haven’t yet been
          moulded, adonaism must be fought intellectually by all sorts
          of publications demonstrating how monstrous and ridiculous the
          idea of the divinity of the priests of superstition is. In
          this struggle, we must not overlook the pamphlet, satire, and
          mockery, which affect the masses easier than learned
          dissertations. We must never forget the good that Voltaire did
          for our cause, by covering the ridiculousness of Roman
          Catholicism. But it is not for fun and laughs that we’ve
          adopted this perfect tactic: in discrediting false doctrines
          and the cult of the adonaites, we discredit the ministers of
          this detestable religion; we arrive gradually to the desertion
          of its churches. [p. 599]<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “In effect, we should not rely solely on
          the outcome of enacted laws; for if we managed to totally
          deprive the Roman Catholic clergy of state-granted subsidies,
          they would obtain financial compensation extracted directly
          from the fanatics wallowing in an incurable credulity.
          However, by discrediting all the Roman Catholic institutions,
          it does decrease the number of these unfortunate exploits; it
          is necessary for individuals with any sense to realize that,
          recourse to superstition sacraments is ridiculous; in this
          way, for fear of mockery, they may break the habit of
          consorting with impostor priests. It is therefore good to give
          latitude to charlatans of the worst sort, the dregs of false
          prophets, whose business is an obvious scam; inspired by us,
          the press will make comparisons between them and the priests
          of Adonai, confounding the two with reprobation and ridicule.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “On the other hand, through legislative
          means or otherwise, recruitment of the Roman Catholic
          priesthood must be restrained. It would be beneficial to give
          young priests actual knowledge of social life, falsely
          portrayed by their teachers. It will be necessary to have
          confident woman who devote themselves to the benefits and
          initiations of the Good-God. The results obtained in this way
          will be fruitful; for one of two things will happen: either
          the adonaite priest, once he has tasted the sweet joys papal
          barbarism forbade, will resign from the clergy, thus
          demonstrating to the public that nature condemns, absolutely,
          systematic celibacy; or he will remain in the priestly caste,
          secretly with us, not as an ally but entirely ours, rendering
          the most valuable service toward undermining the Temple of
          Adonai.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “In any case and in all circumstances, we
          must create a vacuum around the Roman Catholic priest, and it
          is also necessary that the clergy, after becoming more and
          more despised, hated, and scorned, be diminished in number,
          and to stop at nothing to obtain this result. First, we
          increase societies, circles, non-religious festivals, etc.,
          for the pleasure of urban and rural townspeople; and secondly,
          we advocate boldly and everywhere, like a doctrine, the
          anti-Roman Catholic motto: ‘No priest at birth! no priest at
          marriage! no priest at death!’ while favouring the creation of
          any association established in solidarity with this program.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Finally, we should point out,
          scandalously, ready-made facts authored by a priest of Adonai,
          which might be liable to discredit the priesthood; that is, a
          fact not detrimental by itself, but in as much as it [p. 600]
          contradicts the cruel law of chastity so pretentiously
          asserted by Papism, who claim their clergy are above nature,
          and in this case, it will be advisable not to make a noise
          about it unless the offender is considered incapable of
          becoming our secret agent.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “And that will be the way forward
          throughout all countries of the Christian group.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “In particular, we must pause a moment and
          concentrate on Italy. Here, the Freemasons, while following to
          the letter the policies we have outlined, will have a duty to
          work tirelessly with the greatest zeal, to repeal the law that
          passed three months ago on which the Chief of Political Action
          has called our attention. We begin by attacking at the outset
          the system of two sovereignties in one country, in one
          capital; we will highlight the difficulties resulting from a
          dual diplomatic corps, half of which is the Italian crown in a
          state of permanent conspiracy against their own homeland. This
          campaign of Italian masonry should be supported by masons of
          other countries through an ambassador to the superstitious
          Roman Pontiff; to file motions for the removal of their
          embassies; and on this point, we would emphasize the fact that
          the existence of said papal embassies depends only on the
          magnanimity of the Italians who were willing to recognize a
          cult leader, now without a land, and the nature and
          prerogatives of the sovereign. Then we attack the imprudently
          granted sanctity of the ecclesiastical congregations forming
          the high spiritual administration of the Supreme Headquarters
          of the Roman superstition. It will provoke conflicts between
          the political authorities and any leaders under papal
          authority. We will spare no opportunity to arouse the populace
          against this person, even of the occupant of that cursed seat,
          so that, if he dared leave the Vatican, there would be unrest.
          It should become the habitual public opinion of Italy to
          regard as a dangerous embarrassment the presence of the Pope
          in their country.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “When public opinion is ripe to accept the
          Pope’s expulsion passed by a parliament comprised of a Masonic
          majority, we should propose a bill akin to something like
          following:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Art. 1 – Italy recognizes no state
          religion.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Art. 2 – To continue to have the right to
          exercise its cult, the Christian Church, formerly known as
          Catholic, shall be in Italy exclusively Italian. [p. 601]<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Art. 3 – Its bishops are authorized to
          meet in the national council and appoint someone as the
          Patriarch for the Peninsula, Sardinia and Sicily.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Art. 4 – The present pope is eligible for
          this dignity, provided he relinquishes all superior authority
          other than the Church in Italy.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Art. 5 – The Christian Patriarch of Italy
          has no sovereign status, and no foreign ambassador can be
          accredited to him.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Art. 6 – The Sacred College of Cardinals
          will cease to exist, and the Congregations called the Holy
          Office, the Council, of Propaganda, of Rites, of the Index, of
          Indulgences, and, in a word, all ecclesiastically superior
          Church committees with a view toward universal administration,
          either spiritual or financial.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Art. 7 – The titles of Cardinal and
          Archbishop are abolished; vis-à-vis the civil power, all the
          Bishops are on an equal footing, with the exception of the
          Patriarch, who is the first Italian bishop and who, in
          official state ceremonies, takes his place among the
          Presidents of Supreme Courts and the President of the Court of
          Auditors.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Art. 8 – Each bishop administers his
          diocese under state control; [p. 602] the Bishops must refer
          to the Patriarch in issues purely of a spiritual or liturgical
          nature.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Art. 9 – Any act of the Patriarch,
          committed in violation of the present law, will result in
          immediate dismissal and banishment.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Art. 10 – Every bishop who is found
          complicit in violating the law with the Patriarch, shall incur
          a penalty of imprisonment in a fortress, five to ten years,
          and is also humiliated in the presence of people assembled on
          the public square or the courts of the cathedral of his
          diocese.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Art. 11 – The Central Commission of Cults,
          composed of the secular members of the diocese, and whose
          members are appointed by the Parliament, centralize all
          reports of the civilian authorities on administrative actions
          or other documents related to the dioceses and form a
          permanent Superior Council to settle all disputes between the
          bishops and their ecclesiastical subordinates, except for
          spiritual or liturgical matters which are subject to the
          exclusive supreme jurisdiction of the Patriarch.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Art. 12 – Through secret ballot, Priests
          will be elected by the faithful who remain irremovably
          attached to their parish; current priests, declared eligible
          by this Act, though not imposed on the faithful, will submit
          within six months from this date a confirmation of their
          position and title, voted on freely by their parishioners.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Art. 13 – The Bishops are appointed by the
          Patriarch upon presentation of the government’s chosen three
          candidates; nevertheless, the present bishops who accept this
          religious regulation, will remain in office; those bishops not
          accepted will remain simple priests, and will be provided with
          a rural parish in the vicariate by his successor as head of
          the diocese, but his own vicarage will forever remain out of
          reach.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “At the same time the bill is tabled at the
          Chamber of Deputies of Italy, a copy, which would have
          previously been sent to all infected countries of Roman
          Catholicism, and to newspapers written by us, will soon be
          published everywhere, and accompanied by high praise. A
          concert of articles will celebrate the wisdom of Italian
          liberals, crediting them for having found a good solution to
          the religious question. We’ll attempt to illuminate the
          absurdity of the situation up until now: how wrong it is for
          Italy to have one of its citizens conspiring against the
          homeland, while at the same time the holdout is the head of a
          religion claiming to be universal and professing to place
          himself above the country’s legitimate authorities; how wrong
          it is for other nations to have allowed a veritable state
          within a state, with an entire staff of priests who are in
          reality servants of a foreign sovereign. Newspapers will call
          upon progressive deputies from other countries to promptly
          submit a similar bill, externally emancipating them from the
          national clergy of this cult called catholic, to constitute a
          liberal priesthood of a religion which the faithful have
          nothing in common [p. 603] with those practicing the same
          creed in another country. Great unrest will occur in various
          countries with numerous followers of Roman Catholicism, and,
          by legal means, through a general agreement emanating from
          Freemasonry, we proceed with the disintegration of the
          religion of evil.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “These events will not be fulfilled in
          twenty nor thirty years; we bring it about when Roman
          Catholicism has been totally discredited, when old women and a
          few incurable fools are its sole supporters, and when we have
          secretly acquired a significant portion of its clergy. When
          circumstances are favourable, due to increased legal
          restrictions in one country or another, having already
          completely abolished the finances of the cults and reduced the
          income of the priests of superstition to mere offerings of the
          faithful, in this case, it will be useful in such country or
          countries, to restore state funding to members of various
          clergy, even to the point of being generous toward the priests
          of Adonaism who accept the new situation. We’ll then proclaim
          loudly that the State, trying to protect religion at the
          moment when it ceases to be an excuse for a foreign
          conspiracy, only serves to magnify the sacerdotal body. No
          means should be overlooked to ensure the disintegration of the
          religion of Adonai and to weaken its international character.
          This, in effect, is what will empower us to extirpate it
          completely and permanently. Thus it is not possible to be
          overzealous in the struggle to achieve this important result,
          without ever being discouraged by the difficulties of the
          enterprise.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Moreover, we must nurture in our hearts
          not only hope, but even the certainty that the successful
          disintegration of adonaism is not a chimera; for it is
          promised to us by the revelation in the book On Redemption in
          the Apadno.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It is also said that the Pope of
          superstition, based in Rome at the time of its disntegration,
          refused to acquiesce to the new situation in his Church; and
          he will launch his now powerless thunderbolts against
          governments participating in this great work of social
          salvation. In those days a multitude of priests in various
          countries will abandon the church, owing to the fact that many
          have already been won over [to our cause]; and having been
          expelled in Italy, the Papacy will be cursed, wandering, and
          forced to fall into darkness; because governments will impose
          harsh sentences against those who show continued support and
          who conspire with her.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “But it is also written that, the Wandering
          Pope, pastor of a scattered flock, [p. 604] the helpless
          vessel of Cephas [Peter], and sixth successor of human
          self-pride, which collapsed under the temporal power of the
          infamous pontificate, will be saved, after numerous
          expulsions, by the Slavic autocrats who will bestow upon him
          great honours. Adonaism will then attempt to reconstitute
          itself; the Wandering Pope being close to death in Russia,
          with the imperial autocrat prostrate at his feet, the nations
          will convert to orthodoxy, that is to say, the schismatic
          Eastern religion, rallying quickly to the cause of old Roman
          Catholicism purged from Italy. On his deathbed, the Wandering
          Pope will be happy to witness these new believers replace the
          Westerners who had only recently separated from his church,
          and within the nations who’ve taken part in the disintegration
          of adonaism, some of the faithful remain, hidden from view so
          as to engage in the condemned practices of superstition;
          before dying, he will convene an Episcopate with the bishops
          of the Eastern schismatics, and establish among them Greek and
          Russian Cardinals. His successor will be a Slav; the seat of
          the adonaite Papacy will be established in the northern city
          of Pierre, with the intention of reconquering Rome. But it
          will be in vain that the imperial autocrat, in the hopes of
          extending his rule, becomes a crusader for adonaism; his
          efforts unsuccessful, the former Roman Church will remain
          fragmented in the nations of Western Europe. Thus, Russia is
          the last refuge and bastion of adonaism claiming to be
          catholic.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “In Western nations, once the new religious
          regime will be legalized, it will drastically suppress these
          dangerous propagandists who call themselves missionaries and
          preach to our brothers in Asia, and among the heathen in
          Africa and Oceania whom we must convert, carrying falsehoods
          and poisonous sermons. Governments shall prohibit, under
          severe penalties, these detestable emigrations, which are
          liable to provoke incessant conflicts with Asian nations,
          whose faith has become so perfectly illuminated by the efforts
          of the wise Tibetan priests, united with our auxiliary masonry
          in India and China, and deserving of respect. And without
          waiting for the appointed time of these events, every Mason
          has a duty to fight, through the pen and the word, the
          so-called Catholic missionaries, and trumpet throughout the
          secular world contempt and inextinguishable hatred. These
          missionaries are our mortal enemies. Any Freemason, who
          refuses to fight, will be deemed a traitor; whosoever joins
          them or supports such action with public praise, will be
          beaten to death.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Finally, it is useful to maintain in the
          lower classes of any nation, the ferment of revolutionary
          ideas, even those socialists prone to extreme violence.
          Atheism is bad in itself and to hijack its true purpose and
          work toward humane antichristian restoration, [p. 605] we need
          to channel it and mix it with the most exaggerated social
          doctrines, which are destined for failure, occasioned by a
          momentary disruption, immediately followed by an energetic
          reaction.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “In the last stage, however, first we
          discredit the superstitious theory of divinity in such a way
          that those steeped in adonaisme detach gradually and
          eventually no longer believe at all, the last priests of
          adonaisme eroded and fragmented will be entirely won in the
          era of the new religious regime, which will be a state of
          transition, like free-thinking deism; secondly, we’ll take
          care to not suddenly wrest from the multitudes the belief in
          the supernatural God, but, at every opportunity, we’ll remain
          content to proclaim the existence of a Supreme Being, without
          announcing publicly yet our traditions and our mystic
          revelations. So sayeth the God-Good.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Therefore, when the autocratic Empire of
          Russia will become the citadel of papist adonaism, we shall
          unleash the revolutionary nihilists and atheists, and provoke
          a formidable social cataclysm, which will demonstrate clearly
          to the nations, in all its horror, the effect of absolute
          unbelief, mother of savagery and of the bloodiest disorder.
          Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves
          against the mad minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate
          these destroyers of civilization; and the countless
          disillusioned adonaites, whose deist soul have up until that
          time remained without a compass, thirsting for an ideal, but
          not knowing which God is worthy of tribute, will receive the
          True Light, by the universal manifestation of the pure
          Luciferian doctrine, at last made public, an event that will
          arise from a reactionary movement following the destruction of
          atheism and adonaism, together at the same time vanquished and
          exterminated.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The birth of the religion of the Good-God
          Lucifer, established and unrivalled on the earth, cannot be an
          instantaneous operation, neither in one year nor a century. A
          lasting achievement is that which is created by slow
          progression. The nineteenth century saw the conception of true
          and good Catholicism; the twentieth century will be the
          century of gestation, and climaxing with parturition at a

          Leo Taxil - Hoaxer -- Exactly what William Guy Carr was trying
          to pull, I’ll never know. If you’ve beared it until the end,
          perhaps you’re disappointed to have found nothing about a
          prediction of three world wars, Communism, Nazism and Zionist
          Illuminati – or anything of the sort. A search through the
          entire book, utilizing relevant word combinations, turns up
          nothing either. Instead, what it truly represents is the
          scurrilous fantasies, and militant anti-Catholicism of its
          author: the impostor Leo Taxil aka Dr. Bataille, who profited
          handsomely while having a million laughs at the expense of
          both Christians and Masons; who confessed that his entire
          corpus of anti-Masonic works – spanning twelve years and
          representing thousands of pages (including the translated
          excerpt above) – were a complete and utter fraud; a colossal
          yet ridiculously farcical hoax.<br>
          <br>
          It is enough having shown that the so-called Pike/Mazzini
          letter came from the Taxil hoax and to have provided a full
          translation of it. However, if the reader is so inclined,
          there are plenty of resources to become familiar with all
          facets of the Leo Taxil case in the above embedded links.<br>
          <br>
          Taxil benefited from the atmosphere in France at that time,
          which was indeed rife with anti-clericalism, occultism, and
          outright Satanism. The poets and authors of Romanticism had
          also looked upon Satan and Lucifer as a hero, and became more
          outspoken as anti-clericalism became the norm.<br>
          <br>
          “The Devil had a curious rebirth in the nineteenth century,”
          writes historian Jeffrey Burton Russell.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;Conservative Christians of all denominations continued
          to believe in him, but he was also revived by Romantic
          writers, sometimes as a figure of horror, but more often of
          sympathy, or even a hero. Romantics who supported popular
          revolutions from 1789 onward made Satan a symbol of liberty.
          If revolutions were against kings and priests, Romantics
          admired Satan as the enemy of the greatest king and Priest of
          all, Christ himself. Permutations were nearly infinite. In one
          great poem, Victor Hugo portrays Satan as a lonely hero, cast
          out from the world, full of love and longing, thrust out
          beyond the planets and stars into the empty coldness of space.
          At last he can see only three stars; he strains his wings and
          courage to reach a refuge, but one by one the stars die out
          and he is left in utter darkness. For some Romantics, Satan
          was a redeemer who bought human liberty at the cost of his own
          ruin.&nbsp; – in The Satanism Scare, Bromley, Best and
          Richardson (eds.), Aldine Transaction, 1991, p. 47<br>
          <br>
          The late historian of the occult, James Webb, has a detailed
          chapter on the conditions in France during the period, which
          is highly recommended: The Occult Underground, “Visions of
          Heaven and Hell,” (Open Court, 1990), pp. 153-190; there’s
          also a succinct overview of the Taxil affair, pp. 144-7.<br>
          <br>
          Professor Stefan-Ludwig Hoffmann describes Taxil’s fortuitous
          situation quite well:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is only possible to understand the
          hysteria caused by Taxil’s “revelations” in Germany, France,
          Italy, and Belgium if we take into account the contemporary
          political conflicts between church and the state. Taxil’s
          horror stories were well suited for an era in which people
          yearned for otherworldly experiences beyond the disenchanted
          modern world. During the final third of the nineteenth
          century, European societies vacillated between modern
          occultism and the belief in miracles, on the one hand, and the
          belief in Bildung and progress, on the other. Taxil’s writings
          initially satisfied the needs of anticlerics and subsequently
          those of the clerics. In this way, he popularized the conflict
          between liberalism and political Catholicism, appropriating
          many ideas that had long circulated among the Catholic
          population about “satanic” lodges, as well as ideas about
          sinister Catholicism held by the secular and Protestant
          Bürgertum in Masonic lodges. In occupying both liberal and
          Catholic positions, Taxil mobilized and intensified the
          prejudices of both sides. Only in this way can we explain his
          enormous success, as well as the general popularity of
          anti-Masonic and anti-Catholic pamphlet literature between the
          1880s and the First World War.&nbsp;&nbsp; – The Politics of
          Sociability: Freemasonry and German Civil Society, 1840-1918

          <br>
          Taxil, for his part, had admitted in typical form:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The public made me what I am; the
          arch-liar of the period,” confessed Taxil, “for when I first
          commenced to write against the Masons my object was amusement
          pure and simple. The crimes I laid at their door were so
          grotesque, so impossible, so widely exaggerated, I thought
          everybody would see the joke and give me credit for
          originating a new line of humor. But my readers wouldn’t have
          it so; they accepted my fables as gospel truth, and the more I
          lied for the purpose of showing that I lied, the more
          convinced became they that I was a paragon of veracity.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Then it dawned upon me that there was lots
          of money in being a Munchausen of the right kind, and for
          twelve years I gave it to them hot and strong, but never too
          hot. When inditing such slush as the story of the devil snake
          who wrote prophecies on Diana’s back with the end of his tail,
          I sometimes said to myself: ‘Hold on, you are going too far,’
          but I didn’t. My readers even took kindly to the yarn of the
          devil who, in order to marry a Mason, transformed himself into
          a crocodile, and, despite the masquerade, played the piano
          wonderfully well.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “One day when lecturing at Lille, I told my
          audience that I had just had an apparition of Nautilus, the
          most daring affront on human credulity I had so far risked.
          But my hearers never turned a hair. ‘Hear ye, the doctor has
          seen Nautulius,’ they said with admiring glances. Of course no
          one had a clear idea of who Nautilus was I didn’t myself but
          they assumed that he was a devil. Ah, the jolly evenings I
          spent with my fellow authors hatching out new plots, new,
          unheard of perversions of truth and logic, each trying to
          outdo the other in organized mystification. I thought I would
          kill myself laughing at some of the things proposed, but
          everything went; there is no limit to human stupidity.”<br>

            XII. GRAND MASTER ARCHITECT.<br>
            [Master Architect.]<br>
            <br>
          </b>THE great duties that are inculcated by the lessons taught
          by the workinginstrumentsof a Grand Master Architect,
          demanding so much of us, and taking for granted the capacity
          to perform them faithfully and fully, bring us at once to
          reflect upon the dignity of human nature, and the vast powers
          and capacities of the human soul; and to that theme we invite
          your attention in this Degree. Let us begin to rise from earth
          toward the Stars. <br>
          <br>
          Evermore the human soul struggles toward the light, toward
          God, and the Infinite. It is especially so in its afflictions.
          Words go but a little way into the depths of sorrow. The
          thoughts that writhe there in silence, that go into the
          stillness of Infinitude and Eternity, have no emblems.
          Thoughts enough come there, such as no tongue ever uttered.
          They do not so much want human sympathy, as higher help. There
          is a loneliness in deep sorrow which the Deity alone can
          relieve. Alone, the mind wrestles with the great problem of
          calamity, and seeks the solution from the Infinite Providence
          of Heaven, and thus is led directly to God ...<br>
          <br>
          <b>WORD&nbsp; // AZILUTH</b><br>
          <br>
          "The word of God," says the writer of the apostolic letter to
          the Hebrews, "is quick and powerful, and sharper than any
          two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul
          and spirit." "The sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of
          God," says Paul, writing to the Christians at Ephesus. "I will
          fight against them with the sword of my mouth," it is said in
          the Apocalypse, to the angel of the church at Pergamos.<br>
          <br>
          The Tetractys thus leads you, not only to the study of the
          Pythagorean philosophy as to numbers, but also to the Kabalah,
          and will aid you in discovering the True Word, and
          understanding what was meant by "The Music of the Spheres."
          Modern science strikingly confirms the ideas of Pythagoras in
          regard to the properties of numbers, and that they govern in
          the Universe. Long before his time, nature had extracted her
          cube-roots and her squares.<br>
          <br>
          Pythagoras defined God: a Living and Absolute Verity clothed
          with Light. He said that the Word was Number manifested by
          Form. He made all descend from the Tetyactys, that is to say,
          from the Quaternary. God, he said again, is the Supreme Music,
          the nature of which is Harmony.<br>
          <br>
          It is to this philosophic and incontestable reality, which is
          termed The Idea of God, that the Kabalists give a name. In
          this name all others are contained. Its cyphers contain all
          the numbers; and the hieroglyphics of its letters express all
          the laws and all the things of nature.<br>
          <br>
          BEING IS BEING: the reason of Being is in Being: in the
          Beginning is the Word, and the Word in logic formulated
          Speech, the spoken Reason; the Word is in God, and is God
          Himself, manifested to the Intelligence. Here is what is above
          all the philosophies. This we must believe, under the penalty
          of never truly knowing anything, and relapsing into the absurd
          skepticism of Pyrrho. The Priesthood, custodian of Faith,
          wholly rests upon this basis of knowledge, and it is in its
          teachings we must recognize the Divine Principle<br>
          of the Eternal Word.<br>
          <br>
          Light is not Spirit, as the Indian Plato, writing to Dionysius
          the Younger, in regard to the nature of the First Principle,
          says: "I must write to you in enigmas, so that if my letter be
          intercepted by land or sea, he who shall read it may in no
          degree comprehend it." And then he says, "All things surround
          their King; they are, on account of Him, and He alone is the
          cause of good things, Second for the Seconds and Third for the
          Thirds."<br>
          <br>
          There is in these few words a complete summary of the Theology
          of the Sephiroth. "The King" is AINSOPH, Being Supreme and
          Absolute. From this centre, which is everywhere, all things
          ray forth; but we especially conceive of it in three manners
          and in three different spheres. In the Divine world (AZILUTH),
          which is that of the First Cause, and wherein the whole
          Eternity of Things in the beginning existed as Unity, to be
          afterward, during Eternity uttered forth, clothed with form,
          and the attributes that constitute them matter, the First
          Principle is Single and First, and yet not the VERY
          Illimitable Deity, incomprehensible, undefinable; but Himself
          in so far as manifested by the Creative Thought.....<br>
          <br>
          In the World of Creation, which is that of Second Causes [the
          Kabalistic World BRIAH], the Autocracy of the First Principle
          is complete, but we conceive of it only as the Cause of the
          Second Causes. Here it is manifested by the Binary, and is the
          Creative Principle passive. Finally: in the third world,
          YEZIRAH, or of Formation, it is revealed in the perfect Form,
          the Form of Forms, the World, the Supreme Beauty and
          Excellence, the Created Perfection. Thus the Principle is at
          once the First, the Second, and the Third, since it is All in
          All, the Centre and Cause of all. It is not the genius of
          Plato that we here admire.<br>
          <br>
          We recognize only the exact knowledge of the Initiate. <br>
          <br>
          The great Apostle Saint John did not borrow from the
          philosophy of Plato the opening of his Gospel. Plato, on the
          contrary, drank at the same springs with Saint John and Philo;
          and John in the opening verses of his paraphrase, states the
          first principles of a dogma common to many schools, but in
          language especially belonging to Bhilo, whom it is evident he
          had read. The philosophy of Plato, the greatest of human
          Revealers, could yearn toward the Word made man; the Gospel
          alone could give him to the world.<br>

          The perception of the Light is the dawn of the Eternal Life,
          in Being. The Word of God, which creates the Light, seems to
          be uttered by every Intelligence that can take cognizance of
          Forms and will look. "Let the Light BE! The Light, in fact,
          exists, in its condition of splendor, for those eyes alone
          that gaze at it; and the Soul, amorous of the spectacle of the
          beauties of the Universe, and applying its attention to that
          luminous writing of the Infinite Book, which is called "The
          Visible," seems to utter, as God did on the dawn of the first
          day, that sublime and creative word, "BE! LIGHT !"<br>

          <b>XIII. ROYAL ARCH OF SOLOMON.</b><br>
          <br>
          WHETHER the legend and history of this Degree are historically
          true, or but an allegory, containing in itself a deeper truth
          and a profounder meaning, we shall not now debate. If it be
          but a legendary myth, you must find out for yourself what it
          means. It is certain that the word which the Hebrews are not
          now permitted to pronounce was in common use by Abraham, Lot,
          Isaac, Jacob, Laban, Rebecca, and even among tribes foreign to
          the Hebrews, before the time of Moses; and that it recurs a
          hundred times in the lyrical effusions of David and other
          Hebrew poets. <br>
          <br>
          We know that for many centuries the Hebrews have been
          forbidden to pronounce the Sacred Name; that wherever it
          occurs, they have for ages read the word Adonaï instead; and
          that under it, when the masoretic points, which represent the
          vowels, came to be used, they placed those which belonged to
          the latter word. The possession of the true pronunciation was
          deemed to confer on him who had it extraordinary and
          supernatural powers; and the Word itself, worn upon the
          person, was regarded as an amulet, a protection against
          personal danger, sickness, and evil spirits. We know that all
          this was a vain superstition, natural to a rude people,
          necessarily disappearing as the intellect of man became
          enlightened; and wholly unworthy of a Mason.<br>
          <br>
          It is noticeable that this notion of the sanctity of the
          Divine Name or Creative Word was common to all the ancient
          nations. The Sacred Word HOM was supposed by the ancient
          Persians (who were among the earliest emigrants from Northern
          India) to be pregnant with a mysterious power; and they taught
          that by its utterance the world was created. In India it was
          forbidden to pronounce the word AUM or OM, the Sacred Name of
          the One Deity, manifested as Brahma, Vishna, and Seeva.<br>
          <br>
          These superstitious notions in regard to the efficacy of the
          Word, and the prohibition against pronouncing it, could, being
          errors, have formed no part of the pure primitive religion, or
          of the esoteric doctrine taught by Moses, and the full
          knowledge of which was confined to the Initiates; unless the
          whole was but an ingenious invention for the concealment of
          some other Name or truth, the interpretation and meaning
          whereof was made known only to the select few. If so, the
          common notions in regard to the Word grew up in the minds of
          the people, like other errors and fables among all the ancient
          nations, out of original truths and symbols and allegories
          misunderstood. So it has always been that allegories, intended
          as vehicles of truth, to be understood by the sages, have
          become or bred errors, by being literally accepted.<br>
          <br>
          It is true, that before the masoretic points were invented
          (which was after the beginning of the Christian era), the
          pronunciation of a word in the Hebrew language could not be
          known from the characters in which it was written. It was,
          therefore, possible for that of the name of the Deity to have
          been forgotten and lost. It is certain that its true
          pronunciation is not that represented by the word Jehovah; and
          therefore that that is not the true name of Deity, nor the
          Ineffable Word. <br>
          <br>
          Therefore that that is not the true name of Deity, nor the
          Ineffable Word. The ancient symbols and allegories always had
          more than one interpretation. They always had a double meaning
          had more than one interpretation. They always had a double
          meaning, and sometimes more than two, one serving as the
          envelope of the other. Thus the pronunciation of the word was
          a symbol; and that pronunciation and the word itself were
          lost, when the knowledge of the true nature and attributes of
          God faded out of the minds of the Jewish people. That is one
          interpretation - true, but not the inner and profoundest one.
          Men were figuratively said to forget the name of God, when
          they lost that knowledge, and worshipped the heathen deities,
          and burned incense to them on the high places, and passed
          their children through the fire to Moloch.<br>
          <br>
          Thus the attempts of the ancient Israelites and of the
          Initiates to ascertain the True Name of the Deity, and its
          pronunciation, and the loss of the True Word, are an allegory,
          in which are represented the general ignorance of the true
          nature and attributes of God, the proneness of the people of
          Judah and Israel to worship other deities, and the low and
          erroneous and dishonoring notions of the Grand Architect of
          the Universe, which all shared except a few favored persons;
          for even Solomon built altars and sacrificed to Astara and
          animals: and the Scandinavians by ODIN, FREA, and THOR.<br>
          <br>
          In the KABALAH, or the Hebrew traditional philosophy, the
          Infinite Deity, beyond the reach of the Human Intellect, and
          without Name, Form, or Limitation, was represented as
          developing Himself, in order to create, and by
          self-limitation, in ten emanations or out-flowings, called
          SEPHIROTH, or rays, The first of these, in the world AZILUTH,
          that is, within the Deity, was KETHER, or the Crown, by which
          we understand the Divine Will or Potency. Next came, as a
          pair, HAI",MAH and BAINAH, ordinarily translated "Wisdom" and
          "Intelligence," the former termed the FATHER, and the latter
          the MOTHER. HAKEMAH is the active Power or Energy of Deity, by
          which He produces within Himself Intellection or Thinking: and
          BAINAH, the passive Capacity, from which, acted on by the
          Power, the Intellection flows. This Intellection is called
          DAATH: and it is the "WORD," of Plato and the Gnostics; the
          unuttered word, within the Deity. Here is the origin of the
          Trinity of the Father, the Mother or Holy Spirit, and the Son
          or Word.<br>
          <br>
          The Gospel of St. John is in great measure a polemic against
          the Gnostics, whose different sects, to solve the great
          problems, the creation of a material world by an immaterial
          Being, the fall of man, the incarnation, the redemption and
          restoration of the spirits called men, admitted a long series
          of intelligences, intervening in a series of spiritual
          operations; and which they designated by the names, The
          Beginning, the Word, the Only-Begotten, Life, Light, and
          Spirit [Ghost]: in Greek, Mo- and [Archë, Logos, Monogenës,
          Zöe, Phös, and Pneuma]. St. John, at the beginning of his
          Gospel, avers that it was Jesus Christ who existed in the
          Beginning; that He was the WORD of God by which everything was
          made; that He was the Only-Begotten, the Life and the Light,
          and that He diffuses among men the Holy Spirit [or Ghost], the
          Divine Life and Light...<br>
          <br>
          By Marcus, the disciple of Valentinus, the idea of a [Logos
          Tou Ontos], of a WORD, manifesting the hidden Divine Essence,
          in the Creation, was spun out into the most subtle details -
          the entire creation being, in his view, a continuous utterance
          of the Ineffable. The way in which the germs of divine life
          [the …. spermata pneumatika], which lie shut up in the Eons,
          continually unfold and individualize them selves more and
          more, is represented as a spontaneous analysis of the several
          names of the Ineffable, into their several sounds. An echo of
          the Plëroma falls down into the [HuIë], and becomes the
          forming of a new but lower creation.<br>
          <br>
          One formula of the pneumatical baptism among the Gnostics ran
          thus: "In the NAME which is hidden from all the Divinities and
          Powers" [of the Demiurge], "The Name of Truth" [the
          [Aletheial, self-manifestation of the Buthos], which Jesus of
          Nazareth has put on in the light-zones of Christ, the living
          Christ, through the Holy Ghost, for the redemption of the
          angels, - the Name by which all things attain to Perfection."
          ...<br>
          <br>
          Tatian adopted the theory of Emanation, of Eons, of the
          existence of a God too sublime to allow Himself to be known,
          but displaying Himself by Intelligences emanating from His
          bosom. The first of these was His spirit [ ….. Pneuma], God
          Himself, God thinking, God conceiving the Universe. The second
          was the Word [ … Logos], no longer merely the Thought or
          Conception, but the Creative Utterance, manifestation of the
          Divinity, but emanating from the Thought or Spirit; the
          First-Begotten, author of the visible creation. This was the
          Trinity, composed of the Father, Spirit, and Word...<br>
          <br>
          Noëtus termed the Son the first Utterance of the Father; the
          Word, not by Himself, as an Intelligence, and unconnected with
          the flesh, a real Son; but a Word, and a perfect
          Only-Begotten; light emanated from the Light; water flowing
          from its spring; a ray emanated from the Sun. Paul of Samosata
          taught that Jesus Christ was the Son of Joseph and Mary; but
          that the Word, Wisdom, or Intelligence of God, the [Nous] of
          the Gnostics, had united itself with Him, so that He might be
          said to be at once the Son of God, and God Himself. ...<br>
          <br>
          According to the Church, Christ was of the same nature as God;
          according to some dissenters, of the same nature as man. Arius
          adopted the theory of a nature analogous to both. When God
          resolved to create the Human race, He made a Being which He
          called THE WORD, THE SON, WISDOM [ …. Logos, Uios, Sophia], to
          the end that He might give existence to men. This WORD is the
          Ormuzd of Zoroaster, the Ensoph of the Kabalah, the ; of
          Platonism and Philonism, and the or [Sophia or Demiourgos] of
          the Gnostics.<br>
          <br>
          The universal belief of the Orient was, that the Supreme Being
          did not Himself create either the earth or man. The fragment
          which commences the Book of Genesis, consisting of the first
          chapter and the three first verses of the second, assigns the
          creation or rather the formation or modelling of the world
          from matter already existing in confusion, not to lHUH, but to
          the ALHIM, well known as Subordinate Deities, Forces, or
          Manifestations, among the Phoenicians. The second fragment
          imputes it to IHUH-ALHIM,* and St. John assigns the creation
          to the or WORD; and asserts that CHRIST was that WORD, as well
          as LIGHT and LIFE, other emanations from the Great Primeval
          Deity, to which other faiths had assigned the work of
          creation...<br>
          <br>
          And, as the Thought of the Soul, emanating from the Soul,
          becomes audible and visible in Words, so did THE THOUGHT OF
          GOD, springing up within Himself, immortal as Himself, when
          once conceived, - immortal before, because in Himself, utter
          Itself in THE WORD, its manifestation and mode of
          communication, and thus create the Material, Mental, Spiritual
          Universe, which, like Him, never began to exist.<br>
          <br>
          This is the real idea of the Ancient Nations: GOD, the
          Almighty Father, and Source of All; His THOUGHT, conceiving
          the whole Universe, and willing its creation: His WORD,
          uttering that THOUGHT, and thus becoming the Creator or
          Demiourgos, in the whom was Life and Light, and that Light the
          Life of the Universe.<br>
          <br>
          And, as the Thought of the Soul, emanating from the Soul,
          becomes audible and visible in Words, so did THE THOUGHT OF
          GOD, springing up within Himself, immortal as Himself, when
          once conceived, - immortal before, because in Himself, utter
          Itself in THE WORD, its manifestation and mode of
          communication, and thus create the Material, Mental, Spiritual
          Universe, which, like Him, never began to exist.<br>
          <br>
          This is the real idea of the Ancient Nations: GOD, the
          Almighty Father, and Source of All; His THOUGHT, conceiving
          the whole Universe, and willing its creation: His WORD,
          uttering that THOUGHT, and thus becoming the Creator or
          Demiourgos, in the whom was Life and Light, and that Light the
          Life of the Universe.<br>
          <br>
          The Master's word, supposed to be lost, symbolizes the
          Christian faith and religion, supposed to have been crushed
          and destroyed when the Saviour was crucified, after Iscariot
          had betrayed Him, and Peter deserted Him, and when the other
          disciples doubted whether He would arise from the dead; but
          which rose from His tomb and flowed rapidly over the civilized
          world; and so that which was supposed to be lost was found. It
          symbolizes also the Saviour Himself; the WORD that was in the
          beginning--that was with God, and that was God; the Word of
          life, that was made flesh and dwelt among us, and was supposed
          to be lost, while He lay in the tomb, for three days, and His
          disciples "as yet knew not the scripture that He must rise
          again from the dead," and doubted when they heard of it, and
          were amazed and frightened and still doubted when He appeared
          among them...<br>
          <br>
          All errors are not equally innocuous. That which is most
          injurious is to entertain unworthy conceptions of the nature
          and attributes of God; and it is this that Masonry symbolizes
          by ignorance of the True Word. The true word of a Mason is,
          not the entire, perfect, absolute truth in regard to God; but
          the highest and noblest conception of Him that our minds are
          capable of forming; and this word is Ineffable, because one
          man cannot communicate to another his own conception of Deity;
          since every man's conception of God must be proportioned to
          his mental cultivation and intellectual powers, and moral
          excellence. God is, as man conceives Him, the reflected image
          of man himself...<br>
          <br>
          To Philo, the Supreme Being was the Primitive Light, or the
          Archetype of Light, Source whence the rays emanate that
          illuminate Souls. He was also the Soul of the Universe, and as
          such acted in all its parts. He Himself fills and limits His
          whole Being. His Powers and Virtues fill and penetrate all.
          These Powers (dunameis) are Spirits distinct from God, the
          "Ideas" of Plato personified. He is without beginning, and
          lives in the prototype of Time (aion). His image is THE WORD,
          a form more brilliant than fire; that not being the pure
          light. This LOGOS dwells in God; for the Supreme Being makes
          to Himself within His Intelligence the types or ideas of
          everything that is to become reality in this World. The LOGOS
          is the vehicle by which God acts on the Universe, and may be
          compared to the speech of man...<br>
          <br>
          The Word is not only the Creator, but occupies the place of
          the Supreme Being. Through Him all the Powers and Attributes
          of God act. On the other side, as first representative of the
          Human Family, He is the Protector of men and their Shepherd.
          God gives to man the Soul or Intelligence, which exists before
          the body, and which he unites with the body. The reasoning<br>
          Principle comes from God through the Word, and communes with
          God and with the Word; but there is also in man an irrational
          Principle, that of the inclinations and passions which produce
          disorder, emanating from inferior spirits who fill the air as
          ministers of God. The body, taken from the Earth, and the
          irrational Principle that animates it concurrently with the
          rational Principle, are hated by God, while the rational soul
          which He has given it, is, as it were, captive in this prison,
          this coffin, that encompasses it. The present condition of man
          is not his primitive condition, when he was the image of the
          Logos. He hats fallen from his first estate. But he may raise
          himself again, by following the directions of WISDOM and of
          the Angels which God has commissioned to aid him in freeing
          himself from he bonds of the body, and combating Evil, the
          existence whereof God has permitted, to furnish him the means
          of exercising his liberty. The souls that are purified, not by
          the Law but by light, rise to the Heavenly regions, to enjoy
          there a perfect felicity. Those that persevere in evil go from
          body to body, the seats of passions and evil desires. The
          familiar lineaments of these doctrines will be recognized by
          all who read the Epistles of St. Paul, who wrote after Philo,
          the latter living till the reign of Caligula, and being the
          contemporary of Christ.<br>
          <br>
          And the Mason is familiar with these doctrines of Philo: that
          the Supreme Being is a centre of Light whose rays or
          emanations pervade the Universe; for that is the Light for
          which all Masonic journeys are a search, and of which the sun
          and moon in our Lodges are only emblems: that Light and
          Darkness, chief enemies from the beginning of Time, dispute
          with each other the empire of the world; which we symbolize by
          the candidate wandering in darkness and being brought to
          light: that the world was created, not by the Supreme Being,
          but by a secondary agent, who is but His WORD, and by types
          which are but his ideas, aided by an INTELLIGENCE, or WISDOM,
          which gives one of His Attributes; in which we see the occult
          meaning of the necessity of recovering "the Word"; and of our
          two columns of STRENGTH and WISDOM, which are also the two
          parallel lines that bound the circle representing the
          Universe: that the visible world is the image of the invisible
          world; that the essence of the Human Soul is the image of God,
          and it existed before the body; that the object of its
          terrestrial life is to disengage itself of its body or its
          sepulchre; and that it will ascend to the Heavenly regions
          whenever it shall be purified...<br>
          <br>
          The first HERMES was the INTELLIGENCE, or WORD of God. Moved
          with compassion for a race living without law, and wishing to
          teach them that they sprang from His bosom, and to point out
          to them the way that they should go (the books which the first
          Hermes, the same with Enoch, had written on the mysteries of
          divine science, in the sacred characters, being unknown to
          those who lived after the flood), God sent to man OSIRIS and
          ISIS, acaccompanied by THOTH, the incarnation or terrestrial
          repetition of the first Hermes; who taught men the arts,
          science, and the ceremonies of religion; and then ascended to
          Heaven or the Moon...<br>
          <br>
          But one grand idea ever emerged and stood prominent and
          unchangeable over the weltering chaos of confusion. God is
          great, and good, and wise. Evil and pain and sorrow are
          temporary, and for wise and beneficent purposes. They must be
          consistent with God's goodness, purity, and infinite
          perfection; and there must be a mode of explaining them, if we
          could but find it out;<br>
          as, in all ways we will endeavor to do. Ultimately, Good will
          prevail, and Evil be overthrown. God, alone can do this, and
          He will do it, by an Emanation from Himself, assuming the
          Human form and redeeming the world.<br>
          <br>
          Behold the object, the end, the result, of the great
          speculations and logomachies of antiquity; the ultimate
          annihilation of evil, and restoration of Man to his first
          estate, by a Redeemer, a Masayah, a Christos, the incarnate
          Word, Reason, or Power of Deity. This Redeemer is the Word or
          Logos, the Ormuzd of Zoroaster, the Ainsoph of the Kabalah,
          the Nous of Platonism and Philonism; He that was in the
          Beginning with God, and was God, and by Whom everything was
          made. That He was looked for by all the People of the East is
          abundantly shown by the Gospel of John and the Letters of
          Paul; wherein scarcely anything seemed necessary to be said in
          proof that such a Redeemer was to come; but all the energies
          of the writers are devoted to showing that Jesus was that
          Christos whom all the nations were expecting; the "Word," the
          Masayah, the Anointed or Consecrated One. In this Degree the
          great contest between good and evil, in anticipation of the
          appearance and advent of the Word or Redeemer is symbolized;
          and the mysterious esoteric teachings of the Essenes and the
          Cabalists.<br>
          <br>
          "When God resolved to create the human race," said Arius, "He
          made a Being that He called The WORD, The Son, Wisdom, to the
          end that this Being might give existence to men." This WORD is
          the Ormuzd of Zoroaster, the Ainsoph of the Kabalah, the Nous
          of Plato and Philo, the Wisdom or Demiourgos of the Gnostics.
          That is the True Word, the knowledge of which our ancient
          brethren sought as the priceless reward of their labors on the
          Holy Temple: the Word of Life, the Divine Reason, "in whom was
          Life, and that Life the Light of men";"which long shone in
          darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not;" the Infinite
          Reason that is the Soul of Nature, immortal, of which the Word
          of this Degree reminds us; and to believe wherein and revere
          it, is the peculiar duty of every Mason. "In the beginning,"
          says the extract from some older work, with which John
          commences his Gospel, "was the Word, and the Word was near to
          God, and the Word was God. All things were made by Him, and
          without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him was
          Life, and the life was the Light of man; and the light shineth
          in darkness, and the darkness did not contain it."<br>
          <br>
          It is an old tradition that this passage was from an older
          work To Philo the Jew, as to the Gnostics, the Supreme Being
          was the Primitive Light, or Archetype of Light,-Source whence
          the rays emanate that illuminate Souls. He is the Soul of the
          World, and as such acts everywhere. He himself fills and
          bounds his whole existence, and his forces fill and penetrate
          everything. His Image is the WORD [LOGOS], a form more
          brilliant than fire, which is not pure light. This WORD dwells
          in God; for it is within His Intelligence that the Supreme
          Being frames for Himself the Types of Ideas of all that is to
          assume reality in the Universe. The WORD is the Vehicle by
          which God acts on the Universe; the World of Ideas by means
          whereof God has created visible things; the more Ancient God,
          as compared with the Material World; Chief and General
          Representative of all Intelligences; the Archangel and
          representative of all spirits, even those of Mortals; the type
          of Man; the primitive man himself. These ideas are borrowed
          from Plato. And this Word is not only the Creator ["by Him was
          everything made that was made"], but acts in the place of God
          and through him act all the Powers and Attributes of God. And
          also, as first representative of the human race, he is the
          protector of Men and their Shepherd, the "Ben H'Adam," or Son
          of Man ...<br>
          <br>
          Apollonius of Tyana says:"We shall render the most appropriate
          worship to the Deity, when to that God whom we call the First,
          who is One, and separate from all, and after whom we recognize
          the others, we present no offerings whatever, kindle to Him no
          fire, dedicate to Him no sensible thing; for he needs nothing,
          even of all that natures more exalted than ours could give.
          The earth produces no plant, the air nourishes no animal,
          there is in short nothing, which would not be impure in his
          sight. In addressing ourselves to Him, we must use only the
          higher word, that, I mean, which is not expressed by the
          mouth,--the silent inner word of the spirit ..... From the
          most Glorious of all Beings, we must seek for blessings, by
          that which is most glorious in ourselves; and that is the
          spirit, which needs no organ." Strabo says: "This one Supreme
          Essence is that which embraces us all, the water and the land,
          that which we call the Heavens, the World, the Nature of
          things. This Highest Being should be worshipped, without any
          visible image, in sacred groves. In such retreats the devout
          should lay themselves down to sleep, and expect signs from God
          in dreams." ...<br>
          <br>
          The Universe, which is the uttered Word of God, is infinite in
          extent. There is no empty space beyond creation on any side.
          The Universe, which is the Thought of God pronounced, never<br>
          was not, since God never was inert; nor WAS, without thinking
          and creating. The forms of creation change, the suns and
          worlds live and die like the leaves and the insects, but the
          Universe itself is infinite and eternal, because God Is, Was,
          and Will forever Be,...<br>
          <br>
          BEING IS BEING, Ahayah Asar Ahayah. This is the principle, the
          "BEGINNING." In the Beginning was, that is to say, IS, WAS,
          and WILL BE, the WORD, that is to say, the REASON that Speaks.
          The Word is the reason of belief, and in it also is the
          expression of the Faith which makes Science a living thing.
          The Word, is the Source of Logic. Jesus is the Word
          Incarnate...<br>

          <b>XXVI. PRINCE OF MERCY, OR SCOTTISH TRINITARIAN.</b><br>
          <br>
          WHILE you were veiled in darkness, you heard repeated by the
          Voice of the Great Past its most ancient doctrines. None has
          the right to object, if the Christian Mason sees foreshadowed
          in Chrishna and Sosiosch, in Mithras and Osiris, the Divine
          WORD that, as he believes, became Man, and died upon the cross
          to redeem a fallen race. Nor can he object if others see
          reproduced, in the WORD of the beloved Disciple, that was in
          the beginning with God, and that was God, and by Whom
          everything was made, only the LOGOS of Plato, and the WORD or
          Uttered THOUGHT or first Emanation of LIGHT, or the Perfect
          REASON of the Great, Silent, Supreme, Uncreated Deity,
          believed in and adored by all...<br>
          <br>
          In the KABALAH, or the Hebrew traditional philosophy, the
          Infinite Deity, beyond the reach of the Human Intellect, and
          without Name, Form, or Limitation, was represented as
          developing Himself, in order to create, and by
          self-limitation, in ten emanations or out-flowings, called
          SEPHIROTH, or rays, The first of these, in the world AZILUTH,
          that is, within the Deity, was KETHER, or the Crown, by which
          we understand the Divine Will or Potency. Next came, as a
          pair, HAI",MAH and BAINAH, ordinarily translated "Wisdom" and
          "Intelligence," the former termed the FATHER, and the latter
          the MOTHER. HAKEMAH is the active Power or Energy of Deity, by
          which He produces within Himself Intellection or Thinking: and
          BAINAH, the passive Capacity, from which, acted on by the
          Power, the Intellection flows. This Intellection is called
          DAATH: and it is the "WORD," of Plato and the Gnostics; the
          unuttered word, within the Deity. Here is the origin of the
          Trinity of the Father, the Mother or Holy Spirit, and the Son
          or Word.<br>
