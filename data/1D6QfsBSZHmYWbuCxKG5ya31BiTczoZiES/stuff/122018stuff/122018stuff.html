Video series 4, Part 1A is 40 minutes long. There is a part 1B that is
also 40 minutes long. This video&nbsp; covers the most important
information for anyone on this planet because I will fully explain what
causes the ice ages and why they happen immediately after a geomagnetic
reversal (Pole shift, polar reversal). The last time it happened was
about 12,000 years age and it is estimated that only about 30 fertile
females survived and all of us are related to one of them.<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will cover the cause of the Ice Ages at the
time of Geomagnetic Reversals. The earth does not flip over on itself.
Only the magnetic field reverses. I will explain the mechanism that
creates the ice age and ice fields. This information has never been
taught before because government felt it was too disruptive to society.
Even if you have a degree in geology, astronomy or other related field,
you were deliberately never taught this information. You were taught
alternate explanations for the phenomena. The research revealed the
Greatest Secret the Country has and the CIAs Involvement how they kept
the information concealed from the public. You are going to find out
what event caused the government to engineer the concealment. I am
going to give you the Education you were supposed to have gotten when
you went to College. I am going to present this information unblemished
and treat all of you like mature adults, but I warn you that this
information will scare you and change your life. I present this
information because I want some people to survive the reversal event

<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Researchers
use jiggly Jell-O to make powerful new hydrogen fuel catalyst</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">by Kara Manke</span><br>
</div>
<br>
A cheap and effective new catalyst developed by researchers at the
University of California, Berkeley, can generate hydrogen fuel from
water just as efficiently as platinum, currently the best &#8212; but also
most expensive &#8212; water-splitting catalyst out there.<br>
<br>
The catalyst, which is composed of nanometer-thin sheets of metal
carbide, is manufactured using a self-assembly process that relies on a
surprising ingredient: gelatin, the material that gives Jell-O its
jiggle.<br>
<br>
&#8220;Platinum is expensive, so it would be desirable to find other
alternative materials to replace it,&#8221; said senior author Liwei Lin,
professor of mechanical engineering at UC Berkeley. &#8220;We are actually
using something similar to the Jell-O that you can eat as the
foundation, and mixing it with some of the abundant earth elements to
create an inexpensive new material for important catalytic reactions.&#8221;<br>
<br>
The work appears in the Dec. 13 print edition of the journal Advanced
Materials.<br>
<br>
A zap of electricity can break apart the strong bonds that tie water
molecules together, creating oxygen and hydrogen gas, the latter of
which is an extremely valuable source of energy for powering hydrogen
fuel cells. Hydrogen gas can also be used to help store energy from
renewable yet intermittent energy sources like solar and wind power,
which produce excess electricity when the sun shines or when the wind
blows, but which go dormant on rainy or calm days.<br>
<br>
But simply sticking an electrode in a glass of water is an extremely
inefficient method of generating hydrogen gas. For the past 20 years,
scientists have been searching for catalysts that can speed up this
reaction, making it practical for large-scale use.<br>
<br>
&#8220;The traditional way of using water gas to generate hydrogen still
dominates in industry. However, this method produces carbon dioxide as
byproduct,&#8221; said first author Xining Zang, who conducted the research
as a graduate student in mechanical engineering at UC Berkeley.
&#8220;Electrocatalytic hydrogen generation is growing in the past decade,
following the global demand to lower emissions. Developing a highly
efficient and low-cost catalyst for electrohydrolysis will bring
profound technical, economical and societal benefit.&#8221;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
To create the catalyst, the researchers followed a recipe nearly as
simple as making Jell-O from a box. They mixed gelatin and a metal ion
&#8212; either molybdenum, tungsten or cobalt &#8212; with water, and then let the
mixture dry.<br>
<br>
&#8220;We believe that as gelatin dries, it self-assembles layer by layer,&#8221;
Lin said. &#8220;The metal ion is carried by the gelatin, so when the gelatin
self-assembles, your metal ion is also arranged into these flat layers,
and these flat sheets are what give Jell-O its characteristic
mirror-like surface.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Heating the mixture to 600 degrees Celsius triggers the metal ion to
react with the carbon atoms in the gelatin, forming large,
nanometer-thin sheets of metal carbide. The unreacted gelatin burns
away.<br>
<br>
The researchers tested the efficiency of the catalysts by placing them
in water and running an electric current through them. When stacked up
against each other, molybdenum carbide split water the most
efficiently, followed by tungsten carbide and then cobalt carbide,
which didn&#8217;t form thin layers as well as the other two. Mixing
molybdenum ions with a small amount of cobalt boosted the performance
even more.<br>
<br>
It is possible that other forms of carbide may provide even better
performance,&#8221; Lin said.<br>
<br>
The two-dimensional shape of the catalyst is one of the reasons why it
is so successful. That is because the water has to be in contact with
the surface of the catalyst in order to do its job, and the large
surface area of the sheets mean that the metal carbides are extremely
efficient for their weight.<br>
<br>
Because the recipe is so simple, it could easily be scaled up to
produce large quantities of the catalyst, the researchers say.<br>
<br>
&#8220;We found that the performance is very close to the best catalyst made
of platinum and carbon, which is the gold standard in this area,&#8221; Lin
said. &#8220;This means that we can replace the very expensive platinum with
our material, which is made in a very scalable manufacturing process.&#8221;<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
Low&#8208;dimensional (0/1/2 dimension) transition metal carbides (TMCs)
possess intriguing electrical, mechanical, and electrochemical
properties, and they serve as convenient supports for transition metal
catalysts. Large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystalline 2D TMC sheets are generally
prepared by exfoliating MXene sheets from MAX phases. Here, a versatile
bottom&#8208;up method is reported for preparing ultrathin TMC sheets (&#8776;10 nm
in thickness and &gt;100 &#956;m in lateral size) with metal nanoparticle
decoration. A gelatin hydrogel is employed as a scaffold to coordinate
metal ions (Mo5+, W6+, Co2+), resulting in ultrathin&#8208;film morphologies
of diverse TMC sheets. Carbonization of the scaffold at 600 &deg;C
presents a facile route to the corresponding MoCx, WCx, CoCx, and to
metal&#8208;rich hybrids (Mo2&#8722;xWxC and W/Mo2C&#8211;Co). Among these materials, the
Mo2C&#8211;Co hybrid provides excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)
efficiency (Tafel slope of 39 mV dec&#8722;1 and 48 mVj = 10 mA cm&#8208;2 in
overpotential in 0.5 m H2SO4). Such performance makes Mo2C&#8211;Co a viable
noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst for the HER, and is competitive with the
standard platinum on carbon support. This template&#8208;assisted,
self&#8208;assembling, scalable, and low&#8208;cost manufacturing process presents
a new tactic to construct low&#8208;dimensional TMCs with applications in
various clean&#8208;energy&#8208;related fields.<br>

<br>
Antonio and Rosario Marciano administrators of the Italian website
TANKER ENEMY produced the film : &#8220; Chemtrails the secret war &#8221;. This HD
documentary film is the first Italian professional film on illegal
geo-engineering aka chemtrails. It has been realized thanks to many
friends and collaborators. For years this issue has been denied and
mocked but the chemical spraying of our sky is still going on !<br>
<br>
This documentary analyses, in a scientific and rigorous approach the
main characteristics of this issue. The weather manipulation is only a
collateral aspect of the phenomenon...<br>
<br>
In September 2014, Jacques Daidi&eacute;, a French man very active
against illegal geo-engineering, went to Italy and met Antonio and
Rosario Marciano, well-known Italian activists against geo-engineering.
The French translation is born from this meeting and has been realized
by several members of the French association &#8220;Ciel voil&eacute;&#8221;,
(www.cielvoile.fr). We thank him warmly and all those who have
contributed to the translation: Jacques, Dominique from Avignon, Mary
from Monteux, Sebastien from St Firmin in Valgaudemard and Danielle

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tim Cook: The Courageous Censor</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Irish YouTuber Dave Cullen from Computing Forever weighs in on Apple
CEO Tim Cook&#8217;s acceptance speech for the Anti-Defamation League&#8217;s
Courage Against Hate Award, where Apple was praised for being the first
company to de-platform Alex Jones.<br>
<br>
Cook&#8217;s acceptance speech was fraught with fraudulent claims, suggesting
that Jones is a hateful white supremacist who incites violence, which
is untrue.<br>
<br>
The incoherence between Cook&#8217;s &#8220;meritorious&#8221; de-platforming activities
and the &#8220;courageous&#8221; name of the award caused me to wonder what was
causing Cook, CEO of the world&#8217;s largest corporation by market
capitalization to snivel and suck up so hard to the ADL?<br>
<br>
I learned that online censorship is a growth industry. It&#8217;s a form of
disaster capitalism. A calamity has been declared, in order to pave the
way for an all-encompassing censorship infrastructure, with ADL at the
helm.<br>
<br>
ADL&#8217;s Silicon Valley Anti-Cyberhate Working Group includes
representatives from all the tech giants. ADL is the main contractor in
YouTube&#8217;s Trusted Flagger program and ADL&#8217;s hate specs are programmed
into Google-YouTube&#8217;s machine learning censor bots.<br>
<br>
Tim Cook&#8217;s message here is indistinguishable from the stated goal of
the ADL, which is to ruin a person or business if they don&#8217;t follow
ADL&#8217;s agenda down to the letter. The question of course becomes who is
the ADL?<br>
<br>
Dr. John Coleman mentioned ADL several times in his 1991 book, The
Conspirator&#8217;s Hierarchy: The Committee of 300 and you may be surprised
by what he said:<br>
<br>
&#8220;The Anti-Defamation League is an outright British intelligence
operation run by all three branches of British intelligence, that is,
MI6 and the JIO&#8230;Let nobody underestimate the power of the ADL, nor its
long reach&#8230;The ADL has an open door to the State Department and makes
good use of State&#8217;s impressive intelligence agency&#8230;<br>
<br>
&#8220;The ADL is a British intelligence operation founded in the US by MI6
and run by Saul Steinberg and Eric Trist of Tavistock. Saul Steinberg
is the US representative and business partner of the Jacob de
Rothschild family of London&#8230;[ADL is] a joint FBI-British intelligence
operation designed to single out right wing groups and their leaders
and put them out of business before they grow too large and too
influential.&#8221;<br>

<br>
There is so much mind-blowing original content coming out on YouTube
lately, it was hard to choose one that best represents the zeitgeist of
the day but I settled on this very odd broadcast by the Leak Project
with Clif High, in which the latter speaks in a kind of code in order
to ward of the censorbots of Google-YouTube, referring to this episode
as a &#8220;LARP&#8221; (live-action role playing).<br>
<br>
Clif says that a million people are being abducted by aliens around the
world every year, mostly outside the US and that beneath the political
theatrics, the US, Russians and Chinese are working together to manage
what they perceive to be a threat. He believes that something akin to
what happened when Neanderthals were replaced by Homo sapiens is under
way right now, where we are being replaced.<br>
<br>
Clif says, &#8220;I&#8217;m also quite convinced that some odd things are involved
in our war against the aliens. One of these odd things is the 5G
network. So, 5G is gonna roll out all around the planet. It&#8217;s gonna
roll out and there isn&#8217;t anything any human can do because we need that
5g as a very large &#8211; at least in the minds of the military &#8211; strategic
weapon against the space aliens.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Clif then explains that the millimeter wave band used in 5th generation
(5G) communications technology was originally used in scanning
near-field microscopes, whose resolution he says is perfect for
examining DNA. The TSA scanners at the airport also use the millimeter
band in their scanners. Clif suggests that the military has people
trained to use these millimeter scanners to detect the DNA of
hybridized humans.<br>

in our war against the aliens. One of these odd things is the 5G
network. So, 5G is gonna roll out all around the planet. It&#8217;s gonna
roll out and there isn&#8217;t anything any human can do because we need that
5g as a very large &#8211; at least in the minds of the military &#8211; strategic
weapon against the space aliens.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Clif then explains that the millimeter wave band used in 5th generation
(5G) communications technology was originally used in scanning
near-field microscopes, whose resolution he says is perfect for
examining DNA. The TSA scanners at the airport also use the millimeter
band in their scanners. Clif suggests that the military has people
trained to use these millimeter scanners to detect the DNA of
hybridized humans.<br>
<br>
It gets weirder. He says, &#8220;Right now, there&#8217;s something going on that
seems to suggest the USA government might be captive by the aliens and
the Chinese and the Russians don&#8217;t like this&#8230;<br>
<br>
Clif explains that mind control is the primary weapon of the invaders.
&#8220;Space aliens can control our minds they can actually control the
neural pathways in our brains and they can do so, such that they could
eliminate me from your vision I could be sitting there I could be
coughing and hacking and they decide what you will hear and see of my
presence and they can do this relatively easily&#8230;they are able to
control our brains through their inbuilt telepathic abilities&#8230;<br>
<br>
&#8220;The 5G Network&#8230;could be used, in my opinion to disrupt the ability of
the hybrids to control human thought&#8230;so it may be that in order to have
a free mind in the future&#8230;we have to live in 5G envelopes, in order to
be relatively free from being screwed with by the space aliens, as they
proceed with their evil plan to conquer Earth.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Clif goes on to share numerous anecdotes from his experience and those
privately shared with him from people all over the world.<br>

<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Old
human cells rejuvenated in breakthrough discovery on ageing</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
</div>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
A new way to rejuvenate old cells in the laboratory, making them not
only look younger, but start to behave more like young cells, has been
discovered by researchers at the Universities of Exeter and Brighton.<br>
<br>
A&nbsp; team led Professor Lorna Harries, Professor of Molecular
Genetics at the University of Exeter, has discovered a new way to
rejuvenate inactive senescent cells. Within hours of treatment the
older cells started to divide, and had longer telomeres - the 'caps' on
the chromosomes which shorten as we age.<br>
<br>
This discovery, funded by the Dunhill Medical Trust, builds on earlier
findings from the Exeter group that showed that a class of genes called
splicing factors are progressively switched off as we age. The
University of Exeter research team, working with Professor Richard
Faragher and Dr Elizabeth Ostler from the University of Brighton, found
that splicing factors can be switched back on with chemicals, making
senescent cells not only look physically younger, but start to behave
more like young cells and start dividing.<br>
<br>
The researchers applied compounds called reversatrol analogues,
chemicals based on a substance naturally found in red wine, dark
chocolate, red grapes and blueberries, to cells in culture.&nbsp; The
chemicals caused splicing factors, which are progressively switched off
as we age to be switched back on.&nbsp; Within hours, the cells looked
younger and started to rejuvenate, behaving like young cells and
dividing. <br>
<br>
The research&nbsp; Small molecule modulation of splicing factor
expression is associated with rescue from cellular senescence, is
published in the journal, BMC Cell Biology, <br>

.&nbsp; </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
The discovery has the potential to lead to therapies which could help
people age better, without experiencing some of the degenerative
effects of getting old. Most people by the age of 85 have experienced
some kind of chronic illness, and as people get older they are more
prone to stroke, heart disease and cancer. <br>
<br>
Professor Harries said:&nbsp; &#8220;This is a first step in trying to make
people live normal lifespans, but with health for their entire life.
Our data suggests that using chemicals to switch back on the major
class of genes that are switched off as we age might provide a means to
restore function to old cells.&#8221; <br>
<br>
Dr Eva Latorre, Research Associate at the University of Exeter, who
carried out the experiments was surprised by the extent and rapidity of
the changes in the cells. <br>
<br>
&#8220;When I saw some of the cells in the culture dish rejuvenating I
couldn&#8217;t believe it. These old cells were looking like young cells. It
was like magic,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I repeated the experiments several times
and in each case the cells rejuvenated. I am very excited by the
implications and potential for this research.&#8221;<br>
<br>
As we age, our tissues accumulate senescent cells which are alive but
do not grow or function as they should. These old cells lose the
ability to correctly regulate the output of their genes. This is one
reason why tissues and organs become susceptible to disease as we age.
When activated, genes make a message that gives the instructions for
the cell to behave in a certain way. Most genes can make more than one
message, which determines how the cell acts.<br>
<br>
Splicing factors are crucial in ensuring that genes can perform their
full range of functions. One gene can send out several messages to the
body to perform a function &#8211; such as the decision whether or not to
grow new blood vessels &#8211; and the splicing factors make the decision
about which message to make. As people age, the splicing factors tend
to work less efficiently or not at all, restricting the ability of
cells to respond to challenges in their environment. Senescent cells,
which can be found in most organs from older people, also have fewer
splicing factors.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Professor Harries added: &#8220;This demonstrates that when you treat
old cells with molecules that restore the levels of the splicing
factors, the cells regain some features of youth.&nbsp; They are able
to grow, and their telomeres - the caps on the ends of the chromosomes
that shorten as we age -&nbsp; are now longer, as they are in young
cells. Far more research is needed now to establish the true potential
for these sort of approaches to address the degenerative effects of
ageing. &#8221; <br>
<br>
Professor Richard Faragher of the University of Brighton, will today
argue for more research into the degenerative effects of ageing in a
debate into whether science should be used to extend people&#8217;s
lifespans. <br>
<br>
&#8220;At a time when our capacity to translate new knowledge about the
mechanisms of ageing into medicines and lifestyle advice is limited
only by a chronic shortage of funds, older people are ill-served by
self-indulgent science fiction.&nbsp; They need practical action to
restore their health and they need it yesterday,&#8221; he said. <br>
<br>
Professor Faragher added:&nbsp; &#8220;Our discovery of cell rejuvenation
using these simple compounds shows the enormous potential of ageing
research to improve the lives of older people&#8221; <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Background</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
Altered expression of mRNA splicing factors occurs with ageing in vivo
and is thought to be an ageing mechanism. The accumulation of senescent
cells also occurs in vivo with advancing age and causes much
degenerative age-related pathology. However, the relationship between
these two processes is opaque. Accordingly we developed a novel panel
of small molecules based on resveratrol, previously suggested to alter
mRNA splicing, to determine whether altered splicing factor expression
had potential to influence features of replicative senescence.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Results</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
Treatment with resveralogues was associated with altered splicing
factor expression and rescue of multiple features of senescence. This
rescue was independent of cell cycle traverse and also independent of
SIRT1, SASP modulation or senolysis. Under growth permissive
conditions, cells demonstrating restored splicing factor expression
also demonstrated increased telomere length, re-entered cell cycle and
resumed proliferation. These phenomena were also influenced by ERK
antagonists and agonists.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Conclusions</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
This is the first demonstration that moderation of splicing factor
levels is associated with reversal of cellular senescence in human
primary fibroblasts. Small molecule modulators of such targets may
therefore represent promising novel anti-degenerative therapies.<br>

Earlier Diagnosis of Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs):
A Case Series, Including One Associated with Squirrel Brain Consumption
</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
</div>
<br>
Background: TSEs present diagnostic and infection control (IC)
challenges. Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is the most common human
TSE, occurring in 1-2/million/year in the US, but other zoonotic
factors or transmissions remain incompletely understood. Prompted by
the occurrence of 4 suspected cases from 11/2017-04/2018, we present a
case series of suspected CJD to illustrate its variable presentation
and the need for more rapid identification for implementation of
disease-specific disinfection, sterilization, and quarantine measures.<br>
<br>
Conclusion: Protean in presentation, the diagnosis of CJD can be
delayed. Variant CJD and emerging zoonotic TSEs should be considered in
differential diagnoses and IC measures. Improved empiric classification
algorithms and tests with faster turnaround times are needed.<br>

Gave MDMA to Octopuses&#8212;and What Happened Was Profound</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
</div>
<br>
...Given how different we are, G&uuml;l D&ouml;len and her colleague
Eric Edsinger wondered whether the chemistry behind human social
behaviors&#8212;the system controlling the serotonin molecule&#8212;also existed in
the solitary, asocial octopus. They began by analyzing the octopus
genome, and found that octopuses, too, have genes that seem to code for
serotonin transporters, proteins responsible for moving serotonin
molecules into brain cells. Serotonin is the molecule generally
considered to be responsible for feeling good. When humans take MDMA,
it binds to serotonin transporter proteins and changes the way
serotonin travels between brain cells, likely producing the warm and
fuzzy high and perhaps the increased extraversion that the drug is
known for.<br>
<br>
The fun began when the researchers gave MDMA to seven Octopus
bimaculoides octopuses inside laboratory tanks. They hoped to test
whether the animals behaved more socially after receiving a dose of
MDMA&#8212;a sign that the drug bound to their serotonin transporters.<br>
<br>
After hanging out in a bath containing ecstasy, the animals moved to a
chamber with three rooms to pick from: a central room, one containing a
male octopus and another containing a toy. This is a setup frequently
used in mice studies. Before MDMA, the octopuses avoided the male
octopus. But after the MDMA bath, they spent more time with the other
octopus, according to the study published in Current Biology. They also
touched the other octopus in what seemed to be an exploratory, rather
than aggressive, manner.<br>
<br>
The scientists took this to mean that despite our vastly different
brains, social behavior is built into the very molecules coded by our
DNA, D&ouml;len explained.<br>
<br>
&#8220;An octopus doesn&#8217;t have a cortex, and doesn&#8217;t have a reward circuit,&#8221;
D&ouml;len, assistant professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins
University, told Gizmodo. &#8220;And yet it&#8217;s able to respond to MDMA and
produce the same effects, in an animal with a totally different brain
organization. To me, that means we really need to appreciate that the
business end of these things is at the level of the molecule.&#8221;<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Method of destroying cells via
resonant destruction of intracellular structures</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
</div>
Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DREWES WILLIAM<br>
<br>
A method of destroying cells selected for destruction within a host
body with little to no collateral damage to healthy surrounding tissue
utilizes energy to effect resonant destruction of intracellular
components within the cells selected for destruction.<br>
<br>
...There has been proposed a method for destroying selected cells
without damage to nonselected cells through the application of
ultrasonic energy which relies on the principal of resonance of the
target cells for the target cell's destruction. U.S. Pat. No. 4,315,514
teaches the selective destruction of cells by first determining the
resonant frequency of the cell as a whole to be destroyed, followed by
the application of ultrasonic energy at sufficient levels to cause the
entire cell to resonate at its resonant frequency with sufficient
energy to ensure destruction of the target cell. Such a technique bears
the inherent disadvantage of a lack of assurance of destruction of all
selected cells. Specifically, a selected cell's resonant frequency is
determined by taking a biopsy of the selected cells, and bombarding
them with ultrasonic energy over a frequency range of 0.1 megahertz
(MHz) to 4 MHz. The biopsy is interferometrically monitored for motion.
The resonant frequency of the cells is determined to be that frequency
which causes the greatest degree of movement in the biopsy of cells.
However, since the resonant frequency of cells within a selected cell
type to be destroyed can vary depending, for example, on its location
within surrounding tissue, the location of the nucleus within the cell,
or the location of other intracellular components within the cell, the
determination of a resonant frequency which causes the greatest
movement in the biopsy does not necessarily ensure that the resonant
frequency of all of the cancerous cells to be destroyed will be
identified....<br>
<br>
n the present invention intracellular components are impacted with
ultrasonic energy so as to lead them to destructive resonance.
Intracellular components of a particular cell type will show little to
no substantive variance from cell to cell, making the likelihood of
destruction of all selected cells greater at a selected resonant
frequency than in the case of resonating the entire cell, due to the
above-noted propensity for resonant frequencies to vary on a cell to
cell basis. A further advantage of the present invention is that the
likelihood of achieving a 25% difference in resonant frequency between
an intracellular component of a cancerous cell to be destroyed and a
healthy cell is likely, since the structural differences in
intracellular components between cancerous cells and normal cells are
more profound than the structural difference between the cells as a
whole. As demonstrated above in connection with the transmissibility
equation, a variance of 25% from the resonant frequency results in a
300% reduction in conversion of energy from the source to the object
being impacted with ultrasonic energy. Thus, when a resonant frequency
of an abnormal cell's intracellular component(s) can be found at which
the transmissibility of the abnormal cell's intracellular component(s)
is sufficiently higher than the transmissibility of the surrounding
healthy tissue cell's intracellular component(s), the abnormal cell's
intracellular components can be caused to resonate at a frequency with
sufficient intensity to destroy them, while the healthy cells,
exhibiting a low transmissibility at that same frequency, will not be
damaged...<br>
<br>
A technique for determining a resonant frequency of an intracellular
structure comprises mounting a sensitive ultrasonic pickup in the fluid
medium of the cell suspension. Ultrasonic energy from an energy source
is then focused on the cells in suspension. The ultrasonic pick up is
used to determine the amplitude of the ultrasonic energy within the
fluid medium. The amplitude of the ultrasonic energy in the fluid
medium can then be compared to the amplitude of the energy outputted by
the source. Energy from the source will be attenuated prior to
detection at the ultrasonic pickup. However, at the resonant
frequencies of the intracellular structures, the attenuation will be
greater, because at these frequencies the amount of energy absorbed by
intracellular components will be greatest. In this way, the various
resonant frequencies of an intracellular structure can be determined by
identifying those frequencies at which the amplitude ratio of the
source signal to the detected signal is the greatest. Generally, the
frequency which exhibits the largest amplitude difference is the
frequency with the highest transmissibility, and is likely, although
not necessarily, the most desirable destructive frequency.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Another technique for determining a resonant frequency of an
intracellular component utilizes an energy source with a controller
which maintains the amplitude detected at the ultrasonic pickup at a
constant value. A feedback sensor, operatively connected to the
controller, is provided between the ultrasonic pickup and the energy
source. The energy source is modulated to maintain a constant amplitude
signal at the ultrasonic pickup. It will be apparent that when the
energy absorbed by the cell suspension is high, the power required by
the energy source to maintain a constant amplitude at the pick up will
be correspondingly high. As described above, at the resonant
frequencies of the intracellular components, the energy absorbed by the
cell suspension will be greater than at other frequencies.
Consequently, the resonant frequencies of the intracellular components
can be determined by monitoring the power consumed by the energy
source, i.e. the highest power consumption will occur at the resonant
frequencies of the intracellular components. For example, a surge in
power consumption by the energy source at a frequency fn will indicate
that fn is a resonant frequency of the intracellular component...<br>

for the destruction of the World Trade Center buildings on 9/11.<br>
<br>
The 52-page petition, accompanied by 57 exhibits of evidence, states
&#8220;The Lawyers&#8217; Committee has reviewed the relevant available evidence .
. . and has reached a consensus that there is not just substantial or
persuasive evidence of yet-to-be-prosecuted crimes related to the use
of pre-planted explosives and/or incendiaries to destroy WTC1, WTC2 and
WTC7 in New York City on 9/11, but there is actually conclusive
evidence that such federal crimes were committed... The Lawyers'
Committee states unequivocally that the evidence permits no other
conclusion - as a matter of science, as a matter of&nbsp; logic, and as
a matter of law."<br>

<br>
Eating a side of a certain kind of dirt with your dinner might help to
prevent obesity by flushing fat out of your system, new research
suggests.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Australian researchers found that obese rats that ate a certain kind of
clay shed more pounds than those that were given a weight-loss drug, a
new study reveals.<br>
<br>
'Go eat dirt' is not a new phrase - or phenomenon.<br>
<br>
There are records of ancient Greeks who looked at the ground beneath
their feet and decided, 'that looks like a snack.'<br>
<br>
And celebrities like Shailene Woodley and Elle Macphereson have brought
this unlikely nutrition trend back from ancient times, eating clay for
detoxes.<br>
<br>
In an unusual turn of events, the new scientific research suggests they
might be onto something: an unlikely way to fight obesity.<br>
<br>
For the most part radical diets and cleanses are as crazy as they seem:
cabbage cleanses, soy sauce detoxes and turpentine 'treatments' are all
dangerous and can even turn deadly.<br>
<br>
But supplementing your diet with dirt, of all things, might actually be
beneficial.<br>
<br>
Throughout history and certain cultures, people have indulged the
rather strange urge to eat dirt.<br>
<br>
The practice - called geophagy - is most common among pregnant women
and, of course, children.<br>
<br>
Hippocrates, the ancient Greek physician, described pregnant women
consuming soil, and suggested that their children would follow suit.<br>
<br>
And the practice has been reported on every continent in the world.<br>
<br>
Many cultures - including the majority of the US - file it under
disordered eating of non-food things, known as Pica.<br>
<br>
However, in the South, it's a common practice and in 2015, was the
subject of the 2015 documentary Eat White Dirt which explores
Southerners' love for chewing on kaolin, a kind of white clay formed
from mineral deposits.<br>
<br>
Kaolin is actually found in the drug Kaopectate, an anti-diarrheal.<br>
<br>
And anthropological research suggests this is exactly why humans have
been drawn to dirt. Throughout history, people seem to have taken up
eating soil when there stomachs have been in distress.<br>
<br>
But, quite by accident, the University of South Australia researchers
found that a different dirt might do much more than quell upset
stomachs.<br>
<br>
Tahnee Dening, a PhD candidate, was trying to find compounds that could
improve the way the body absorbs antipsychotic pills.<br>
<br>
'I noticed that the clay particles weren't behaving as I'd expected,'
she said.<br>
<br>
'Instead of breaking down to release drugs, the clay materials were
attracting fat droplets and literally soaking them up. Not only were
the clay materials trapping the fats within their particle structure,
but they were also preventing them from being absorbed by the body,
ensuring that fat simply passed through the digestive system.<br>
<br>
'It's this unique behavior that immediately signaled we could be onto
something significant - potentially a cure for obesity.'<br>
<br>
It's also not clear if bentonite clay that has gained popularity with
celebrities or the kaolin consumed in the South have similar properties.<br>
<br>
Dening and her fellow researchers tested their theory out by feeding a
group of rats high-fat diets plus one of three supplements: the
weight-loss drug, orlistat, a clay called montmorillonite or a placebo.<br>
<br>
The mice eating the clay supplement gained the least weight, suggesting
that eatind dirt was better at flushing fat from their systems than the
FDA-approved drug was.<br>
<br>
Our processed clay has an unusually high surface area which means it
has a huge capacity to interact with and soak up digested fats and oils
present in the foods we eat,' said Dening.<br>
<br>
Orlistat, on the other hand, blocks the body from digesting fat in the
first place.<br>
<br>
So, next, she wants to try the two in combination.<br>
<br>
'We're essentially attacking fat digestion and absorption in two
different ways and we hope this will lead to greater weight loss with
fewer side effects.'<br>
<br>
Previous research on geophagy hasn't found any significant health risks
to eating it in moderation - though too much could cause constipation.<br>
<br>
Experts have long approached diet pills with apprehension, however,
fearing that the risks outweigh the benefits.<br>
<br>
A safer alternative to supplement improved diets and exercise to fight
obesity could be a blockbuster drug - and the University of South
Australia researchers know it.<br>
<br>
'With a finding like this, people will naturally be keen to find out
when they can try it. Given that the material is generally considered
safe and is widely used in food and nutraceutical products, it is
feasible that human clinical trials could start reasonably soon,' said
Dening's supervisor, Dr Clive Prestige.<br>
<br>
'Watch this space.'<br>

<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Study
unlocks full potential of 'supermaterial' graphene</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
</div>
<br>
New research reveals why the "supermaterial" graphene has not
transformed electronics as promised, and shows how to double its
performance and finally harness its extraordinary potential.<br>
<br>
Graphene is the strongest material ever tested. It's also flexible,
transparent and conducts heat and electricity 10 times better than
copper.<br>
<br>
After graphene research won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2010 it was
hailed as a transformative material for flexible electronics, more
powerful computer chips and solar panels, water filters and
bio-sensors. But performance has been mixed and industry adoption slow.<br>
<br>
Now a study published in Nature Communications identifies silicon
contamination as the root cause of disappointing results and details
how to produce higher performing, pure graphene.<br>
<br>
The RMIT University team led by Dr. Dorna Esrafilzadeh and Dr.
Rouhollah Ali Jalili inspected commercially-available graphene samples,
atom by atom, with a state-of-art scanning transition electron
microscope.<br>
<br>
"We found high levels of silicon contamination in commercially
available graphene, with massive impacts on the material's
performance," Esrafilzadeh said.<br>
<br>
Testing showed that silicon present in natural graphite, the raw
material used to make graphene, was not being fully removed when
processed.<br>
<br>
"We believe this contamination is at the heart of many seemingly
inconsistent reports on the properties of graphene and perhaps many
other atomically thin two-dimensional (2-D) materials ," Esrafilzadeh
said.<br>
<br>
"Graphene was billed as being transformative, but has so far failed to
make a significant commercial impact, as have some similar 2-D
nanomaterials. Now we know why it has not been performing as promised,
and what needs to be done to harness its full potential."<br>
<br>
The testing not only identified these impurities but also demonstrated
the major influence they have on performance, with contaminated
material performing up to 50% worse when tested as electrodes.<br>
<br>
"This level of inconsistency may have stymied the emergence of major
industry applications for graphene-based systems. But it's also
preventing the development of regulatory frameworks governing the
implementation of such layered nanomaterials, which are destined to
become the backbone of next-generation devices," she said.<br>
<br>
The two-dimensional property of graphene sheeting, which is only one
atom thick, makes it ideal for electricity storage and new sensor
technologies that rely on high surface area.<br>
<br>
This study reveals how that 2-D property is also graphene's Achilles'
heel, by making it so vulnerable to surface contamination, and
underscores how important high purity graphite is for the production of
more pure graphene.<br>
<br>
Using pure graphene, researchers demonstrated how the material
performed extraordinarily well when used to build a supercapacitator, a
kind of super battery.<br>
<br>
When tested, the device's capacity to hold electrical charge was
massive. In fact, it was the biggest capacity so far recorded for
graphene and within sight of the material's predicted theoretical
capacity.<br>
<br>
In collaboration with RMIT's Centre for Advanced Materials and
Industrial Chemistry, the team then used pure graphene to build a
versatile humidity sensor with the highest sensitivity and the lowest
limit of detection ever reported.<br>
<br>
These findings constitute a vital milestone for the complete
understanding of atomically thin two-dimensional materials and their
successful integration within high performance commercial devices.<br>
<br>
"We hope this research will help to unlock the exciting potential of
these materials."<br>

Solution for next generation nanochips comes out of thin air</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">by M. Quinn</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
</div>
<br>
The secret ingredient for the next generation of more powerful
electronics could be air, according to new research.<br>
<br>
Researchers at RMIT University have engineered a new type of
transistor, the building block for all electronics. Instead of sending
electrical currents through silicon, these transistors send electrons
through narrow air gaps, where they can travel unimpeded as if in
space. <br>
<br>
The device unveiled in material sciences journal Nano Letters,
eliminates the use of any semiconductor at all, making it faster and
less prone to heating up.<br>
<br>
Lead author and PhD candidate in RMIT&#8217;s Functional Materials and
Microsystems Research Group, Ms Shruti Nirantar, said this promising
proof-of-concept design for nanochips as a combination of metal and air
gapscould revolutionise electronics. <br>
<br>
&#8220;Every computer and phone has millions to billions of electronic
transistors made from silicon, but this technology is reaching its
physical limits where the silicon atoms get in the way of the current
flow, limiting speed and causing heat,&#8221; Nirantar said. <br>
<br>
&#8220;Our air channel transistor technology has the current flowing through
air, so there are no collisions to slow it down and no resistance in
the material to produce heat.&#8221;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Moore's law</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
The power of computer chips - or number of transistors squeezed onto a
silicon chip - has increased on a predictable path for decades, roughly
doubling every two years. But this rate of progress, known as Moore&#8217;s
Law, has slowed in recent years as engineers struggle to make
transistor parts, which are already smaller than the tiniest viruses,
smaller still.<br>
<br>
Nirantar says their research is a promising way forward for nano
electronics in response to the limitation of silicon-based electronics.
<br>
<br>
&#8220;This technology simply takes a different pathway to the
miniaturisation of a transistor in an effort to uphold Moore&#8217;s Law for
several more decades,&#8221; Shruti said.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A new way forward</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Research team leader Associate Professor Sharath Sriram said the design
solved a major flaw in traditional solid channel transistors &#8211; they are
packed with atoms - which meant electrons passing through them
collided, slowed down and wasted energy as heat.<br>
<br>
&#8220;Imagine walking on a densely crowded street in an effort to get from
point A to B. The crowd slows your progress and drains your energy,&#8221;
Sriram said. <br>
<br>
&#8220;Travelling in a vacuum on the other hand is like an empty highway
where you can drive faster with higher energy efficiency.&#8221;<br>
<br>
But while this concept is obvious, vacuum packaging solutions around
transistors to make them faster would also make them much bigger, so
are not viable.<br>
<br>
&#8220;We address this by creating a nanoscale gap between two metal points.
The gap is only a few tens of nanometers, or 50,000 times smaller than
the width of a human hair, but it&#8217;s enough to fool electrons into
thinking that they are travelling through a vacuum and re-create a
virtual outer-space for electrons within the nanoscale air gap,&#8221; he
said.<br>
<br>
The nanoscale device is designed to be compatible with modern industry
fabrication and development processes. It also has applications in
space &#8211; both as electronics resistant to radiation and to use electron
emission for steering and positioning &#8216;nano-satellites&#8217;.<br>
<br>
&#8220;This is a step towards an exciting technology which aims to create
something out of nothing to significantly increase speed of electronics
and maintain pace of rapid technological progress,&#8221; Sriram said.<br>
<br>
This work was undertaken at RMIT University&#8217;s cutting-edge Micro Nano
Research Facility and with support of the Victorian node of the
Australian National Fabrication Facility.<br>

<br>
A new, low-cost wound dressing developed by University of
Wisconsin&#8211;Madison engineers could dramatically speed up healing in a
surprising way.<br>
<br>
The method leverages energy generated from a patient&#8217;s own body motions
to apply gentle electrical pulses at the site of an injury.<br>
<br>
In rodent tests, the dressings reduced healing times to a mere three
days compared to nearly two weeks for the normal healing process.<br>
<br>
&#8220;We were surprised to see such a fast recovery rate,&#8221; says Xudong Wang,
a professor of materials science and engineering at UW&#8211;Madison. &#8220;We
suspected that the devices would produce some effect, but the magnitude
was much more than we expected.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Wang and collaborators described their wound dressing method today
(Nov. 29, 2018) in the journal ACS Nano.<br>
<br>
Researchers have known for several decades that electricity can be
beneficial for skin healing, but most electrotherapy units in use today
require bulky electrical equipment and complicated wiring to deliver
powerful jolts of electricity.<br>
<br>
&#8220;Acute and chronic wounds represent a substantial burden in healthcare
worldwide,&#8221; says collaborator Angela Gibson, professor of surgery at
UW&#8211;Madison and a burn surgeon and director of wound healing services at
UW Health. &#8220;The use of electrical stimulation in wound healing is
uncommon.&#8221;<br>
<br>
In contrast with existing methods, the new dressing is much more
straightforward.<br>
<br>
&#8220;Our device is as convenient as a bandage you put on your skin,&#8221; says
Wang.<br>
<br>
The new dressings consist of small electrodes for the injury site that
are linked to a band holding energy-harvesting units called
nanogenerators, which are looped around a wearer&#8217;s torso. The natural
expansion and contraction of the wearer&#8217;s ribcage during breathing
powers the nanogenerators, which deliver low-intensity electric pulses.<br>
<br>
&#8220;The nature of these electrical pulses is similar to the way the body
generates an internal electric field,&#8221; says Wang.<br>
<br>
And, those low-power pulses won&#8217;t harm healthy tissue like traditional,
high-power electrotherapy devices might.<br>
<br>
In fact, the researchers showed that exposing cells to high-energy
electrical pulses caused them to produce almost five times more
reactive oxygen species &#8212; major risk factors for cancer and cellular
aging &#8212; than did cells that were exposed to the nanogenerators.<br>
<br>
Also a boon to healing: They determined that the low-power pulses
boosted viability for a type of skin cell called fibroblasts, and
exposure to the nanogenerator&#8217;s pulses encouraged fibroblasts to line
up (a crucial step in wound healing) and produce more biochemical
substances that promote tissue growth.<br>
<br>
&#8220;These findings are very exciting,&#8221; says collaborator Weibo Cai, a
professor of radiology at UW&#8211;Madison. &#8220;The detailed mechanisms will
still need to be elucidated in future work.&#8221;<br>
<br>
In that vein, the researchers aim to tease out precisely how the gentle
pulses aid in healing. The scientists also plan to test the devices on
pig skin, which closely mimics human tissue.<br>
<br>
And, they are working to give the nanogenerators additional
capabilities&#8212;tweaking their structure to allow for energy harvesting
from small imperceptible twitches in the skin or the thrumming pulse of
a heartbeat.<br>
<br>
&#8220;The impressive results in this study represent an exciting new spin on
electrical stimulation for many different wound types, given the
simplicity of the design,&#8221; says Gibson, who will collaborate with the
team to confirm the reproducibility of these results in human skin
models.<br>
<br>
If the team is successful, the devices could help solve a major
challenge for modern medicine.<br>
<br>
&#8220;We think our nanogenerator could be the most effective electrical
stimulation approach for many therapeutic purposes,&#8221; says Wang.<br>
<br>
And because the nanogenerators consist of relatively common materials,
price won&#8217;t be an issue.<br>
<br>
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the cost will be much more than a regular bandage,&#8221; says
Wang. &#8220;The device in itself is very simple and convenient to fabricate.&#8221;<br>
<br>
This research was supported by grants from the National Institutes of
Health (R01EB021336 and P30CA014520).<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
&nbsp;Skin wound healing is a major health care issue. While electric
stimulations have been known for decades to be effective for
facilitating skin wound recovery, practical applications are still
largely limited by the clumsy electrical systems. Here, we report an
efficient electrical bandage for accelerated skin wound healing. On the
bandage, an alternating discrete electric field is generated by a
wearable nanogenerator by converting mechanical displacement from skin
movements into electricity. Rat studies demonstrated rapid closure of a
full-thickness rectangular skin wound within 3 days as compared to 12
days of usual contraction-based healing processes in rodents. From in
vitro studies, the accelerated skin wound healing was attributed to
electric field-facilitated fibroblast migration, proliferation, and
transdifferentiation. This self-powered electric-dressing modality
could lead to a facile therapeutic strategy for nonhealing skin wound
treatment.<br>
<br>
Nonhealing skin wounds, such as diabetic foot ulcers, venous-related
ulcerations, and nonhealing surgical wounds affect more than 6.5
million people in the United States and result in enormous health care
expenditures, with the total cost estimated at more than $25 billion
per year.(1&#8722;4) In addition, slow- or nonhealing skin wounds are morbid
conditions that can result in long-term physical and mental suffering
due to the protracted treatment courses often required by chronic
wounds. The principal goal in skin wound management is to achieve rapid
wound closure. Treating skin wounds has been dated to the very early
stage of human civilization, e.g., by making plasters and bandaging the
wounds.(5) Owing to the large advancements of modern biomedicine and
medical technology, the last several decades have seen the evolution of
a number of more effective treatment strategies, including invasive
methods such as wound debridement(6) and noninvasive techniques such as
compression bandaging,(7) wound dressing,(8,9) hyperbaric oxygen
therapy,(10) negative pressure therapy,(11) ultrasound,(12) and
electrical stimulation.(13,14) Most of these methods are passive
treatments and rarely participate in controlling endogenous cell
behaviors. Currently, advanced growth factors-mediated therapy emerged
as an effective approach for regenerative skin wound healing, which
still faces the challenges of rapid degradation and loss of
bioactivity.(15,16) Electrical stimulation (ES) for wound healing is an
attractive adjunct to wound care. It imitates the natural wound-healing
mechanism of the endogenous electric field to facilitate skin growth.
It has the potential to treat many different types of acute and chronic
skin wounds with minimal adverse effects and good simplicity to apply.<br>
<br>
The therapeutic effects of ES for wound healing were first observed in
the late 20th century.(17,18) It is believed that an electric field is
essential for directing many cellular processes that lead to orderly
healing naturally.(19,20) As summarized in the literature,(21) ES can
decrease edema around the electrode; lyse or liquify necrotic tissue;
stimulate growth of granulation tissue; increase blood flow; cause
fibroblasts to proliferate and make collagen; induce epidermal cell
migration; attract neutrophils; stimulate neurite growth directionally;
promote epithelial growth and organization; decrease mast cells in
healing wounds; attract macrophages; and stimulate receptor sites to
accept certain growth factors. Although the influence from an electric
field can be significant, clinical applications of electrical
stimulation for wound healing typically involves large-sized
extracorporeal devices to provide appropriate electrical fields and may
require patient hospitalization.<br>
<br>
The recent innovation of nanogenerator (NG) technology opened a route
for generating periodic biphasic electric pulses by locally converting
mechanical displacements, such as body or muscle motions.(22&#8722;27) This
exceptional capability makes NG a candidate for producing electrical
stimulations that is self-sustainable and biologically responsive.
Besides, NGs could be made flexible with reasonably high output power
density and energy conversion efficiency. Their multiple energy
conversion mechanisms, including both piezoelectric and triboelectric
effects, allow a wide selection of materials and multiple designs
principles. Furthermore, typical NGs have been proved fairly stable
against environmental conditions like temperature(28) and
humidity(29,30) within the range of normal biological systems.
Therefore, NG may bring opportunities for electrical stimulation-based
medical treatments. In this work, we report a significantly accelerated
skin wound recovery under the influence of small electrical pulses
produced by a wearable NG device. The wound-healing time on rat&#8217;s
dorsal skin was reduced from 12 days to less than 3 days by this
treatment, which was superior to most other reported wound recovery
strategies. The outstanding effectiveness of the self-activated
electrotherapy was attributed to electric field-facilitated fibroblast
migration, proliferation, and transdifferentiation...<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Conclusion</span><br>
In summary, we demonstrated a highly efficient wound recovery strategy
based on a wearable NG device. The device can locally convert the
kinetic energy generated from a rat breathing into a discrete AC
voltage signal and apply the electric field directly on the wound to
enhance skin regeneration. Animal studies demonstrated a rapid closure
of full-thickness rectangular skin wound within 3 days as compared to
12 days of normal healing process. In vitro data showed that the
therapeutic effects were attributed to the electric field which
promotes fibroblast migration, proliferation, and transdifferentiation.
Moreover, the NG-based bandage produced a safe and very low-level
electricity over the wounds, which is favorable for lowering the level
of discomfort or pain. This self-stimulated electrotherapy for wound
healing could have an impact on other related diseases (e.g., Raynaud&#8217;s
disease) and may resolve cosmetic concerns, such as chickenpox scars,
acne, keloid scarring, or rosacea. Better understanding and
optimization of this physical treatment strategy will impact
multidisciplinary research directions including surgical, biochemical,
and translational sciences and eventually bring an effective
therapeutic strategy to chronic disease treatment...<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
This paper presents the first empirical evidence in the history of
banking on the question whether banks can create money out of nothing.
The banking crisis has revived interest in this issue, but it remains
unsettled. Three hypotheses are recognised in the literature. According
to the financial intermediation theory of banking, banks are merely
intermediaries like other non-bank financial institutions, collecting
deposits that are then lent out. According to the fractional reserve
theory of banking, individual banks are mere financial intermediaries
that cannot create money, but collectively they end up creating money
through systemic interaction. A third theory maintains that each
individual bank has the power to create money &#8216;out of nothing&#8217; and does
so when it extends credit (the credit creation theory of banking). The
question which of the hypotheses is correct has far-reaching
implications for research and policy. Surprisingly, despite the
longstanding controversy, until now no empirical study has attempted to
do so. This is the contribution of the present paper. An empirical test
is conducted, whereby money is borrowed from a cooperating bank, while
its internal records are being monitored, to establish whether in the
process of making the loan available to the borrower, the bank
transfers these funds from other accounts within or outside the bank,
or whether they are newly created. This study establishes for the first
time empirically that banks individually create money out of nothing.
The money supply is created as &#8216;fairy dust&#8217; produced by the banks
individually, out of thin air.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span><br>
Thanks to the recent banking crises interest has grown in banks and how
they operate. In the past, the empirical and institutional market
micro-structure of the operation of banks had not been a primary focus
for investigations by researchers, which is why they are not well
covered in the literature. One neglected detail is the banks' function
as the creators and allocators of about 97% of the money supply (.
Werner, 1997, 2005), which has recently attracted attention (. Bank of
England, 2014a,b; Werner, 2014b,c). It is the purpose of this paper to
investigate precisely how banks create money, and why or whether
companies cannot do the same. Since the implementation of banking
operations takes place within a corporate accounting framework, this
paper is based upon a comparative accounting analysis perspective. By
breaking the accounting treatment of lending into two steps, the
difference in the accounting operation by bank and non-bank
corporations can be isolated. As a result, it can be established
precisely why banks are different and what it is that makes them
different: They are exempted from the Client Money Rules and thus,
unlike other firms, do not have to segregate client money. This enables
banks to classify their accounts payable liabilities arising from bank
loan contracts as a different type of liability called 'customer
deposits'. The finding is important for many reasons, including for
modelling the banking sector accurately in economic models, bank
regulation and also for monetary reform proposals that aim at taking
away the privilege of money creation from banks. The paper thus adds to
the growing literature on the institutional details and market
micro-structure of our financial and monetary system, and in particular
offers a new contribution to the literature on 'what makes banks
different', from an accounting and regulatory perspective, solving the
puzzle of why banks combine lending and deposit-taking operations under
one roof.<br>

<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Film the Israel Lobby Does Not Want You to See</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">By Chris Hedges</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
</div>
<br>
&#8220;The Lobby,&#8221; the four-part Al-Jazeera documentary that was blocked
under heavy Israeli pressure shortly before its release, has been
leaked online by the Chicago-based website Electronic Intifada, the
French website Orient XXI and the Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar.<br>
<br>
The series is an inside look over five months by an undercover
reporter, armed with a hidden camera, at how the government and
intelligence agencies of Israel work with U.S. domestic Jewish groups
such as the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), The
Israel Project and StandWithUs to spy on, smear and attack critics,
especially American university students who support the boycott,
divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement. It shows how the Israel lobby
uses huge cash donations, often far above the U.S. legal limit, and
flies hundreds of members of Congress to Israel for lavish and unpaid
vacations at Israeli seaside resorts, bribing the American lawmakers to
do Israel&#8217;s bidding, including providing military aid such as the $38
billion (over 10 years) that was approved by Congress in 2016. It
uncovers Israel&#8217;s sleazy character assassination of academics,
activists and journalists, its well-funded fake grassroots activism,
its manipulation of press coverage, and its ham-fisted attempts to
destroy marriages, personal relationships and careers. The film
highlights the efforts to discredit liberal Jews and Jewish
organizations as tools of radical jihadists, referring, for example, to
Jewish Voice for Peace as &#8220;Jewish Voice for Hamas&#8221; and claiming that
many members of the organization are not actually Jewish. Israel
recruits black South Africans into an Israeli front group called Stop
Stealing My Apartheid, in a desperate effort to counter the reality of
the apartheid state that Israel has constructed. The series documents
Israel&#8217;s repeated and multifaceted interference in the internal affairs
of the United States, including elections; efforts to discredit
progressive groups such as Black Lives Matter that express sympathy for
the Palestinians; and routine employment of Americans to spy on other
Americans. Israel&#8217;s behavior is unethical and perhaps illegal. But
don&#8217;t expect anyone in the establishment or either of the two ruling
political parties to do anything about it. It is abundantly clear by
the end of the series that they have been intimidated, discredited or
bought off.<br>
<br>
&#8220;Imagine if China was doing this, if Iran was doing this, if Russia was
doing this?&#8221; Ali Abunimah, the author of &#8220;The Battle for Justice in
Palestine&#8221; and co-founder of The Electronic Intifada, says in the film.
&#8220;There would be uproar. You would have Congress going off to them. You
would have hearings.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Those of us who denounce and expose the Israeli crimes committed
against Palestinians are intimately familiar with the sordid and
nefarious tactics of the Israel lobby. The power of the film series is
that in dealing with the reporter&#8212;a young Oxford postgraduate, James
Anthony Kleinfeld, who goes by the name Tony in the film and poses as a
pro-Israel student&#8212;major figures within the Israel lobby candidly
explain and expose their massive covert campaign in the United States.
There is no plausible deniability. And this is why Israel worked so
hard to stop the film from being broadcast.<br>
<br>
Clayton Swisher, who directed the series, wrote in the liberal Jewish
newspaper The Forward that leaders from the Israel lobby met with the
state of Qatar&#8217;s registered agent and lobbyist, a former aide to U.S.
Sen. Ted Cruz named Nick Muzin, to &#8220;see if he could use his ties with
the Qataris to stop the airing.&#8221; Qatar funds Al-Jazeera. Muzin told the
Israeli newspaper Haaretz that &#8220;he was discussing the issue with the
Qataris and didn&#8217;t think the film would broadcast in the near future.&#8221;
An anonymous source told Haaretz that &#8220;the Qatari emir himself helped
make the decision&#8221; to spike the film.<br>
<br>
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates severed ties
with Qatar in June 2017 and imposed a land, sea and air blockade on the
Persian Gulf state. They accuse Doha of supporting terrorism and
radical Islamist groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood. The four
states have issued a list of demands for re-establishing ties that
include Qatar&#8217;s shutting down Al-Jazeera, along with severing relations
with Iran. Qatar has appealed to the United States to intercede and
has, as part of this effort, reached out to the powerful Israel lobby
in the United States for support. American Jewish leaders, including
the former Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, have met with the
Qatari emir, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and have discussed with him what
they describe as the network&#8217;s &#8220;anti-Semitism.&#8221; It is widely believed
the series was sacrificed by Qatar in an effort to placate the Israel
lobby and get its support for an end to the sanctions, although the
blockade remains in force...<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
In order to evaluate the effect of colloidal metallic gold on cognitive
functions, the revised Wechsler Intelligence scales battery of tests
(WAIS-R) was administered to 5 subjects aged 15 to 45 years, before,
after 4 weeks on colloidal gold at 30 mg/day and again 1 to 3 months
off the gold preparation. The WAIS-R total scores (I.Q) were calculated
by adding the sum of the verbal test scores to the sum of the
performance scores. After 4 weeks on colloidal gold, there was a 20%
increase in I.Q scores with mean + SE of 112.8 + 2.3 pre gold and 137 +
3.8, post gold (p &lt;0.005). Both the performance and verbal test
scores contributed equally to this increase in I.Q scores. The effect
of the colloidal gold persisted in 3 subjects after 1 to 2 month off
gold, where as in 2 subjects who took the tests 3 months after stopping
the gold , I.Q scores were down to baseline levels.<br>

</div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
The system provides for the transformation of permanent magnetic energy
into a continuous electric energy current flow within a circuit. This
is accomplished by creating a very strong egg shaped planetary
permanent magnet. The magnet contains a longitudinal channel through
its center to allow for initial energization. The initial energization
is accomplished by applying a very strong burst of electrical current
from a direct current power source. The magnet embodying the present
invention is an egg shaped object that shall be held in one place
without any physical or visible rotation of the magnet itself. Instead,
the egg shape of the magnet creates varying field strengths patterns
for energy transfer and polarization due to the internal left hand rule
principles of electric current. This arrangement will create a
permanent or near permanent perpetuating magnetic field. This magnetic
field maintains intrinsic, centripetal, magnetic forces that create a
magnetic whirl-pool that rotates the magnetic field within the magnet
without rotating the magnet itself. The system created by the present
invention is capable of self-sufficiency, recharging itself through
power flow in the system's circuit. Additionally, the power is
supplemented with atmospheric energy seeking termination, or moving
towards the magnet, due to the centripetal forces generated by the
magnetic angular momentum depression inside the magnet.<br>

We have a very special episode with guest James Scott who is an expert
on Cyber Security. This episode of Edge of Wonder has a more serious
tone compared to our previous episodes but we hope you keep watching
till the end because this about very sensitive information, social
media, and how your personal data is being compromised. On this episode
we had the amazing opportunity to sit down with James Scott who is the
Senior Fellow and co-founder of the Institute for Critical
Infrastructure Technology, Senior fellow at the Center for Cyber
Influence Operations Studies and Center for Space Warfares Studies.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Silicon Valley Cyborg Disruptors</span><br

If the steady stream of television &#8220;smart phone&#8221; ads featuring
androgynous demon actors haven&#8217;t made you scratch your head as to the
direction artificial intelligence (AI) is taking humanity, and you
still refuse to listen to &#8220;crazy conspiracy theorists&#8221; per insider
advice (wink, secret handshake, silly real humans &#8211; from the Ministry
of Truth, then maybe you will observe the actions of the almighty
Silicon Valley guru glitterati who have invented this spell under which
most of you have sadly fallen. Google&#8217;s Ray Kurzweil, darling of the
military-industrial complex, continues to push his &#8220;singularity&#8221;
thesis, whereby he states that by 2030 the &#8220;nonbiological portion of
our intelligence will predominate&#8221;. The implication is that we will
soon be trans-humans &#8220;enhanced&#8221; by AI.<br>
<br>
His CEO at Google&#8217;s parent company Alphabet &#8211; which also owns Youtube &#8211;
Eric Schmidt has stated that &#8220;true anonymity is too dangerous&#8221;, when
asked to address the privacy concerns of people using his search
engine. &#8220;We are all subject to the US Patriot Act,&#8221; says Schmidt. &#8220;It
is possible that information could be made available to authorities.&#8221;<br>
<br>
At last month&#8217;s Samsung CEO summit at The Masonic in San Francisco tech
insider Regina Dugan stated, &#8220;I think it&#8217;s impossible to know at any
one point in time what all the unintended consequences will be. What
are the bad things that could happen and what are the mitigating
strategies?&#8221;<br>
<br>
Dugan must have felt right at home at The Masonic &#8211; also home to the
Grand Lodge of California. Dugan headed DARPA (Defense Advanced
Research Projects Administration) from 2009-2012, before becoming a
Google executive. There she worked at the Motorola Mobility subsidiary
developing an electronic tattoo (one of which she sports proudly on her
forearm) and a vitamin authentication system, where a person takes a
pill which becomes battery-powered by stomach acid to produce an 18-bit
internal signal, making the person&#8217;s body a password.<br>
<br>
In 2016 Dugan left Google to head Facebook&#8217;s Building 8 project, which
has been compared to the old Lockheed Martin Skunkworks. Dugan headed
the &#8220;brain-computer interface project&#8221; for Facebook, which translates a
user&#8217;s thoughts onto a computer screen. This has become the creepy
Facebook Portal project. Dugan moved on early this year to disrupt a
yet to be revealed something else.<br>
<br>
It is interesting that these Silicon Valley tech messiahs love the word
&#8220;disrupt&#8221; since the elusive Planet X or Nibiru was also called The
Disruptor by the ancients. Are these mad men and women channeling the
Nibiru-dwelling Annunaki reptilians via their demonic behavior? Quantum
or D-wave computing as done by CERN is finding some very interesting
portals into other dimensions indeed.<br>
<br>
Has a life spent behind computer screens turned these video-game
junkies turned tech prophets into cyborgs, now commissioned by the
mothership to proselytize the merits of transhumanism, &#8220;singularity&#8221;,
intellect worship and Luciferian amorality to those who remain human?<br>
<br>
The most demented of these badly damaged cyborgs has to be Tesla and
SpaceX founder Elon Musk, whose latest act has been to tell us
repeatedly that he warned everyone that AI was going to subjugate the
human race but no one listened. Musk says now it is too late and his
answer (the old Masonic problem-reaction-solution or Order out of
Chaos) is to market his Neuralink technology, which will link the human
brain to AI.<br>
<br>
If you&#8217;ve never heard Musk talk, check out any of his interviews. This
is a person whose heart chakra has been completely closed, who revels
only in being &#8220;right&#8221;, complete with the use of the biggest words his
stunted brain can conjure up. His attitude towards the AI apocalypse
which he continues to bring to fruition is a coldly cavalier, &#8220;if we
can&#8217;t beat them, we might as well join them&#8221;.<br>
<br>
DARPA created the Internet. Silicon Valley is a military enterprise
well-funded by the City of London Rothschild bankers and Europe&#8217;s Black
Nobility. Musk, Dugan, Schmidt, Kurzweil and the other tech sycophants
are serving these Annunaki bloodline lizard kings in this frontal
assault at enslaving and destroying humanity.<br>
<br>
All human beings face a choice. Your decision seals your fate both in
this world and beyond. Those who defend the heart of humanity by
exposing and walking away from this unfolding technofascist electronic
control grid will be rewarded with eternal life.<br>
<br>
Those who stay plugged in and spellbound will help the cyborg slowly
marginalize and kill off the messengers of truth. These will accept the
mark of the AI beast, be well-fed, over-entertained and commended
regularly by the mothership. In other words, they will &#8220;fit in&#8221;. The
only problem for these cowards will be their hijacked destiny. Where I
come from they call it &#8220;Hell&#8221;.<br>

Roberto Nakay Flotte aka "Pitaya Queen" is not a "poor impoverished

believe he is. He and his partner Cesar Mejia are accused of being
coyotes who work in human trafficking and prostitution.<br>

Discover That ~50% Of Muslims Are Inbred</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
</div>
<br>
After extensive scientific research, experts believe that nearly 50
percent of Muslims worldwide are the offspring of first cousins.<br>
<br>
Because of religious and cultural customs, around half of the world&#8217;s
Muslim population is confirmed to be the offspring of generational
inbreeding, meaning that they are the product of incest in some form.<br>
<br>
In a study of 20 populous Islamic nations, an average of 49.8 percent
of all marriages were to first cousins.<br>
<br>
The most disturbing aspect of this statistic is that it doesn&#8217;t even
include marriages of double first cousins &#8212; first cousins who are the
offspring of two siblings marrying unrelated siblings of another family.<br>
<br>
Pakistan, in which roughly 70 percent of citizens marry first cousins,
was also included, which bumped the number up over a full one percent...<br>
