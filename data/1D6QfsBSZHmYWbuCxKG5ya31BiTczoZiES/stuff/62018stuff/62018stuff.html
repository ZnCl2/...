          I observed strange electrical signals from a tomato plant in
          Taiwan five days before the 2008 Sichuan M8.0 Earthquake. That
          opened my door to quake forecast. Since then, I observed
          electrical signals of plants, tofu, soil, water or air to
          predict earthquakes. I successfully predicted a lot of quakes.
          Now I have about 30 quake forecast stations all over the
          world. I will publish a series of papers to describe my
          discoveries in the past 10 years. This paper is the start of
          the series. I am Founder and CEO of Taiwan Quake Forecast
          Institute.<br>

          &nbsp;Peer inside an antique radio and you'll find what look
          like small light bulbs. They're actually vacuum tubes—the
          predecessors of the silicon transistor. Vacuum tubes went the
          way of the dinosaurs in the 1960s, but researchers have now
          brought them back to life, creating a nano-sized version
          that's faster and hardier than the transistor. It's even able
          to survive the harsh radiation of outer space....<br>

            <b>Paul Craig Roberts</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Dear Readers, In the Western World truth, justice, and liberty
          are in total collapse. They cannot be resurrected and restored
          without information. Few people have that information. The
          young are born into what exists, and as the tyranny increases
          year by year, tyranny becomes the natural order to them.
          Indeed, they do not recognize tyranny. Their cell phones,
          social media, and the Internet give them the illusion of
          freedom. The old are lost in the controversies of their time:
          The Russians are communists, only hippies, left-wingers, and
          communists distrust the great and good US government. In
          short, the vast bulk of the American people haven’t a clue.
          When readers ask me to tell them the solution, what to do, my
          answer is that nothing can be done until enough people are
          informed. Informing is my job. Support my efforts and those of
          a few others whose only agenda is to inform.<br>
          <br>
          In America, and throughout the Western world, it is harder and
          harder to speak the truth. Indeed, truth is such a devalued
          virtue that to speak it almost qualifies one as a criminal. If
          you want truth spoken, you must support it.<br>
          <br>
          Now for the column:<br>
          <br>
          I remember when America was a free country. You could get on
          an airliner without an ID. Driving licenses didn’t even have
          photos. If a friend was coming through your city on a flight
          and had a few hours layover, you could meet them inside the
          airport for lunch or dinner. You could meet friends, children,
          and relatives at the gate or see them off at the gate. Parents
          could actually put children on the plane and grandparents
          could take them off.<br>
          <br>
          Your flight ticket was good at any airline. If something
          happened to your flight or you missed it, you could use the
          ticket on another airline going to the same place. On
          international flights you were permitted two free stopovers
          prior to your destination. If you were going to Athens,
          Greece, for example, you could first visit Paris and then
          Rome. It worked both ways, over and back. So one air ticket,
          six cities.<br>
          <br>
          I can remember when you could enter a Manhattan office
          building without having to show an ID, be looked up on a list,
          and cleared in, and when you could check in a hotel without an
          ID and paid your bill when you checked out, with cash if you
          preferred. The only evidence of your name was the one you gave
          when you checked in.<br>
          <br>
          Cars didn’t beep at you and neither did appliances nor
          construction machinery. The world was a quieter, less
          noise-disturbed place.<br>
          <br>
          Common sense was more prevalent. Today it is hard to find any
          common sense. The British parliament is debating a law that
          would criminalize upskirt photographs. The “invasion of
          privacy” would have a price tag of two years imprisonment. Yet
          government can invade our privacy at will with street cameras,
          traffic cameras, read our emails, listen to our telephone
          calls, monitor our credit card purchases. Serious kinds of
          privacy invasion run amuck, but parents cannot find out if an
          underaged daughter is pregnant or has VD.<br>
          <br>
          As kids we ran free. Heaven help a parent that permitted that
          today.<br>
          <br>
          Oh, but times are more dangerous today we are told. What made
          today more dangerous? Failures in public policy. The
          government has made life more dangerous and less free....<br>

          The invention provides a vinasse fulvic acid extraction
          method. Firstly, vinasse is firstly regulated to be alkaline,
          and then hot extraction, acid analysis, precipitation and
          enrichment treatment are sequentially performed to extract
          vinasse fulvic acid. The experimental results of the

          extracted from the vinasse by adopting the extraction method,
          and the yield of the vinasse fulvic acid is 4.2-6.25%. In
          addition, the obtained vinasse fulvic acid is a
          microcrystalline-state substance, is soluble in water, acid
          and alkali, is slightly soluble in ethyl alcohol, is not
          soluble in chloroform and acetone and does not produce an
          obvious layering phenomenon. The vinasse fulvic acid can also

          It has been independently confirmed both by Linda Moulton Howe

          are in fact a message written in binary code that can be
          translated via a standard ASCII table. C.J.’s message reads as
          follows:<br>

          ... Beef, responsible for roughly 6% of greenhouse gas

          climate change, according to a 2013 United Nations report.<br>

          Politicians are the only people in the world who create
          problems and then campaign against them.<br>
          <br>
          Have you ever wondered, if both the Democrats and the
          Republicans are against deficits, WHY do we have deficits?
          Have you ever wondered, if all the politicians are against
          inflation and high taxes, WHY do we have inflation and high
          taxes?<br>
          <br>
          You and I don't propose a federal budget. The President does.<br>
          <br>
          You and I don't have the Constitutional authority to vote on
          appropriations. The House of Representatives does.<br>
          <br>
          You and I don't write the tax code, Congress does.<br>
          <br>
          You and I don't set fiscal policy, Congress does.<br>
          <br>
          You and I don't control monetary policy, the Federal Reserve
          Bank does.<br>
          <br>
          One hundred senators, 435 congressmen, one President, and nine
          Supreme Court justices equates to 545 human beings out of the
          300 million are directly, legally, morally, and individually
          responsible for the domestic problems that plague this
          country.<br>
          <br>
          I excluded the members of the Federal Reserve Board because
          that problem was created by the Congress. In 1913, Congress
          delegated its Constitutional duty to provide a sound currency
          to a federally chartered, but private, central bank.<br>
          <br>
          I excluded all the special interests and lobbyists for a sound
          reason. They have no legal authority. They have no ability to
          coerce a senator, a congressman, or a President to do one
          cotton-picking thing. I don't care if they offer a politician
          $1 million dollars in cash. The politician has the power to
          accept or reject it. No matter what the lobbyist promises, it
          is the legislator's responsibility to determine how he votes.<br>
          <br>
          Those 545 human beings spend much of their energy convincing
          you that what they did is not their fault. They cooperate in
          this common con regardless of party.<br>
          <br>
          What separates a politician from a normal human being is an
          excessive amount of gall. No normal human being would have the
          gall of a Speaker, who stood up and criticized the President
          for creating deficits.. ( The President can only propose a
          budget. He cannot force the Congress to accept it.)<br>
          <br>
          The Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land, gives
          sole responsibility to the House of Representatives for
          originating and approving appropriations and taxes. Who is the
          speaker of the House?( John Boehner. He is the leader of the
          majority party. He and fellow House members, not the
          President, can approve any budget they want. ) If the
          President vetoes it, they can pass it over his veto if they
          agree to. [The House has passed a budget but the Senate has
          not approved a budget in over three years. The President's
          proposed budgets have gotten almost unanimous rejections in
          the Senate in that time. ]<br>
          <br>
          It seems inconceivable to me that a nation of 300 million
          cannot replace 545 people who stand convicted -- by present
          facts -- of incompetence and irresponsibility. I can't think
          of a single domestic problem that is not traceable directly to
          those 545 people. When you fully grasp the plain truth that
          545 people exercise the power of the federal government, then
          it must follow that what exists is what they want to exist.<br>

          In a new explosive interview, Silicon Valley tech pioneer and
          creator of the virtual reality 'avatar' Jaron Lanier tells
          people to delete your social media accounts due to the strong
          correlation between persistent social media usage and a
          dramatic societal rise in depression, anger, and anxiety that
          he says is the result of internet-induced modified forms of
          behavior.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          The warning comes in the wake of his new book which details
          how the creators of social media and the early engineers
          behind the internet "foolishly laid the foundations for global
          monopolies." <br>
          <br>
          Jaron Lanier is best known as a founding father of the field
          of virtual reality and throughout his polymath career has
          written extensively on human-computer interaction, including
          most recently in his book Ten Arguments for Deleting Your
          Social Media Accounts Right Now.<br>
          <br>
          Lanier explained in a recent UK Channel 4 interview: <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you watch the television the
          television isn't watching you. When you see the billboard the

          social media, search, YouTube — when you see these things,
          you're being observed constantly and algorithms are taking
          that information and changing what you see next.<br>

          <br>
          Rentfrow et al. (2013) constructs a cross-section of the “Big
          Five” personality traits and demonstrates their relationship
          with outcomes variables for the continental United States and
          the District of Columbia. Hyatt et al. (Forthcoming) creates a
          means of describing psychopathy in terms of the Big Five
          personality traits. When these two findings are combined, a
          state-level estimate of psychopathy is produced. Among the
          typical predictions made regarding psychopathy, the variable
          with the closest univariate relationship with this new
          statistical aggregate is the percentage of the population in
          the state living in an urban area. There is not a clear
          univariate relationship with homicide rates. <br>

          </div>
          <br>
          Research on the structural features of people’s most enduring
          regrets has focused on whether they result from having acted
          or having failed to act. Here we focus on a different
          structural feature, their connection to a person’s
          self-concept. In 6 studies, we predict and find that people’s
          most enduring regrets stem more often from discrepancies
          between their actual and ideal selves than their actual and
          ought selves. We also provide evidence that this asymmetry is
          at least partly due to differences in how people cope with
          regret. People are quicker to take steps to cope with failures
          to live up to their duties and responsibilities (ought-related
          regrets) than their failures to live up to their goals and
          aspirations (ideal-related regrets). As a consequence,
          ideal-related regrets are more likely to remain unresolved,
          leaving people more likely to regret not being all they could
          have been more than all they should have been.<br>

          the proponents of the cold fusion - Martin Fleischmann and
          Stanley Pons, even as hundreds of scientists across the world
          replicated their experiment. They had told the world that
          electrolysis of heavy water led to release of excess heat at
          room temperature. This experiment was replicated with success
          the same year at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Trombay. The
          then Director of BARC, P K Iyengar PK Iyengar and Director of
          the elite Physics Group Mahadevan Srinivasan were successful
          in generating surplus heat energy at room temperature by the
          same experiment which was reported by international media.<br>
          <br>
          Since there was opposition from conventional scientists,
          Iyengar and Srinivasan could not sustain the momentum and Cold
          fusion was put in the back burner by scientists.<br>
          <br>
          Still, there were some physicists like Srinivasan, who
          believed that there should be light at the end of the tunnel.
          The billion dollar question was how the excess heat was
          generated at room temperature and that too, without the
          release of radio active by-products.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;“There should be a scientific reason behind the
          generation of heat energy during such experiments. Let them
          explain it,” the then chief of Indira Gandhi Atomic Research
          Centre at Kalpakkam, Late Dr Baldev Raj had told this reporter
          when asked why the Department of Atomic Energy was not
          enthusiastic about the cold fusion project which has since
          been renamed as Low Energy Nuclear Reaction.<br>
          <br>
          After 30 years, Japanese scientists have come out with reports
          that substantiate observations made during the cold fusion
          experiments. A research group including scientists of Toyota,
          Nissan Motor, Universities of Tohoku, Kobe, Kyushu and&nbsp;
          Nagoya have found that heat energy was released at room
          temperature. Professor Emeritus Akito Takahashi, who led the
          teams has an answer for questions raised by scientists like
          late Dr Raj. “It could be multi-body fusion occurring at an
          extremely small space,” said he.<br>
          <br>
          Eminent cardiologist Dr B M Hegde has already pointed out that
          transmutation of potassium to sodium happening in human body
          is akin to release of heat energy during cold fusion. The
          research group expects that it was possible to generate 1
          kilowatt of heat, which is two orders of magnitude larger than
          the present reactions, by improving the structure of the
          sample, increasing the amount reactant, devising changes to
          the temperature conditions. The attempt to develop a cold
          fusion reactor has resumed in India thanks to the efforts of
          Srinivasan. The BARC is in the forefront along with Swamy
          Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana (S-Vyas) in making this
          dream machine a reality.&nbsp; “I may not be able to give the
          exact date on which the cold fusion reactor would materialise.
          But it is around the corner,” said Dr Srinivasan.<br>

              Incident </b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          ...In a letter addressed to his brother-in-law, Burgin,
          Crockett detailed the following experience:<br>
          <br>
          “William and I were pushing through some thicket, clearing the
          way, when I sat down to mop my brow. I sat for a spell,
          watching as William made his good and fine progress. I removed
          my boots and sat with my rations, thinking the afternoon a
          fine time to lunch. As the birds whistled and chirped, and I
          ate my small and meager ration, I tapped my axe upon the
          opposite end of the felled tree I rested upon.<br>
          <br>
          “Whether it was the axe’s disturbance or possibly the heat of
          the sun which caused an apparition to slowly form in front of
          my eyes, I know not. As a Christian man, I swear to you, Abe,
          that what spirit came upon me was the shape and shade of a
          large ape man, the likes we might expect among the more
          bellicose and hostile Indian tribes in the Territories. The
          shade formed into the most deformed and ugly countenance.
          Covered in wild hair, with small and needling eyes, large
          broken rows of teeth, and the height of three foundlings, I
          spit upon the ground the bread I was eating.<br>
          <br>
          “The monster then addressed a warning to me. Abner, it told me
          to return from Texas, to flee this Fort and to abandon this
          lost cause. When I began to question this, the creature spread
          upon the wind like the morning steam swirls off a frog pond. I
          swear to you, Abner, that whatever meat or sausage disagreed
          with me that afternoon, I swore off all beef and hog for a day
          or so afterward.”<br>

              retinopathy and neuropathy, destroys the optic nerve from
              the methanol, causes diabetics to go into convulsions and

              Another epidemic that has soared throughout the world is
              obesity right along with diabetes because of aspartame.
              The pop companies knew this would happen and the National
              Soft Drink Association, now American Beverage&nbsp;
              protested to the FDA in a 33 page report that was added to
              the congressional record on May 7, l985. Using an
              affidavit by Dr. Richard Wurtman it said:&nbsp; "Aspartame
              has been demonstrated to inhibit the carbohydrate-induced
              synthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin.&nbsp;
              Serotonin blunts the sensation of craving carbohydrates
              and thus is part of the body's feedback system that helps
              limit consumption of carbohydrate to appropriate levels.
              Its inhibition by aspartame could lead to the anomalous
              result of a diet product causing increased consumption of
              carbohydrates."&nbsp; The congressional record is on my
              web site, www.mpwhi.com .&nbsp; Among their&nbsp;
              objections&nbsp; they were telling the FDA they didn't
              want to use aspartame because it would make people fat.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;Dr. Wurtman had serious concerns including&nbsp;
              increased brain levels of phenylalanine and tyrosine&nbsp;
              likely to affect the synthesis of certain
              neurotransmitters - substances vital to the regulation of
              brain function - and that changes in the levels of
              neurotransmitters could in turn cause adverse
              physiological effects (by for example, modifying the
              function of the autonomic nervous system) and/or
              behavioral effects.&nbsp; Written years ago that is what
              has happened as aspartame is a psycho drug and triggers
              psychiatric and behavioral problems and interacts with all
              antidepressants according to Dr. Roberts.&nbsp; Ralph
              Walton, M.D., psychiatrist, did a study on aspartame but
              the reactions were so severe the institution stopped the
              study:&nbsp;
              https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006322393902518<br>
              <br>
              Diabetic specialist H. J. Roberts, M.D. said on page 389
              of "Aspartame Disease: An Ignored&nbsp;&nbsp;
              Epidemic":&nbsp; "A gain of considerable weight, as much
              as 80 to 100 pounds, occurred in 40 aspartame
              reactors.&nbsp; This term "paradoxic" conveys their
              initial intent to lose or "control" weight.&nbsp; The
              increase occurred with various aspartame products.&nbsp;
              Case IX-B-10 gained 60 pounds on a franchised diet plan
              containing aspartame.&nbsp; Abstinence from aspartame
              generally effects a significant loss of undesired weight."<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;Dr. Roberts says on page 392:<br>
              <br>
              "*&nbsp; Two thirds of adults in the United States are on
              diets to lose or control weight (Serdula 1999).<br>
              *&nbsp; Most overweight patients seen in consultation by
              the author consume considerable aspartame.<br>
              *&nbsp; Aspartame products have played a major role in our
              fat-enabling culture, with emphasis on the "snack well
              syndrome" using low-calorie foods and sodas.<br>
              *&nbsp; The American Cancer Society (1986) found that
              persons using artificial sweeteners gain more weight than
              those who avoid them,"<br>
              <br>
              A study by Massachusetts General Hospital showed&nbsp;
              when aspartame is ingested it releases phenylalanine,
              which disrupts a gut enzyme called intestinal alkaline
              phosphatase (IAP) that had previously been shown to
              prevent obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome.&nbsp;
              Researchers found that this process prevents weight loss
              and can even cause weight gain.<br>
              <br>
              In&nbsp; a 2013 study published in the Proceedings of the
              National Academy of Sciences, Dr. Richard Hodin and
              colleagues also found that feeding IAP to mice kept on a
              high fat diet could prevent the development of metabolic
              syndrome and reduce symptoms in animals that already had
              the condition.,&nbsp; Obesity, metabolic syndrome and
              diabetes are epidemic because of aspartame and have been
              proven on independent scientific peer reviewed studies.<br>
              <br>
              As the&nbsp; aspartame obesity epidemic soared as expected
              by the admission of the soda companies themselves
              officials said they had to get rid of sugar.&nbsp; Then
              came the sugar tax and manufacturers started doing the
              unthinkable, replacing sugar with aspartame, the very
              toxin which no doubt caused these two epidemics of
              diabetes and obesity.<br>
              <br>
              Almost everyday you read articles from manufacturers
              admitting this replacement.&nbsp; From an article today
              from the Trade Chronicle discussing the diabetic food
              market it states:&nbsp; "The first Initiative taken by
              manufacturers is that they have started using artificial
              sweeteners such as Aspartame, Acesulfame K, and Neotame
              instead of sugar."&nbsp; In a discussion with Dr. Jeffrey
              Bada years ago he said Neotame is just the aspartame
              formula scrambled. Today its unlabeled.&nbsp; Acesulfame K
              caused cancer and leukemia in original studies just like
              aspartame does.&nbsp; Sucralose (brand name Splenda) is
              particularly bad for diabetics. Researchers found that
              diabetic patients using sucralose showed a statistically
              significant increase in glycosylated hemoglobin, a marker
              that is used to assess glycemic control in diabetic
              patients. According to the FDA, "increases in
              glycosolation in hemoglobin imply lessening of control of
              diabetes."<br>
              <br>
              Because aspartame is triggering such an epidemic of
              obesity class actions have been filed for deceptive
              advertising against Coke, Pepsi and Dr.
              Pepper.&nbsp;&nbsp; The National Health Federation
              published the article in the Health Freedom&nbsp;
              News:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              https://thenhf.co.uk/six-class-action-lawsuits-filed-against-aspartame/
              As one attorney said, if they would simply remove the "t"
              from diet. You can subscribe to the NHF and keep up with
              what is going on.&nbsp; They are the people who fight to
              save our vitamins and herbs and alert on aspartame.<br>
              <br>
              Diabetics abstaining from aspartame see so many of their
              medical problems disappearing that were caused by this
              poison.&nbsp; Then they say, "so what do I use now as a
              sweetener?"&nbsp; I had this conversation with Mike Sylver
              many years ago who grew herbs in the Amazon Rain Forest.
              He said he would create a safe sweetener. Here is
              the&nbsp; "Just Like Sugar" story:&nbsp;&nbsp;
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MebZ2dlHkkU&nbsp; Now they
              can have a sweetener that is made from organic food like
              orange peel and organic chicory which has been used for
              over 70 years to improve the health of diabetics. So there
              is something to replace sugar with, not using aspartame
              which caused the problem in the first place.&nbsp; In the
              5 minute video you will also see Mike Sylver being given
              an award by William Shatner for creating the first safe
              sweetener.&nbsp; Dr. Russell Blaylock, neurosurgeon and
              author of "Excitotoxins: The Taste That Kills" on
              aspartame asked for it to be analyzed.&nbsp; On receiving
              the analyzation&nbsp; he wrote in the Blaylock Wellness
              Report, "Finally a safe sweetener".&nbsp; More information
              can be found at www.justlikesugarinc.com<br>
              <br>
              So the problems have been solved we just have to stop the
              aspartame manufacturers from mass poisoning the public
              with aspartame. <br>
              <br>
              Since the beginning the aspartame manufacturers have sold
              the public stacks of propaganda that have nothing to do
              with reality.&nbsp; It has tied the hands of physicians
              who have no idea aspartame interacts with drugs and
              vaccines.&nbsp; Yet almost 100 per cent of independent,
              scientific peer reviewed studies have shown the
              problems.&nbsp; Usually when a lot of facts get out on
              aspartame like studies showing aspartame causes cancer,
              dementia, obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, etc. the
              aspartame industry decides to get a review done and makes
              up more fairy tales.&nbsp; Be sure to check out the
              Aspartame Toxicity Center, www.holisticmed.com/aspartame
              and read about some of the reviews and how far industry
              will go to mislead the public. <br>
              <br>
              Dr. H. J. Robert, diabetic specialist,&nbsp; who wrote the
              medical text on aspartame disease has now passed
              on.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              http://www.mpwhi.com/h_j_roberts_has_died.htm His work was
              worthy of the Nobel Prize.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I worked with
              him for 20 years.&nbsp; As he was dying he said, "Please
              continue my work and save as many as you can."&nbsp; I
              gave him my solemn promise.&nbsp; He then sent me crates
              of his 30 years of research on aspartame. He wanted
              aspartame banned so bad before he died.&nbsp; He listened
              to heart wrenching complaints of aspartame victims in the
              trenches of medical practice these 30 years getting them
              off the toxin and returning them to healthful lives.&nbsp;
              If he was here today he would be disgusted with industry
              still pushing this poison on the public with full
              knowledge of its toxicity.<br>
              <br>
              Dr. Roberts is still in our hearts and his help continues
              from beyond the grave with his 1000 page medical text,
              "Aspartame Disease: An Ignored Epidemic", that he
              dedicated to me.&nbsp; So in his memory below is the
              entire chapter on aspartame and diabetes giving the public
              all the facts on this diabetic eruption.&nbsp; He told me
              once when discussing topics always quote the full story
              from the text.&nbsp; Here you have it and it will help the
              public understand the wickedness of industry and the FDA
              allowing a poison to be marketed for human consumption
              that was once listed with the pentagon in an inventory of
              prospective biochemical warfare weapons:&nbsp;
              http://www.mpwhi.com/ecologist_september_2005.pdf <br>
              <br>
              I sign off with wishes of good health for diabetics and
              hope for the obese now off aspartame.&nbsp; Please send us
              your story 60 days off this toxin.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See

              of their larger, next-generation harvester proved what the
              team had predicted earlier in 2017: that the water
              harvester can extract drinkable water every day/night
              cycle at very low humidity and at low cost, making it
              ideal for people living in arid, water-starved areas of
              the world.<br>
              <br>
              “There is nothing like this,” said Omar Yaghi, who
              invented the technology underlying the harvester. “It
              operates at ambient temperature with ambient sunlight, and
              with no additional energy input you can collect water in
              the desert. This laboratory-to-desert journey allowed us
              to really turn water harvesting from an interesting
              phenomenon into a science.”<br>
              <br>
              Yaghi, the James and Neeltje Tretter chair in chemistry at
              UC Berkeley and a faculty scientist at Lawrence Berkeley
              National Laboratory, and his team will report the results
              of the first field test of a water-collecting harvester in
              the June 8 issue of the journal Science Advances.<br>
              <br>
              The trial in Scottsdale, where the relative humidity drops
              from a high of 40 percent at night to as low as 8 percent
              during the day, demonstrated that the harvester should be
              easy to scale up by simply adding more of the water
              absorber, a highly porous material called a metal-organic
              framework, or MOF. The researchers anticipate that with
              the current MOF (MOF-801), made from the expensive metal
              zirconium, they will ultimately be able to harvest about
              200 milliliters (about 7 ounces) of water per kilogram
              (2.2 pounds) of MOF, or 3 ounces of water per pound.<br>
              <br>
              But Yaghi also reports that he has created a new MOF based
              on aluminum, called MOF-303, that is at least 150 times
              cheaper and captures twice as much water in lab tests.
              This will enable a new generation of harvesters producing
              more than 400 ml (1.5 cups) of water per day from a
              kilogram of MOF, the equivalent of half a 12-ounce soda
              can per pound per day.<br>
              <br>
              “There has been tremendous interest in commercializing
              this, and there are several startups already engaged in
              developing a commercial water-harvesting device,” Yaghi
              said. “The aluminum MOF is making this practical for water
              production, because it is cheap.”<br>
              <br>
              Yaghi is also working with King Abdul Aziz City for
              Science and Technology in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and its
              president, Prince Dr. Turki Saud Mohammad Al Saud, on the
              technology as part of their joint research Center of
              Excellence for Nanomaterials and Clean Energy.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Super-absorbent MOFs</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              Yaghi is a pioneer in metal-organic frameworks, which are
              solids with so many internal channels and holes that a
              sugar-cube-size MOF might have an internal surface area
              the size of six football fields. This surface area easily
              absorbs gases or liquids but, just as important, quickly
              releases them when heated. Various types of MOFs are
              already being tested as a way to pack more gas into the
              tanks of hydrogen-fueled vehicles, absorb carbon dioxide
              from smokestacks and store methane.<br>
              <br>
              Several years ago, Yaghi created MOF-801, which absorbs
              and releases water easily, and last year he tested small
              quantities in a simple harvester to see if he could
              capture water from ambient air overnight and use the heat
              of the sun to drive it out again for use. That harvester,
              built by a collaborator at MIT using less than 2 grams of
              MOF, proved that the concept worked: the windows fogged up
              in the sun, though the researchers were not able to
              collect or accurately measure the water.<br>
              <br>
              That same harvester was transported to the desert earlier
              this year and worked similarly, though again only droplets
              of water were generated as a proof of concept.<br>
              <br>
              For the new paper, the UC Berkeley team — graduate student
              Eugene Kapustin and postdoctoral fellows Markus Kalmutzki
              and Farhad Fathieh — collected and measured the water and
              tested the latest generation harvester under varying
              conditions of humidity, temperature and solar intensity.<br>
              <br>
              The harvester is essentially a box within a box. The inner
              box holds a 2-square-foot bed of MOF grains open to the
              air to absorb moisture. This is encased in a two-foot
              plastic cube with transparent top and sides. The top was
              left open at night to let air flow in and contact the MOF,
              but was replaced during the day so the box could heat up
              like a greenhouse to drive water back out of the MOF. The
              released water condensed on the inside of the outer box
              and fell to the bottom, where the researchers collected it
              with a pipette.<br>
              team sets up harvester for Arizona test<br>
              <br>
              The extensive field tests lay out a blueprint allowing
              engineers to configure the harvester for the differing
              conditions in Arizona, the Mediterranean or anywhere else,
              given a specific MOF.<br>

              “The key development here is that it operates at low
              humidity, because that is what it is in arid regions of
              the world,” Yaghi said. In these conditions, the harvester
              collects water even at sub-zero dew points.<br>
              <br>
              Yaghi is eagerly awaiting the next field test, which will
              test the aluminum-based MOF and is planned for Death
              Valley in late summer, where temperatures reach 110
              degrees Fahrenheit in the daytime and remain in the 70s at
              night, with nighttime humidity as low as 25 percent.<br>

              production of water from desert air has not been
              developed. A proof-of-concept device for harvesting water
              at low relative humidity was reported; however, it used
              external cooling and was not desert-tested. We report a
              laboratory-to-desert experiment where a prototype using up
              to 1.2 kg of metal-organic framework (MOF)–801 was tested
              in the laboratory and later in the desert of Arizona, USA.
              It produced 100 g of water per kilogram of MOF-801 per
              day-and-night cycle, using only natural cooling and
              ambient sunlight as a source of energy. We also report an
              aluminum-based MOF-303, which delivers more than twice the
              amount of water. The desert experiment uncovered key
              parameters pertaining to the energy, material, and air
              requirements for efficient production of water from desert

              Observation Affects Reality</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          One of the most bizarre premises of quantum theory, which has
          long fascinated philosophers and physicists alike, states that
          by the very act of watching, the observer affects the observed
          reality. <br>
          <br>
          In a study reported in the February 26 issue of Nature (Vol.
          391, pp. 871-874), researchers at the Weizmann Institute of
          Science have now conducted a highly controlled experiment
          demonstrating how a beam of electrons is affected by the act
          of being observed. The experiment revealed that the greater
          the amount of "watching," the greater the observer's influence
          on what actually takes place....<br>
          <br>
          The research team headed by Prof. Mordehai Heiblum, included
          Ph.D. student Eyal Buks, Dr. Ralph Schuster, Dr. Diana Mahalu
          and Dr. Vladimir Umansky. The scientists, members of the
          Condensed Matter Physics Department, work at the Institute's
          Joseph H. and Belle R. Braun Center for Submicron Research.<br>
          <br>
          When a quantum "observer" is watching Quantum mechanics states
          that particles can also behave as waves. This can be true for
          electrons at the submicron level, i.e., at distances measuring
          less than one micron, or one thousandth of a millimeter. When
          behaving as waves, they can simultaneously pass through
          several openings in a barrier and then meet again at the other
          side of the barrier. This "meeting" is known as interference.<br>
          <br>
          Strange as it may sound, interference can only occur when no
          one is watching. Once an observer begins to watch the
          particles going through the openings, the picture changes
          dramatically: if a particle can be seen going through one
          opening, then it's clear it didn't go through another. In
          other words, when under observation, electrons are being
          "forced" to behave like particles and not like waves. Thus the
          mere act of observation affects the experimental findings.<br>
          <br>
          To demonstrate this, Weizmann Institute researchers built a
          tiny device measuring less than one micron in size, which had
          a barrier with two openings. They then sent a current of
          electrons towards the barrier. The "observer" in this
          experiment wasn't human. Institute scientists used for this
          purpose a tiny but sophisticated electronic detector that can
          spot passing electrons. The quantum "observer's" capacity to
          detect electrons could be altered by changing its electrical
          conductivity, or the strength of the current passing through
          it.<br>
          <br>
          Apart from "observing," or detecting, the electrons, the
          detector had no effect on the current. Yet the scientists
          found that the very presence of the detector-"observer" near
          one of the openings caused changes in the interference pattern
          of the electron waves passing through the openings of the
          barrier. In fact, this effect was dependent on the "amount" of
          the observation: when the "observer's" capacity to detect
          electrons increased, in other words, when the level of the
          observation went up, the interference weakened; in contrast,
          when its capacity to detect electrons was reduced, in other
          words, when the observation slackened, the interference
          increased. ...<br>

          The IQ scores of young people have begun to fall after rising
          steadily since the Second World War, according to the first
          authoritative study of the phenomenon.<br>
          <br>
          The decline, which is equivalent to at least seven points per
          generation, is thought to have started with the cohort born in
          1975, who reached adulthood in the early Nineties.<br>
          <br>
          Scientists say that the deterioration could be down to changes
          in the way maths and languages are taught, or to a shift from
          reading books to spending time on television and computers....<br>

          Macquarie University / Mar 19, 2013<br>
          "For the first time an array of interconnected problems is
          moving a global civilization toward collapse. Driven by
          increasing overpopulation and over consumption by the rich,
          these dilemmas include climate disruption, loss of ecosystem
          services, global poisoning, depletion of resources (especially
          soils and groundwater), and the threat of vast famines,
          epidemics and resource wars. Only a concerted effort to reduce
          the scale of society and focus much more attention on
          agriculture and equity seems likely to much improve the human
          prospect. Growth is the disease; sustainability is attainable,
          but only with unprecedented rethinking, effort, and
          cooperation."<br>

          This seminar consists of a short presentation given by
          Professor Paul Ehrlich based on his recent paper Can a

          REMEMBER OPERATION JADE HELM, WITH THE PRISON WAL MARTS? IT
          HAPPENED AND A SENATOR BUSTED IT ON VIDEO.<br>
          The ilk of Snopes laughed at us and called us conspiracy
          "theorists". Well, the laugh is now on them.<br>
          <br>
          THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT EVENTS EVER DOCUMENTED,
          EVER. YOU HAVE GOT TO WATCH THIS 25 MINUTE VIDEO OF A SENATOR
          VISITING ONE OF THESE WAL MARTS. THIS IS THE RAW VIDEO THE
          SENATOR SHOT WITH HIS OWN CREW, AND NOT JUST AN ATTENTION GRAB
          BY A RANDOM BLOGGER. CONSPIRACY FACT!!!! THIS IS THE MOST
          IMPORTANT VIDEO EVER, IT IS ON PAR WITH THE ALEX AT THE GROVE
          VIDEO.<br>
          Ha ha ha, he handles this so well and absolutely BURNS THIS
          CONSPIRACY.<br>
          SURPRISINGLY, Democrat Senator Jeff Merkley busted this.<br>
          A couple years ago there was a massive military exercise in
          the U.S. called Jade Helm, part of which was the conversion of
          several wal-marts with "plumbing problems" (as a reason for
          their sudden shut down) into detention facilities.<br>
          <br>
          Jade Helm vanished from the headlines, and "conspiracy
          theorists" were laughed at because "nothing happened". Now the
          "conspiracy theorists" have conspiracy fact, because the
          Wal-Marts really were converted into detention centers.<br>
          <br>
          These detention centers house immigrant children, who were
          taken from their parents. Now, this is pure speculation, but
          there's plenty of wiggle room for abuse in such situations,
          and it would be foolish to overlook the possibility that these
          detention centers are in part used in the child slave trade. I
          have no evidence of this, but it is an obvious possibility
          with the current child slave trading situation.<br>
          <br>
          Senator Jeff Merkeley showed up at one of these detention
          centers in Texas, and was denied access. The detention center
          CALLED THE F***ING POLICE ON HIM when he asked to enter!!!
          WTF, OVER!!!<br>
          <br>
          The detention center then issued an apology saying "oh we are
          sorry, but it does not matter if you are a senator, you will
          be denied access without an appointment. PROBLEM: HE CALLED
          FOR AN APPOINTMENT, AND THEY REFUSED TO ARRANGE IT. So he
          showed up anyway. If this place was on the up and up, he
          should have been granted VIP access.<br>
          <br>
          MY QUESTION: WHY NOT? HE IS A SENATOR FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, NO
          VIP ACCESS? WHY??!!?? They refused him access completely.
          WHY??!!??<br>
          <br>
          Repeat: I strongly suspect child trafficking. If it has to be
          kept secret, there is something evil going on. If they won't
          let him in, even after he announced he was going to arrive,
          SOMETHING IS SERIOIUSLY WRONG<br>
          There is a video of him walking up to this detention center
          HERE (this is the entire video of the incident.)It is
          complete, the senator is very thorough, and explains it all
          very well as he does this. <br>

              breast cancer</b><br>
            <b>By James Gallagher</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          The life of a woman with terminal breast cancer has been saved
          by a pioneering new therapy, say US researchers.<br>
          <br>
          It involved pumping 90 billion cancer-killing immune cells
          into her body.<br>
          <br>
          Judy Perkins had been given three months to live, but two
          years later there is no sign of cancer in her body.<br>
          <br>
          The team at the US National Cancer Institute says the therapy
          is still experimental, but could transform the treatment of
          all cancer.<br>
          <br>
          Judy - who lives in Florida - had spreading, advanced breast
          cancer that could not be treated with conventional therapy.<br>
          <br>
          She had tennis ball-sized tumours in her liver and secondary
          cancers throughout her body.<br>
          <br>
          She told the BBC: "About a week after [the therapy] I started
          to feel something, I had a tumour in my chest that I could
          feel shrinking.<br>
          <br>
          "It took another week or two for it to completely go away."<br>
          <br>
          She remembers her first scan after the procedure when the
          medical staff "were all very excited and jumping around".<br>
          <br>
          It was then she was told that she was likely to be cured.<br>
          <br>
          Now she's filling her life with backpacking and sea kayaking
          and has just taken five weeks circumnavigating Florida.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Living therapy</b><br>
          <br>
          The technology is a "living drug" made from a patient's own
          cells at one of the world's leading centres of cancer
          research.<br>
          <br>
          Dr Steven Rosenberg, chief of surgery at the National Cancer
          Institute, told the BBC: "We're talking about the most highly
          personalised treatment imaginable."<br>
          <br>
          It remains experimental and still requires considerably more
          testing before it can be used more widely, but this is how it
          works: it starts by getting to know the enemy.<br>

          A patient's tumour is genetically analysed to identify the
          rare changes that might make the cancer visible to the immune
          system.<br>
          <br>
          Out of the 62 genetic abnormalities in this patient, only four
          were potential lines of attack.<br>
          <br>
          Next researchers go hunting. A patient's immune system will
          already be attacking the tumour, it's just losing the fight
          between white blood cells and cancer.<br>
          <br>
          The scientists screen the patient's white blood cells and
          extract those capable of attacking the cancer.<br>
          <br>
          These are then grown in huge quantities in the laboratory.<br>
          <br>
          Around 90 billion were injected back into the 49-year-old
          patient, alongside drugs to take the brakes off the immune
          system.<br>
          <br>
          <b>'Paradigm shift'</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          These are the results from a single patient and much larger
          trials will be needed to confirm the findings.<br>
          <br>
          The challenge so far in cancer immunotherapy is it tends to
          work spectacularly for some patients, but the majority do not
          benefit.<br>
          <br>
          Dr Rosenberg added: "This is highly experimental and we're
          just learning how to do this, but potentially it is applicable
          to any cancer.<br>
          <br>
          "At lot of works needs to be done, but the potential exists
          for a paradigm shift in cancer therapy - a unique drug for
          every cancer patient - it is very different to any other kind
          of treatment."<br>
          <br>
          The details were published in journal Nature Medicine.<br>
          <br>
          Commenting on the findings, Dr Simon Vincent, director of
          research at Breast Cancer Now, said the research was "world
          class".<br>
          <br>
          He told the BBC: "We think this is a remarkable result.<br>
          <br>
          "It's the first opportunity to see this sort of immunotherapy
          in the most common sort of breast cancer at the moment it has
          only been tested in one patient,<br>
          <br>
          "There's a huge amount of work that needs to be done, but
          potentially it could open up a whole new area of therapy for a
          large number of people."<br>

              leading to complete durable regression in metastatic
              breast cancer</b><br>
            <b>N. Zacharakis, et al.</b><br>

          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          Immunotherapy using either checkpoint blockade or the adoptive
          transfer of antitumor lymphocytes has shown effectiveness in
          treating cancers with high levels of somatic mutations—such as
          melanoma, smoking-induced lung cancers and bladder cancer—with
          little effect in other common epithelial cancers that have
          lower mutation rates, such as those arising in the
          gastrointestinal tract, breast and ovary1,2,3,4,5,6,7.
          Adoptive transfer of autologous lymphocytes that specifically
          target proteins encoded by somatically mutated genes has
          mediated substantial objective clinical regressions in
          patients with metastatic bile duct, colon and cervical
          cancers8,9,10,11. We present a patient with chemorefractory
          hormone receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer who
          was treated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)
          reactive against mutant versions of four proteins—SLC3A2,
          KIAA0368, CADPS2 and CTSB. Adoptive transfer of these
          mutant-protein-specific TILs in conjunction with interleukin
          (IL)-2 and checkpoint blockade mediated the complete durable
          regression of metastatic breast cancer, which is now ongoing
          for &gt;22 months, and it represents a new immunotherapy
          approach for the treatment of these patients.<br>

          We are a new company and the first and only one in the world
          since Dr Becker's time, to actually produce silver
          iontophoresis equipment; and which is now generally available,
          through us, to anyone.<br>
          <br>
          Though we must operate as a commercial entity, due partly to
          the considerable financial R&amp;D investment and cost
          involved to produce this equipment, our underlying mission is
          to make this equipment generally and widely available, for
          widest possible human benefit.<br>
          <br>
          The devices that meet all Dr Becker's specifications, and
          incorporate all of his published data concerning correct and
          appropriate electrical parameters are this and this one.&nbsp;
          We also custom manufacture the silver-nylon cloth electrodes
          that Dr Becker pioneered, seen here, using the latest and
          highest quality medical-grade components.<br>
          <br>
          From general electronics advances over the last approximately
          20 years, our devices are state-of-the-art, precision
          electronics instruments, robustly designed, and manufactured
          by us using high-end componentry in our Melbourne factory by
          our electronics engineers.<br>

          <br>
          Simple, inexpensive method for producing hydrogen water.<br>
          Based on suggestions here and further experimentation here are
          the current parameters I use for this protocol:<br>
          The bottles are half-liters or so and my current recipe for
          that size is 4 new 5" rods (or equivalent surface area in 5-7
          older rods), 1 gm of malic acid, fill to top with hot water
          and seal and refrigerate for 3 hours. (can leave up to 12
          hours with only slight degrading of concentrations, providing
          the seals are still tight on the bottles.) This produces
          regularly 3-4.0 ppm concentrations of H2 water provided you
          rotate/shake the container 30 sec or so before opening to
          further help dissolve the H2. (If you're getting a good pop
          when opening the bottle, feel confident you're getting close
          to these concentrations.) I also now inhale 1 big breath of
          the H2 gas after opening through a funnel per David Zweig's
          suggestion. <br>

          </div>
          <br>
          Although the research is early, the 1000+ scientific articles
          suggest that H2 has therapeutic potential in over 170
          different human and animal disease models, and essentially
          every organ of the human body.<br>
          <br>
          Molecular hydrogen (H2) or diatomic hydrogen is a tasteless,
          odorless, flammable gas<br>
          H2 reduces oxidative stress and improves redox homeostasis
          partly mediated via the Nrf2 pathway, which regulates levels
          of glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase, etc.<br>
          H2, like other gaseous-signaling molecules (e.g. NO*, CO, H2
          S), modulates signal transduction, protein phosphorylation,
          and gene expression, which provides its anti-inflammatory,
          anti-allergy, and anti-apoptotic protective effects<br>

          EVER. YOU HAVE GOT TO WATCH THIS 25 MINUTE VIDEO OF A SENATOR
          VISITING ONE OF THESE WAL MARTS. THIS IS THE RAW VIDEO THE
          SENATOR SHOT WITH HIS OWN CREW, AND NOT JUST AN ATTENTION GRAB
          BY A RANDOM BLOGGER. CONSPIRACY FACT!!!! THIS IS THE MOST
          IMPORTANT VIDEO EVER, IT IS ON PAR WITH THE ALEX AT THE GROVE
          VIDEO.<br>
          Ha ha ha, he handles this so well and absolutely BURNS THIS
          CONSPIRACY.<br>
          SURPRISINGLY, Democrat Senator Jeff Merkley busted this.<br>
          A couple years ago there was a massive military exercise in
          the U.S. called Jade Helm, part of which was the conversion of
          several wal-marts with "plumbing problems" (as a reason for
          their sudden shut down) into detention facilities.<br>
          <br>
          Jade Helm vanished from the headlines, and "conspiracy
          theorists" were laughed at because "nothing happened". Now the
          "conspiracy theorists" have conspiracy fact, because the
          Wal-Marts really were converted into detention centers.<br>
          <br>
          These detention centers house immigrant children, who were
          taken from their parents. Now, this is pure speculation, but
          there's plenty of wiggle room for abuse in such situations,
          and it would be foolish to overlook the possibility that these
          detention centers are in part used in the child slave trade. I
          have no evidence of this, but it is an obvious possibility
          with the current child slave trading situation.<br>
          <br>
          Senator Jeff Merkeley showed up at one of these detention
          centers in Texas, and was denied access. The detention center
          CALLED THE F***ING POLICE ON HIM when he asked to enter!!!
          WTF, OVER!!!<br>
          <br>
          The detention center then issued an apology saying "oh we are
          sorry, but it does not matter if you are a senator, you will
          be denied access without an appointment. PROBLEM: HE CALLED
          FOR AN APPOINTMENT, AND THEY REFUSED TO ARRANGE IT. So he
          showed up anyway. If this place was on the up and up, he
          should have been granted VIP access.<br>
          <br>
          MY QUESTION: WHY NOT? HE IS A SENATOR FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, NO
          VIP ACCESS? WHY??!!?? They refused him access completely.
          WHY??!!??<br>
          <br>
          Repeat: I strongly suspect child trafficking. If it has to be
          kept secret, there is something evil going on. If they won't
          let him in, even after he announced he was going to arrive,
          SOMETHING IS SERIOIUSLY WRONG<br>
          There is a video of him walking up to this detention center
          HERE (this is the entire video of the incident.)It is
          complete, the senator is very thorough, and explains it all
          very well as he does this. <br>

              breast cancer</b><br>
            <b>By James Gallagher</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          The life of a woman with terminal breast cancer has been saved
          by a pioneering new therapy, say US researchers.<br>
          <br>
          It involved pumping 90 billion cancer-killing immune cells
          into her body.<br>
          <br>
          Judy Perkins had been given three months to live, but two
          years later there is no sign of cancer in her body.<br>
          <br>
          The team at the US National Cancer Institute says the therapy
          is still experimental, but could transform the treatment of
          all cancer.<br>
          <br>
          Judy - who lives in Florida - had spreading, advanced breast
          cancer that could not be treated with conventional therapy.<br>
          <br>
          She had tennis ball-sized tumours in her liver and secondary
          cancers throughout her body.<br>
          <br>
          She told the BBC: "About a week after [the therapy] I started
          to feel something, I had a tumour in my chest that I could
          feel shrinking.<br>
          <br>
          "It took another week or two for it to completely go away."<br>
          <br>
          She remembers her first scan after the procedure when the
          medical staff "were all very excited and jumping around".<br>
          <br>
          It was then she was told that she was likely to be cured.<br>
          <br>
          Now she's filling her life with backpacking and sea kayaking
          and has just taken five weeks circumnavigating Florida.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Living therapy</b><b><br>
          </b><b> </b><br>
          The technology is a "living drug" made from a patient's own
          cells at one of the world's leading centres of cancer
          research.<br>
          <br>
          Dr Steven Rosenberg, chief of surgery at the National Cancer
          Institute, told the BBC: "We're talking about the most highly
          personalised treatment imaginable."<br>
          <br>
          It remains experimental and still requires considerably more
          testing before it can be used more widely, but this is how it
          works: it starts by getting to know the enemy.<br>
          <br>
          A patient's tumour is genetically analysed to identify the
          rare changes that might make the cancer visible to the immune
          system.<br>
          <br>
          Out of the 62 genetic abnormalities in this patient, only four
          were potential lines of attack.<br>
          <br>
          Next researchers go hunting. A patient's immune system will
          already be attacking the tumour, it's just losing the fight
          between white blood cells and cancer.<br>
          <br>
          The scientists screen the patient's white blood cells and
          extract those capable of attacking the cancer.<br>
          <br>
          These are then grown in huge quantities in the laboratory.<br>
          <br>
          Around 90 billion were injected back into the 49-year-old
          patient, alongside drugs to take the brakes off the immune
          system.<br>
          <br>
          <b>'Paradigm shift'</b><br>
          <br>
          These are the results from a single patient and much larger
          trials will be needed to confirm the findings.<br>
          <br>
          The challenge so far in cancer immunotherapy is it tends to
          work spectacularly for some patients, but the majority do not
          benefit.<br>
          <br>
          Dr Rosenberg added: "This is highly experimental and we're
          just learning how to do this, but potentially it is applicable
          to any cancer.<br>
          <br>
          "At lot of works needs to be done, but the potential exists
          for a paradigm shift in cancer therapy - a unique drug for
          every cancer patient - it is very different to any other kind
          of treatment."<br>
          <br>
          The details were published in journal Nature Medicine.<br>
          <br>
          Commenting on the findings, Dr Simon Vincent, director of
          research at Breast Cancer Now, said the research was "world
          class".<br>
          <br>
          He told the BBC: "We think this is a remarkable result.<br>
          <br>
          "It's the first opportunity to see this sort of immunotherapy
          in the most common sort of breast cancer at the moment it has
          only been tested in one patient,<br>
          <br>
          "There's a huge amount of work that needs to be done, but
          potentially it could open up a whole new area of therapy for a
          large number of people."<br>

              leading to complete durable regression in metastatic
              breast cancer</b><br>
            <b>N. Zacharakis, et al.</b><br>

          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          Immunotherapy using either checkpoint blockade or the adoptive
          transfer of antitumor lymphocytes has shown effectiveness in
          treating cancers with high levels of somatic mutations—such as
          melanoma, smoking-induced lung cancers and bladder cancer—with
          little effect in other common epithelial cancers that have
          lower mutation rates, such as those arising in the
          gastrointestinal tract, breast and ovary1,2,3,4,5,6,7.
          Adoptive transfer of autologous lymphocytes that specifically
          target proteins encoded by somatically mutated genes has
          mediated substantial objective clinical regressions in
          patients with metastatic bile duct, colon and cervical
          cancers8,9,10,11. We present a patient with chemorefractory
          hormone receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer who
          was treated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)
          reactive against mutant versions of four proteins—SLC3A2,
          KIAA0368, CADPS2 and CTSB. Adoptive transfer of these
          mutant-protein-specific TILs in conjunction with interleukin
          (IL)-2 and checkpoint blockade mediated the complete durable
          regression of metastatic breast cancer, which is now ongoing
          for &gt;22 months, and it represents a new immunotherapy
          approach for the treatment of these patients.<br>

      Some years ago an informant said the National Soft Drink Assn (now
      American Beverage) did a ten year study showing Alzheimers, birth
      defects and blindness.<br>
      <br>
      In talking to someone at NSDA I was told, "You couldn't possibly
      have those studies". Also employees at Monsanto, when they owned
      it, told me they were told NOT to use it and they warned their
      friends about Alzheimers. I still maintain all the informant's

        The Link Between Aspartame And Alzheimer's<br>
      </b><br>
      In the name of weight loss, fat loss, and sugar-free diets, the
      world has been trending towards low- or no-calorie artificial
      sweeteners like Aspartame. If you're health conscious, you've
      probably been warned not to jump on the Aspartame/Splenda train,
      as these no-calorie sugar substitutes have been linked to brain
      damage, headaches, migraines, increased hunger, weight gain,
      seizures, and cancer. In fact, Aspartame is the number one cause
      of side effect complaints to the FDA­10,000 complaints and 91
      documented symptoms! Even as studies continue to tighten the link
      between Aspartame and Alzheimer's, the FDA has yet to remove its
      stamp of approval.<br>
      <b><br>
        Alzheimer's and Methanol Toxicity<br>
        <br>
      </b>Methanol toxicity seems to be the driving mechanism behind the
      link between Aspartame and Alzheimer's. Here's how it works:<br>
      <br>
      Aspartame is manufactured as a mixture of aspartic acid and
      synthetically modified phenylalanine, which contains a methyl
      group. The phenylalanine sweetens the aspartame up, making it a
      viable sugar substitute. The problem with this phenylalanine
      methyl bond (called a methyl ester) is that it is extremely
      fragile and easily detaches and becomes methanol, which scours our
      cells and tissues.<br>
      <br>
      But what's wrong with methanol? Nothing, when it comes as part of
      a whole food like a fruit or vegetable. In this case, methanol
      binds with pectin and is safely eliminated through your digestive
      tract. But…when it's not binded to something (as is the case with
      Aspartame)…it becomes a poison in your body.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b>Your cells convert methanol from Aspartame into formaldehyde.
      Every other mammal except humans is able to convert this toxic
      formaldehyde into harmless formic acid. Humans, however, cannot,
      and the formaldehyde stays in toxic form and presents as methanol
      toxicity in the body. Formaldehyde is a known carcinogen that
      damages the retina and DNA, and may cause birth defects.<br>
      <br>
      The symptoms of methanol toxicity include: Ringing in the ears...
      Headaches... Nausea... Headaches... Digestive upset... Vertigo...
      Chills... Mental disturbances... Vision problems... Weakness...
      Neuritis... Shooting pains in the limbs<b><br>
        <br>
        The Invalidity of Animal Studies<br>
        <br>
      </b>The studies that assert the safety of Aspartame have tested
      the effects of the artificial sweetener on animals, not
      humans­which renders the validity of these tests null and void, as
      humans don't have the biological mechanism to break down
      Aspartame's dangerous components like animals do. Case in point, a
      recent study on rhesus monkeys demonstrated that methanol toxicity
      was much more likely to occur than what was previously
      demonstrated by a similar study on mice. Mice fed methanol

      The Trocho study proved once and for all&nbsp; the formaldehyde
      converted from the&nbsp; methyl alcohol&nbsp; in aspartame embalms
      living tissue and damages DNA.
      http://www.mpwhi.com/aspartame_and_preembalming.htm After reading
      this study it appears&nbsp; rather than aspartame being hydrolyzed
      in the intestines it is released in the cells.&nbsp; Anyone
      repeating this study surely would come to the same conclusion. The
      study is so condemnatory against this chemical poison the
      aspartame industry attempted to assassinate the character of Dr.
      M. Alemany who did it.&nbsp; Read&nbsp; his letter about it:&nbsp;
      <a href="http://www.mpwhi.com/hhc-malemany.pdf" "><b>http://www.mpwhi.com/hhc-malemany.pdf</b></a>
      This was sent to the President of the&nbsp; House Committee on
      Health&nbsp; when there was an attempt to ban aspartame in
      Hawaii..&nbsp; Note he says he is sorry the health of so many
      people depends on a product that is harmful and should never have
      been approved for human consumption. In reality the FDA never
      intended for it to be marketed after they set up a task force and
      realized how harmful it was. First they tried to indict the
      manufacturer for fraud and then a Board of Inquiry revoked the
      petition for approval. For further information on how it got on
      the market through the political chicanery of Don Rumsfeld see the
      documentary "Sweet Misery: A Poisoned World" [ <a

      ] You will see and hear the aspartame experts discuss the
      toxicity, and the victims telling their heart wrenching stories.<br>
      <br>
      Aspartame has a methyl ester that immediately becomes free methyl
      alcohol and converts to formaldehyde. In Dr. Woodrow Monte's book,
      "While Science Sleeps:&nbsp; A Sweetener Kills", he discusses how
      the formaldehyde turns the tissues to plastic.&nbsp; <a
        href="http://www.whilesciencesleeps.com" "><b>http://www.whilesciencesleeps.com</b></a>
      Aspartame has continually produced cases of methanol
      poisoning.&nbsp; Here is one of the deaths of an aspartame victim
      from methanol poisoning:&nbsp; <a
        href="http://www.rense.com/general74/deatjb.htm" "><b>http://www.rense.com/general74/deatjb.htm</b></a>
      Dr. Monte also wrote the peer reviewed journal article,
      "Aspartame: Methanol and the Public Health" -
      http://www.mpwhi.com/aspartame_methanol_and_public_health.pdf He
      also explains why victims are going blind from aspartame and took
      the issues of blindness and seizures all the way to the Supreme
      Court.&nbsp; Only aspartame industry power kept it from being
      heard by the court. <br>
      <br>
      Dr. Monte continually compares aspartame and smoking.&nbsp; Which
      is the worst defilement of the body? Here is an example under the
      Toxicological Evidence: "The circulatory system is a known target
      of methanol poisoning, with short term exposure causing thickening
      of the intima of the artery walls as seen in arteriosclerosis.
      There are few sources of dietary or environmental methanol
      poisoning. Cigarette smoking is the most reliable and is
      universally considered the major cause of coronary heart disease,
      stroke and the other atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.
      Aspartame is another known source of methanol whose daily
      consumption has recently been linked to a fifty percent increase
      in death from heart disease and stroke."<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Monte's book explains how the methanol in aspartame
      precipitates Alzheimer's Disease. Under the molecular evidence he
      says: "In the absence of ethanol, dietary methanol easily
      penetrates the blood brain barrier and passes into the intima and
      media of the veins and arteries of the brain, where it is
      transformed by ADH into formaldehyde.&nbsp; Formaldehyde diffuses
      into nearby nerve cell axons and penetrates until it locates tau
      protein, which is modified and polymerized to produce plaque. Once
      the plague breaks through the cell membrane and myelin layers of
      the axon it is exposed to the brain's macrophages, which become
      activated, leading to the inflammation of Alzheimer's."<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Monte said: "How can formaldehyde produce such large plague
      configurations that they break through cell membranes and myelin
      sheaths surrounding the axon? Under suitable conditions the
      molecules of many compounds can be linked together into giant
      molecules by methylene bridges when subject to the action of
      formaldehyde."<br>
      <br>
      Under toxicological evidence Monte says "The brain is the target
      organ of methanol poisoning, and methanol's infliction of damage
      on the brain is the direct cause of all methanol
      mortalities.&nbsp; Amnesia and memory loss is a common symptom of
      methanol activity."<br>
      <br>
      Aspartame memory loss is so rampant it is number 9 on the FDA list
      of 92 symptoms including death:&nbsp;
      http://www.mpwhi.com/92_aspartame_symptoms.pdf Dr. H. J. Roberts
      who wrote the medical text, "Aspartame Disease: An Ignored
      Epidemic", 1000 pages of symptoms and diseases triggered or
      precipitated by aspartame, told me he spoke to someone in Air
      Traffic Control drinking a Diet Coke who couldn't remember his
      name or where he was.&nbsp; After Pilot Cliff Evans crashed his
      plane on aspartame we set up Mission Possible Aviation:&nbsp;
      http://www.mpwhi.com/pilot_aspartame_alert_with_letters.htm<br>
      <br>
      So many informants have told me&nbsp; the manufacturers know
      aspartame precipitates Alzheimer's I finally wrote an article
      about them:&nbsp; <a
        href="http://www.rense.com/general96/asparalz.html"
        "><b>http://www.rense.com/general96/asparalz.html</b></a><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Monte too wrote: "Formaldehyde as a Trigger for Protein
      Aggregation and Potential Target for Mitigation of Age-Related,
      Progressive Cognitive Impairment"&amp;nb
      http://www.mpwhi.com/formaldehyde_as_a_trigger.pdf<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;Monte sums it up in his book:&nbsp; "Something very wrong is
      going on, something that is killing good people and causing untold
      suffering to families and communities around the world.&nbsp;
      Never has such a high percentage of the population been afflicted
      with so many tragic and wasting illnesses.&nbsp; In the past
      thirty years, a group of diseases has reached epidemic proportions
      in the United States and many other countries. These diseases
      include multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, breast cancer,
      lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, melanoma, and autism, a
      once rare birth defect. Mankind endures a plague whose point of
      origin distinctly coincides with the Food and Drug Administrations
      1981 approval of aspartame an artificial sweetener containing
      methanol, which is metabolized into deadly formaldehyde within the
      brain and sinew of all who consume it."<br>
      <br>
      Because aspartame was never proven safe by science and indeed the
      manufacturers own studies proved it to be dangerous , the biggest
      study on aspartame was thrust upon the unsuspecting public.&nbsp;
      Monte calls this study on the public a toxicologist's dream.
      Welcome to the International Association of lab rats and guinea
      pigs! Today it's called Rumsfeld's plague for the man who talked
      President Ronald Reagan into writing an executive order forbidding
      the FDA to sign the revoked petition for approval of aspartame
      into law.&nbsp; He even had the transition team call at 3:00 AM
      the FDA Commissioner Dr. Jerri Goyan and fire him so he could
      appoint one of Rumsfeld's buddies as FDA Commissioner and
      over-rule the Board of Inquiry.&nbsp; This is how Reagan became an
      aspartame victim. <br>
      <br>
      Monte wrote: "I remember clearly the sympathy I felt while reading
      Ronald Reagan's heart wrenching letter revealing his Alzheimers
      disease diagnosis.&nbsp; It began with "I have recently been told
      that I'm one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted
      with Alzheimer's disease."&nbsp; I was saddened by the thought of
      countless souls witnessing their brains being turned off, not
      knowing what treasured memory, what loved one, they would forget
      next.&nbsp; Reagan was a man with a legendary memory that was
      considered by some to be photographic during his years as an
      actor.&nbsp; In contrast, as his presidency progressed, stories of
      forgetting the names of officials, cabinet members and important
      press persons became legion."<br>
      <br>
      With Reagan's help aspartame was marketed and it quickly became
      the major source of methanol in the human diet.&nbsp; Dr. Monte
      continued, "Ironically, all through his years in office Reagan was
      known to carry on his person little blue packets of aspartame
      sweetener.&nbsp; They were as visible to his presidency as the
      little jelly beans that he insisted be made available at every
      cabinet meeting. He, like do many others, developed a taste for
      Rumsfeld's aspartame and always made sure he had it close and
      available.&nbsp; It wasn't until the end of his presidency that a
      reporter allegedly asked Reagan whatever happened to his little
      blue packets, to which he is said to have replied, "Well, you just
      never know what might be in those sweeteners."<br>
      <br>
      So now we have an epidemiological study performed on the
      inhabitants of the US (and the world for that matter).&nbsp; The
      results could have been predicted from the history and original
      studies.&nbsp; On the back of Dr. Monte's book he gives the
      results of this continuing study.&nbsp; "The introduction of
      aspartame into the food supply of the United States began in the
      summer of 1981.&nbsp; Since that time, the incidence of
      Alzheimer's deaths has increased 10,000%.&nbsp; Autism has, with
      no explanation increased 2500%.&nbsp; Autoimmune diseases have
      reached epidemic proportions, with Lupus (SLE) up 300% and
      Multiple Sclerosis, Type !! Diabetes and Rheumatoid Arthritis
      headed out of control.&nbsp; Cancers, the hallmark of formaldehyde
      exposure, have exploded.&nbsp; Skin cancer has shot up over 400%,
      liver cancer has tripled, kidney cancer has doubled, and breast
      cancer is up 50%.&nbsp; The list goes on ....<br>
      <br>
      "This book explains to the average person the fascinating process
      by which methanol, a poison hidden in aspartame and some other
      foods, is converted to formaldehyde at the very locations in the
      human body where these diseases originate, revealing, for the
      first time, the exact details of the probable cause of each.&nbsp;
      It is a cautionary tale of the legacy of the danger of&nbsp; a
      poisonous food additive and the failure of a government, corrupted
      by greed, to safeguard the health and welfare of its people."<br>
      <br>
      I have taken the case histories of the sick and dying victims of
      aspartame for 28 years.&nbsp; I have felt the anguish of victims
      who have in many cases lost their jobs, their families and their
      health.&nbsp; All activists trying to save the public from this
      chemical poison have had to put up with cowards at the FDA who
      should have banned it years ago, and the manufacturers who release
      propaganda, have their own front research group to fund
      universities, ILSI, and use trade organizations they fund to
      defend them. <br>
      <br>
      As Dr. Monte has brought out continually, ethanol is the antidote
      for methanol poisoning.&nbsp; The manufacturers always say there
      is more methanol in oranges than in aspartame, but there is no
      ethanol in aspartame.&nbsp; Further methanol binds to pectin and
      takes it safely out of your body.&nbsp; An example of what we put
      up with is information rebutting their propaganda on methanol by
      Mark Gold, founder of the Aspartame Toxicity Information
      Center:&nbsp; http://www.rense.com/health3/badnews.htm <br>
      <br>
      Dr. Morando Soffritti of the Ramazzini Institute did three studies
      proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that aspartame is a
      multipotential carcinogen.&nbsp; He said there was so much
      formaldehyde that it turned the rats hair to yellow.&nbsp; Today
      the body is being defiled with formaldehyde.&nbsp; On page 675 of
      "Aspartame Disease: An Ignored Epidemic", Dr. H. J. Roberts
      discusses pre-embalming of persons who had been heavy aspartame
      consumers.&nbsp; He said, "One experienced undertaker literally
      warned his family against using diet sodas after repeatedly
      detecting the deposition of formaldehyde crystals deposited in the
      organs of such individuals.&nbsp; Some funeral directors even
      insisted on closing the caskets of persons who had consumed large
      amounts of aspartame because formaldehyde seeped through the
      skin."<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Aspartame is in at least 14,000 foods and is being added to
      drugs both brand and generic by the thousands, interacting with
      both drugs and vaccines.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a killing machine and
      for years physicians, toxicologists and researchers have asked for
      it to be banned, as well as myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It violates
      the Delaney Amendment because it causes cancer, violates
      adulteration laws and interstate commerce. <br>
      <br>
      Years ago Dr. James Bowen told the FDA: " Every known metabolite
      of aspartame is of marked or questionable toxicity and patently
      unsafe for human use. Methyl alcohol is metabolized to nascent
      formaldehyde in the eye, nervous system and other metabolically
      active organs. It immediately attacks and denatures the tissue
      structure proteins in which is metabolized to nascent
      formaldehyde. This stimulates specific organ and subcellular
      autoimmunity which seems to be a preponderant source of the bad
      experiences reported by NutraSweet victims. Aspartic Acid is a
      neuroexcitotoxic present in damaging amounts, it own right, at the
      ADI for aspartame. Simple logic tells one that it will vastly
      increase the metabolism of methyl alcohol to formaldehyde attach
      there. This corresponds well with the symptomalogies often
      experienced, such as Lou Gehrig's Disease (ALS), bulbar palsies,
      neurohormonal disorders, diketopiperazine issue remains totally
      unresolved and dangerous. The amino acids that are released by
      hydrolysis, form eimers and isomers that are either not
      sufficiently studied, or which are known substrates in undesirable
      pathological states such as Alzheimer's disease."<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Bowen gives only one solution and says:&nbsp;&nbsp; .."the
      only responsible action would be to immediately take aspartame off
      the market, fully disclose its toxicities, offer full compensation
      to the injured, public and criminally prosecute anyone who
      participated in the fraudulent placement of aspartame on the
      marketplace. That includes those who work so diligently to keep in
      on the market as well."<br>
      <br>
      In meeting a pathologist, Reginall Bundrage,&nbsp; who had been
      working for the EPA on aspartame, not the FDA, he was quick to
      explain that aspartame should not be on the market because of its
      poisonous nature.&nbsp; He told me he spoke to his superiors on
      the subject in the early 1990's, and asked: "How could a product
      that is killing thousands of people remain on the market?" He was
      told," the FDA will have to remove it".&nbsp; He was speaking to
      me and my husband in 2010,<br>
      <br>
      About six years ago I met in New York the Chairman of the Board of
      the American Anti-Cancer Institute.&nbsp; I'm on the advisory
      board myself.&nbsp; In a discussion of aspartame she told me she
      had been told by a funeral director that they had cut down the use
      of formaldehyde in embalming by at least 25% because of the
      presence of so much formaldehyde in the bodies. <br>
      <br>
      I close with the words of Patrick Henry: "Let us not, I beseech
      you , sir, deceive ourselves longer."&nbsp; Humans are being
      pre-embalmed with formaldehyde converted from the methanol in
      aspartame defiling the body.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

      Frequencies. This technology is unique in that there is no
      mechanical connection between the linear oscillation and the
      rotation (frictionless). One oscillation cycle equals 360 degreees
      of rotation. This is not a free energy device. The motor is an
      example how the Kundel Magnetic Coupling Device can turn a Voice
      Coil Motor runnig at 3,250 oscillations per min. into 3,250 RPM's.

          Large GMO Corn Field</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Millions of bees dropped dead after GMO corn was planted few
      weeks ago in Ontario, Canada. The local bee keeper, Dave Schuit
      who produces honey in Elmwood lost about 37 million bees which are
      about 600 hives.<br>
      <br>
      “Once the corn started to get planted our bees died by the
      millions,” Schuit said. While many bee keepers blame
      neonicotinoids, or “neonics.” for colony collapse of bees and many
      countries in EU have banned neonicotinoid class of pesticides, the
      US Department of Agriculture fails to ban insecticides known as
      neonicotinoids, manufactured by Bayer CropScience Inc.<br>
      <br>
      Two of Bayer’s best-selling pesticides, Imidacloprid and
      Clothianidin, are known to get into pollen and nectar, and can
      damage beneficial insects such as bees. The marketing of these
      drugs also coincided with the occurrence of large-scale bee deaths
      in many European countries and the United States....<b><br>

        </a><br>
      </b>Ebola first emerged from what is now the Democratic Republic
      of Congo (DRC) (then Zaire) in 1976. It’s named after the Ebola
      River, which is where the outbreak began. At the time, 284 people
      died. Several more small outbreaks occurred in Africa over the
      '80s and '90s, garnering the attention of the medical community.
      Although scientists have been studying the disease for decades,
      its natural reservoir has never been found—meaning the animal from
      which it originates. The stakes weren’t that high, until 2014.<br>
      <br>
      The world was gripped by the West African Ebola crisis at that
      time (2014-2016). It quickly spread over several West African
      countries, including Sierra Leone, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, and
      Senegal. Over 28,000 were infected and 11,000 died. Soon, cases
      were reported further afield, including a handful in Spain, Italy,
      the U.K., and the U.S.<br>
      <br>
      Note that such outbreaks haven’t ceased; on May 8 of this year,
      the DRC announced yet another. So far, 51 Ebola cases have been
      reported and 25 people have died. This is the ninth such outbreak
      in the country’s history. Ebola is spread through contact with
      infected bodily fluids. Endemic poverty and government corruption
      often force people in these countries to acquire bush meat to
      supplement their diet. Sometimes the animal they’ve captured is
      infected. Burial practices in this part of Africa too, where the
      body is carefully prepared for funeral by relatives, often causes
      the virus to spread.<br>
      <br>
      The latest outbreak occurred in a rural area and was contained
      quickly. Even so, Bill Gates and others warn that a worldwide
      pandemic of Ebola or a similar disease could kill 30 million in as
      little as six months. Despite this, the U.S. and other countries
      are woefully unprepared. As a result, medical researchers have
      been scrambling to find ways to predict the timing and location of
      outbreaks so that they can be contained. Now, a group of
      researchers think they’ve found a reliable method, developed
      through following the migratory patterns of bats.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#660000"><font color="#000000">Now, in a study
          published in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers at
          Lehigh University in Pennsylvania have developed a framework
          for such a model.<br>
          <br>
          Associate professor of bioengineering Javier Buceta
          co-authored the study. He worked alongside Paolo Bocchini, an
          associate professor of civil and environmental engineering,
          and postdoctoral researcher Graziano Fiorillo. Buceta told
          Live Science, "Traditionally, scientists studying the [spread]
          of diseases like Ebola have operated under the assumption that
          the disease moves uniformly. In reality, diseases that are
          spread by animal hosts depend on how those hosts migrate.” <br>

      <br>
      A revolutionary, cutting-edge technology, developed by researchers
      at Bar-Ilan University's Institute of Nanotechnology and Advanced
      Materials (BINA), has the potential to provide a new alternative
      to eyeglasses, contact lenses, and laser correction for refractive
      errors.<br>
      <br>
      The technology, known as Nano-Drops, was developed by
      opthamologist Dr. David Smadja from Shaare Zedek Medical Center,
      Prof. Zeev Zalevsky from Bar-Ilan's Kofkin Faculty of Engineering,
      and Prof. Jean-Paul Moshe Lellouche, head of the Department of
      Chemistry at Bar-Ilan.<br>
      <br>
      Nano-Drops achieve their optical effect and correction by locally
      modifying the corneal refractive index. The magnitude and nature
      of the optical correction is adjusted by an optical pattern that
      is stamped onto the superficial layer of the corneal epithelium
      with a laser source. The shape of the optical pattern can be
      adjusted for correction of myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia
      (farsightedness) or presbyopia (loss of accommodation ability).
      The laser stamping takes a few milliseconds and enables the
      nanoparticles to enhance and 'activate' this optical pattern by
      locally changing the refractive index and ultimately modifying the
      trajectory of light passing through the cornea.<br>

      <b> </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There are new types of composite fuels, such as coal-water slurry
      fuel and artificial composite liquid fuel that can be used to
      exploit the limited energy sources more effectively. Such
      composite fuels consist of coal fine particles and water (or
      liquid industrial waste). This paper presents the experimental
      study of the ignition of coal-water slurry fuel and artificial
      composite liquid fuel droplets during convective heating carried
      out at the National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University. The
      ignition delay time of the fuels has been determined when the heat
      source temperature varied from 350 to 600 °C. The analysis
      reported here has revealed droplet ignition mechanisms for four
      different fuel compositions.<br>

      OVER THE YEARS, THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF ADVANCED COAL
      COMBUSTION TECHNOLOGIES WHICH HAVE ATTEMPTED TO UTILIZE COAL-WATER
      SLURRY (CWS) AS FUEL. TYPICALLY, THE GOALS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF CWS
      FUEL TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN AIMED AT UTILIZATION OF RECOVERED FINE
      COAL, REPLACEMENT OF NATURAL GAS OR PETROLEUM, OR ELIMINATION OF
      THE HANDLING AND DEWATERING PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHLY
      BENEFICATED FINE COAL. A DRAWBACK TO THE UTILIZATION OFCWS AS A
      FUEL, FOR MANY OF THE PROGRAMS, HAS BEEN THE LACK OF A SOURCE OF
      RELIABLE, HIGH-QUALITY COAL-WATER FUEL. THE MANUFACTURE OF
      CONSISTENT, STABLE COAL-WATER SLURRIES IS PROBLEMATICOWING TO THE
      NATURALLY BROAD RANGE OF COAL PROPERTIES AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE
      BEHAVIOR OFSOLID-LIQUID MIXTURES. IF THE CWS PRODUCER KNOWS THE
      EFFECT OF CHANGING PROCESS CONDITIONS ON THE SLURRY PRODUCT,
      ADJUSTMENTS IN PLANT OPERATING CONDITIONS CAN BE MADE AND THE
      PRODUCT QUALITY CAN BE MAINTAINED. IN THIS PHASE I PROJECT,
      INVENTIVE PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY WILL BE DEVELOPED AND COUPLED WITH
      SOUND ENGINEERING EXPERIMENTATION TO ACHIEVE NEAR PERFECT CONTROL
      OVER COAL SLURRYPRODUCT QUALITY PARAMETERS. IN PHASE II, THE FULLY
      AUTOMATED CWS PRODUCTION PROCESS WILL BE DEMONSTRATED AT A ONE-TON
      PER HOUR CWS PRODUCTION FACILITY. WHEN COMPLETED, THE PLANT WILL
      BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING CONSISTENT AND RELIABLE CWS FROM ANY

      rotor are opposed to each other in a vacuum container. In the
      stator, first electrodes and second electrodes, which are attached
      to electrode supports, and which are electrically insulated from
      each other by an insulator, are arranged alternately in the
      circumferential direction. In the rotor, first electrodes and
      second electrodes, which are attached to electrode supports, and
      which are electrically insulated from each other by an insulator,
      are arranged alternately in the circumferential direction. The
      first electrodes and the second electrodes on the side of the
      stator are arranged at a spacing of two or more rows at a
      predetermined distance from the center of a rotating shaft. The
      first electrodes and the second electrodes on the side of the
      rotor are arranged at a predetermined distance from the center of
      the rotating shaft and at an intermediate position between the
      rows of the first electrodes and the second electrodes on the side
      of the stator. As a result, the electrostatic motor can establish
      a high electric field in the vacuum so that it can rotationally
      drive with a sufficient driving force.<br>

          long-term, low-calorie diet slows cell ageing</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The scientists found out that the longer an animal follows this
      diet, the more pronounced the slowing down of the ageing changes
      are<br>
      <br>
      A longstanding, low-calorie diet prevents the formation of changes
      in the genes responsible for the body’s ageing, researchers from
      the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech) and
      Harvard Medical School (Boston, USA) ascertained. This news has
      been reported by Skoltech’s press office.<br>
      <br>
      "We can see that a low-calorie diet has an accumulative effect,
      and the longer an animal follows this diet, the more pronounced
      the slowing down of the ageing changes are. Yet, a short-term
      impact causes some changes typical for the ageing process.
      However, they disappear quite fast during the course of further
      dieting," said Alexander Tyshkovsky study co-author, and PhD
      student at Skoltech.<br>
      <br>
      When a body starts aging, many molecular changes take place
      including epigenetic transformations, that is, modifications of
      DNA and proteins that do not affect the sequence of the genetic
      code but have a significant impact on the functioning of the
      genes. One such process is DNA methylation, which "hangs"
      additional methyl-groups on a DNA.<br>
      <br>
      The scientists from Skoltech and Harvard studied the methylation
      dynamics in the blood of mice during ageing in 16 age groups. It
      turned out that the changes appear mostly in advanced age. The
      results of the study were published in the Aging Cell journal.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the researchers pinpointed the particular cell
      mechanisms, which are affected by the changes and found out that
      many of them are already known to play an important role in the
      ageing process and are targeted by drugs that can extend the life
      of an animal.<br>
      <br>
      Then, the scientists tracked how a low-calorie diet influences
      these processes. It was proven that for mice with long-term
      calorie restrictions, the ageing changes decelerated while the
      short-term reduction in daily intake not only demonstrated no
      effect on ageing changes, but also accelerated them.<br>

        <b>Vitor C. M. Neves, Rebecca Babb, Dhivya Chandrasekaran &amp;
          Paul T. Sharpe</b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The restoration of dentine lost in deep caries lesions in teeth is
      a routine and common treatment that involves the use of inorganic
      cements based on calcium or silicon-based mineral aggregates. Such
      cements remain in the tooth and fail to degrade and thus normal
      mineral volume is never completely restored. Here we describe a
      novel, biological approach to dentine restoration that stimulates
      the natural formation of reparative dentine via the mobilisation
      of resident stem cells in the tooth pulp. Biodegradable,
      clinically-approved collagen sponges are used to deliver low doses
      of small molecule glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3) antagonists
      that promote the natural processes of reparative dentine formation
      to completely restore dentine. Since the carrier sponge is
      degraded over time, dentine replaces the degraded sponge leading
      to a complete, effective natural repair. This simple, rapid
      natural tooth repair process could thus potentially provide a new
      approach to clinical tooth restoration.<br>

          controlled study of efficacy and tolerability of Withaina
          somnifera extracts in knee joint pain</b><b><br>
        </b><b>G.S.H.Ramakanth, et al.</b><b><br>
        </b></div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Highlights</b><br>
      Aqueous extract of Withania somnifera roots plus leaves
      demonstrated dose – dependent therapeutic response.<br>
      Onset of therapeutic activity is seen as early as 4 weeks with the
      W. somnifera 250 mg group.<br>
      Aqueous extract of W. somnifera roots plus leaves has good safety
      profile and is well tolerated.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Background</b><br>
      Root extracts of Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) are known to
      possess analgesic, anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective
      effects. An aqueous extract of roots plus leaves of this plant has
      shown to yield higher percentages of withanolide glycosides and,
      accordingly, may possess better analgesic, anti-inflammatory and
      chondroprotective effects than root alone extracts.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusions</b><br>
      Treatment with W. somnifera 250 mg and W. somnifera 125 mg, both
      taken twice daily in patients with knee joint pain and discomfort
      for a period of 12 weeks showed significant reduction in the
      outcome variables of efficacy and safety, when compared to
      baseline and placebo. On further analysis, W. somnifera 250 mg
      produced better reduction in outcomes when statistically compared
      to W. somnifera 125 mg. Also, this effect was seen earlier (in 4
      weeks) in W. somnifera 250 mg group than in W. somnifera 125 mg
      group. The need for rescue medication (Paracetamol 650 mg tablets)
      was the least with W. somnifera 250 mg group suggesting its
      analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. All the study medications
      were well tolerated and mild gastrointestinal adverse effects like
      nausea and gastritis were observed in few patients. None of the
      patients discontinued the study suggesting the favorable safety
      profile of W. somnifera. Further studies with W. somnifera, hence,
      are needed to confirm its therapeutic potential in patients with
      knee joint pain and discomfort and other painful rheumatologic
      conditions.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      Propellantless propulsion is believed to be the best option for
      interstellar travel. However, photon rockets or solar sails have
      thrusts so low that maybe only nano-scaled spacecraft may reach
      the next star within our lifetime using very high-power laser
      beams. Following into the footsteps of earlier breakthrough
      propulsion programs, we are investigating different concepts based
      on non-classical/revolutionary propulsion ideas that claim to be
      at least an order of magnitude more efficient in producing thrust
      compared to photon rockets. Our intention is to develop an
      excellent research infrastructure to test new ideas and measure
      thrusts and/or artefacts with high confidence to determine if a
      concept works and if it does how to scale it up. At present, we
      are focusing on two possible revolutionary concepts: The EMDrive
      and the Mach-Effect Thruster. The first concept uses microwaves in
      a truncated cone-shaped cavity that is claimed to produce thrust.
      Although it is not clear on which theoretical basis this can work,
      several experimental tests have been reported in the literature,
      which warrants a closer examination. The second concept is
      believed to generate mass fluctuations in a piezo-crystal stack
      that creates non-zero time-averaged thrusts. Here we are reporting
      first results of our improved thrust balance as well as EMDrive
      and Mach-Effect thruster models. Special attention is given to the
      investigation and identification of error sources that cause false
      thrust signals. Our results show that the magnetic interaction
      from not sufficiently shielded cables or thrusters are a major
      factor that needs to be taken into account for proper µN thrust
      measurements for these type of devices.<br>

      In the previous episode, physicist Eugene Bagashov introduced us
      to potentially groundbreaking scientific research into the
      influence of electrical charge on the properties and behaviors of
      water. The recently published paper states that the electric
      charge of water influences: its ultraviolet absorption spectrum;
      its mechanical behavior; the behavior of water solutions; its
      surface tension; its interaction with polymers; and its freezing
      temperature. Today, Eugene offers an extensive thought-provoking
      analysis on the possible vast implications for this research in
      our Electric Universe.<br>

        <b>Yuri Pivovarenko</b><br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      It was shown previously that the shape of the crystals formed
      during the evaporation of salt solutions depends on the sign of
      the electric potential of such solutions. It has been particularly
      found that the evaporation of salt solutions with positive
      electric potential is accompanied by the formation of cubic
      crystals and the evaporation of salt solutions with negative
      electric potential is accompanied by the formation of needle-like
      crystals. The obtained results stimulated further studies of the
      properties of water and aqueous solutions, which depend on the
      electric potential. During these studies it was found that the
      surface tension of the water clearly depends on its electrical
      potential: an increase in the positive electric potential of water
      is accompanied by an increase in its surface tension and increase
      the negative electrical potential of the water is accompanied by a
      decrease of its surface tension. It was also discovered that the
      electrical potential of the water determines its ability to
      hydrate the polymers of biological origin. It is shown that water
      with a positive potential is better hydrates biological polymers
      than water with negative potential.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      The UV absorption spectra of water with different electric charge
      (potential) were obtained. It was shown that UV absorption spectra
      of water with negative electric charge (potential) have the sharp
      peaks with maximum in the range 190 – 200 nm and UV absorption
      spectra of water with positive electric charge (potential) have
      the wide peaks with maximum in the range 200 – 220 nm. It was
      asked to explain this absorption. It was also established that UV
      absorption spectra of water solutions of surface inactive
      substances have sharp peaks with a maximum in the range 190 – 200
      nm and UV absorption spectra of solutions of surface active
      substances have the wide peaks with a maximum in the range 200 –
      220 nm. The UV absorption spectra of DNA solutions, which were
      prepared on the water with different electric charge (potential),
      were obtained. It was shown that these spectra are dependent on
      the electric charge (potential) of water used. It was proposed
      that UV absorption spectra of aqueous DNA reflect mostly the
      spectral properties of charged water or charged cuvette.<br>

          albatross, cruise like a sailboat</b><br>
        <b>&nbsp;by Jennifer Chu</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      MIT engineers have designed a robotic glider that can skim along
      the water's surface, riding the wind like an albatross while also
      surfing the waves like a sailboat.<br>
      <br>
      In regions of high wind, the robot is designed to stay aloft, much
      like its avian counterpart. Where there are calmer winds, the
      robot can dip a keel into the water to ride like a highly
      efficient sailboat instead.<br>
      <br>
      The robotic system, which borrows from both nautical and
      biological designs, can cover a given distance using one-third as
      much wind as an albatross and traveling 10 times faster than a
      typical sailboat. The glider is also relatively lightweight,
      weighing about 6 pounds. The researchers hope that in the near
      future, such compact, speedy robotic water-skimmers may be
      deployed in teams to survey large swaths of the ocean....<br>

      Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate or NaHCO3) has a number of
      medicinal uses and benefits. It’s commonly known to have
      alkalinizing, antacid and electrolyte replacement properties ...
      Studies have shown drinking baking soda solution can help pregnant
      women who are having a slow or difficult labor to avoid C-sections
      in about 20 percent of cases by neutralizing acid in the womb ...
      Research funded by the National Institutes of Health suggests
      baking soda may be a safe and effective treatment for autoimmune
      diseases by priming your immune system against inflammation ...
      The data suggests drinking baking soda infused water activates an
      anti-inflammatory pathway that is mediated by the neuronal-like
      function of mesothelial cells that line your internal organs ...
      Baking soda is also useful against other aches and pains,
      including heartburn and ulcer pain, and may enhance sports
      performance (a strategy known as soda doping)...<br>

        <b>Fukushima Recap: </b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Hard facts that prove the earthquake was fabricated, and
      Fukushima was a Stuxnet/nuke attack. Facts unknown by people who
      have not read the Fukushima report, yet were fully certified by
      the World Nuclear Association.<br>
      <br>
      1. Fukushima never lost off site power, which made the "flooding
      of the generators" irrelevant. You read that right, Fukushima had
      power the entire time. However, there was an "anomaly" which
      caused the transfer switches (that were above the tsunami line) to
      cut external power into the facility. Long before there was any
      disaster at all this problem was found and the off site switch
      gear was replaced, but even the new switch gear, which was SCADA
      controlled, refused to engage and provide power to Fukushima. What
      would do that? the Stuxnet virus, under control from Dimona,
      that's what.<br>
      <br>
      2. Fukushima had 11 back up generators. Several of these were in
      the basement of the turbine building. The turbine building did get
      some water, but it was not enough to flood the generators there.
      Four of them which started automatically mysteriously switched off
      and could not be re-started, however a fifth one stayed running
      but could not be used because the Scada based switch gear that
      transfered it's power for facility use would not engage, so it sat
      there, running uselessly. It was sufficient to power emergency
      systems at all reactors by itself and if it could have been
      connected it would have prevented all disaster. But the "Dimona
      Dozen" said no.<br>
      <br>
      3. The roads into Fukushima were totally un-damaged, so very early
      on (within the first couple hours, when it was clear there was
      something seriously amiss with the transfer switches,) massive
      flat bed semi mounted "portable" generators were driven into the
      facility and hooked up. Alas, the Scada controlled switch gear was
      not allowed by some mysterious entity, to engage. And you can't
      "just hook it up" by hand, you need specialized switch gear to
      handle that much power or there will be an explosion when it is
      connected. So they were stuck.<br>
      <br>
      4. Fukushima had control power the entire time. Control power is
      what the computers and small non motorized devices run from (small
      devices, such as electric valves, relays, etc.) Control power
      alone was enough to save Fukushima from destruction, however, the
      engineers in the control room were not getting accurate readings,
      and all commands sent to valves were declined. If they had been
      able to open any of the pressure release valves, they could have
      saved the facility with high pressure pumper trucks (that could
      rapidly pump water into the reactors at the normal reactor
      operating pressure of 1050 PSI, but the valves, which should
      automatically open at 1058 PSI (and vent the reactors out the huge
      white "smokestacks") were electronically held shut, despite all
      attempts to cut power to them and force them to open. When the
      trucks arrived to try to get water into the reactors, they
      encountered pressures above 2700 PSI (despite the control rooms
      all saying the pressures were where they should be, at 1050 PSI)
      and 2700 PSO was the limit the trucks could pump to. This meant
      that not only were the pressure relase valves refusing to open,
      but the reactors were far far above maximum operating temperature
      (with temperature directly correlated with steam pressure) and the
      control room readouts were lying. That's exactly what Stuxnet
      does.<br>
      <br>
      After they discovered how high the pressures really were (because
      the pumper trucks gave accurate answers) they decided to send
      people in to cut the wires to the valves (which would then allow
      them to open automatically) but before the final decision was
      made, 3 of the reactors exploded.<br>
      <br>
      5. Reactor 4 was under maintenance and had it's core removed, yet
      it exploded anyway.<br>
      <br>
      6. All 4 reactor containments were pre-purged with nitrogen, which
      made hydrogen explosions impossible, and the official lie -
      "hydrogen explosions" could not have destroyed the containments
      because they were simply too robust. Additionally, the only way
      hydrogen could get out of any reactor was through the smokestacks,
      there was no way for it to get into the containments to begin
      with. Seismic readings at Fukushima proper were 6.02, and the
      facility was designed to withstand local seismic events of 8+. All
      reactors were shock absorber mounted, the whole 9 yards, there was
      no damage that made hydrogen explosions possible.<br>
      <br>
      7. YET HUGE EXPLOSIONS, NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS, HAPPENED AT REACTORS 3
      AND 4, AND REACTOR PRESSURE VESSEL EXPLOSIONS, AT 3000+ PSI
      HAPPENED AT REACTORS 1 AND 2. These were pressure vessel
      explosions (boiler pressure vessel explosions) - nuclear reactors
      are in effect giant boiler pressure vessels - explosions of such
      boilers are really nasty (nasty enough to ruin containments) but
      nuclear weapons are worse, and I HAVE PROOF THEY WERE USED, which
      is why containments 3 and 4 were destroyed so much worse than 1
      and 2.<br>
      <br>
      8. Here is the big bad naughty thing this site is hated most for -
      a picture of the nuclear weapon, fronted as a security camera,
      that was placed under reactor 3 by Israeli "security firm" Magna
      BSP. A different one went into reactor 4...<br>

        <b>Svante Pääbo</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      Artificial mummification was practised in Egypt from ~ 2600 BC
      until the fourth century AD. Because of the dry Egyptian climate,
      however, there are also many natural mummies preserved from
      earlier as well as later times. To elucidate whether this unique
      source of ancient human remains can be used for molecular genetic
      analyses, 23 mummies were investigated for DNA content. One
      2,400-yr-old mummy of a child was found to contain DNA that could

      Salk Institute scientists have found preliminary evidence that

      "Although other studies have offered evidence that cannabinoids

        <b>Antonio Currais, et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      The beta amyloid (Aß) and other aggregating proteins in the brain
      increase with age and are frequently found within neurons. The
      mechanistic relationship between intracellular amyloid, aging and
      neurodegeneration is not, however, well understood. We use a
      proteotoxicity model based upon the inducible expression of Aß in
      a human central nervous system nerve cell line to characterize a
      distinct form of nerve cell death caused by intracellular Aß. It
      is shown that intracellular Aß initiates a toxic inflammatory
      response leading to the cell's demise. Aß induces the expression
      of multiple proinflammatory genes and an increase in both
      arachidonic acid and eicosanoids, including prostaglandins that
      are neuroprotective and leukotrienes that potentiate death.
      Cannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinol stimulate the removal of
      intraneuronal Aß, block the inflammatory response, and are
      protective. Altogether these data show that there is a complex and
      likely autocatalytic inflammatory response within nerve cells
      caused by the accumulation of intracellular Aß, and that this
      early form of proteotoxicity can be blocked by the activation of
      cannabinoid receptors.<br>

          regulation of autonomic function during cold exposure</b><br>
        <b>OttoMuzika, Kaice T.Reilly, Vaibhav A.Diwadkar</b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      The defense of body temperature against environmental thermal
      challenges is a core objective of homeostatic regulation governed
      by the autonomic nervous system. Autonomous mechanisms of
      thermoregulation are only weakly affected by top-down modulation,
      allowing only transient tolerance for extreme cold. There is
      however, anecdotal evidence of a unique set of individuals known
      for extreme cold tolerance. Here we present a case study of a
      57-year old Dutch national, Wim Hof, the so-called “Iceman”, with
      the ability to withstand frequent prolonged periods of extreme
      cold exposure based on the practice of a self-developed technique
      involving a combination of forced breathing, cold exposure and
      meditation (collectively referred to as the Wim Hof Method,
      henceforth “WHM”). The relative contributions of the brain and the
      periphery that endow the Iceman with these capabilities is
      unknown. To investigate this, we conducted multi-modal imaging
      assessments of the brain and the periphery using a combination of
      fMRI and PET/CT imaging. Thermoregulatory defense was evoked by
      subjecting the Iceman (and a cohort of typical controls) to a fMRI
      paradigm designed to generate periods of mild hypothermia
      interspersed by periods of return to basal core body temperature.
      fMRI was acquired in two separate sessions: in a typical (passive)
      state and following the practice of WHM. In addition, the Iceman
      also underwent a whole body PET/CT imaging session using the
      tracers C11-hydroxyephedrine (HED) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose
      (FDG) during both thermoneutral and prolonged mild cold
      conditions. This acquisition allowed us to determine changes in
      sympathetic innervation (HED) and glucose consumption (FDG) in
      muscle and fat tissues in the absence of the WHM. fMRI analyses
      indicated that the WHM activates primary control centers for
      descending pain/cold stimuli modulation in the periaqueductal gray
      (PAG), possibly initiating a stress-induced analgesic response. In
      addition, the WHM also engages higher-order cortical areas (left
      anterior and right middle insula) that are uniquely associated
      with self-reflection, and which facilitate both internal focus and
      sustained attention in the presence of averse (e.g. cold) external
      stimuli. However, the activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) was
      unremarkable. Finally, forceful respiration results in increased
      sympathetic innervation and glucose consumption in intercostal
      muscle, generating heat that dissipates to lung tissue and warms
      circulating blood in the pulmonary capillaries. Our results
      provide compelling evidence for the primacy of the brain (CNS)
      rather than the body (peripheral mechanisms) in mediating the
      Iceman's responses to cold exposure. They also suggest the
      compelling possibility that the WHM might allow practitioners to
      develop higher level of control over key components of the
      autonomous system, with implications for lifestyle interventions
      that might ameliorate multiple clinical syndromes.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      An international research team led by scientists at Beihang
      University in China and The University of Texas at Dallas has
      developed high-strength, super-tough sheets of carbon that can be
      inexpensively fabricated at low temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      The team made the sheets by chemically stitching together
      platelets of graphitic carbon, which is similar to the graphite
      found in the soft lead of an ordinary pencil. The fabrication
      process resulted in a material whose mechanical properties exceed
      those of carbon fiber composites currently used in commercial
      products.<br>
      <br>
      “These sheets might eventually replace the expensive carbon fiber
      composites that are used for everything from aircraft and
      automobile bodies to windmill blades and sports equipment,” said
      Dr. Ray Baughman, the Robert A. Welch Distinguished Chair in
      Chemistry at UT Dallas and director of the Alan G. MacDiarmid

        <b>Sijie Wan, et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Significance</b><br>
      There is a continuing search for manufacturable sheets having high
      strength and toughness in all sheet directions for diverse
      applications, from airplanes to windmills. Cross-plied carbon
      fibers in a polymer resin requiring high-temperature cure
      presently provide the common solution. We demonstrate cross-linked
      graphene sheets that are manufacturable from graphene platelets,
      which are resin-free, processable at low temperature, contain less
      than 10 wt % additives, and provide high strength and record
      toughness in all in-plane directions. This advance results from
      successive use of p–p and covalent cross-linking agents.
      Simultaneous enhancement of strength, durability, and electrical
      conductivity are demonstrated. Spectroscopic measurements,
      including Raman studies of interplatelet stress transfer,
      elucidate the chemical nature and physical consequences of these
      dual cross-linking agents.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      We here show that infiltrated bridging agents can convert
      inexpensively fabricated graphene platelet sheets into
      high-performance materials, thereby avoiding the need for a
      polymer matrix. Two types of bridging agents were investigated for
      interconnecting graphene sheets, which attach to sheets by either
      p–p bonding or covalent bonding. When applied alone, the p–p
      bonding agent is most effective. However, successive application
      of the optimized ratio of p–p bonding and covalent bonding agents
      provides graphene sheets with the highest strength, toughness,
      fatigue resistance, electrical conductivity, electromagnetic
      interference shielding efficiency, and resistance to ultrasonic
      dissolution. Raman spectroscopy measurements of stress transfer to
      graphene platelets allow us to decipher the mechanisms of property
      improvement. In addition, the degree of orientation of graphene
      platelets increases with increasing effectiveness of the bonding
      agents, and the interlayer spacing increases. Compared with other
      materials that are strong in all directions within a sheet, the
      realized tensile strength (945 MPa) of the resin-free graphene
      platelet sheets was higher than for carbon nanotube or graphene
      platelet composites, and comparable to that of commercially
      available carbon fiber composites. The toughness of these
      composites, containing the combination of p–p bonding and covalent
      bonding, was much higher than for these other materials having
      high strengths for all in-plane directions, thereby opening the
      path to materials design of layered nanocomposites using multiple
      types of quantitatively engineered chemical bonds between
      nanoscale building blocks.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      A tiny "Arc Processor" sitting within the Intel CPU with it's own
      custom version of Linux (Minix) operating beyond the software
      level - completely transparent to the end user. Does not matter if
      your using Windows, Linux or Apple iOS...you are toast and THIS is
      how Israel does it. All part of The Talpiot Program. No one is
      safe - no one. AMD has the exact same system - Platform Security
      System - and that is now totally owned and run by China. The
      ENTIRE worlds "Cloud Based" Internet system is backdoored by
      Israel. THIS is a national security disaster. Disaster is spelt
      D-I-S-A-S-T-E-R. I have copped endless shit for 9 years exposing
      this. I have been jailed, beaten, bashed, vilified and threatened
      with the dreaded "Wood Shed" by Ry Ry Dawson [shivers], but I am
      still here. And so are you. I have been greeted by high level
      players. Everyone HATES Israel. Everyone. They just have the key
      staff in key positions bribed and blackmailed. They have "kill
      switched" the worlds infrastructure. This is why Netanyahu is
      soooooooooo cocky and why we never seem to get anywhere. With
      thanks to Luke for the details on the IME. Luke worked as a
      software engineer and specialized in all things Intel. <br>
