          Plasmonic metal nanostructures have attracted considerable
          attention for solar energy harvesting due to their capability
          in photothermal conversion. However, the narrow resonant band
          of the conventional plasmonic nanoparticles greatly limits
          their application as only a small fraction of the solar energy
          can be utilized. Herein, a unique confined seeded growth
          strategy is developed to synthesize black silver
          nanostructures with broadband absorption in the visible and
          near-infrared spectrum. Through this novel strategy,
          assemblages of silver nanoparticles with widely distributed
          interparticle distances are generated in rod-shaped tubular
          spaces, leading to strong random plasmonic coupling and
          accordingly broadband absorption for significantly improved
          utilization of solar energy. With excellent efficiency in
          converting solar energy to heat, the resulting black Ag
          nanostructures can be made into thin films floating at the
          air/water interface for efficient generation of clean water
          steam through localized interfacial heating.<br>

          Abstract<br>
          Calcium fructoborate (CF), a natural sugar-borate ester found
          in fresh fruits and vegetables, is a source of soluble boron.
          CF contains three forms of borate (diester, monoester, and
          boric acid) and all are biologically active, both at the
          intracellular (as free boric acid) and extracellular level (as
          fructose-borate diester and monoester). At the cellular and
          molecular level, CF is superior to the boric acid/borate,
          exhibiting a complex "protective" effect against inflammatory
          response. CF is commercially available in the USA as a
          "nature-identical" complex, an active compound for dietary
          supplements. It provides effective and safe support against
          the discomfort and lack of flexibility associated with
          osteoarticular conditions (arthritis and joint degeneration),
          and improves Western Ontario and McMaster Universities
          Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) and McGill indexes. In addition, orally
          administered CF is effective in ameliorating symptoms of
          physiological response to stress, including inflammation of
          the mucous membranes, discomfort associated with
          osteoarthritis disorders, and bone loss, and also for
          supporting cardiovascular health. Clinical studies have
          exhibited the ability of CF to significantly modulate
          molecular markers associated with inflammatory mechanisms,
          mainly on the elevated serum levels of C-reactive protein
          (CRP).<br>

          Girls exposed to chemicals commonly found in shampoo,
          toothpaste and soap may hit puberty earlier, even if their
          only exposure is through the products their mothers used while
          they were pregnant, according to a new longitudinal study led
          by researchers at UC Berkeley.<br>
          <br>
          “We know that some of the things we put on our bodies are
          getting into our bodies, either because they pass through the
          skin or we breathe them in or we inadvertently ingest them,”
          said Kim Harley, lead author of the study and associate
          adjunct professor in the School of Public Health at Berkeley,
          in the UC newsletter. “We need to know how these chemicals are
          affecting our health.”<br>
          <br>
          Published in the journal Human Reproduction, this new report
          comes from data collected as part of the Centre for the Health
          Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS)
          study. That project followed 338 children from before birth
          into adolescence to reveal how early environmental exposures
          may impact childhood development.<br>
          <br>
          Over the past 20 years, research has shown that girls, and
          possibly also boys, have been going through puberty earlier
          and earlier. This is troubling news because scientists have
          linked the early onset of puberty with greater risk of mental
          illness, breast and ovarian cancer in girls and testicular
          cancer in boys.<br>
          <br>
          Early puberty, also known as precocious puberty, is defined as
          developing breasts and starting periods before the age of
          eight. The average age for girls is 11. Starting before the
          age of eight also causes social trouble for young girls,
          including a heightened tendency towards risky behaviour,
          explains Harley.<br>
          <br>
          The chemicals in question — phthalates, parabens and phenols —
          are known as endocrine disrupters, which may mimic hormones
          and lead children to mature well before their natural time. As
          the study noted, exposure to these chemicals is widespread,
          which is why it’s crucial parents be made aware of the
          findings.<br>
          <br>
          “While more research is needed, people should be aware that
          there are chemicals in personal care products that may be
          disrupting the hormones in our bodies,” Harley said, as the UC
          newsletter noted.<br>

          The effect of boron supplementation was investigated in 19
          male bodybuilders ages 20-27 years. Ten were given a 2.5-mg
          boron supplement while 9 were given a placebo every day for 7
          weeks. Plasma total and free testosterone, plasma boron, lean
          body mass, and strength measurements were determined on Days 1
          and 49 of the study. Plasma boron values were significantly (p
          &lt; 0.05) different as the experimental group increased from
          (+/- SD) 20.1 +/- 7.7 ppb pretest to 32.6 +/- 27.6 ppb
          posttest, while the control group mean decreased from 15.1 +/-
          14.4 ppb pretest to 6.3 +/- 5.5 ppb posttest. Analysis of
          variance indicated no significant effect of boron
          supplementation on any of the dependent variables. Both groups
          demonstrated significant increases in total testosterone, lean
          body mass, 1-RM squat, and 1-RM bench press. The findings
          suggest that 7 weeks of bodybuilding can increase total
          testosterone, lean body mass, and strength in lesser trained
          bodybuilders, and that boron supplementation had no effect on
          these measures.<br>

          Boron. <br>
          Abstract<br>
          OBJECTIVE:<br>
          <br>
          To evaluate the scientific evidence on boron including expert
          opinion, folkloric precedent, history, pharmacology,
          kinetics/dynamics, interactions, adverse effects, toxicology,
          and dosing. This review serves as a clinical support tool.<br>
          METHODS:<br>
          <br>
          Electronic searches were conducted in nine databases, 20
          additional journals (not indexed in common databases), and
          bibliographies from 50 selected secondary references. No
          restrictions were placed on language or quality of
          publications. All literature collected pertained to efficacy
          in humans, dosing, precautions, adverse effects, use in
          pregnancy/lactation, interactions, alteration of laboratory
          assays, and mechanisms of action. Standardized
          inclusion/exclusion criteria are utilized for selection.
          Grades were assigned using an evidence-based grading
          rationale.<br>
          RESULTS:<br>
          <br>
          There was a lack of systematic study on the safety and
          effectiveness of boron in humans. However, based on popular
          use and supportive scientific data, nine indications are
          discussed in this review: hormone regulation, improving
          cognitive function, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, vaginitis
          (topical), bodybuilding aid (increasing testosterone),
          menopausal symptoms, prevention of blood clotting (coagulation
          effects), and psoriasis (topical).<br>
          CONCLUSION:<br>
          <br>
          Although studies assessing the use of boron for osteoarthritis
          and osteoporosis are in preliminary stages, reports are
          promising. There is conflicting evidence to support the use of
          boron in hormonal regulation and cognitive function. Future
          randomized controlled trials are warranted. There is fair
          negative evidence regarding the use of boron as an
          anticoagulant, a bodybuilding aid, for menopausal symptoms, or
          for psoriasis. Excessive use may be harmful, and caution is
          advised.<br>

          Abstract<br>
          Boron is increasingly added to food supplements due to
          multiple effects that have been reported in mammals after
          boric acid administration. Among these effects are
          inflammatory process control, bone and muscle strength
          enhancement, protein expression regulation, and a decreased
          risk of developing some pathologies in which these processes
          are key, such as osteoporosis, dermatological inflammatory
          non-infectious maladies and diseases affecting the central
          nervous system. Experimental data have suggested that steroid
          hormone levels in plasma change after boric acid
          administration, but a clear mechanism behind these variations
          has not been established. We analyzed possibilities for these
          changes and hypothesized that boric acid disrupts the
          interactions between steroid hormones and several carriers in
          plasma. In particular, we proposed that there is an uncoupling
          of the interactions between sex hormone binding globulin
          (SHBG) and estrogens and testosterone and that there are
          alterations in the binding of hydrophobic ligands by other
          carrier proteins in plasma. Further experimental and
          computational studies are required to support the hypothesis
          that boric acid and probably other boron-containing compounds
          can displace steroid hormones from their plasma carriers. If
          such phenomena are confirmed, boron administration with a
          clear mechanism could be employed as a therapeutic agent in
          several diseases or physiological events that require
          modulation of steroid hormone levels in plasma.<br>

      Jacques Ravatin nous a quitté en Mars 2011. C’est par cet
      entretien de 1978 – ci-dessous – que nous l’avons découvert. Il
      était la continuation et la synthèse d’une longue lignée de
      chercheurs et de scientifiques d’avant-garde qui, à la fois,
      pratiquement et théoriquement étudiaient les liens du visible et
      de l’invisible, de leurs implications et de la possibilité de
      changer de conscience. Son œuvre reste relativement méconnu et il
      est dommage que plusieurs farfelus s’en inspirent. Ravatin
      continua ses travaux avec sa fondation Ark’all et publia de
      nombreuses études, parfois sous le pseudonyme de Vladimir
      Rosgnilk. Ses thèses restent à être vérifier par une communauté
      plus large de chercheurs…<br>

      While this article by Dr. Woodrow Monte was published in 2008, the
      facts are current and it's one everybody should read because of
      the link to breast cancer.&nbsp; In his book, "While Science
      Sleeps: A Sweetener Kills" he&nbsp; correctly calls aspartame a
      killing machine.&nbsp; Dr. Morando Soffritti in one of his studies
      at the Ramazzini Institute on aspartame also proved it causes
      breast cancer.&nbsp; It goes into some detail about if a woman is
      pregnant and the baby survives (aspartame is a teratogen) that
      child can grow up to cancer.&nbsp; While we see the horror of the
      use of aspartame in the population and almost 100% of scientific
      peer reviewed studies prove the problems, the FDA goes ahead and
      approves another aspartame product, Advantame.&nbsp; Be safe, read
      labels and spread the word.<br>

      <br>
      Formaldehyde from contaminated air, at very low concentrations
      (11) , causes cancer in humans. Formaldehyde is a powerful cancer
      causing agent, one of the handful of chemicals classed as a Group
      I carcinogen by the IARC, the International Agency for Research on
      Cancer, Lyon, France (11) , because of this there is no known safe
      level of formaldehyde exposure. Gaseous environmental formaldehyde
      causes nasopharyngeal cancer, however, it is not known, in the
      gaseous form, to cause breast cancer. The probable reason for this
      is that formaldehyde has an extremely high reactivity (201) it
      reacts with and does its damage to the first human tissue with
      which it makes contact. Formaldehyde does not travel well in
      protein rich blood supply (122) and because of this it is blocked
      from reaching the breast and other internal organs. The only way
      that formaldehyde can reach the mammary tissue, aside from
      purposely injecting formaldehyde solution (122) (as in embalming)
      is to disguise the formaldehyde as methanol. The methanol from
      Aspartame can reach a woman's breast and will there is readily
      converted into formaldehyde by ADH (190b) .<br>
      <br>
      It is not possible to prevent Aspartame from producing the cancer
      causing compound formaldehyde in a woman's breast (78) . All of
      the methanol in diet soda must be transformed into formaldehyde
      before the body can metabolize it. The scientifically acclaimed
      Ramazzini Institute recently found consumption of Aspartame over
      time caused Breast Cancer in Rats (50) . The methanol that is
      responsible for producing this formaldehyde is also found in our
      processed food supply, the average modern woman not exposed to
      diet products consumes, conservatively, less than 8 milligrams of
      it a day (1) . Methanol has be implicated as a possible cause of
      the increase of breast cancer over the last 25 years and can be
      found in human milk (219) . One can of diet soda contains over 4
      times this amount, one liter almost 20 times what would be
      average. Primitive and or impoverished woman consume little
      methanol and are protected, to a very great extent, from breast
      cancer. Conversely increased consumption of Aspartame has caused
      breast cancer rates to increase dramatically (194) .<br>
      <br>
      It can be shown that the incidence of breast cancer has increased
      dramatically over the last 25 years (219) and particularly in
      populations exposed to Aspartame (194) .<br>
      <br>
      The breast is an organ with no way to protect itself from
      formaldehyde (216) with no means to render it harmless. The
      methanol, always produced when Aspartame is consumed ( 20 , 51
      ),will convert directly into formaldehyde, there is no
      intermediate compound or alternate path( 7 , 30 ). "Class I
      Alcohol dehydrogenase" ADH is required for the conversion of
      methanol to formaldehyde (112) . ADH is not a common enzyme in the
      human body, not many cells in the human body contains this enzyme.
      The human breast is one of the few organs in the body with a high
      concentration of ADH (190b) and it is found there exclusively in
      the mammary epithelial cells, the very cells known to transform
      into adenocarcinoma (190c) (breast cancer) cells with very low
      aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (216) .<br>
      <br>
      The most recent breast cancer scientific literature implicates ADH
      as perhaps having a pivotal role in the formation of breast
      cancer, indicating a greater incidence of the disease in those
      with higher levels of ADH activity in their breasts (190a) . One
      article went so far as to implicate acetaldehyde as a potential
      culprit (190a) . Acetaldehyde is the molecule that ethanol is
      metabolized into by ADH, the first step in the manufacture of
      vinegar, a beneficial molecule with no link to carcinogenicity,
      what so ever. Recent scientific literature is a desert when it
      comes to methanol. It is as if there were no such thing as
      methanol in the environment as if methanol did not exist, as if
      all the laboratories doing work in methanol toxicity had vanished
      from the face of the earth 40 years ago and with them the science
      of methanol poisoning (39) .<br>
      <br>
      The truth is that methanol acts as a golden bullet, wasting none
      of its destructive power but administering a carcinogen directly
      inside those breast cells most vulnerable to cancer.<br>
      <br>
      All of the hundreds of test that were done to prove Aspartame safe
      were done on animals insensitive to methanol poisoning (78) . This
      was well known to the company who invented Aspartame, why else
      would they have hired the worlds methanol research laboratories to
      help them prove aspartame was safe (39) ? These animals have a
      specialized catalase enzyme in their livers that humans do not
      (55) . Catalase helps keep methanol out of their general
      circulation and therefore they are mostly immune to methanol as a
      poison. Many thousands of people lost their lives in the early
      nineteen hundreds when methanol was allowed in foods and
      medications after it was proven falsely safe by trusting methanol
      safety testing done on an identical array of animals( 17 , 30 ).<br>
      <br>
      Twenty six years ago, I traveled from my laboratory at Arizona
      State University to Washington DC to view the results of the
      testing done by the company who invented Aspartame and were
      seeking it's approval for use in carbonated beverages. I will
      never forget viewing the data from the only high dosage human
      consumption study done on diabetics. This study was never to be
      repeated. Before the test began the subjects were screened for all
      manner of illnesses and certified disease free (save from
      diabetes) as a prerequisite to being accepted into the study.
      During that study, after 11 weeks of high dose aspartame
      consumption two of the women developed epithelial cancer. Both
      were removed from the study, one had a mastectomy, subsequent
      pathology tested conclusively for adenocarcinoma.<br>
      To my most profound horror, the executive summary of that study
      concluded that Aspartame was safe! The rational used to ignore the
      fact that none of the placebo group but fully 8% of the Aspartame
      consumption subjects developed epithelial cancer during the high
      dosage consumption study was that "no such cancers were seen in
      the numerous animal studies" (48) . The Bressler Report exposed
      that this was, in fact. a lie (197) , These cancers should have
      never been ignored.<br>
      <br>
      I can not say that methanol is the only cause of breast cancer,
      there are so many other poisons in our modern environment. I will
      say that it is intuitively obvious that there would be no good
      done producing one more cancer causing agent inside a sensitive
      breast cell already exposed to other cancer causing agents.<br>
      <br>
      Breast cancer, as with MS may possibly be linked to cigarette
      smoking (191) which is a source of methanol (even though smoking
      would be a much more efficient mechanism to administer methanol to
      the brain than the breast). The uneven distribution of both MS and
      Breast cancer throughout the world show a disarming similarity
      (193) even to the unexplained increases to epidemic proportions in
      the same regions over the last 30 years (190) , such as Japan
      (192) . Then of course we have the chart I presented in the
      December issue of Fitness Life showing a disconcerting, abrupt
      rise in incidence of breast cancer coinciding exactly with the
      ramp up of Aspartame consumption after it was approved for
      sweetening carbonated beverages in the United States (194) .<br>
      <br>
      As a food scientist I have been trained to detect food borne
      disease. Breast cancer and MS are two diseases that I believe are
      linked to methanol poisoning derived primarily from food. With
      this observation I hope to point the way to my colleagues in the
      healing arts to continue with the investigation of this poisoning.<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately no major pharmacological laboratory anywhere in the
      world seems to have any time for studying poisoning. The
      considerable brain power of medical research seems mesmerized by
      the quest for ever more expensive cures while leaving the details
      of prevention to the "lesser" sciences. The reason's for this are
      obvious... to cure a poisoning you need only teach how to limit
      exposure... there is no real money to be made from good advice.<br>
      <br>
      A courageous new history may someday designate our era as the dark
      ages of the health sciences.<br>
      <br>
      Poison taints the "swich licour" in which our tissues are
      "bathed". Knowing the cause of any malfunction in our almost
      perfect workings we must consider first the impact of our poisoned
      environment.<br>
      <br>
      The wild natural world of our ancient forbearers seems, to me, a
      friendlier place to our countenance than this one we have tamed
      with new processes and chemical tools who's power we do not fully
      understand and appear to have no interest in knowing.<br>
      <br>
      Methanol is an unwanted residue of our quest for leisure and
      release from the burden of constant search for sustenance (194) .
      It has been around since man first tasted meat cooked on an open
      fire or was forced, by hunger, to eat a fruit long past its prime
      (35) . It has been to our great disadvantage that it has now been
      made to taste sweet (14) .<br>
      <br>
      Here then is the bizarre, dark side to sweet Aspartame. Its
      workings are too rich in design and simple in nature to have been
      plotted, in purpose, by any human hand... to splendid to consign
      to serendipity. There is magic in the mischief of this little
      molecule. I suggest that we will be surprised to learn what it can
      teach us...<br>

      Aspartame is a psycho drug causing psychiatric and behavioral
      problems, and interacts with all anti-depressants according to Dr.
      H. J. Roberts ("Aspartame Disease: An Ignored Epidemic" -
      www.amazon.com The Atlanta Journal Constitution has been writing
      about the epidemic of suicides:&nbsp; https://www.ajc.com/news/
      schools-try-thwart-troubling- trend-childhood-suicide/
      0vOiym7bSN9Vz4lbBp8SIL/ Here is an article by Dr. Ralph Walton on
      psychiatric disease and aspartame:&nbsp;
      https://rense.com/general78/ psych.htm Dr. Walton is a
      psychiatrist who did a study on aspartame.&nbsp; The administrator
      of a hospital took part&nbsp; in a study of aspartame by Dr.
      Walton suffering a retinal detachment and losing the vision in one
      eye.&nbsp; The problems were so bad the study had to be stopped
      and it wasn't even using the maximum allowable intake:&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/%20pubmed/8373935"><span
          style="font-weight: bold;">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
          pubmed/8373935 </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      </a><br>
      As this study shows, "aspartame may be contributing to the
      downfall of human civilization by altering the brains of human
      beings, turning them into cognitively impaired, chemically-altered
      organisms incapable of rational behavior. It also reminds us that
      when it comes to food ingredients, humans are the lab rats who are
      routinely exposed to dangerous, toxic chemicals that have unknown
      long-term effects."<br>
      <br>
      "But they're all "approved" by the FDA, often based on fraudulent
      science studies provided by the chemical manufacturers
      themselves.".<br>
      <br>
      On August 1, 1985 Senator Howard Metzenbaum submitted a bill, S.
      1557 for NIH to do independent studies on what they were seeing in
      the population immediately after release of aspartame including
      "behavioral and neurological effects experienced by individuals
      who have consumed aspartame, especially children who have consumed
      aspartame."&nbsp; Other problems they were seeing included the
      consumption of aspartame on pregnant women and fetuses. (FDA had
      sealed the teratology studies that showed such things as spina
      bifida, neural tube defects and&nbsp; cleft palate:&nbsp; Here is
      Dr. Woodrow Monte's chapter on aspartame and autism from "While
      Science Sleeps:&nbsp; A Sweetener Kills", https://rense.com/
      general96/asparautism.html )&nbsp; , the interaction of aspartame
      with drugs, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors,
      alpha-methyl-dopa, and L-dihydroxphenylalanine, the effect of the
      consumption of aspartame in increasing the probability of
      seizures. <br>
      This bill never got out of committee.&nbsp; The only reason they
      didn't want the studies done&nbsp; is because they knew it would
      show the same problems over again and the public were being used
      as lab rats since aspartame was never proven safe according to the
      investigators at&nbsp; the FDA at that time on
      aspartame.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why would any Senator not sign this to
      protect the human race? The bill never got out of committee.<br>
      <br>
      More and more mental hospitals&nbsp; are being built. They are
      giving them diet coke and psychiatric drugs that interact. <br>

        Abstract</span><br>
      Black phosphorus (BP), also known as phosphorene, has attracted
      recent scientific attention since its first successful exfoliation
      in 2014 owing to its unique structure and properties. In
      particular, its exceptional attributes, such as the excellent
      optical and mechanical properties, electrical conductivity and
      electron-transfer capacity, contribute to its increasing demand as
      an alternative to graphene-based materials in biomedical
      applications. Although the outlook of this material seems
      promising, its practical applications are still highly
      challenging. In this review article, we discuss the unique
      properties of BP, which make it a potential platform for
      biomedical applications compared to other 2D materials, including
      graphene, molybdenum disulphide (MoS2), tungsten diselenide (WSe2)
      and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). We then introduce various
      synthesis methods of BP and review its latest progress in
      biomedical applications, such as biosensing, drug delivery,
      photoacoustic imaging and cancer therapies (i.e., photothermal and
      photodynamic therapies). Lastly, the existing challenges and
      future perspective of BP in biomedical applications are briefly
      discussed.<br>

          killed famed cancer doctor in mere minutes from “total organ
          failure” … state-run media desperately tries to cover it up</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
      </div>
      <br>
      Dr. Martin Gore, a widely celebrated cancer doctor credited with
      “saving thousands of lives” died from “total organ failure” just
      minutes after receiving a vaccine shot yesterday. Dr. Gore was a
      professor of cancer medicine at the Institute of Cancer Research
      based in London. He “died suddenly yesterday after a routine
      inoculation for yellow fever,” reports The Times (UK).<br>
      <br>
      “His death highlights the increased risks associated with the
      vaccine for the growing number of older travellers visiting exotic
      destinations,” the paper explains.<br>
      <br>
      It also underscores the horrific price of believing in Big Pharma,
      chemotherapy and vaccines. Throughout his career, Dr. Gore oversaw
      the harming of tens of thousands of children who were subjected to
      toxic chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Ultimately, he was
      killed by his own false belief in the safety of vaccines, another
      weaponized form of toxic medicine. Live by the sword, die by the
      sword.<br>
      <br>
      So far, the U.S. media has completely blacked out the story in yet
      another effort to silence any truth about the deadly dangers of
      vaccines. There isn’t a single establishment news outlet in the
      United States that has accurately reported on this vaccine-induced
      sudden death of a cancer doctor. In truth, vaccines kill people,
      yet the CDC-directed U.S. media pretends no one ever dies from
      vaccines in order to deliberately mislead the public, resulting in
      more people being killed by vaccine injuries.<br>
      <br>
      Even the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity where Dr. Gore also worked
      withheld the truth in their own Facebook announcement about his
      death, saying, “It is with deep sadness that The Royal Marsden
      announces the sudden death of Professor Martin Gore CBE who died
      this morning,” utterly failing to mention he died from a vaccine
      jab.<br>
      <br>
      BBC lies about the doctor’s death claiming, “cause of death is
      unknown” and eliminating the word “vaccine” from its story
      headline<br>
      <br>
      The BBC also tried to hide the truth about this vaccine-induced
      fatality by eliminating any word of “vaccine” from the headline of
      the story announcing his death. “Royal Marsden’s leading cancer
      expert Martin Gore dies,” states BBC News, deliberately misleading
      readers because the BBC is, of course, state-run fake news.<br>
      <br>
      The BBC even goes on to misleadingly claim, “The cause of his
      death is not known.” We wonder what Dr. Gore would think if he
      knew the BBC was using his death to promote more vaccines that
      will kill more people, all while burying the truth about the
      serious risks associated with vaccine shots.<br>
      <br>
      The UK Daily Mail reported the story with greater accuracy,
      stating, “Martin Gore, 67, passed away after suffering total organ
      failure shortly after having the injection, which is recommended
      to anyone visiting Sub-Saharan Africa, South and Central America
      and the Caribbean…” The Daily Mail even goes on to quote a study
      that documented some of the serious side effects of the Yellow
      Fever vaccine:<br>
      <br>
      Serious adverse effects recorded in the study included
      hospitalization, life-threatening illness, permanent disability
      and death. Five people died from the jab in this period.<br>
      Dr. Martin Gore was part of a review team that exposed medical
      malpractice taking place inside The Royal Marsden<br>
      <br>
      Adding to the intrigue of the story, in 2013 Dr. Gore led an
      investigation that exposed medical malpractice by other cancer
      doctors working at Royal Marsden. “A top cancer doctor has
      admitted mistakes were made in the care of a toddler who died
      after doctors failed to spot her fatal brain condition in time to
      save her.” reports the UK Mirror. “Professor Martin Gore, medical
      director of the Royal Marsden, who led an inquiry into Alice’s
      care at the hospital and Kingston Hospital following her death,
      found more than a dozen failings by medical staff.”<br>
      <br>
      The Royal Marsden is the same hospital that sought to destroy the
      career of a renowned cancer surgeon named Joseph Meirion Thomas,
      who blew the whistle on the medical fraud taking place at the
      hospital. As Natural News reported on August 29, 2015:<br>
      <br>
      A vicious hate campaign has been waged against an internationally
      renowned cancer surgeon named Joseph Meirion Thomas. At first, his
      superiors in the medical system tried to silence him, but now
      they’ve resorted to firing him.<br>
      <br>
      The courageous 69-year-old surgeon has been fired from the Royal
      Marsden Hospital in London because he started speaking the truth
      about the faults of the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK
      while questioning the quality of care that general practitioners
      provide.<br>
      <br>
      It raises the obvious speculative question: Was Dr. Gore
      deliberately murdered with a vaccine injection to silence him?<br>

      In an effort to stem the rising tide of multi-resistant bacteria,
      researchers have turned to niche environments in the hope of
      discovering new varieties of antibiotics. We investigated an
      ethnopharmacological (cure) from an alkaline/radon soil in the
      area of Boho, in the Fermanagh Scarplands (N. Ireland) for the
      presence of Streptomyces, a well-known producer of antibiotics.
      From this soil we isolated a novel (closest relative 57% of genome
      relatedness) Streptomyces sp. capable of growth at high alkaline
      pH (10.5) and tolerant of gamma radiation to 4 kGy. Genomic
      sequencing identified many alkaline tolerance
      (antiporter/multi-resistance) genes compared to S. coelicolor M145
      (at 3:1), hence we designated the strain Streptomyces sp.
      myrophorea, isolate McG1, from the Greek, myro (fragrance) and
      phorea (porter/carrier). In vitro tests demonstrated the ability
      of the Streptomyces sp. myrophorea, isolate McG1 to inhibit the
      growth of many strains of ESKAPE pathogens; most notably
      carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (a critical pathogen
      on the WHO priority list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria),
      vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (both listed as high
      priority pathogens). Further in silico prediction of antimicrobial
      potential of Streptomyces sp. myrophorea, isolate McG1 by
      anti-SMASH and RAST software identified many secondary metabolite
      and toxicity resistance gene clusters (45 and 27, respectively) as
      well as many antibiotic resistance genes potentially related to
      antibiotic production. Follow-up in vitro tests show that the
      Streptomyces sp. myrophorea, isolate McG1 was resistant to 28 out
      of 36 clinical antibiotics. Although not a comprehensive analysis,
      we think that some of the Boho soils’ reputed curative properties
      may be linked to the ability of Streptomyces sp. myrophorea,
      isolate McG1 to inhibit ESKAPE pathogens. More importantly,
      further analysis may elucidate other key components that could
      alleviate the tide of multi-resistant nosocomial infections.<br>

      <br>
      But, in a surprising twist, the US Food and Drug Administration

          Study: Fast Food Can Make Your Penis Smaller?</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Terrence Donovan </span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
      </div>
      <br>
      A new published study found that a chemical commonly found on
      fast-food wrappers and non-stick frying pans could seriously have
      a significant impact on male penis endowment.<br>
      <br>
      According to the study, published in the Journal of Clinical
      Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism, those who had been exposed to
      perfluoroalkyl compounds had significantly smaller penises than
      those who hadn’t.<br>
      <br>
      Also referred to as PFCs, the compounds also lowered semen
      quality. They’re designed to make cooking easier, but it seems
      that they may have a bizarre effect on penises.<br>
      <br>
      Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substancesare a class of
      fluorinated organic chemicals containing at least one fully
      fluorinated carbon atom.<br>
      <br>
      The compounds are also found in drinking water in some places. In
      the study, researchers analysed young men living in Padua, Italy.
      Water there is known to be heavily polluted with PFCs.<br>
      <br>
      383 male high-school students were examined, including 212 who had
      been exposed to PFCs through June 2017 and May. They took
      participant’s blood to measure sexual hormones, examined semen
      samples. They also took several measurements on their penises,
      including length, circumference, testicular volume and anogenital
      distance.<br>
      <br>
      These chemicals had a significant effect on boys. Participants who
      weren’t exposed to PFCs had an average penis length of 3.94
      inches, compared to an average of 3.44 inches in those who had.
      Exposed men were also one-fifth of an inch less girthy.<br>
      <br>
      The Mirror explains:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the study, published in the Journal of
      Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism, the researchers, led by
      Andrea Di Nisio, wrote: “This study documents that PFCs have a
      substantial impact on human male health as they directly interfere
      with hormonal pathways potentially leading to male infertility.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “We found that increased levels of PFCs in
      plasma and seminal fluid positively correlate with circulating
      testosterone and with a reduction of semen quality, testicular
      volume, penile length, and AGD [anogenital distance].”<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worryingly, the researchers found the problem
      has affected young men from 1978 onwards – and the PFCs aren’t
      going anywhere anytime soon.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, they suggest that the next move may be
      working out a way to remove PFCs from the blood.<br>
      <br>
      Study authors call this a “substantial impact on human male
      health”.<br>
      <br>
      The man-made chemicals have long been used in a wide range of
      consumer products. The list includes nonstick cookware,
      water-repellent fabrics and grease-resistant paper products. They
      are also used in firefighting foams. Exposures have been
      associated with an array of health problems, among them thyroid
      disease, weakened immunity, infertility risks and certain cancers.
      The compounds do not break down in the environment.<br>
      <br>
      So, what can we do to keep ourselves safe? Di Nisio believes the
      next priority is figuring out how to safely remove PFCs from the
      blood. Until we can do so, and until more PFCs are banned or
      phased out, the penis outlook is far from sunny.<br>
      <br>
      “At least here in Italy, it is very difficult to know if a product
      contains these chemicals,” he told IFLScience. “In the case of a
      product where it is explicitly stated ‘PFOA-free’, I do not feel
      safe anyway. PFOA is only one of hundreds of possible PFC
      compounds. They can all be dangerous… therefore it is very hard to
      avoid any contact with any PFC.”<br>

          Earthquake Will Hit US, Canadian West Coast Between Feb 21 And
          Mar 7, Astrologer Predicts</span><br style="font-weight:
          bold;">
      </div>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      Frank Hoogerbeets, an astrologer based on the Netherlands, warned
      U.S. residents living on the West Coast to prepare for a magnitude
      9 earthquake. Hoogerbeets claimed that a rare planetary alignment
      will occur between February 21 and March 7. He insists that the
      gravitational pull will increase seismic activity and that there’s
      a “potential for a megathrust earthquake with a magnitude 8 or
      even 9.”<br>
      <br>
      In a YouTube video, Hoogerbeets explained that a rare planetary
      alignment will cause an increase in seismic activity starting on
      February 21. On the said dates, there will be three planetary
      alignments. As reported by Express, Hoogerbeets revealed that the
      same planetary alignment coincides with the occurring of the
      largest earthquakes in the world. He claimed that the same
      planetary alignment happened during the 9.5 magnitude Chilean
      earthquake in 1960, the 9.2 magnitude earthquake in Alaska in
      1964, and the 9.3 magnitude earthquake in Sumatra in 2004.<br>
      <br>
      Out of all the dates during the period he specified, Hoogerbeets
      is most concerned about March 4 and 5. According to him, these
      dates are critical.<br>
      <br>
      Hoogerbeets explained that on March 4, there will be six planetary
      alignments. This occurrence is highly irregular and unique. On top
      of that, there will be a quadruple alignment involving Jupiter,
      Mars, the Sun, and Mercury. Given this scenario, he predicts an
      increase in seismic activity on March 5. He added that this
      convergence is the most powerful out of all the alignments he saw
      in the past three years.<br>
      <br>
      In another video posted on YouTube, Hoogerbeets cited that the
      recent tremors felt in Vancouver and South California are signs of
      increased seismic activity. On January 14, Vancouver Island
      experienced three light earthquakes. A 4.2 magnitude earthquake
      was reported first, followed by 4.3 magnitude and 4.0 magnitude
      earthquakes.<br>

      He warned that the West Coast needs to be on the lookout for a
      strong earthquake. He reiterated that there’s a “distinct
      possibility” that the megathrust earthquake will happen in late
      February or early March. He also clarified that he is not claiming
      that this event is a sure thing but that there is a high
      possibility that it will happen.<br>
      <br>
      Hoogerbeets went on to explain that an earthquake is long overdue
      on the West Coast. Meanwhile, experts agree with Hoogerbeets on
      one thing – they have been anticipating a major quake in the
      Cascadia subduction zone where the West Coast is located.<br>
      <br>
      As for the validity of Hoogerbeets’ claim that planetary alignment
      affects seismic activity, astronomer Phil Plait has something to
      clear up.<br>
      <br>
      “No, it won’t. It can’t.” He added that “there is simply no way an
      alignment of planets can cause an earthquake on Earth.”<br>
      <br>
      Experts defend that if there will be a magnitude 9 earthquake as
      Hoogerbeets predicted, it will have nothing to do with planetary
      alignment.<br>

EARTHQUAKE

          WARNING 21 Feb - 7 Mar 2018</span><br style="font-weight:
          bold;">
      </div>
      <br>
      This is a very timely warning so that everyone may find the time
      to prepare. Between February 21 and March 7 several very critical
      planetary configurations will cause a seismic increase. At least
      one or two high 7 magnitude earthquakes are expected, but it could
      also go easily over magnitude 8 or even 9, depending on the
      condition of Earth's crust. Three planetary alignments converge on
      February 21 and again on February 25, making the time-frame from
      the 21st to the 27th highly critical. No less than six planetary
      alignments converge around March 4 and this makes the time-frame
      from the 4th to the 7th highly critical. Expect at least one or
      two high 7 magnitude earthquakes, but prepare for at least an 8
      pointer. <br>

          warnings are racist, Portland NAACP says </span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
      </div>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Protesters in Portland, Oregon have rallied against a city
      policy demanding that owners of brick houses post warnings of
      potential collapse in case of an earthquake. Civil rights
      activists say the order targets black people.<br>
      <br>
      Dozens of activists led by Portland's chapter of the National
      Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) took to
      the streets on Saturday to protest against the city policy that
      came into effect this week.<br>
      <br>
      The policy, adopted in October, orders owners of old brick
      buildings to put up a sign that reads: "This is an unreinforced
      masonry building. Unreinforced masonry buildings may be unsafe in
      the event of a major earthquake."<br>
      <br>
      City officials say the policy is aimed at raising awareness about
      the structures' vulnerability to earthquakes, with experts
      pointing out that Portland is a high-risk area and may see a
      potent earthquake in the next 50 years. Some 1,600 aging buildings
      are estimated to fall under the new policy.<br>
      <br>
      However, Portland's black rights activists argue that the policy
      would drive the remnants of the city's black population,
      concentrated in the north and northeast of the city, out. Since
      investors and banks would likely be discouraged by "black marks,"
      the current owners of the buildings would be ultimately force to
      sell them to developers, who then would remodel the buildings,
      hiking up the cost of living in the neighborhoods, the NAACP
      believes...<br>

      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      Scientists have created a solar cell device that is significantly
      more efficient than conventional photovoltaic cells.<br>
      <br>
      For the first time, scientists have produced a photovoltaic (PV)
      cell with a conversion efficiency of 40.7 percent, the U.S.
      Department of Energy (DOE) reported on December 7. The
      collaboration of DOE and Spectrolab, Inc. (a subsidiary of Boeing)
      led to the achievement of a decades-long goal: to break the
      40-percent efficiency barrier on solar cell devices. “We are eager
      to see this accomplishment translate into the marketplace as soon
      as possible,” Alexander Karsner, assistant secretary for energy
      efficiency and renewable energy at DOE, said. ...<br>

Dark

          Overlord hacker group has released decryption keys for 650
          documents it says are related to 9/11. Unless a ransom is
          paid, it threatened with more leaks that will have devastating
          consequences for the US deep state.</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
      </div>
      <br>
      The document dump is just a fraction of the 18, 000 secret
      documents related to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks
      believed to have been stolen from insurers, law firms, and
      government agencies.<br>
      <br>
      The Dark Overlord initially threatened to release the 10GB of data
      unless the hacked firms paid an unspecified bitcoin ransom.
      However, on Wednesday, the group announced a "tiered compensation
      plan" in which the public could make bitcoin payments to unlock
      the troves of documents.<br>
      <br>
      A day later, the Dark Overlord said that it had received more than
      $12, 000 in bitcoin â€“ enough to unlock "layer 1" and several
      "checkpoints, " comprised of 650 documents in total.<br>
      <br>
      There are four more layers that remain encrypted and, according to
      the group, "each layer contains more secrets, more damaging
      materials... and generally just more truth."...<br>

      <br>
      We're now calling this megaleak, the '9/11 Papers'. Keep giving us
      cyber-cash for cyber-cache.<br>
      <br>
      Hello, world. As you're well-aware, we designed a compensation
      plan that would allow for the public crowd-funding of our
      organisation in order to permit the public disclosure of our "9/11
      Papers" in the interest of the public. Part of this plan was to
      create a tiered escalation plan that would result in multiple
      layers and milestones (which we're calling checkpoints) to ensure
      the powers at be are being properly bent over a barrel. We've said
      it before, and we'll say it again: we're financially motivated,
      and you (the public) has spoken to us in our language (internet
      money, specifically Bitcoin). Through voicing your satisfaction by
      sending us 3.27 BTC for a total of over 12.000 USD of BTC (at the
      time of writing), you've successfully unlocked Layer 1 as well as
      Checkpoint 03, Checkpoint 04, Checkpoint 05, Checkpoint 06, and
      Checkpoint 07. As with our previous paid releases, we've
      demonstrated to you that we're honest about our intentions and
      we're transparent. As a result of this most magnificent
      achievement, we're continuing to follow the wishes of the public
      by releasing the Layers and Checkpoints we promised you we would.
      Remember, continuing to fund our wallet will continue to keep us
      motivated to help break the truth to the world by open-sourcing
      what we're calling the "9/11 Papers". As such, let the leaking
      continue..<br>

      An introduction to the extraordinary metal-planet relationship
      experiments of Lili Kolisko, a significant scientific associate of
      Rudolf Steiner. <br>
      <br>
      Lili was one of the great unsung scientists of the 20th century
      who via decades of crystallization experiments in sync with
      geocentrically-observed cosmic motions and positions described a
      qualitative direct relationship between the 7 luminaries of old
      (Sun, Moon, visible planets) and the 7 noble metals (Gold, Silver,
      Copper, Tin, etc) as was held as canon in alchemy and ancient
      mystery schools (i.e. Gold=Sun, Silver=Moon, Copper=Venus, etc). <br>
      <br>
      The experiments described herein reflect Iron-Mars, Silver-Moon,
      and Lead-Saturn connections.<br>
      <br>
      The Hermetic Axiom "As Above, So Below" has a far more profound
      interpretation than modern orthodox consciousness allows with its
      petty materialistic limits. Lili Kolisko ennobles the path to
      awakening our supersensible consciousness - a definite remedy for
      the subsensible, sub-material quantum world explanations of
      orthodox science. <br>
      <br>
      "True Science will lead us to the acknowledgment of spiritual
      facts. The unison of Science, Art and Religion must come in the
      near future. Scientists must arise who are at the same time
      endowed in their souls with the qualities of an artist and a
      priest. Science must again become a holy Art, if an unholy natural
      science is not to lead mankind to destruction." ~ L. Kolisko<br>
      <br>
      This is a narration of Lili's work published in Stuttgart, Germany
      1928<br>

      solidify 99.98% pure mercury at room temperature.This is a secret
      process whose knowledge is given to the few disciples. This
      process is also known as Rasavaidya.It was known to great sages
      like Nagarjun, Aadi-Shankaracharya.A special treaty on mercury was

      Alchemists believed that no transformation—whether in the
      laboratory, in the body, or in the soul—could succeed without the
      presence of a mysterious ingredient known as the Materia Prima
      (First Matter). Nothing was more important to alchemist’s work
      than this energetic essence, which they believed could be
      extracted from nature and rendered tangible and visible. This
      lecture examines the nature and properties of the elusive First
      Matter. Hauck explains how the concept of the First Matter evolved
      in both the scientific and Hermetic traditions to become a
      fundamental, although often unrecognized, tenet of both ancient
      alchemy and modern physics. Based on a lecture at the “Hidden In
      Plain Sight” Conference at the Francis Bacon Auditorium in San
      Jose, California, in 2011.<br>

          Unveils World’s First Prefab House Built Entirely of Cannabis</span><br

      In the near future, citizens around the world will have the
      opportunity to live in economical, sustainable, and secure housing
      made entirely from hemp, a variety of the cannabis plant. Not only
      can the prefabricated abodes be constructed in a fraction of the
      time modern-day homes require, but they are also said to be more
      durable and affordable, as well as earthquake-resistant.<br>
      <br>
      The progressive home was constructed by Dun Agro, a Dutch company
      specializing in “hemp concrete,” also referred to as “hempcrete.”
      Hemp is a versatile variety of the cannabis plant. It can be used
      to make everything from industrial building materials and food to
      clothing and bio-fuel. Unlike its cousin, hemp does not contain
      tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). As a result, it is impossible to get
      “high” from ingesting or using the material.<br>
      <br>
      Dun Agro hempcrete is made from hemp fibers, water and glue. After
      it is pressed together in a mold to make prefab sections for
      houses, the mixture dries over a period of three months. Then, all
      sections of the home can be assembled.<br>
      <br>
      On November 30th, Dun Agro put its hemp home on display. The
      company has already completed its second hemp home and has plans
      to build and sell more in the near future. In fact, with the
      present output of hemp in the Netherlands, the company estimates
      it can produce up to 500 hemp houses per year. If the demand
      increases, that number can easily be scaled up.<br>
      <br>
      Dun Agro isn’t the first company that has attempted to build a
      prefabricated hemp house. However, the company does claim to be
      the first to have succeeded in doing so. The company lists the
      negative CO2 footprint as a primary benefit of purchasing a hemp
      home. Hemp takes on 13,500 kilos of CO2 when it grows and it
      remains stored in the hempcrete.<br>
      <br>
      Right now in the Netherlands, 1,100 hectares of agricultural land
      is being used to grow hemp. Farmers are choosing to cultivate the
      crop for extra income and to benefit the environment. <br>

      <br>
      (Natural News) Could deadly viruses hiding in the toxic
      “biosolids” that are being spread all over America’s food crops be
      at the root of the current epidemic of dementia? According to
      biosolids expert Craig Monk, there’s strong evidence to suggest
      so.<br>
      <br>
      During a recent behind-the-scenes interview he gave as part of the
      Brighteon Films Biosludged project – be sure to watch the official
      trailer for Biosludged at Brighteon.com – Monk explains how
      so-called “prions” are contaminating the food supply via
      biosolids, aka biosludge.<br>
      <br>
      One of the big issues in Texas where Monk lives is chronic wasting
      disease, a syndrome that afflicts deer and other wildlife. And
      according to Monk, Texas health and wildlife authorities have
      failed to make the connection between this disease and the
      biosludge to which many deer are being exposed.<br>
      <br>
      “If you think about it, right now in Texas chronic wasting disease
      of deer is, you don’t hear about it, but it’s at the top of the
      topics with the Texas Wildlife Department,” Monk explained during
      the interview.<br>
      <br>
      “In fact, they’re the ones handling chronic wasting disease. Well,
      chronic wasting disease is a form of prions … which is also in
      Alzheimer’s and many other diseases that affect the brain.”<br>
      <br>

      Brighteon.com below:<br>
      <br>
      Deadly prions are impervious to heat, chemicals, and all other
      known sterilization methods<br>
      <br>
      While prions aren’t technically viruses, they act like them. And
      even worse, prions are known to survive chemicals, heat, and other
      forms of sterilization that would otherwise kill normal pathogens
      – which makes prions perhaps the most serious problem associated
      with biosludge.<br>

      <br>
      Since they make their way right through wastewater treatment
      systems unscathed, prions are being spread all over food crops –
      where they not only contaminate the surfaces of fruits and
      vegetables, but also make their way inside the plants themselves.<br>
      <br>
      “So somebody’s contaminated and they use the restroom, and now
      it’s in sewage,” Monk explains about prions.<br>
      <br>
      “And it’s distributed back into the field, the cattle pick it up,
      it’s picked up in plants. There are studies that show that prions
      are picked up by plants, they make their way back into the food
      cycle, and they’re rolled out.”<br>
      <br>
      Further, the group Focus For Health published eye-opening research
      back in 2016 showing a direct connection between prions and
      Alzheimer’s disease.<br>
      <br>
      “The only thing stopping people from getting sick is the immune
      system,” says Monk. “So, you’ll see as people’s immune systems
      start to dwindle, you’ll see these diseases take over.”<br>
      <br>
      Research shows that prions are capable of surviving almost
      anything – which means if they’re present in wastewater, they’re
      also present in the biosludge that’s made from it. It also means
      that tens of millions of people are potentially being exposed to
      prions through the food supply, and they’re not even aware that it
      could be making them sick.<br>
      <br>
      “It’s unfortunate about our youth that they’re growing up in this
      contaminated world,” laments Monk. “It’s a fact that they are.
      There’s just not telling all it’s contaminating because they just
      won’t run tests on it.”<br>
      <br>
      “We know that there are chemicals in our tap water. They have run
      tests on that. There are hundreds of thousands of chemicals that
      they’ve found in tap water. So what are the chemicals that they’re
      not testing for? Are they in tap water as well? And where did
      these chemicals come from? Did it come from Joe Smith dumping his
      prescription in the lake? I don’t think so. It’s coming from
      sewage, from farms, from the sewage plant. The only way to fix
      something like this is a public outcry.”<br>

      <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">How
Space

          and Time Could Be a Quantum Error-Correcting Code</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">by Natalie Wolchover</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
      </div>
      <br>
      ...But qubits are maddeningly error-prone. The feeblest magnetic
      field or stray microwave pulse causes them to undergo “bit-flips”
      that switch their chances of being |0&#10217; and |1&#10217; relative to the
      other qubits, or “phase-flips” that invert the mathematical
      relationship between their two states. For quantum computers to
      work, scientists must find schemes for protecting information even
      when individual qubits get corrupted. What’s more, these schemes
      must detect and correct errors without directly measuring the
      qubits, since measurements collapse qubits’ coexisting
      possibilities into definite realities: plain old 0s or 1s that
      can’t sustain quantum computations.<br>
      <br>
      In 1995, Shor followed his factoring algorithm with another
      stunner: proof that “quantum error-correcting codes” exist...<br>
      <br>
      But in the dogged pursuit of these codes over the past
      quarter-century, a funny thing happened in 2014, when physicists
      found evidence of a deep connection between quantum error
      correction and the nature of space, time and gravity. In Albert
      Einstein’s general theory of relativity, gravity is defined as the
      fabric of space and time — or “space-time” — bending around
      massive objects. (A ball tossed into the air travels along a
      straight line through space-time, which itself bends back toward
      Earth.) But powerful as Einstein’s theory is, physicists believe
      gravity must have a deeper, quantum origin from which the
      semblance of a space-time fabric somehow emerges.<br>
      <br>
      That year — 2014 — three young quantum gravity researchers came to
      an astonishing realization. They were working in physicists’
      theoretical playground of choice: a toy universe called “anti-de
      Sitter space” that works like a hologram. The bendy fabric of
      space-time in the interior of the universe is a projection that
      emerges from entangled quantum particles living on its outer
      boundary. Ahmed Almheiri, Xi Dong and Daniel Harlow did
      calculations suggesting that this holographic “emergence” of
      space-time works just like a quantum error-correcting code. They
      conjectured in the Journal of High Energy Physics that space-time
      itself is a code — in anti-de Sitter (AdS) universes, at least.
      The paper has triggered a wave of activity in the quantum gravity
      community, and new quantum error-correcting codes have been
      discovered that capture more properties of space-time.<br>
      <br>
      John Preskill, a theoretical physicist at the California Institute
      of Technology, says quantum error correction explains how
      space-time achieves its “intrinsic robustness,” despite being
      woven out of fragile quantum stuff. “We’re not walking on
      eggshells to make sure we don’t make the geometry fall apart,”
      Preskill said. “I think this connection with quantum error
      correction is the deepest explanation we have for why that’s the
      case.”...<br>

      New York, NY, January 4, 2019. PubRelCo has been informed about
      the publication of the following important scientific paper
      providing experimental evidence by two U.S. spectroscopic
      laboratories on the existence of the negatively charged protons
      called pseudoprotons and negatively charged nuclei called
      pseudonuclei which are being developed by Sir Ruggero M. Santilli
      (see his Biographical Notes
      http://www.i-b-r.org/Dr-R-M-Santilli-Bio-1-10-18.pdf) as Chief
      Scientist of the U. S. public company Thunder Energies Corporation

      Mankind has been unable to achieve the controlled fusion at both
      low and high energies despite the investment of billions of
      dollars of public funds because nuclei are positively charged,
      thus experiencing a Coulomb repulsion that acquires astronomical
      values at the nuclear distance needed for the fusion (see Figure
      1).<br>
      <br>
      The importance of Dr. Santilli's discovery is that being
      negatively charged, pseudoprotons and pseudonuclei are attracted
      by nuclei, thus resolving the historical Coulomb barrier. In fact,
      pseudoproton irradiation caused the nuclear transmutation of
      selected light, stable and natural elements into light, stable and
      natural elements with a smaller atomic number, while pseudonuclei
      irradiation of selected elements causes basically novel nuclear
      fusion.<br>
      <br>
      In all cases, there is the emission of thermal energy without a
      release of neutrons or other harmful radiation or the release of
      radioactive waste. Subject to the necessary funding and time, the
      new energies are expected to be controllable via the control of
      the irradiation beams and other means within current technological
      capability (for details, see Dr. Santilli's interview <a

      <br>
      The experimental confirmation of the existence of the negatively
      charged pseudoprotons entirely composed of matter has confirmed
      doubts raised by various scientists on the claim by CERN, FERMILAB
      and other particle laboratories that they can produce antiprotons.
      Dr. Santilli suggests that particle physics laboratories should
      conduct various tests establishing the antimatter character of the
      claimed antiprotons. Interested scientists are suggested to
      participate in the ongoing debate in the field CERN Antiprotons or
      Santilli Pseudoprotons accessible in the website

      Just two years ago, the U.S. Embassy in Havana was bustling with
      U.S. personnel sent by the Obama Administration to restore
      diplomatic relations with Cuba. Today it is nearly empty. In late
      2016, diplomats started hearing a loud, piercing noise. Two dozen
      of them reported symptoms such as ear pain and dizziness, and were
      diagnosed with injuries consistent with a concussion. Suspicions
      of politically motivated "sonic attacks" soon followed. The U.S.
      State Department recalled most personnel from Cuba and reduced its
      embassy staff in Havana to a skeleton crew. Cooperative measures
      between the two governments stalled amidst conspiracy theories of
      high-tech attack. Despite ongoing investigations by American and
      Cuban government agencies, and extensive coverage of the study by
      major news outlets, the source of the strange noise provoking the
      crisis has remained an enigma.<br>
      <br>
      But a new study indicates that the culprit behind this debacle is
      in fact... a cricket. According to Alexander Stubbs, a scientist
      in the Department of Integrative Biology and Museum of Vertebrate
      Zoology at the University of California, Berkeley, the mysterious
      noise is actually the echoing call of the Indies short-tailed
      cricket (Anurogryllus celerinictus). Stubbs will present his
      findings this week at the 2019 Annual Meeting of the Society for
      Integrative and Comparative Biology in Tampa, Florida, based on a
      paper that was just released through the bioArxive online
      database...<br>

      <br>
      BIO 520™ is a liquid growth promoter used for agriculture,
      horticulture, viticulture, floriculture, aquaculture, hydroponics,
      livestock, poultry and home gardening. The product is a “game
      changer”, shielding crops from the uptake of harmful chemicals
      applied by growers during conventional grow practices or
      accumulated from decades of conventional use of chemical
      fertilizers, insecticides, fungicides and herbicides.<br>
      <br>
      The product delivers increased yields, and improved quality and
      safety of the food chain. BIO 520™ contains zero chemicals and
      enables plants to absorb greater amounts of nutrients. It also
      enables nitrogen fixation from the air and is simply diluted to
      irrigation water at 1 to 1,000 dilution.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">PRODUCT FEATURES &amp;
        PERFORMANCE</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Harvested crops of fruits and vegetables grown using BIO 520™ have
      been proven, in government-controlled labs, to contain zero
      chemical residues. BIO 520™ has also been proven to deliver
      improved animal health, reduced mortality and economic benefits
      for the livestock and poultry industries.<br>
      <br>
      Also,&nbsp; the ingredients of BIO 520™ generate a mild heat
      imparted by terahertz energy. This provides for extended,
      productive crop cycles and growth of crops at temperatures
      marginally&nbsp; below&nbsp; normal ranges. Substantially higher
      crop yields have been regularly achieved with staple food crops
      than previously possible when using&nbsp; conventional chemical or
      organic fertilizers.<br>
      <br>
      BIO 520™ is inorganic and contains zero chemicals. A complex of
      mineral contents provides nutrients, stimulates increased
      absorption and enhances plant growth. BIO 520™ has been
      successfully developed and extensively tested, both in the field
      and in laboratories over several years. BIO 520™ has dramatically
      improved crop yield, measured by weight.<br>
      <br>
      The photograph of sweet potatoes (top right) highlights the crop
      yield of an increase of 20 tons per 3-acre plot. Yield for various
      crops (measured by weight) from identical-sized plots and in
      identical soils&nbsp; increased between 50% and 200%.<br>
      <br>
      Tests over several years of development have included numerous
      greenhouse and outdoor food crops, including tomatoes, peppers,
      pumpkins, radishes, onions, tea and rice. Tests also measured BIO
      520’s positive impact on flowers, fruits and berries.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">MORE BIO 520™ CASE STUDY
        RESULTS…&nbsp; </span><br>
      Fruit and produce sizes (per unit) have substantially increased
      across a variety of plants; Increase in production measured by
      “fruit count” with cherry tomatoes, produced from identical-size
      plots, increased from 6,000 fruits to 26,000 fruits; Pumpkins are
      conventionally produced at a rate of 5 fruits per harvested growth
      area. With BIO 520™, the same growth area produced 40 fruits of
      conventional size; Carrots, grown for carrot juice, produced
      triple the amount of juice; Zehyantha flower petals grew to twice
      normal size and with more vivid color; Garlic: 6 pieces increased
      to 13 pieces, with garlic growth larger than normal; Mango trees
      produced their first crop in year 2 instead of year 3. Mold on
      leaves also disappeared shortly after surface spraying with BIO
      520™; Spinach yield increased by 200%;; Cannabis bud yield
      increased 126% with faster growth and zero chemical contaminants
      in the harvested crop.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BIO 520™ BRIEF OVERVIEW</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      This one-year double blind randomized control trial assessed the
      effects of nightly melatonin, strontium (citrate), vitamin D3 and
      vitamin K2 (MK7; MSDK) on bone mineral density (BMD) and quality
      of life (QOL) in postmenopausal osteopenic women (ages 49-75).
      Compared to placebo, MSDK treatment increased BMD in lumbar spine
      (4.3%) and left femoral neck (2.2%), with an upward trend for
      total left hip (p=0.069). MSDK increased serum P1NP levels and
      reduced bone turnover (CTx:P1NP). Psychometric analyses indicated
      that mood and sleep quality improved for the MSDK group.
      MSDK-exposed human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and human
      peripheral blood monocytes (hPBMCs) plated in transwells or
      layered demonstrated increases in osteoblastogenesis, decreases in
      osteoclastogenesis, increases in OPG (TNFRSF11B) and decreases in
      RANKL (TNFSF11) levels. In transwell osteoblasts, MSDK increased
      pERK1/2 (MAPK1/MAPK3) and RUNX2 levels; decreased ERK5 (MAPK7);
      and did not affect the expression of NF&#954;B (NFKB1) and &#946;1integrin
      (ITGB1). In layered osteoblasts, MSDK also decreased expression of
      the metabolic proteins PPAR&#947; (PPARG) and GLUT4 (SLC2A4). In
      adipose-derived human MSCs, MSDK induced osteoblastogenesis. These
      findings provide both clinical and mechanistic support for the use
      of MSDK for the prevention or treatment of osteopenia,
      osteoporosis or other bone-related diseases...<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;In this study, we investigated whether our treatment-
      melatonin, strontium (citrate), vitamin D3 and vitamin K2 (MSDK)
      could provide a much-needed stopgap treatment and serve as a safe
      and effective modulator of anabolic bone formation and metabolism
      to improve the efficacy of pre-osteoporosis prevention. In the
      Melatonin-micronutrients Osteopenia Treatment Study (MOTS;
      NCT01870115), we examined whether melatonin added in combination
      with three other natural bone-protective micronutrients: strontium
      (citrate), vitamins D3 and K2 (MSDK) could improve bone health
      without affecting or even improving health related quality of life
      (hrQOL) in postmenopausal osteopenic women. The second goal was to
      identify potential mechanisms underlying MSDK's action using human
      osteoblast and osteoclast co-culture models. Women with osteopenia
      were targeted because osteopenia accounts for the highest
      population burden of fractures [4, 10]. A nutritional bone support
      supplement formulated with MSDK could address this population
      group and become readily available without prescription at a
      nominal cost.<br>
      <br>
      Melatonin is a chronotherapeutic hormone and nutritional
      supplement that has demonstrated efficacy to renormalize bone
      marker turnover in perimenopausal women [11] and increase bone
      density in post-menopausal women with osteopenia [12]. Strontium
      increased vertebral and femoral bone density and reduced fracture
      in both postmenopausal osteopenic and osteoporotic women [13, 14].
      Vitamin K2 has been shown to prevent bone loss, reduce the
      incidence of vertebral fractures and modestly increase bone
      density in a postmenopausal cohort primarily by improving bone
      microarchitecture and the bone mineral/matrix ratio and also by
      preserving bone quality [15, 16]. Combination of vitamin D3 with
      K2 has been shown to increase vertebral bone density in
      postmenopausal women [17, 18]. Also, improved vitamin D3 status in
      postmeno-pausal women has been shown to significantly enhance BMD
      response to strontium ranelate, particularly in the femoral neck
      [19]. The Combination of Micronutrients for Bone (COMB) study,
      using strontium (citrate) and vitamins D3 and K2 was at least as
      effective as bisphosphonates and strontium ranelate at increasing
      BMD in the hip, spine and femoral neck sites [20].<br>
      <br>
      The MOTS utilizes a safe, complementary, non-pharmacologic
      combination therapy based on the hypothesis of chronosynergy -
      novel treatment approach using several condition-targeted bone
      restorative agents with melatonin to reverse bone loss reducing
      the need for osteoporosis-related medications later. In addition
      to improving bone health outcomes, this novel therapy may reduce
      the cost of treating bone disease. In a recent study, the
      introduction of melatonin into an osteoporosis treatment formulary
      resulted in significant savings with respect to annual treatment
      costs [21] lowering the economic burden associated with bone loss
      therapies. With continued study and validation, MSDK could become
      an early treatment option in the time-course for managing
      postmenopausal and age-related bone loss.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      Nutritional supplementation with probiotics can prevent pathologic
      bone loss. Here we examined the impact of supplementation with
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) on bone homeostasis in eugonadic
      young mice. Micro-computed tomography revealed that LGG increased
      trabecular bone volume in mice, which was due to increased bone
      formation. Butyrate produced in the gut following LGG ingestion,
      or butyrate fed directly to germ-free mice, induced the expansion
      of intestinal and bone marrow (BM) regulatory T (Treg) cells.
      Interaction of BM CD8+ T cells with Treg cells resulted in
      increased secretion of Wnt10b, a bone anabolic Wnt ligand.
      Mechanistically, Treg cells promoted the assembly of a NFAT1-SMAD3
      transcription complex in CD8+ cells, which drove expression of
      Wnt10b. Reducing Treg cell numbers, or reconstitution of TCR&#946;&#8722;/&#8722;
      mice with CD8+ T cells from Wnt10b&#8722;/&#8722; mice, prevented
      butyrate-induced bone formation and bone mass acquisition. Thus,
      butyrate concentrations regulate bone anabolism via Treg
      cell-mediated regulation of CD8+ T cell Wnt10b production.<br>

cave

          art reveals ancient use of complex astronomy </span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
      </div>
      <br>
      Some of the world's oldest cave paintings have revealed how
      ancient people had relatively advanced knowledge of astronomy.<br>
      <br>
      The artworks, at sites across Europe, are not simply depictions of
      wild animals, as was previously thought. Instead, the animal
      symbols represent star constellations in the night sky, and are
      used to represent dates and mark events such as comet strikes,
      analysis suggests.<br>
      <br>
      They reveal that, perhaps as far back as 40,000 years ago, humans
      kept track of time using knowledge of how the position of the
      stars slowly changes over thousands of years.<br>
      <br>
      The findings suggest that ancient people understood an effect
      caused by the gradual shift of Earth's rotational axis. Discovery
      of this phenomenon, called precession of the equinoxes, was
      previously credited to the ancient Greeks.<br>
      <br>
      Around the time that Neanderthals became extinct, and perhaps
      before mankind settled in Western Europe, people could define
      dates to within 250 years, the study shows.<br>
      <br>
      The findings indicate that the astronomical insights of ancient
      people were far greater than previously believed. Their knowledge
      may have aided navigation of the open seas, with implications for
      our understanding of prehistoric human migration.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers from the Universities of Edinburgh and Kent studied
      details of Palaeolithic and Neolithic art featuring animal symbols
      at sites in Turkey, Spain, France and Germany.<br>
      <br>
      They found all the sites used the same method of date-keeping
      based on sophisticated astronomy, even though the art was
      separated in time by tens of thousands of years.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers clarified earlier findings from a study of stone
      carvings at one of these sites - Gobekli Tepe in modern-day Turkey
      - which is interpreted as a memorial to a devastating comet strike
      around 11,000 BC. This strike was thought to have initiated a mini
      ice-age known as the Younger Dryas period.<br>
      <br>
      They also decoded what is probably the best known ancient artwork
      - the Lascaux Shaft Scene in France. The work, which features a
      dying man and several animals, may commemorate another comet
      strike around 15,200 BC, researchers suggest.<br>
      <br>
      The team confirmed their findings by comparing the age of many
      examples of cave art - known from chemically dating the paints
      used - with the positions of stars in ancient times as predicted
      by sophisticated software.<br>
      <br>
      The world's oldest sculpture, the Lion-Man of Hohlenstein-Stadel
      Cave, from 38,000 BC, was also found to conform to this ancient
      time-keeping system.<br>
      <br>
      This study was published in Athens Journal of History.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Martin Sweatman, of the University of Edinburgh's School of
      Engineering, who led the study, said: "Early cave art shows that
      people had advanced knowledge of the night sky within the last ice
      age. Intellectually, they were hardly any different to us today.<br>
      <br>
      "These findings support a theory of multiple comet impacts over
      the course of human development, and will probably revolutionise
      how prehistoric populations are seen." <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">ABOUT BIO 520™</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      BIO 520™ is a liquid growth promoter used for agriculture,
      horticulture, viticulture, floriculture, aquaculture, hydroponics,
      livestock, poultry and home gardening. The product is a “game
      changer”, shielding crops from the uptake of harmful chemicals
      applied by growers during conventional grow practices or
      accumulated from decades of conventional use of chemical
      fertilizers, insecticides, fungicides and herbicides.<br>
      <br>
      The product delivers increased yields, and improved quality and
      safety of the food chain. BIO 520™ contains zero chemicals and
      enables plants to absorb greater amounts of nutrients. It also
      enables nitrogen fixation from the air and is simply diluted to
      irrigation water at 1 to 1,000 dilution.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">PRODUCT FEATURES &amp;
        PERFORMANCE</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      Harvested crops of fruits and vegetables grown using BIO 520™ have
      been proven, in government-controlled labs, to contain zero
      chemical residues. BIO 520™ has also been proven to deliver
      improved animal health, reduced mortality and economic benefits
      for the livestock and poultry industries.<br>
      <br>
      Also,&nbsp; the ingredients of BIO 520™ generate a mild heat
      imparted by terahertz energy. This provides for extended,
      productive crop cycles and growth of crops at temperatures
      marginally&nbsp; below&nbsp; normal ranges. Substantially higher
      crop yields have been regularly achieved with staple food crops
      than previously possible when using&nbsp; conventional chemical or
      organic fertilizers.<br>
      <br>
      BIO 520™ is inorganic and contains zero chemicals. A complex of
      mineral contents provides nutrients, stimulates increased
      absorption and enhances plant growth. BIO 520™ has been
      successfully developed and extensively tested, both in the field
      and in laboratories over several years. BIO 520™ has dramatically
      improved crop yield, measured by weight.<br>
      <br>
      The photograph of sweet potatoes (top right) highlights the crop
      yield of an increase of 20 tons per 3-acre plot. Yield for various
      crops (measured by weight) from identical-sized plots and in
      identical soils&nbsp; increased between 50% and 200%.<br>
      <br>
      Tests over several years of development have included numerous
      greenhouse and outdoor food crops, including tomatoes, peppers,
      pumpkins, radishes, onions, tea and rice. Tests also measured BIO
      520’s positive impact on flowers, fruits and berries.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
        MORE BIO 520™ CASE STUDY RESULTS… </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      Fruit and produce sizes (per unit) have substantially increased
      across a variety of plants;<br>
      Increase in production measured by “fruit count” with cherry
      tomatoes, produced from identical-size plots, increased from 6,000
      fruits to 26,000 fruits;<br>
      Pumpkins are conventionally produced at a rate of 5 fruits per
      harvested growth area. With BIO 520™, the same growth area
      produced 40 fruits of conventional size;<br>
      Carrots, grown for carrot juice, produced triple the amount of
      juice;<br>
      Zehyantha flower petals grew to twice normal size and with more
      vivid color;<br>
      Garlic: 6 pieces increased to 13 pieces, with garlic growth larger
      than normal;<br>
      Mango trees produced their first crop in year 2 instead of year 3.
      Mold on leaves also disappeared shortly after surface spraying
      with BIO 520™;<br>
      Spinach yield increased by 200%;<br>
      Cannabis bud yield increased 126% with faster growth and zero
      chemical contaminants in the harvested crop.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BIO 520™ BRIEF OVERVIEW</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      (i) BIO 520™ has been developed by a team of scientists over a
      period of several years including extensive real-life cultivation
      and laboratory experimentation &amp; validation.<br>
      (ii) BIO 520™ is 100% mineral content. No chemicals. Harmless to
      all life. Safe for human consumption. The SDS defines the product
      as “a compound of water-soluble mineralized powders”.<br>
      (iii) Easy application. Simply dilute into irrigation water at 1
      to 1,000.<br>
      (iii) It has a 5 year shelf life<br>
      (iv) Faster growth of cannabis clones (4x faster, as measured by
      several growers), ultimately this shortens the grow cycle by 7 to
      10 days.<br>
      (v) Zero toxicity uptake. Proven in numerous post-harvest Lab
      Tests to barrier against toxic chemicals to “below scientifically
      detectable levels” for a range of toxins currently being
      prohibited by new safety regulations governing the cannabis
      industry.<br>
      (vi) BIO 520™ shields from the uptake of toxins into the plant but
      enables the natural development of THC’s, Terpenes and and CBD’s
      without changing the attributes of the original strain.<br>
      (vii) BIO 520™ yields a superior quality of “buds” in terms of
      their size, quantity, robustness, colors, end-taste etc. and
      safety.<br>
      (viii) BIO 520™ is proven to enable growth of crops at
      temperatures marginally below normal ranges.<br>

Valentina

          Zharkova: The Solar Magnet Field and the Terrestrial Climate</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
      </div>
      <br>
      Professor Valentina Zharkova gave a presentation of her Climate
      and the Solar Magnetic Field hypothesis at the Global Warming
      Policy Foundation in October, 2018. <br>
      <br>
      Principal component analysis (PCA) of the solar background
      magnetic field observed from the Earth, revealed four pairs of
      dynamo waves, the pair with the highest eigen values are called
      principal components (PCs).<br>
      <br>
      PCs are shown to be produced by magnetic dipoles in inner and
      outer layers of the Sun, while the second pair of waves is assumed
      produced by quadruple magnetic sources and so on. The PC waves
      produced by a magnetic dipole and their summary curve were
      described analytically and shown to be closely related to the
      average sunspot number index used for description of solar
      activity. Based on this correlation, the summary curve was used
      for the prediction of long-term solar activity on a millennial
      timescale. This prediction revealed the presence of a grand cycle
      of 350-400 years, with a remarkable resemblance to the sunspot and
      terrestrial activity features reported in the past millennia:
      Maunder (grand) Minimum (1645-1715), Wolf (grand) minimum (1200),
      Oort (grand) minimum (1010-1050), Homer (grand) minimum (800-900
      BC); the medieval (900-1200) warm period, Roman (400-10BC) and
      other warm periods.<br>
      <br>
      This approach also predicts the modern grand minimum upcoming in
      2020-2055. By utilising the two principal components of solar
      magnetic field oscillations and their summary curve, we
      extrapolate the solar activity backwards one hundred millennia and
      derive weaker oscillations with a period of 2000-2100years (a
      super-grand cycle) reflecting variations of magnetic field
      magnitude. The last super-grand minimum occurred during Maunder
      Minimum with magnetic field growing for 500 years (until ~2150)
      and decreasing for another 500 years. The most likely nature of
      this interaction will be discussed and used to explain long-term
      variations of solar magnetic field and irradiance observed from
      the Earth.<br>

      Video series 4, Part 1A is 40 minutes long. There is a part 1B
      that is also 40 minutes long. This video&nbsp; covers the most
      important information for anyone on this planet because I will
      fully explain what causes the ice ages and why they happen
      immediately after a geomagnetic reversal (Pole shift, polar
      reversal). The last time it happened was about 12,000 years age
      and it is estimated that only about 30 fertile females survived
      and all of us are related to one of them.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will cover the cause of the Ice Ages at
      the time of Geomagnetic Reversals. The earth does not flip over on
      itself. Only the magnetic field reverses. I will explain the
      mechanism that creates the ice age and ice fields. This
      information has never been taught before because government felt
      it was too disruptive to society. Even if you have a degree in
      geology, astronomy or other related field, you were deliberately
      never taught this information. You were taught alternate
      explanations for the phenomena. The research revealed the Greatest
      Secret the Country has and the CIAs Involvement how they kept the
      information concealed from the public. You are going to find out
      what event caused the government to engineer the concealment. I am
      going to give you the Education you were supposed to have gotten
      when you went to College. I am going to present this information
      unblemished and treat all of you like mature adults, but I warn
      you that this information will scare you and change your life. I
      present this information because I want some people to survive the

      Scientific Experiment. In this experiment it's noted that one half
      of an aluminum anodized copper globe is connected to an electrical
      wire in a DC current pole. At the center of the container there is
      an electrically isolated brass bolt from the container and
      connected to another pole of the DC current. At the base of the
      wooden support there is a large loudspeaker magnet that generates
      a magnetic attraction. Inside the container liquid mercury is
      poured in a weight of just over 1 Kg. When current flows through
      the two conductors, it generates a strong magnetic field that
      supports the system. This favorable condition rotates the liquid
      mercury as it's an electric conductive metal. This experiment is
      known as the "Lorentz Force". The operating voltage is 2V DC
      controlled by a DC inverter. The speed of rotation of mercury
      depends on the voltage being given. Increasing the tension the
      mercury takes off outside the bowl. *The system doesn't work in
      alternating current.<br>

      In this video I attempt to recreate a lost supermaterial called
      Starlite. This material could supposedly resist temperatures up to
      10,000 degrees Celsius, having undergone testing by NASA and the
      Atomic Weapons Establishment in the UK. I believe in this video I
      have come close in function to the original formula for Starlite,
      but there is still some work to be done. My result works very
      well, but for a few reasons I may talk about in a future video I
      do not believe Starlite used PVA glue as it's binder, and I also
      suspect a different CO2 producer was used instead of baking soda.
      More experiments are required...<br>

      <br>
      Travis Walton had one of the most famous and fascinating potential
      ET abduction experiences. It was documented in the movie Fire in
      the Sky. However, while the movie did portray much of the events
      surrounding the encounter accurately, the events onboard the
      spacecraft were completely fictional. What Travis really remembers
      is much more fascinating.<br>
      <br>
      Travis will be discussing how the world reacted to his experiences
      in the 70s and the large media attention it drew. He will discuss
      how the reaction has changed from then until now. He will also
      discuss the importance of credibility when it comes to UFO and
      paranormal experiences, and what he feels is the criteria for
      credible cases.<br>

      <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">New
method

          allows copper to be used as a precious metals type of catalyst</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
      </div>
      <br>
      A team of Chinese researchers have turned cheap copper into a new
      material “almost identical” to gold, according to a study
      published in peer-reviewed journal Science Advances on Saturday.<br>
      <br>
      The discovery will significantly reduce the use of rare, expensive
      metals in factories, said the authors.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Sun Jian and colleagues at the Dalian Institute of
      Chemical Physics, at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Liaoning,
      shot a copper target with a jet of hot, electrically charged argon
      gas.<br>
      <br>
      The fast-moving ionised particles blasted copper atoms off the
      target. The atoms cooled down and condensed on the surface of a
      collecting device, producing a thin layer of sand.<br>
      <br>
      Each grain of the sand had a diameter of only a few nanometres, or
      a thousandth of the size of a bacterium.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers put the material in a reaction chamber and used it
      as a catalyst to turn coal to alcohol, a sophisticated and
      difficult chemical process that only precious metals can handle
      efficiently.<br>
      <br>
      “The copper nano particles achieved catalytic performance
      extremely similar to that of gold or silver,” Sun and
      collaborators said in a statement posted on the academy’s website
      on Saturday.<br>
      <br>
      “The results … proved that after processing, metal copper can
      transform from ‘chicken’ to ‘phoenix’,” claimed Sun, who was not
      immediately available for comment.<br>
      <br>
      Copper has a similar weight and look to gold. For centuries it has
      attracted alchemists who saw it as a gateway to instant riches.<br>
      <br>
      The new material created by Sun’s lab cannot be used to make fake
      gold pennies. Its density remains the same as ordinary copper.<br>
      <br>
      But the process could prove lucrative and provide a significant
      boost for Chinese industries, according to the researchers.<br>

      boost for Chinese industries, according to the researchers.<br>
      <br>
      Precious metals remain central to modern economies. The components
      of electronic devices, for instance, contain a large amount of
      gold, silver and platinum.<br>
      <br>
      About 40 smartphones can contain as much gold as a tonne of ore,
      it has been estimated.<br>
      <br>
      Copper cannot function as well as gold in industrial applications,
      mainly because there are fewer electrons – subatomic particles
      with negative charge – buzzing around its nucleus.<br>
      <br>
      These electrons are also relatively unstable, so copper tends to
      react more easily when combining with other chemicals.<br>
      <br>
      The method developed by Sun’s team can inject a large amount of
      energy into copper atoms and made the electrons more dense and
      stable, they said.<br>
      <br>
      The new material can resist high temperatures, oxidisation and
      erosion, according to the researchers.<br>
      <br>
      It is “like a warrior with golden armour in a battlefield, capable
      of withstanding any enemy assault”, they said.<br>

copper

          behaves as noble metal in catalysis</span><br

      <br>
      As a non-noble metal, copper oxidizes more easily to a positive
      valence (Cu+ or Cu2+) than same-family elements Au or Ag. In
      general, this chemical property is mainly determined by electron
      structure. Can we change the chemical properties of an element by
      regulating its electron structure? Can Cu act as a noble metal in
      catalytic reactions?<br>
      <br>
      A team led by Dr. Sun Jian of the Dalian Institute of Chemical
      Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) gives a
      positive answer. The team's recently published paper in Science
      Advances shows that the electron structure of Cu can be changed,
      assisted by high energy plasma, making Cu exhibit significantly
      different catalytic behaviors than normal Cu in selective
      hydrogenation reactions.<br>
      <br>
      The dimethyl oxalate (DMO) hydrogenation reaction, a typical
      multistep catalytic reaction producing methyl glycolate (MG),
      ethylene glycol or ethanol, was selected as a probe reaction for
      copper. In this reaction, the common product over supported
      Cu/SiO2 catalysts is one of the latter two owing to the inevitable
      co-existence of Cu+ and Cu0 for deep hydrogenation.<br>
      <br>
      The sputtered (SP) Cu, which is bombarded by high energy argon
      plasma, can be "frozen" at zero valence when exposed to oxidation
      or reaction atmosphere at a very wide range of temperature,
      presenting noble-metal-like behaviors.<br>
      <br>
      In DMO hydrogenation, a high selectivity (87%) towards the
      preliminary hydrogenation product, MG, a high-value chemical, was
      observed. The molecule level free energy surface in various
      reaction pathways by DFT calculation also verifies that "frozen"
      Cu0 is crucial for preliminary hydrogenation.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      Skin has a remarkable ability to heal itself. But in some cases,
      wounds heal very slowly or not at all, putting a person at risk
      for chronic pain, infection and scarring. Now, researchers have
      developed a self-powered bandage that generates an electric field
      over an injury, dramatically reducing the healing time for skin
      wounds in rats. They report their results in ACS Nano.<br>
      <br>
      Chronic skin wounds include diabetic foot ulcers, venous ulcers
      and non-healing surgical wounds. Doctors have tried various
      approaches to help chronic wounds heal, including bandaging,
      dressing, exposure to oxygen and growth-factor therapy, but they
      often show limited effectiveness. As early as the 1960s,
      researchers observed that electrical stimulation could help skin
      wounds heal. However, the equipment for generating the electric
      field is often large and may require patient hospitalization.
      Weibo Cai, Xudong Wang and colleagues wanted to develop a
      flexible, self-powered bandage that could convert skin movements
      into a therapeutic electric field.<br>
      <br>
      To power their electric bandage, or e-bandage, the researchers
      made a wearable nanogenerator by overlapping sheets of
      polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), copper foil and polyethylene
      terephthalate (PET). The nanogenerator converted skin movements,
      which occur during normal activity or even breathing, into small
      electrical pulses. This current flowed to two working electrodes
      that were placed on either side of the skin wound to produce a
      weak electric field. The team tested the device by placing it over
      wounds on rats’ backs. Wounds covered by e-bandages closed within
      3 days, compared with 12 days for a control bandage with no
      electric field.&nbsp; The researchers attribute the faster wound
      healing to enhanced fibroblast migration, proliferation and
      differentiation induced by the electric field....<br>

      Skin wound healing is a major health care issue. While electric
      stimulations have been known for decades to be effective for
      facilitating skin wound recovery, practical applications are still
      largely limited by the clumsy electrical systems. Here, we report
      an efficient electrical bandage for accelerated skin wound
      healing. On the bandage, an alternating discrete electric field is
      generated by a wearable nanogenerator by converting mechanical
      displacement from skin movements into electricity. Rat studies
      demonstrated rapid closure of a full-thickness rectangular skin
      wound within 3 days as compared to 12 days of usual
      contraction-based healing processes in rodents. From in vitro
      studies, the accelerated skin wound healing was attributed to
      electric field-facilitated fibroblast migration, proliferation,
      and transdifferentiation. This self-powered electric-dressing
      modality could lead to a facile therapeutic strategy for
      nonhealing skin wound treatment.<br>

Use

          Magnetic Defects to Achieve Electromagnetic Wave Breakthrough</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
      </div>
      <br>
      Surfers spend much of their time watching long waves come onto the
      shoreline as they attempt to catch one right as it begins to curve
      and break. <br>
      <br>
      In a similar vein, scientists are working to create twisting
      helical electromagnetic waves whose curvature allows more accurate
      imaging of the magnetic properties of different materials at the
      atomic level and could possibly lead to the development of future
      devices.<br>
      <br>
      When scientists use electron beams to look at samples of
      materials, they have the ability to modify many different aspects
      of the electromagnetic waves that make up the beam. They can make
      the amplitude of the waves bigger or smaller, or make the waves
      faster or slower. However, until now there has been no easy way to
      transform a plane wave — like the long rolling waves out at sea —
      into a helical wave, like the ones that crash on shore.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “If we can see the magnetic moments of the
      material, we can build a description of the total magnetic
      properties of the material, and how the material will manifest its
      electronic and magnetic properties.” — C.D. Phatak, Argonne
      materials scientist<br>
      <br>
      In a new study from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne
      National Laboratory, scientists have created small regions of
      magnetic defects made from nanoscale magnetic islands assembled
      into a grid. The plane waves interact with these defects, thereby
      generating helical waves.<br>
      <br>
      “We’re looking for waves with a kind of perfect curl, and in order
      to generate the curl we need to give them something to crash into,
      which in our case are magnetic monopoles,” said Argonne materials
      scientist Charudatta (C.D.) Phatak.<br>
      <br>
      The reason scientists are so interested in helical waves is that
      they have a property called orbital angular momentum. Knowing the
      orbital angular momentum of an electron beam allows scientists to
      investigate the magnetic behavior of materials at an atomic level
      by determining an atomic property called the magnetic moment.<br>
      <br>
      “If we can see the magnetic moments of the material, we can build
      a description of the total magnetic properties of the material,
      and how the material will manifest its electronic and magnetic
      properties,” Phatak said.<br>
      <br>
      In this way, the refigured electron beam could be useful for
      studying materials in which spin and magnetization play a crucial
      role, potentially paving the way towards new forms of electronic
      devices.<br>
      <br>
      Having access to the information encoded by orbital angular
      momentum will also allow scientists to better understand the
      nuances of chiral materials, which have a kind of left- or
      right-handedness that determines their properties.<br>
      <br>
      The grid of defects can be inserted into any transmission electron
      microscope to provide a direct way of imaging the sample. “People
      usually don’t think about modifying the beam profile itself in
      this way,” Phatak said.<br>
      <br>
      In the next phase of the experiment, Phatak explained that the
      researchers may seek to replace the grids of magnetic islands with
      solenoids, or coils of wire that can act as electromagnets. Using
      solenoids would allow the creation of more precisely tuned
      magnetic defects. “Right now, because of the arrangement of the
      magnetic grid, we can only create defects with a cumulative
      magnetization of two or four, but solenoids would allow us to have
      a much broader range of magnetization states,” Phatak said...<br>

      All measurements are comparisons. The only physically accessible
      degrees of freedom (DOFs) are dimensionless ratios. The objective
      description of the universe as a whole thus predicts only how
      these ratios change collectively as one of them is changed. Here
      we develop a description for classical Bianchi IX cosmology
      implementing these relational principles. The objective evolution
      decouples from the volume and its expansion degree of freedom. We
      use the relational description to investigate both vacuum
      dominated and quiescent Bianchi IX cosmologies. In the vacuum
      dominated case the relational dynamical system predicts an
      infinite amount of change of the relational DOFs, in accordance
      with the well known chaotic behaviour of Bianchi IX. In the
      quiescent case the relational dynamical system evolves uniquely
      though the point where the decoupled scale DOFs predict the big
      bang/crunch. This is a non-trivial prediction of the relational
      description; the big bang/crunch is not the end of physics – it is
      instead a regular point of the relational evolution. Describing
      our solutions as spacetimes that satisfy Einstein's equations, we
      find that the relational dynamical system predicts two singular
      solutions of GR that are connected at the hypersurface of the
      singularity such that relational DOFs are continuous and the
      orientation of the spatial frame is inverted.<br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">By Brian Resnick</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
      </div>
      <br>
      The Stanford Prison Experiment, one of the most famous and
      compelling psychological studies of all time, told us a
      tantalizingly simple story about human nature.<br>
      <br>
      The study took paid participants and assigned them to be “inmates”
      or “guards” in a mock prison at Stanford University. Soon after
      the experiment began, the “guards” began mistreating the
      “prisoners,” implying evil is brought out by circumstance. The
      authors, in their conclusions, suggested innocent people, thrown
      into a situation where they have power over others, will begin to
      abuse that power. And people who are put into a situation where
      they are powerless will be driven to submission, even madness.<br>
      <br>
      The Stanford Prison Experiment has been included in many, many
      introductory psychology textbooks and is often cited uncritically.
      It’s the subject of movies, documentaries, books, television
      shows, and congressional testimony.<br>
      <br>
      But its findings were wrong. Very wrong. And not just due to its
      questionable ethics or lack of concrete data — but because of
      deceit. <br>
      <br>
      A new exposé published by Medium based on previously unpublished
      recordings of Philip Zimbardo, the Stanford psychologist who ran
      the study, and interviews with his participants, offers convincing
      evidence that the guards in the experiment were coached to be
      cruel. It also shows that the experiment’s most memorable moment —
      of a prisoner descending into a screaming fit, proclaiming, “I’m
      burning up inside!” — was the result of the prisoner acting. “I
      took it as a kind of an improv exercise,” one of the guards told
      reporter Ben Blum. “I believed that I was doing what the
      researchers wanted me to do.”<br>
      <br>
      The findings have long been subject to scrutiny — many think of
      them as more of a dramatic demonstration, a sort-of academic
      reality show, than a serious bit of science. But these new
      revelations incited an immediate response. “We must stop
      celebrating this work,” personality psychologist Simine Vazire
      tweeted, in response to the article. “It’s anti-scientific. Get it
      out of textbooks.” Many other psychologists have expressed similar
      sentiments. <br>
      <br>
      Many of the classic show-stopping experiments in psychology have
      lately turned out to be wrong, fraudulent, or outdated. And in
      recent years, social scientists have begun to reckon with the
      truth that their old work needs a redo, the “replication crisis.”
      But there’s been a lag — in the popular consciousness and in how
      psychology is taught by teachers and textbooks. It’s time to catch
      up.<br>
      Many classic findings in psychology have been reevaluated recently
      <br>
      <br>
      The Zimbardo prison experiment is not the only classic study that
      has been recently scrutinized, reevaluated, or outright exposed as
      a fraud. Recently, science journalist Gina Perry found that the
      infamous “Robbers Cave“ experiment in the 1950s — in which young
      boys at summer camp were essentially manipulated into joining
      warring factions — was a do-over from a failed previous version of
      an experiment, which the scientists never mentioned in an academic
      paper. That’s a glaring omission. It’s wrong to throw out data
      that refutes your hypothesis and only publicize data that supports
      it.<br>
      <br>
      Perry has also revealed inconsistencies in another major early
      work in psychology: the Milgram electroshock test, in which
      participants were told by an authority figure to deliver seemingly
      lethal doses of electricity to an unseen hapless soul. Her
      investigations show some evidence of researchers going off the
      study script and possibly coercing participants to deliver the
      desired results. (Somewhat ironically, the new revelations about
      the prison experiment also show the power an authority figure — in
      this case Zimbardo himself and his “warden” — has in manipulating
      others to be cruel.)<br>
      <br>
      Other studies have been reevaluated for more honest,
      methodological snafus. Recently, I wrote about the “marshmallow
      test,” a series of studies from the early ’90s that suggested the
      ability to delay gratification at a young age is correlated with
      success later in life. New research finds that if the original
      marshmallow test authors had a larger sample size, and greater
      research controls, their results would not have been the
      showstoppers they were in the ’90s. I can list so many more
      textbook psychology findings that have either not replicated, or
      are currently in the midst of a serious reevaluation.<br>
      <br>
      Like: <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Social priming: People who read “old”-sounding
      words (like “nursing home”) were more likely to walk slowly —
      showing how our brains can be subtly “primed” with thoughts and
      actions.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The facial feedback hypothesis: Merely
      activating muscles around the mouth caused people to become
      happier — demonstrating how our bodies tell our brains what
      emotions to feel.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stereotype threat: Minorities and maligned
      social groups don’t perform as well on tests due to anxieties
      about becoming a stereotype themselves.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ego depletion: The idea that willpower is a
      finite mental resource.<br>
      <br>
      Alas, the past few years have brought about a reckoning for these
      ideas and social psychology as a whole.<br>
      <br>
      Many psychological theories have been debunked or diminished in
      rigorous replication attempts. Psychologists are now realizing
      it's more likely that false positives will make it through to
      publication than inconclusive results. And they’ve realized that
      experimental methods commonly used just a few years ago aren’t
      rigorous enough. For instance, it used to be commonplace for
      scientists to publish experiments that sampled about 50
      undergraduate students. Today, scientists realize this is a recipe
      for false positives, and strive for sample sizes in the hundreds
      and ideally from a more representative subject pool. <br>

      Our “peer review” system of publishing research is clearly highly
      flawed. In less objective fields like psychology, past half of
      such published research has been shown to be not reproducible.
      Some of this research has been foundational to psychology, such as
      the famous Stanford Prison Experiment…despite the fame, it’s a
      fraud.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In medicine, we also have this problem,
      and even wide swaths of cancer research are probably fraudulent.
      Of course, I have a front row seat to how unpredictable cancer can
      be.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even hard sciences are obviously
      vulnerable, as shocking as that sounds. Today I’m looking at
      events at an electronics journal…surely peer review could check
      whether the research claims are valid? Perhaps not, but there’s
      something even more interesting here:<br>
      <br>
      Journal Retracts 29 Articles, Explaining Little<br>
      <br>
      Violations of policies on peer review are cited, without saying
      what the violations were.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, clearly they found a serious peer
      review policy violation here. If I were to conjecture, I would
      suppose that the “peers” reviewing the papers were a loaded bunch,
      possibly just one guy posing as a half dozen or more guys. That’s
      just a guess, and it doesn’t matter, the journal found violations
      and reacted appropriately.<br>
      <br>
      For now, the IEEE said that "three volunteer editors identified
      during the investigation as involved in the misconduct have been
      permanently excluded from IEEE membership.<br>
      <br>
      --IEEE is the organization which publishes the journal<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being a journal editor, a legitimate one,
      is a thankless job. Often you hire “assistant” journal editors to
      help with the work, for no pay (I’ve done this a few times). And
      so the game was fixed to get certain articles published with scant
      oversight. Fair enough.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But wait, there’s more:<br>
      <br>
      Inside Higher Ed asked IEEE a series of questions about which
      papers were retracted, which editors had been barred from working
      with the group, how they violated peer-review rules and whether
      the papers had flaws that had been identified or were being
      retracted solely because of problems with the peer-review process.
      IEEE declined to answer any of those questions.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seriously, they won’t say which articles
      have been un-published due to fraud? Should a scientist then play
      it safe by disregarding all articles in this journal?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This behavior raises many questions,
      questions unasked by the article I’m quoting from. Chief among
      them? WHY are they protecting the fraudulent editors? If they did
      the decent thing and revealed which articles are unpublished, it
      wouldn’t take much to backtrack to figure out who the associated
      editors are.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, we have a mysterious 29
      unpublished papers…already published in physical documents. Can’t
      tell you what they are, or course.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, ultimately, brings up the real
      problem in our journal and peer review process: lack of integrity.
      There is simply no way a journal with integrity would protect
      fraudsters, quite possibly allowing them to commit the same fraud
      at a different journal. These people committed a crime against
      hard science, and the journal will cover for them. Yeah, “why” is
      a fair question to ask, shame I’m alone in being curious why
      they’d do that.<br>

        Abstract<br>
      </span>Recent studies of the minute morphology of the skin by
      optical coherence tomography showed that the sweat ducts in human
      skin are helically shaped tubes, filled with a conductive aqueous
      solution. A computer simulation study of these structures in
      millimeter and submillimeter wave bands show that the human skin
      functions as an array of low-Q helical antennas. Experimental
      evidence is presented that the spectral response in the
      sub-Terahertz region is governed by the level of activity of the
      perspiration system. It is also correlated to physiological stress
      as manifested by the pulse rate and the systolic blood pressure.<br>

      </span>Each household, and in many cases each electrical device,
      will be equipped with a neutrino energy converter (a so-called
      "Neutrino Power Cube") that is capable of fully powering the
      respective application. The Neutrino Energy Group is currently
      working on the development of such devices.<br>
      But how exactly will it be possible to convert the kinetic energy
      of neutrinos into electrical energy that can power a device? The
      secret lies in the geometry of a special construction and the
      vibrations created when neutrinos strike it: Layers of silicon and
      carbon are applied with amazing precision to a metallic substrate
      in accordance with an ingenious design (the real "Da Vinci Code")
      so that the impact of the neutrinos upon them results in
      resonance. In a world of physics and technology, the concept of
      resonance refers to the increased vibration of a vibrating system
      when said system is subject to temporally variable impact. Once
      the process has been set in motion, resonance can even lead to
      stronger vibrations than those caused by the impact itself,
      assuming, of course, that one has taken the relevant geometrical
      principles into account. Our scientists have finally succeeded in
      making use of this geometry for the construction of these
      specially coated resonating substrates so that they are actually
      able to translate the periodic impact frequency of neutrinos into
      a resonating frequency on an electrical conductor. The patent for
      this design bears the number WO2016142056 A1, 7.03.2016 and
      belongs to Neutrino Deutschland GmbH. This technology is the
      foundation for the energy of the future.==<br>

      This one-year double blind randomized control trial assessed the
      effects of nightly melatonin, strontium (citrate), vitamin D3 and
      vitamin K2 (MK7; MSDK) on bone mineral density (BMD) and quality
      of life (QOL) in postmenopausal osteopenic women (ages 49-75).
      Compared to placebo, MSDK treatment increased BMD in lumbar spine
      (4.3%) and left femoral neck (2.2%), with an upward trend for
      total left hip (p=0.069). MSDK increased serum P1NP levels and
      reduced bone turnover (CTx:P1NP). Psychometric analyses indicated
      that mood and sleep quality improved for the MSDK group.
      MSDK-exposed human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and human
      peripheral blood monocytes (hPBMCs) plated in transwells or
      layered demonstrated increases in osteoblastogenesis, decreases in
      osteoclastogenesis, increases in OPG (TNFRSF11B) and decreases in
      RANKL (TNFSF11) levels. In transwell osteoblasts, MSDK increased
      pERK1/2 (MAPK1/MAPK3) and RUNX2 levels; decreased ERK5 (MAPK7);
      and did not affect the expression of NF&#954;B (NFKB1) and &#946;1integrin
      (ITGB1). In layered osteoblasts, MSDK also decreased expression of
      the metabolic proteins PPAR&#947; (PPARG) and GLUT4 (SLC2A4). In
      adipose-derived human MSCs, MSDK induced osteoblastogenesis. These
      findings provide both clinical and mechanistic support for the use
      of MSDK for the prevention or treatment of osteopenia,
      osteoporosis or other bone-related diseases...<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;In this study, we investigated whether our treatment-
      melatonin, strontium (citrate), vitamin D3 and vitamin K2 (MSDK)
      could provide a much-needed stopgap treatment and serve as a safe
      and effective modulator of anabolic bone formation and metabolism
      to improve the efficacy of pre-osteoporosis prevention. In the
      Melatonin-micronutrients Osteopenia Treatment Study (MOTS;
      NCT01870115), we examined whether melatonin added in combination
      with three other natural bone-protective micronutrients: strontium
      (citrate), vitamins D3 and K2 (MSDK) could improve bone health
      without affecting or even improving health related quality of life
      (hrQOL) in postmenopausal osteopenic women. The second goal was to
      identify potential mechanisms underlying MSDK's action using human
      osteoblast and osteoclast co-culture models. Women with osteopenia
      were targeted because osteopenia accounts for the highest
      population burden of fractures [4, 10]. A nutritional bone support
      supplement formulated with MSDK could address this population
      group and become readily available without prescription at a
      nominal cost.<br>
      <br>
      Melatonin is a chronotherapeutic hormone and nutritional
      supplement that has demonstrated efficacy to renormalize bone
      marker turnover in perimenopausal women [11] and increase bone
      density in post-menopausal women with osteopenia [12]. Strontium
      increased vertebral and femoral bone density and reduced fracture
      in both postmenopausal osteopenic and osteoporotic women [13, 14].
      Vitamin K2 has been shown to prevent bone loss, reduce the
      incidence of vertebral fractures and modestly increase bone
      density in a postmenopausal cohort primarily by improving bone
      microarchitecture and the bone mineral/matrix ratio and also by
      preserving bone quality [15, 16]. Combination of vitamin D3 with
      K2 has been shown to increase vertebral bone density in
      postmenopausal women [17, 18]. Also, improved vitamin D3 status in
      postmeno-pausal women has been shown to significantly enhance BMD
      response to strontium ranelate, particularly in the femoral neck
      [19]. The Combination of Micronutrients for Bone (COMB) study,
      using strontium (citrate) and vitamins D3 and K2 was at least as
      effective as bisphosphonates and strontium ranelate at increasing
      BMD in the hip, spine and femoral neck sites [20].<br>
      <br>
      The MOTS utilizes a safe, complementary, non-pharmacologic
      combination therapy based on the hypothesis of chronosynergy -
      novel treatment approach using several condition-targeted bone
      restorative agents with melatonin to reverse bone loss reducing
      the need for osteoporosis-related medications later. In addition
      to improving bone health outcomes, this novel therapy may reduce
      the cost of treating bone disease. In a recent study, the
      introduction of melatonin into an osteoporosis treatment formulary
      resulted in significant savings with respect to annual treatment
      costs [21] lowering the economic burden associated with bone loss
      therapies. With continued study and validation, MSDK could become
      an early treatment option in the time-course for managing
      postmenopausal and age-related bone loss.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Summary</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      Nutritional supplementation with probiotics can prevent pathologic
      bone loss. Here we examined the impact of supplementation with
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) on bone homeostasis in eugonadic
      young mice. Micro-computed tomography revealed that LGG increased
      trabecular bone volume in mice, which was due to increased bone
      formation. Butyrate produced in the gut following LGG ingestion,
      or butyrate fed directly to germ-free mice, induced the expansion
      of intestinal and bone marrow (BM) regulatory T (Treg) cells.
      Interaction of BM CD8+ T cells with Treg cells resulted in
      increased secretion of Wnt10b, a bone anabolic Wnt ligand.
      Mechanistically, Treg cells promoted the assembly of a NFAT1-SMAD3
      transcription complex in CD8+ cells, which drove expression of
      Wnt10b. Reducing Treg cell numbers, or reconstitution of TCR&#946;&#8722;/&#8722;
      mice with CD8+ T cells from Wnt10b&#8722;/&#8722; mice, prevented
      butyrate-induced bone formation and bone mass acquisition. Thus,
      butyrate concentrations regulate bone anabolism via Treg

cave

          art reveals ancient use of complex astronomy </span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
      </div>
      <br>
      Some of the world's oldest cave paintings have revealed how
      ancient people had relatively advanced knowledge of astronomy.<br>
      <br>
      The artworks, at sites across Europe, are not simply depictions of
      wild animals, as was previously thought. Instead, the animal
      symbols represent star constellations in the night sky, and are
      used to represent dates and mark events such as comet strikes,
      analysis suggests.<br>
      <br>
      They reveal that, perhaps as far back as 40,000 years ago, humans
      kept track of time using knowledge of how the position of the
      stars slowly changes over thousands of years.<br>
      <br>
      The findings suggest that ancient people understood an effect
      caused by the gradual shift of Earth's rotational axis. Discovery
      of this phenomenon, called precession of the equinoxes, was
      previously credited to the ancient Greeks.<br>
      <br>
      Around the time that Neanderthals became extinct, and perhaps
      before mankind settled in Western Europe, people could define
      dates to within 250 years, the study shows.<br>
      <br>
      The findings indicate that the astronomical insights of ancient
      people were far greater than previously believed. Their knowledge
      may have aided navigation of the open seas, with implications for
      our understanding of prehistoric human migration.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers from the Universities of Edinburgh and Kent studied
      details of Palaeolithic and Neolithic art featuring animal symbols
      at sites in Turkey, Spain, France and Germany.<br>
      <br>
      They found all the sites used the same method of date-keeping
      based on sophisticated astronomy, even though the art was
      separated in time by tens of thousands of years.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers clarified earlier findings from a study of stone
      carvings at one of these sites - Gobekli Tepe in modern-day Turkey
      - which is interpreted as a memorial to a devastating comet strike
      around 11,000 BC. This strike was thought to have initiated a mini
      ice-age known as the Younger Dryas period.<br>
      <br>
      They also decoded what is probably the best known ancient artwork
      - the Lascaux Shaft Scene in France. The work, which features a
      dying man and several animals, may commemorate another comet
      strike around 15,200 BC, researchers suggest.<br>
      <br>
      The team confirmed their findings by comparing the age of many
      examples of cave art - known from chemically dating the paints
      used - with the positions of stars in ancient times as predicted
      by sophisticated software.<br>
      <br>
      The world's oldest sculpture, the Lion-Man of Hohlenstein-Stadel
      Cave, from 38,000 BC, was also found to conform to this ancient
      time-keeping system.<br>
      <br>
      This study was published in Athens Journal of History.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Martin Sweatman, of the University of Edinburgh's School of
      Engineering, who led the study, said: "Early cave art shows that
      people had advanced knowledge of the night sky within the last ice
      age. Intellectually, they were hardly any different to us today.<br>
      <br>
      "These findings support a theory of multiple comet impacts over
      the course of human development, and will probably revolutionise
      how prehistoric populations are seen." <br>

      Wishing someone ‘Merry Christmas’ worse than murder for Muslims,
      says Canadian cleric <br>
      <br>
      "Muslims should be offended when people worship Jesus as a god,
      and wishing someone a “Merry Christmas” is a worse sin than
      murder", a Canadian Islamic cleric has said during a sermon.<br>
      <br>
      Sheik Younus Kathrada was preaching to the Muslim Youth of
      Victoria in British Columbia ahead of Christmas when he said that
      congratulating non-Muslims on their holidays means approving them.<br>
      <br>
      “If a person were to commit every major sin – committing adultery,
      dealing with interest, lying, murder… If a person were to do all
      of those major sins, they are nothing compared to the sin of
      congratulating and greeting the non-Muslims on their false
      festivals,” Kathrada said, according to the video posted on the
      organization’s YouTube page.<br>
      <br>
      He later added that “this doesn't mean that we treat the
      non-Muslims in a bad way or that we deal with them unjustly. I’m
      not saying, and I’ve never said, go out and just kill them, and do
      this to them… No!”<br>

      Danish authorities have concluded that the situation in some parts
      of Somalia is safe, and that Somalis no longer have valid grounds
      for asylum.<br>
      <br>
      Following a review of the situation in Somalia, which began in
      2017, residence permits will therefore be withdrawn for no less
      than 1,000 Somalis. “It is time for them to go home now,” Denmark
      states.<br>
      <br>
      “If you no longer need our protection and your life and your
      health are no longer at risk in your homeland, you must of course
      return home and build up your country of origin”, says Minister
      for Migration Inger Støjberg, according to DR...<br>
