                    </b><b>Background:</b> Live oral rotavirus vaccines
                    have been less immunogenic and efficacious among
                    children in poor developing countries compared with
                    middle income and industrialized countries for
                    reasons that are not yet completely understood. We
                    assessed whether the neutralizing activity of breast
                    milk could lower the titer of vaccine virus and
                    explain this difference in vitro.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Methods:</b> Breast milk samples were collected
                    from mothers who were breast-feeding infants 4 to 29
                    weeks of age (ie, vaccine eligible age) in India (N
                    = 40), Vietnam (N = 77), South Korea (N = 34), and
                    the United States (N = 51). We examined breast milk
                    for rotavirus-specific IgA and neutralizing activity
                    against 3 rotavirus vaccine strains-RV1, RV5 G1, and
                    116E using enzyme immunoassays. The inhibitory
                    effect of breast milk on RV1 was further examined by
                    a plaque reduction assay.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Findings:</b> Breast milk from Indian women had
                    the highest IgA and neutralizing titers against all
                    3 vaccine strains, while lower but comparable median
                    IgA and neutralizing titers were detected in breast
                    milk from Korean and Vietnamese women, and the
                    lowest titers were seen in American women.
                    Neutralizing activity was greatest against the 2
                    vaccine strains of human origin, RV1 and 116E. This
                    neutralizing activity in one half of the breast milk
                    specimens from Indian women could reduce the
                    effective titer of RV1 by &#8764;2 logs, of 116E by 1.5
                    logs, and RV5 G1 strain by &#8764;1 log more than that of
                    breast milk from American women.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Interpretation:</b> The lower immunogenicity and
                    efficacy of rotavirus vaccines in poor developing
                    countries could be explained, in part, by higher
                    titers of IgA and neutralizing activity in breast
                    milk consumed by their infants at the time of
                    immunization that could effectively reduce the
                    potency of the vaccine. Strategies to overcome this
                    negative effect, such as delaying breast-feeding at
                    the time of immunization, should be evaluated.<br>

                    </b>Two spaced electrodes having a load in an
                    external circuit connected between them are disposed
                    in an electrically conductive liquid, and energy is
                    imparted to the liquid in such manner that energized
                    free electrons in the liquid excite free electrons
                    which flow into one electrode to a greater degree
                    than in the other electrode, thereby causing
                    electric current to flow in the external circuit

                    microchip all U.S. citizens and enforce REAL ID acts
                    (put into place via the Patriot Act, post 9/11).

                    Members of the Brazilian parliament decided to
                    confirm suspicions and break into a hospital that
                    claimed to have 5,000 infected &amp; 200 deaths from
                    COVID-19, and found that the hospital had grossly
                    over-represented the cases and its claims. There was
                    in fact not a single person, they report, and the
                    hospital was entirely empty and was obviously still
                    under construction....<br>
                    <br>
                    What was more shocking still was the decision to
                    open the coffins supposedly awaiting transport to be
                    buried, of coronavirus victims. Opening the coffins,
                    the MP’s were shocked, but not surprised, when they
                    were found to be empty.<br>

                    “the American Empire”. Over the last decade of

                    shaping past and present events that altered
                    history, the hand of British Intelligence just kept
                    slapping me squarely in the face at nearly every
                    turn.<br>
                    <br>
                    Who controlled the dodgy Steele dossier that put
                    Russiagate into motion and nearly overthrew
                    President Trump? British Intelligence.<br>
                    <br>
                    How about the intelligence used to justify the
                    bombing of Iraq? That was British Intelligence too.<br>
                    <br>
                    How about the Clash of Civilizations strategy used
                    to blow up the middle east over decades? That just
                    so happened to be British Intelligence’s own Sir
                    Bernard Lewis.<br>
                    <br>
                    How about the CFR takeover over of American foreign
                    policy during the 20th century? That is the British
                    Roundtable Movement in America (created as Britain’s
                    Chatham House in America in 1921).<br>

                    own State Department at a May 10, 1981 Chatham House
                    seminar? The British Foreign Office (1).<br>
                    <br>
                    How about William Yandall Elliot who trained a
                    generation of neocon strategists who took over
                    American foreign policy after the murder of JFK?
                    Well, he was a Rhodes Scholar and we know what they
                    are zombified to do.<br>
                    <br>
                    How about the financial empire running the world
                    drug trade? Well HSBC is the proven leading agency
                    of that game and the British Caymen islands is the
                    known center of world offshore drug money
                    laundering.<br>

                    intelligence agencies?) The British.<br>

                        I’ve said from day one.. “wait until they make a

                        will see a true and honest death spike”. And
                        they’re talking between 2-4 vaccinations per
                        person for every person on earth. For me? I’ll
                        take the armor of God. It’s sure getting like
                        the times of Noah…I’m 73 and have only had one
                        flu shot in my life but that was so long ago I
                        can’t remember. On the other hand my wife took

                        In an interview with Bill Gates’ wife, she was
                        asked who should be vaccinated first she stated
                        that black Americans should be first because
                        covid supposedly is effecting their community
                        the most. She said the elderly is also a
                        priority.<br>
                        <br>
                        Yeah they know it.. That’s the whole idea behind
                        it, population reduction. Without trying to
                        sound to conspiratorial, but Ai isn’t what
                        people think, it is the same entities that
                        caused Noah’s flood. You can disbelieve God all
                        you want, but these things want to kill us, all
                        of us and we can’t defeat them as mortals...<br>
                        <br>
                        Last time the Bolchewiks killed ~120 millions.
                        Today they have 5G and 5G’s 60 GHz. This time
                        they plan to kill at least 500 million in the
                        first round, if you add all up....<br>

                        Yesterday:<br>
                        “You must understand, the leading Bolsheviks who
                        took over Russia were not Russians. They hated
                        Russians. They hated Christians. Driven by
                        ethnic hatred they tortured and slaughtered
                        millions of Russians without a shred of human
                        remorse. It cannot be overstated. Bolshevism
                        committed the greatest human slaughter of all
                        time. The fact that most of the world is
                        ignorant and uncaring about this enormous crime
                        is proof that the global media is in the hands
                        of the perpetrators.” -— Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn

                        a cheap and widely used steroid, has become the
                        first drug shown to be able to save lives among
                        Covid-19 patients in what scientists hailed as a
                        “major breakthrough”.<br>
                        <br>
                        Results of trials announced on Tuesday showed
                        dexamethasone, which is used to reduce
                        inflammation in other diseases, reduced death
                        rates by around a third among the most severely
                        ill Covid-19 patients admitted to hospital.<br>
                        <br>
                        The results suggest the drug should immediately
                        become standard care in patients with severe
                        cases of the pandemic disease, said the
                        researchers who led the trials.<br>
                        <br>
                        “This is a result that shows that if patients
                        who have Covid-19 and are on ventilators or are
                        on oxygen are given dexamethasone, it will save
                        lives, and it will do so at a remarkably low
                        cost,” said Martin Landray, an Oxford University
                        professor co-leading the trial, known as the
                        RECOVERY trial...<br>
                        <br>
                        LAST Friday, hard on the heels of the retraction
                        by The Lancet of its now-notorious paper
                        purporting to show that hydroxychloroquine not
                        only did not help Covid-19 patients, but
                        actually made them worse, came the termination
                        of the hydroxychloroquine ‘arm’ of the UK’s
                        RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVid-19
                        thERapY) clinical trials. A huge embarrassment
                        was conveniently overlain by news from Oxford
                        University that sorry, hydroxychloroquine really
                        isn’t any good. So even if The Lancet paper was
                        fake, ‘a political hit job’ as one American
                        doctor had it, Oxford’s clinical trial showed
                        the same result.</font></font></font><b><font

                        Professor Martin Landray, MB ChB, PhD, FRCP,
                        FHEA, FASN, FBPhS, FESC, Professor of Medicine
                        and Epidemiology at Oxford, and deputy chief
                        investigator of the RECOVERY trial, was
                        interviewed by the increasingly astute France
                        Soir. It began well: the trial termination was
                        triggered by a request from the Medicines and
                        Healthcare products Regulatory Agency who were
                        bothered about safety (reasons not explained).
                        In consequence the study was ‘unblinded’, that
                        is, results were revealed. Finding no
                        significant difference between treated and
                        untreated patients, they called off the trial,
                        with Oxford triumphantly announcing that
                        hydroxychloroquine was no good for Covid-19, at
                        least for hospitalised patients.<br>
                        <br>
                        Since those following the issue already knew
                        that no anti-viral was likely to help very sick
                        late-stage Covid-19 patients, this wasn’t news.
                        The trial design had already been savaged within
                        days of launch; the results were no surprise.
                        Internet sleuths also got to work on the very
                        heavy doses of the drug that were given – 2400
                        mg in the first 24 hours, a ‘dose fit for a
                        gorilla’ as one critic had it. Quizzed about
                        this, Landray defended the dosage, twice, as
                        being usual for other diseases such as amoebic
                        dysentery. Say again? Hydroxychloroquine is used
                        for lupus and arthritis as well as malaria, but
                        dysentery? As a footnote in medical history, the
                        older chloroquine was used half a century ago in
                        attempts to control dysentery, but Professor
                        Christian Perronne, head of infectious diseases
                        at Garches, France, told France Soir that it had
                        been abandoned before 1976. Was Landray
                        confusing hydroxychloroquine with the
                        hydroxyquinolines, which are used for dysentery?
                        Perhaps all those post-nominals had induced some
                        medical dyslexia...<br>

                        did not believe hospitals were being honest
                        about Corona, had people break into one that
                        claimed to have 5, 000 CORONA patients and the
                        place was empty.<br>
                        Five members of the Brazilian parlaiment went to
                        hospitals under the orders of Bolsonaro to
                        conduct surprise audits and confirm the number
                        of patients there. One hospital claimed to have
                        5, 000 people with Coronavirus along with 200
                        dead. When the officials audited it, they
                        discovered it was not even fully constructed yet
                        and had no patients of any sort, let alone
                        Corona.<br>
                        <br>
                        The same trend happened at other hospitals that
                        were completed. Though they had patients, there
                        were few, if any, with coronavirus while the
                        hospitals were claiming huge numbers.<br>
                        <br>
                        The hospitals are guilty of embezzlement and
                        defrauding the Brazilian government, while
                        attempting to destroy Brazil with a fraud and
                        forced vaccination scheme.<br>
                        <br>
                        This same fraud is playing out in American
                        hospitals to an even greater scale now - taken
                        to such an extent that whistle blowing nurses
                        are stating the hospitals are killing people on
                        purpose to get the death stats to actionable
                        levels. Coronavirus is likely the greatest scam
                        perpetrated in the history of mankind.<br>
                        <br>
                        You will NOT hear about this in America's scam
                        MSM, but for A limited time only there's a

                        angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)

                        acute-onset diabetes have been reported among
                        patients with SARS coronavirus 1 pneumonia than
                        among those with non-SARS pneumonia.5<br>
                        <br>
                        In the aggregate, these observations provide
                        support for the hypothesis of a potential
                        diabetogenic effect of Covid-19, beyond the
                        well-recognized stress response associated with
                        severe illness. However, whether the alterations
                        of glucose metabolism that occur with a sudden
                        onset in severe Covid-19 persist or remit when
                        the infection resolves is unclear. How frequent
                        is the phenomenon of new-onset diabetes, and is
                        it classic type 1 or type 2 diabetes or a new
                        type of diabetes? Do these patients remain at
                        higher risk for diabetes or diabetic
                        ketoacidosis? In patients with preexisting
                        diabetes, does Covid-19 change the underlying
                        pathophysiology and the natural history of the
                        disease? Answering these questions in order to
                        inform the immediate clinical care, follow-up,
                        and monitoring of affected patients is a
                        priority...<br>

                        health problem affecting more than 40% of US
                        adults and 13% of the global population.
                        Anti-obesity treatments including diet,
                        exercise, surgery and pharmacotherapies have so
                        far failed to reverse obesity incidence. Herein,
                        we target obesity with a pharmacotherapeutic
                        approach that decreases caloric efficiency by
                        mitochondrial uncoupling. We show that a
                        recently identified mitochondrial uncoupler
                        BAM15 is orally bioavailable, increases nutrient
                        oxidation, and decreases body fat mass without
                        altering food intake, lean body mass, body
                        temperature, or biochemical and haematological
                        markers of toxicity. BAM15 decreases hepatic
                        fat, decreases inflammatory lipids, and has
                        strong antioxidant effects.
                        Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies show
                        that BAM15 improves insulin sensitivity in
                        multiple tissue types. Collectively, these data
                        demonstrate that pharmacologic mitochondrial
                        uncoupling with BAM15 has powerful anti-obesity
                        and insulin sensitizing effects without
                        compromising lean mass or affecting food intake.<br>

                        allowed her to report as an employee, including
                        statistics contradicting Florida's official
                        coronavirus numbers and the push to reopen the

                        "We weren't allowed to really draw attention to
                        deaths, which is why I added hospitalizations
                        and deaths, which use something we buried in a
                        PDF but never showed on our dashboard," Jones
                        told the Post. "So people can bring the humanity
                        aspect of this to the forefront."<br>
                        <br>
                        Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' (R) claims Jones was
                        fired for refusing to "listen to the people who
                        were her superiors." Either way, her numbers are
                        starkly different than what is being reported by
                        the Florida Health Department. "On Friday,
                        Jones' website counted 75,897 people with
                        coronavirus infections in Florida," reports The
                        Washington Post, "while the state site tallied
                        70,971." Additionally, Jones' website claims the
                        Health Department has tested about 30 percent
                        fewer people than the 1.3 million it claims to
                        have screened. "If Florida is indeed
                        misreporting how many people have been tested,
                        it makes the health situation in Florida look
                        better than it is," The Palm Beach Post notes.<br>
                        <br>
                        The Washington Post explains that Jones'
                        positive tests are higher in part because her
                        total also includes people who've tested
                        positive for antibodies, which are the factor
                        that indicate that the virus has been in a
                        person's system. Antibody testing, however, can
                        have more false positive results than regular
                        virus tests. Visit Jones' dashboard here, and
                        compare with the state's here. <br>

                        and synthesis of artificial materials that mimic
                        the structures, mechanical properties, and
                        ultimately functionalities of biological cells
                        remains a current holy grail of materials
                        science. Here, based on a silica cell
                        bioreplication approach, we report the design
                        and construction of synthetic rebuilt red blood
                        cells (RRBCs) that fully mimic the broad
                        properties of native RBCs: size, biconcave
                        shape, deformability, oxygen-carrying capacity,
                        and long circulation time. Four successive
                        nanoscale processing steps (RBC bioreplication,
                        layer-by-layer polymer deposition, and precision
                        silica etching, followed by RBC ghost membrane
                        vesicle fusion) are employed for RRBC
                        construction. A panel of physicochemical
                        analyses including zeta-potential measurement,
                        fluorescence microscopy, and antibody-mediated
                        agglutination assay proved the recapitulation of
                        RBC shape, size, and membrane structure.
                        Flow-based deformation studies carried out in a
                        microfluidic blood capillary model confirmed the
                        ability of RRBCs to deform and pass through
                        small slits and reconstitute themselves in a
                        manner comparable to native RBCs. Circulation
                        studies of RRBCs conducted ex ovo in a chick
                        embryo and in vivo in a mouse model demonstrated
                        the requirement of both deformability and native
                        cell membrane surface to achieve long-term
                        circulation. To confer additional non-native
                        functionalities to RRBCs, we developed modular
                        procedures with which to load functional cargos
                        such as hemoglobin, drugs, magnetic
                        nanoparticles, and ATP biosensors within the
                        RRBC interior to enable various functions,
                        including oxygen delivery, therapeutic drug
                        delivery, magnetic manipulation, and toxin
                        biosensing and detection. Taken together, RRBCs
                        represent a class of long-circulating
                        RBC-inspired artificial hybrid materials with a
                        broad range of potential applications.</font></font></font><b><font

                        ...In an interview with Country Rosatom, the
                        agency's newsletter, Goverdovsky said physicists
                        at the Institute of Physics and Power
                        Engineering (IPPE) are currently developing
                        methods to combat viruses, including SARS-CoV-2,
                        which causes COVID-19. He said they have called
                        the project "luminous gas."<br>
                        <br>
                        "So far, no one has managed to hold UV
                        disinfection inside a person," he said. "We
                        figured out how to do this. We select molecules
                        and gas components that when inhaled remain
                        activated and emit ultraviolet light directly in
                        the lungs. We hope that in addition to
                        coronavirus, our method [can be used to] treat
                        tuberculosis, oncology and other diseases."...</font></font></font><b><font

                    women, and children are still bought, owned, sold,
                    and traded by Arab and black Muslim masters in five
                    African countries.<br>
                    <br>
                    The five African countries where blacks are the
                    property of Arabs and Muslims: Algeria (106,000),
                    Libya (48,000), Mauritania (340,000 – 680,000),
                    Nigeria (number unknown), and Sudan (35,000);
                    totaling 529,000 – 869,000.<br>
                    <br>
                    In Algeria, Sub-Saharan Africans fleeing violence
                    and poverty for Europe are enslaved by Algerian
                    Arabs as they try to cross the Mediterranean. Today,
                    according to the Global Slavery Index, around
                    106,000 black Africans are estimated to be enslaved.<br>

                    Migrant women, but also children (both male and
                    female), risk being forced into sexual slavery,
                    while men perform unskilled labor. Such enslavement
                    of black migrants is generally a surprise condition
                    for being smuggled to Europe — though, unlike
                    typical debt bondage, traffickers are not obliged to
                    release the enslaved once their debt is somehow
                    paid. Those who avoid slavery are also subjected to
                    virulent Arab racism, further marginalizing the

                    The DIY "Earth Battery". Earth Batteries are easy to
                    make and produce enough power to run many items such
                    as Lcd clocks, watches, pedometers, calculators, LED
                    lighting and more. all that's needed is copper wire
                    (from old extension cord etc.), several small bolts
                    (screws or nails can also be used), an ice cube tray
                    and dirt. that's it. makes a quick and easy battery.
                    works best if it's made with moist dirt/soil. Note:
                    every couple of days the dirt will "dry out" and the
                    voltage will decrease. TO RECHARGE THE BATTERY; just
                    add 1 or 2 teaspoons of water to each "cell" and the
                    battery will be "recharged". for increased voltage
                    make more than one battery and hook them together.
                    Tip: try to use "galvanized" bolts, screws or nails
                    - as they work the best. *included in this video is
                    footage of a larger outdoor "single cell" earth
                    battery i made. it's made using a 2' long piece of
                    copper pipe and a giant (foot long) nail.<br>
                    UPDATE:(5/25/2018) This battery has now been sitting
                    on a shelf collecting dust for 4 years. so i decided
                    to see if i could recharge it to&nbsp; "like new"

                    The Ethnic European June 8, 2020<br>
                    One of the only countries in Europe not to institute
                    strict lockdown measures amid the coronavirus
                    crisis, Central Europe’s Belarus has so far managed
                    to keep virus-related fatalities impressively low.<br>
                    <br>
                    Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has taken
                    a shot at the world’s elites, accusing them of
                    taking advantage of the coronavirus pandemic to put
                    ‘trillions of dollars in their pockets’ while the
                    global economy burns....<br>
                    <br>
                    Belarus faced the wrath of on-message liberal media
                    and medical experts around the world after refusing
                    to institute mandatory lockdown measures, with the
                    country’s factories, farms, schools, shops,
                    restaurants and other amenities remaining open
                    throughout the past several months even as its
                    neighbours closed down.<br>
                    However, recently published data have shown that
                    while the country’s per capita infection rates are
                    comparable to other European nations and the US, its
                    mortality rates have been among the lowest in the
                    world, ranking 45th among 49 countries with 10,000
                    or more cases where sufficient data is available...<br>

                    </font></b><font color="#000000">The design and
                    synthesis of artificial materials that mimic the
                    structures, mechanical properties, and ultimately
                    functionalities of biological cells remains a
                    current holy grail of materials science. Here, based
                    on a silica cell bioreplication approach, we report
                    the design and construction of synthetic rebuilt red
                    blood cells (RRBCs) that fully mimic the broad
                    properties of native RBCs: size, biconcave shape,
                    deformability, oxygen-carrying capacity, and long
                    circulation time. Four successive nanoscale
                    processing steps (RBC bioreplication, layer-by-layer
                    polymer deposition, and precision silica etching,
                    followed by RBC ghost membrane vesicle fusion) are
                    employed for RRBC construction. A panel of
                    physicochemical analyses including zeta-potential
                    measurement, fluorescence microscopy, and
                    antibody-mediated agglutination assay proved the
                    recapitulation of RBC shape, size, and membrane
                    structure. Flow-based deformation studies carried
                    out in a microfluidic blood capillary model
                    confirmed the ability of RRBCs to deform and pass
                    through small slits and reconstitute themselves in a
                    manner comparable to native RBCs. Circulation
                    studies of RRBCs conducted ex ovo in a chick embryo
                    and in vivo in a mouse model demonstrated the
                    requirement of both deformability and native cell
                    membrane surface to achieve long-term circulation.
                    To confer additional non-native functionalities to
                    RRBCs, we developed modular procedures with which to
                    load functional cargos such as hemoglobin, drugs,
                    magnetic nanoparticles, and ATP biosensors within
                    the RRBC interior to enable various functions,
                    including oxygen delivery, therapeutic drug
                    delivery, magnetic manipulation, and toxin
                    biosensing and detection. Taken together, RRBCs
                    represent a class of long-circulating RBC-inspired
                    artificial hybrid materials with a broad range of
                    potential applications.<br>

                    Relative Humidity Conditions</b><br>

                <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
                </b>Certain metals can surprisingly build-up charge
                spontaneously, when exposed to high relative humidity
                (RH), although they need to be isolated from the ground.
                We have explored this phenomenon, building on former
                experimental knowledge and carrying out additional
                experiments, to identify the parameters that could
                enhance this charging. We used many types of metals with
                different characteristics under different RH and
                temperature conditions. While some metals were
                unaffected by high RH, others, like zinc and stainless
                steel, did acquire charge, when RH was &gt;60%, and
                charged a capacitor to a voltage of 1&#8201;V. For the first
                time, we also performed outdoors experiments, showing
                this phenomenon is also valid under similar natural
                ambient humid conditions. If these results can be scaled
                up, it may lead to the development of practical
                applications for regions and times of high RH
                conditions.<br>

              'climate change dissent'</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          YouTuber and climate realist Naomi Seibt says governments
          across the world are cracking down on dissent, especially when
          it comes to contentions issues&nbsp; like the response to
          COVID-19 and climate change.<br>
          <br>
          Ms Seibt is currently being threatened with imprisonment by
          German authorities after she refused to take down three of her
          videos, with authorities claiming her videos do not comply
          with the law.<br>
          <br>
          “They are abusing these crisis’ to push tyranny and to silence
          the people who have different opinions or who do their
          research,” Ms Seibt told Sky News.<br>
          <br>
          “Once again we can see that state going against people like me
          and trying to silence us,” she said.<br>
          <br>
          “I made them (the videos) because I do stand by what I say,
          and I do question the science behind the climate change
          mainstream agenda”.<br>
          <br>
          “I do believe most climate activists don’t know what they’re
          talking about and there is so much propaganda being put out
          there.<br>
          <br>
          “We need to push against this and fight for more climate
          realism and freedom of speech again.”<br>

            <b>Violent Social Unrest Ahead? History Suggests So (Podcast
              w/ Neil Howe)</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          We're entering the era when the new violently replaces the
          old.<br>
          <br>
          Neil Howe, demographer and co-authour of the book The Fourth
          Turning, returns to the podcast this week. In our prior
          interviews with him, we’ve explored his study of generational
          cycles (“turnings”) in America which reveal predictable social
          trends that recur throughout history and invariably result in
          transformational crisis (a “fourth turning”).<br>
          <br>
          Fourth turnings are characterized by a growing demand for
          social order, yet supply of it remains weak. The emergence of
          the surveillance state, a perpetual war machine, increased
          intervention in failing markets by the central planners,
          greater government control of critical systems like health
          care and the Internet — all of these are classic fourth
          turning signs of the desperation authorities exert as they
          lose control.<br>
          <br>
          History shows time and time again that such overreach ends in
          rejection of the current order, usually via violent
          revolution.<br>
          <br>
          Now that we’re roughly halfway through the current Fourth
          Turning and things have really started to unravel here in
          2020, we’ve asked Neil back on the program to update us on
          what to expect next.<br>

              Experiment, Neoliberal Wing Of Democratic Party Must Be
              Fought</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>Dr. Cornel West said on Friday we are witnessing the
          failed social experiment that is the United States of America
          in the protests and riots that have followed the death of
          George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. West told CNN
          host Anderson Cooper that what is going on is rebellion to a
          failed capitalist economy that does not protect the people.
          West, a professor, denounced the neoliberal wing of the
          Democratic party that is all about "black faces in high
          places" but not actual change. The professor remarked even
          those black faces often lose legitimacy because they
          ingriatiate themselves into the establishment neo-liberal
          Democratic party.<br>
          <br>
          You cannot fix something, if you cannot acknowledge it's
          broken in the first place; and that, as a nation, is where we
          stand right now, in terms of race relations.<br>
          <br>
          I had the luckiest educational experience of my life, when I
          attended Cal State Dominguez Hills. It was a "rainbow school",
          where the students, no matter their ethnicity, got along well,
          because we all had our collective "eyes on the prize" of a
          degree, which would get us better opportunities for jobs, at
          least during that period of time.<br>
          <br>
          What breaks my heart, as an American, is every time another
          incident like this happens, I keep praying that it will be the
          last, and that people can collectively learn from their
          mistakes; but so far, that hasn't seemed to happen.<br>
          <br>
          And the real hell of it is, many African-American businesses
          have been, and possibly will be, burned to the ground, and
          their lifetime of work in building that business, will be
          utterly destroyed...<b><br>

          As peaceful protests continue to be hijacked to carry out
          organized violence, the country descends further into chaos,
          while the government's only response is more police state and
          more surveillance state controls.<br>
          <br>
          In this report, Spiro is joined by top constitutional and
          human rights attorney John W. Whitehead to discuss the current
          state of the nation. For Decades, Whitehead has been warning
          of the threat of a domestic standing army in the form of
          militarized police. Now in addition to having a full blown
          militarized police force, we actually have the military police
          and the national guard on the streets of America. <br>
          <br>
          In addition to covering martial law and the police state,
          Spiro and John Whitehead also delve into mandatory vaccines
          and President Trump's coming designation of Antifa as a

              &nbsp;A major study, the first of its kind, has revealed
              an association between certain blood types and the

                <b>CARLY CASSELLA </b><br>
              </div>
              <br>
              ...Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to monitor the
              brains of 60 healthy volunteers, the team found
              significant changes in activity in both the cortex and the
              hippocampus in those taking psilocybin.<br>
              <br>
              Glutamate is the most common neurotransmitter in the
              brain, and it's known to be critical for fast signalling
              and information, especially in the cortex and hippocampus,
              the latter of which is thought to play a role in self
              esteem....<br>
              <br>
              Interestingly enough, in the new clinical study, these two
              regions of the brain had quite different glutamate
              responses to psilocybin. While the authors found higher
              levels of glutamate in the prefrontal cortex during a
              trip, they actually found lower levels of glutamate in the
              hippocampus.<br>
              <br>
              What's more, this may have something to do with whether a
              person has a good experience with their ego or a bad one.
              <br>
              <br>
              "Analyses indicated that region-dependent alterations in
              glutamate were also correlated with different dimensions
              of ego dissolution," the authors write. <br>
              <br>
              "Whereas changes in [cortical] glutamate were found to be
              the strongest predictor of negatively experienced ego
              dissolution, changes in hippocampal glutamate were found
              to be the strongest predictor of positively experienced
              ego dissolution."..<br>

              male hormones that also cause baldness, actually help the
              coronavirus to attack cells and could be a major factor in
              the higher number of male Covid-19 deaths worldwide.<br>
              <br>
              Researchers in Madrid are investigating the interaction
              between these male sex hormones – such as testosterone –
              and the coronavirus in Covid-19 patients, with multiple
              studies already finding that bald men suffer worse cases
              of the disease than others. <br>
              <br>
              “We think androgens or male hormones are definitely the
              gateway for the virus to enter our cells,” said Professor
              Carlos Wambier from Brown University, the lead author of
              the latest study. “We really think that baldness is a
              perfect predictor of severity.” <br>
              <br>
              Wambier led two previous studies in Spain, both of which
              found that men with male pattern baldness were
              disproportionately hospitalized due to severe coronavirus
              infection.<br>

              <b>Abstract:</b><br>
              Static, or electronic, energy meters are replacing the
              conventional electromechanical meters. Consumers are
              sometimes complaining about higher energy readings and
              billing after the change to a static meter, but there is
              not a clear common or root cause at present.
              Electromagnetic interference has been observed between
              active infeed converters as used in photo-voltaic systems
              and static meters. Reducing the interference levels
              eliminated inaccurate reading in static meters. Several
              field investigations failed to identify a clear root cause
              of inaccurate readings of static energy meters.
              Experiments were performed in a controlled lab
              environment. Three-phase meters showed large deviations,
              even when supplied with an ideal sinusoidal voltage from a
              fourquadrant power amplifier. Large variations could be
              observed when non-linear, fast switching, loads were
              connected. A deviation of +276 % was measured with one
              static energy meter, +265% with a second and -46% with a
              third static energy meter. After dismantling it was
              revealed that the meters with the positive deviation used
              a Rogowski coil current sensor. The meter with a Hall
              effect-based current sensor gave the -46% deviation. The
              fourth meter, with a current transformer, resulted in -10%
              in one experiment and +8% in another experiment, where the
              deviations are with respect to a conventional
              electromechanical meter. Measurements were repeated with
              more meters and supplied from standard, low internal
              impedance, mains supply in the laboratory. Deviations of
              +475%, +566%, +569%, +581%, +582% and -31% and -32% were
              registered, with again the positive deviation for Rogowski
              coil current sensors and negative deviations for the Hall
              sensors.<br>

              The car cooler came in different models from "ram-air" to
              "fan-powered" types. The "ram-air" type mounted on the
              passenger side window. It would only work when the car was
              in forward motion as the air was forced into the tube. It
              had a water reservoir that held about a gallon (3.8 L) of
              water, which would provide "air conditioned" cooling for
              about 100 to 150 miles (160 to 240 km). The "fan-powered"
              model was designed to work when the car was not in motion
              or when moving at low speeds.<br>

              You can't be olde skool without an original thermador car
              cooler. Basically it's air-conditioning that uses no
              energy. Inside the big gray tube is a blanket with a
              string attached that hangs in the passenger window. You
              fill the tube up with water before you start driving, then
              every so often you pull the cord. It rotates the blanket
              inside and dips it in the water. Then air comes through
              the tube, it becomes cool by going through the wet blanket
              and finally goes into your car. Obviously it doesn't work
              in high humidity or when you're at a stoplight.<br>

              A Finnish research group has found strong evidence for the

              collapses into an even more exotic state called quark
              matter, in which the nuclei themselves no longer exist.
              Researchers from the University of Helsinki now claim that

                  sleep</b><br>
              </div>
              <br>
              Researchers of the University of Bern showed that we can
              acquire the vocabulary of a new language during distinct
              phases of slow-wave sleep and that the sleep-learned
              vocabulary could be retrieved unconsciously following
              waking. Memory formation appeared to be mediated by the
              same brain structures that also mediate wake vocabulary
              learning.<br>
              <br>
              Sleeping time is sometimes considered unproductive time.
              This raises the question whether the time spent asleep
              could be used more productively – e.g. for learning a new
              language? To date sleep research focused on the
              stabilization and strengthening (consolidation) of
              memories that had been formed during preceding
              wakefulness. However, learning during sleep has rarely
              been examined. There is considerable evidence for
              wake-learned information undergoing a recapitulation by
              replay in the sleeping brain. The replay during sleep
              strengthens the still fragile memory traces und embeds the
              newly acquired information in the preexisting store of
              knowledge.<br>
              <br>
              If re-play during sleep improves the storage of
              wake-learned information, then first-play – i.e., the
              initial processing of new information – should also be
              feasible during sleep, potentially carving out a memory
              trace that lasts into wakefulness. This was the research
              question of Katharina Henke, Marc Züst und Simon Ruch of
              the Institute of Psychology and of the Interfaculty
              Research Cooperation “Decoding Sleep” at the University of
              Bern, Switzerland. These investigators now showed for the
              first time that new foreign words and their translation
              words could be associated during a midday nap with
              associations stored into wakefulness. Following waking,
              participants could reactivate the sleep-formed
              associations to access word meanings when represented with
              the formerly sleep-played foreign words. The hippocampus,
              a brain structure essential for wake associative learning,
              also supported the retrieval of sleep-formed associations.
              The results of this experiment are published open access
              in the scientific journal “Current Biology”. <br>
              <br>
              <b>The brain cells’ active states are central for
                sleep-learning</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
              The research group of Katharina Henke examined whether a
              sleeping person is able to form new semantic associations
              between played foreign words and translation words during
              the brain cells’ active states, the so-called “Up-states”.
              When we reach deep sleep stages, our brain cells
              progressively coordinate their activity. During deep
              sleep, the brain cells are commonly active for a brief
              period of time before they jointly enter into a state of
              brief inactivity. The active state is called “Up-state”
              and the inactive state “Down-state”. The two states
              alternate about every half-second.<br>
              <br>
              Semantic associations between sleep-played words of an
              artificial language and their German translations words
              were only encoded and stored, if the second word of a pair
              was repeatedly (2, 3 or 4 times) played dur<br>
              ing an Up-state. E.g., when a sleeping person heard the
              word pairs “tofer = key” and “guga = elephant”, then after
              waking they were able to categorize with a
              better-than-chance accuracy whether the sleep-played
              foreign words denominated something large (“Guga”) or
              small (“Tofer”). “It was interesting that language areas
              of the brain and the hippocampus – the brain’s essential
              memory hub – were activated during the wake retrieval of
              sleep-learned vocabulary because these brain structures
              normally mediate wake learning of new vocabulary”, says
              Marc Züst, co-first-author of this paper. “These brain
              structures appear to mediate memory formation
              independently of the prevailing state of consciousness –
              unconscious during deep sleep, conscious during
              wakefulness”.<br>

                  Reversible and Linked to Stress</b><br>
                <b>Ayelet Rosenberg, et al.</b><br>
              </div>
              <b>Summary</b><b><br>
              </b>Hair graying is a universal hallmark of aging1 but its
              mechanisms are insufficiently understood2 and its
              reversibility in humans remains uncertain. Moreover, while
              psychological stress accelerates human biological
              aging3,4and triggers hair graying in animals5, no prior
              study has longitudinally examined the stress-to-hair
              graying connection in humans. Here we develop an approach
              to quantitatively profile natural graying events and their
              associated proteomic signatures along individual human
              hairs, resulting in a quantifiable physical timescale of
              aging. Using this approach, we identify white hairs that
              naturally regain pigmentation within days to weeks in
              healthy young individuals across sex, ethnicities, ages,
              and body regions, demonstrating that human hair graying is
              naturally reversible. Proteomic analysis of matched dark
              and white hairs replicated across two independent
              experiments show that graying is marked by the
              upregulation of proteins related to energy metabolism,
              mitochondria, and antioxidant defenses. Coordinated
              graying and reversal also occur simultaneously across
              multiple scalp hair follicles of a person, suggesting that
              unknown systemic factors influence hair graying patterns.
              Combining hair pigmentation profiling and proteomics at
              the single hair shaft level, we also report hair graying
              and reversal occurring in parallel with behavioral and
              psychological stressors. A computational simulation of
              life-long and stress-induced hair graying suggests a
              threshold-based mechanism for the rapid reversibility of
              graying. Together, these findings document the
              reversibility of hair graying in humans and provide a new
              model to examine the modifiability of human aging.<br>

              <br>
              The results of a clinical trial released today in STEM
              CELLS Translational Medicine demonstrate how a topical
              solution made up of stem cells leads to the regrowth of
              hair for people with a common type of baldness.<br>
              <br>
              Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) - commonly known as
              male-pattern baldness (female-pattern baldness in women)
              -- is a condition caused by genetic, hormonal and
              environmental factors. It affects an estimated 50 percent
              of all men and almost as many women older than 50. While
              it is not a life-threatening condition, AGA can lower a
              person's self-esteem and psychological well-being. There
              are a few FDA-approved medications to treat hair loss, but
              the most effective can have side effects such as loss of
              libido and erectile dysfunction. Therefore, the search
              continues for a safer, effective treatment.<br>
              <br>
              Adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) secrete several
              growth hormones that help cells develop and proliferate.
              According to laboratory and experimental studies, growth
              factors such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), vascular
              endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin-like growth
              factor (IGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)
              increase the size of the hair follicle during hair
              development.<br>
              <br>
              "Recent studies have shown that ADSCs promote hair growth
              in both men and women with alopecia. However, no
              randomized, placebo-controlled trial in humans has
              explored the effects and safety of adipose-derived stem
              cell constituent extract (ADSC-CE) in AGA. We aimed to
              assess the efficacy and tolerability of ADSC-CE in
              middle-aged patients with AGA in our study, hypothesizing
              that it is an effective and safe treatment agent," said
              Sang Yeoup Lee, M.D., Ph.D., of the Family Medicine Clinic
              and Research Institute of Convergence of Biomedical
              Science and Technology, Pusan National University Yangsan
              Hospital in South Korea. He led the group of researchers,
              which also included colleagues from Pusan National
              University School of Medicine, Pusan National University
              Yangsan Hospital and T-Stem Co., Ltd.<br>
              <br>
              The team recruited 38 patients (29 men and nine women)
              with AGA and assigned half to an intervention group that
              received the ADSC-CE topical solution and half as a
              control group that received a placebo. Twice daily, each
              patient applied the ADSC-CE topical solution or placebo to
              their scalp using their fingers.<br>
              <br>
              "At the end of 16 weeks, the group that received the
              ADSC-CEs had a significant increase in both hair count and
              follicle diameter," reported the study's senior author,
              Young Jin Tak, M.D., Ph.D.<br>
              <br>
              Dr. Lee added, "Our findings suggest that the application
              of the ADSC-CE topical solution has enormous potential as
              an alternative therapeutic strategy for hair regrowth in
              patients with AGA, by increasing both hair density and
              thickness while maintaining adequate treatment safety. The
              next step should be to conduct similar studies with large
              and diverse populations in order to confirm the beneficial
              effects of ADSC-CE on hair growth and elucidate the
              mechanisms responsible for the action of ADSC-CE in

              and director of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative
              Medicine. "The topical solution created from proteins
              secreted by stem cells found in fat tissue proves to be

              Accumulating evidence suggests that adipose&#8208;derived stem
              cell constituent extract (ADSC&#8208;CE) helps hair regrowth in
              patients with androgenetic alopecia (AGA). However, the

              trial. In this randomized, double&#8208;blind,
              vehicle&#8208;controlled clinical trial, 38 patients (29 men)
              with AGA were assigned to an intervention group (IG), with
              twice&#8208;daily self&#8208;application of the ADSC&#8208;CE topical
              solution over the scalp with fingers, or to a control

              baseline at 16&#8201;weeks were evaluated using a
              phototrichogram. Overall, 34 (89%) patients (mean age,
              45.3&#8201;years) completed the study. The phototrichogram at
              week 8 showed more increase in hair count in the IG than
              in the CG, and intergroup differences in the change of
              hair count remained significant until week 16 with overall
              changes of 28.1% vs 7.1%, respectively. Similarly, a
              significant improvement in hair diameter was observed in
              the IG (14.2%) after 16&#8201;weeks when compared with hair
              diameter in the CG (6.3%). Our findings suggest that the
              application of the ADSC&#8208;CE topical solution has enormous
              potential as an alternative therapeutic strategy for hair
              regrowth in patients with AGA, by increasing both hair
              density and thickness while maintaining adequate treatment
              safety.<br>

          <b><br>
          </b>Thousands of people face life-long losses in motor
          function and sensation due to spinal cord injury. This is
          because the components of a central nervous system do not
          regenerate. Along the spine runs the neurons with long wiry
          projections called axons protruding outward. The axons provide
          the sensation of touch and sight. This system is the
          communication network that connects all the parts of the body
          to the brain. If axons are severely damaged or severed, the
          connection is broken, which results in paralysis and
          blindness.<br>
          <br>
          But now, Lewis Katz School of Medicine Temple University
          (LKSOM) researchers found a way to fix the axons. Their
          strategy involves upregulating (boosting expression of) a
          molecule (a protein) called Lin28, which regulates cell
          growth. In experiments with mice that had spinal cord injuries
          and damaged optical nerves, the protein helped them regain
          movement, feeling, and patched up the axons in the optical
          nerve...<br>
          <br>
          Shuxin Li, MD, Ph.D., Professor of Anatomy and Cell Biology
          and senior investigator on the new study, explained:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our findings show that Lin28 is a major
          regulator of axon regeneration and a promising therapeutic
          target for central nervous system injuries. We became
          interested in Lin28 as a target for neuron regeneration
          because it acts as a gatekeeper of stem cell activity. It
          controls the switch that maintains stem cells or allows them
          to differentiate and potentially contribute to activities such
          as axon regeneration.<br>
          <br>
          The Lin28 gene is expressed in high amounts in embryonic stem
          cells early on but drops off as cells age. Ramping up levels
          has been found in past studies to help mice regrow bone, skin,
          cartilage, and other tissues – but not axons, until now.<br>
          <br>
          Dr. Li said:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our findings show that Lin28 is a major
          regulator of axon regeneration and a promising therapeutic
          target for central nervous system injuries. We observed a lot
          of axon regrowth, which could be very significant clinically
          since there currently are no regenerative treatments for
          spinal cord injury or optic nerve injury.<br>
          <br>
          Injections of Lin28 helped axons regenerate along the entire
          optic nerve tract and as far as 3mm beyond the damaged area in
          the spinal cord in all the mice. The researchers speculate
          that other molecules involved with growth signaling could be
          bundled together with Lin28 for an even better result. Their
          next goal is to identify how to get Lin28 to injured tissues
          in humans safely and effectively...<b><br>

            <b>Changyu Shao</b><br>

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>The regeneration of tooth enamel, the hardest biological
          tissue, remains a considerable challenge because its
          complicated and well-aligned apatite structure has not been
          duplicated artificially. We herein reveal that a rationally
          designed material composed of calcium phosphate ion clusters
          can be used to produce a precursor layer to induce the
          epitaxial crystal growth of enamel apatite, which mimics the
          biomineralization crystalline-amorphous frontier of hard
          tissue development in nature. After repair, the damaged enamel
          can be recovered completely because its hierarchical structure
          and mechanical properties are identical to those of natural
          enamel. The suggested phase transformation–based epitaxial
          growth follows a promising strategy for enamel regeneration
          and, more generally, for biomimetic reproduction of materials
          with complicated structure.<b><br>

              In This Simple Reactor</b><br>
            <b>by Andrea D. Steffen</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>Walter Rosner is a metallurgist and researcher who
          designed and manufactured a reactor to turn plastic waste into
          fuel. He did this from the small missionary town Dos de Mayo
          in Argentina where no such machine had ever existed;
          therefore, he had to invent it himself. Now, he uses the oven
          to melt standard plastic from packaging and other sources and
          distills it down to diesel or gasoline for vehicles and
          machines.<br>
          <br>
          Rosner proposed building a facility in each municipality that
          would collect plastic and turn it into fuel. The size of each
          plant should be scaled according to how much garbage the
          region produces.<br>
          <br>
          One reactor can process 30 kilos of plastic in about 90
          minutes. For every 10 kilos put in, nine liters of fuel comes
          out. Even agrochemical packaging such as glyphosate can be
          transformed into a usable product. Different plastics produce
          different types of fuel (naphtha, diesel, or oil), and some
          plastics take longer than others to convert.<br>
          <br>
          Rosner’s household accumulates around 8 kilos of plastic waste
          weekly, which, when converted in the reactor provides 5 liters
          of gasoline. To put it into perspective, here in Thailand, I
          use a motorbike to get around. I have to fill it once a week
          with three liters of gasoline. The amount of plastic Rosner’s
          household throws away could provide me with almost double my
          fuel needs for the week! However, I rarely have plastic to
          throw away (or recycle) because my diet barely involves things
          packaged in single-use plastic. No soda, no junk food, almost
          no plastic!<br>
          <br>
          Of course, I also live on a small island with lots of small
          local farms selling fruits in vegetables from market stalls,
          and many places around the world are not like this. It may not
          be possible for some people to avoid plastic. For this,
          Rosner’s reactor is terrific because it accelerates the
          plastic decomposition process from hundreds of years to merely
          three hours.<br>
          <br>
          He said: In three hours, you have fuel suitable for cars,
          machines, generator sets, chainsaws.<br>
          <br>
          Meanwhile, in Africa, there’s another man from Ghana called
          Francis Kantavooro, who also assembled his own reactor. It
          turns plastic waste into either diesel, gasoline, kerosene, or
          domestic gas for home use.<br>
          <br>
          Kantavooro said: Ghana spends [a lot of] money on plastic
          waste. When I was at university as an engineer, I wanted to
          make a change. I started to research what the plastic waste
          could be used for and [how to] permanently get it out of the
          environmental system.<br>
          <br>
          Ghana has a severe plastic pollution problem as it produces
          1.7 million tons of it annually but only recycles 2%! Now, at
          least in his town, people collect plastic waste and bring it
          to the reactor site. They receive money per kilo. It takes no
          longer than a day for Kantavooro’s reactor to convert one ton
          of plastic into 800 liters of diesel. Likewise, people from
          the town come to him to buy fuel for their motorbikes and
          machines as it is cheaper than buying it from the gas station.<br>

          </b>A Canadian startup called Anahit Therapeutics is nearly

          Jamaica, where it hopes to grow psychedelic mushrooms to use
          in new pharmaceuticals.<br>
          <br>
          The plan is to build modular cultivation facilities that not
          only grow the psychedelic mushrooms but extract their active
          ingredient, psilocybin. Doctors have investigated psilocybin’s
          ability to treat myriad conditions ranging from depression to
          eating disorders, and this new facility is a major bid to
          bring those treatments to reality.<br>

          <br>
          Each facility can generate just over 34 pounds of psilocybin
          per year — Anahit plans to build five more facilities once
          this first one is done, bringing that total yield to about 172

          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>Researchers at a Hong Kong university say they have
          developed an antiviral coating which could provide 90 days of
          “significant” protection against bacteria and viruses such as
          the one causing COVID-19. <br>
          <br>
          The coating, called MAP-1, took 10 years to develop and can be
          sprayed on surfaces that are frequently used by the public,
          such as elevator buttons and handrails, researchers at the
          Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) say.<br>
          <br>
          “These places are frequently touched, and, at the same time,
          serve as a very effective medium for transmission of
          diseases,” said HKUST Adjunct Professor Joseph Kwan, one of
          the chief researchers in the team that developed the product.
          <br>
          <br>
          The coating that forms after spraying has millions of

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>Present estimates suggest that of the 359 million tons of
          plastics produced annually worldwide1, 150–200 million tons
          accumulate in landfill or in the natural environment2.
          Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is the most abundant
          polyester plastic, with almost 70 million tons manufactured
          annually worldwide for use in textiles and packaging3. The
          main recycling process for PET, via thermomechanical means,
          results in a loss of mechanical properties4. Consequently, de
          novo synthesis is preferred and PET waste continues to
          accumulate. With a high ratio of aromatic terephthalate
          units—which reduce chain mobility—PET is a polyester that is
          extremely difficult to hydrolyse5. Several PET hydrolase
          enzymes have been reported, but show limited productivity6,7.
          Here we describe an improved PET hydrolase that ultimately
          achieves, over 10 hours, a minimum of 90 per cent PET
          depolymerization into monomers, with a productivity of 16.7
          grams of terephthalate per litre per hour (200 grams per
          kilogram of PET suspension, with an enzyme concentration of 3
          milligrams per gram of PET). This highly efficient, optimized
          enzyme outperforms all PET hydrolases reported so far,
          including an enzyme8,9 from the bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis
          strain 201-F6 (even assisted by a secondary enzyme10) and
          related improved variants11,12,13,14 that have attracted
          recent interest. We also show that biologically recycled PET
          exhibiting the same properties as petrochemical PET can be
          produced from enzymatically depolymerized PET waste, before
          being processed into bottles, thereby contributing towards the
          concept of a circular PET economy.<br>

          </b>...Incredible as it may sound, the researchers improved
          the brains of animals with Alzheimer’s simply by using LED
          lights that flashed 40 times a second. Even sound played at
          this charmed frequency, 40 hertz, had a similar effect...<br>
          <br>
          I already knew that much, so to better understand the new work
          and its origins, I sought out Li-Huei Tsai, a neuroscientist
          at MIT. She said the idea of using one of these frequencies to
          treat Alzheimer’s came from a curious observation. “We had
          noticed in our own data, and in that of other groups, that
          40-hertz rhythm power and synchrony are reduced in mouse
          models of Alzheimer’s disease,” she said, as well as in
          patients with the disease. Apparently, if you have
          Alzheimer’s, your brain doesn’t produce strong brain waves in
          that particular frequency. In 2016, her graduate student
          Hannah Iaccarino reasoned that perhaps boosting the power of
          these weakened gamma waves would be helpful in treating this
          severe and irreversible dementia...<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;Tsai’s MIT colleague Emery Brown pointed her to an older
          paper showing that you can boost the power of gamma waves in a
          cat’s brain simply by having it stare at a screen illuminated
          by a strobe light flickering at certain frequencies, which
          included 40 hertz. “Hannah and our collaborators built a
          system to try that sensory stimulation in mice, and it
          worked,” Tsai told me... <br>
          <br>
          Following a clue from Alois Alzheimer himself, the researchers
          quickly shifted their attention from neurons to microglia. In
          Alzheimer’s first description of brain tissue taken from
          patients with “presenile dementia,” which he examined under a
          microscope near the turn of the 20th century, he noted that
          the deposits of amyloid plaques were surrounded by these
          immune cells. Subsequent research confirmed that microglia
          engulf the plaques pockmarking these patients’ brains.<br>
          <br>
          Tsai and colleagues decided to check out these immune cells in
          the animals whose brain waves they’d boosted. They observed
          that microglia in all the treated animals had bulked up in
          size, and more of them were digesting amyloid plaques.<br>
          <br>
          How did these cells know to do this? Unlike immune cells in
          the bloodstream, which are unaware of neuronal transmissions,
          the brain’s microglia are tuned in to the rhythms of
          electrical activity in the brain. While immune cells in the
          bloodstream and microglia in the brain both have cellular
          sensors to detect disease and injury, microglia can also
          detect neurons firing electrical impulses. That’s because they
          have the same neurotransmitter receptors that neurons use to
          transmit signals through synapses. This gives microglia the
          ability to “listen in” on information flowing through neural
          networks and, when those transmissions are disturbed, to take
          action to repair the circuitry. Thus, the right brain waves
          can drive microglia to consume the toxic protein deposits.<br>
          <br>
          “I find this intersection [between brain waves and microglia]
          to be one of the most exciting and intriguing results of our
          work,” Tsai told me. Her team reported last year in Neuron
          that prolonging the LED strobe-light flashing for three to six
          weeks not only cleared out the toxic plaques in mice brains
          but also prevented neurons from dying and even preserved
          synapses, which dementia can destroy...<br>

          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>Changes in gamma oscillations (20–50&#8201;Hz) have been
          observed in several neurological disorders. However, the
          relationship between gamma oscillations and cellular
          pathologies is unclear. Here we show reduced, behaviourally
          driven gamma oscillations before the onset of plaque formation
          or cognitive decline in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease.
          Optogenetically driving fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive
          (FS-PV)-interneurons at gamma (40&#8201;Hz), but not other
          frequencies, reduces levels of amyloid-&#946; (A&#946;)1–40 and A&#946; 1–42
          isoforms. Gene expression profiling revealed induction of
          genes associated with morphological transformation of
          microglia, and histological analysis confirmed increased
          microglia co-localization with A&#946;. Subsequently, we designed a
          non-invasive 40&#8201;Hz light-flickering regime that reduced A&#946;1–40
          and A&#946;1–42 levels in the visual cortex of pre-depositing mice
          and mitigated plaque load in aged, depositing mice. Our
          findings uncover a previously unappreciated function of gamma
          rhythms in recruiting both neuronal and glial responses to
          attenuate Alzheimer’s-disease-associated pathology.<br>

            Summary<br>
          </b>Neuronal and synaptic loss is characteristic in many
          neurodegenerative diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia
          and Alzheimer’s disease. Recently, we showed that inducing
          gamma oscillations with visual stimulation (gamma entrainment
          using sensory stimuli, or GENUS) reduced amyloid plaques and
          phosphorylated tau in multiple mouse models. Whether GENUS can
          affect neurodegeneration or cognitive performance remains
          unknown. Here, we demonstrate that GENUS can entrain gamma
          oscillations in the visual cortex, hippocampus, and prefrontal
          cortex in Tau P301S and CK-p25 mouse models of
          neurodegeneration. Tau P301S and CK-p25 mice subjected to
          chronic, daily GENUS from the early stages of
          neurodegeneration showed a preservation of neuronal and
          synaptic density across multiple brain areas and modified
          cognitive performance. Our transcriptomic and phosphoproteomic
          data suggest that chronic GENUS shifts neurons to a less
          degenerative state, improving synaptic function, enhancing
          neuroprotective factors, and reducing DNA damage in neurons
          while also reducing inflammatory response in microglia.<b><br>

          We previously reported that inducing gamma oscillations with a
          non-invasive light flicker (gamma entrainment using sensory
          stimulus or GENUS) impacted pathology in the visual cortex of
          Alzheimer’s disease mouse models. Here, we designed auditory
          tone stimulation that drove gamma frequency neural activity in
          auditory cortex (AC) and hippocampal CA1. Seven days of
          auditory GENUS improved spatial and recognition memory and
          reduced amyloid in AC and hippocampus of 5XFAD mice. Changes
          in activation responses were evident in microglia, astrocytes,
          and vasculature. Auditory GENUS also reduced phosphorylated
          tau in the P301S tauopathy model. Furthermore, combined
          auditory and visual GENUS, but not either alone, produced
          microglial-clustering responses, and decreased amyloid in
          medial prefrontal cortex. Whole brain analysis using SHIELD
          revealed widespread reduction of amyloid plaques throughout
          neocortex after multi-sensory GENUS. Thus, GENUS can be
          achieved through multiple sensory modalities with wide-ranging
          effects across multiple brain areas to improve cognitive
          function...<br>

              of choice behavior with ultrasonic waves</b><br>
            <b>Jan Kubanek, et al.</b><br>
          </div>
          <b>Abstract<br>
          </b>The ability to modulate neural activity in specific brain
          circuits remotely and systematically could revolutionize
          studies of brain function and treatments of brain disorders.
          Sound waves of high frequencies (ultrasound) have shown
          promise in this respect, combining the ability to modulate
          neuronal activity with sharp spatial focus. Here, we show that
          the approach can have potent effects on choice behavior.
          Brief, low-intensity ultrasound pulses delivered noninvasively
          into specific brain regions of macaque monkeys influenced
          their decisions regarding which target to choose. The effects
          were substantial, leading to around a 2:1 bias in choices
          compared to the default balanced proportion. The effect
          presence and polarity was controlled by the specific target
          region. These results represent a critical step towards the
          ability to influence choice behavior noninvasively, enabling
          systematic investigations and treatments of brain circuits
          underlying disorders of choice.<br>

                Denouncing Corona as ‘A Global False Alarm’</b><br>
              <b>Daniele Pozzati</b><br>
            </div>
            <b><br>
            </b>Germany’s federal government and mainstream media are
            engaged in damage control after a report that challenges the
            established Corona narrative leaked from the interior
            ministry. Some of the report key passages are:<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dangerousness of Covid-19 was
            overestimated: probably at no point did the danger posed by
            the new virus go beyond the normal level.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people who die from Corona are
            essentially those who would statistically die this year,
            because they have reached the end of their lives and their
            weakened bodies can no longer cope with any random everyday
            stress (including the approximately 150 viruses currently in
            circulation).<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worldwide, within a quarter of a year,
            there has been no more than 250,000 deaths from Covid-19,
            compared to 1.5 million deaths [25,100 in Germany] during
            the influenza wave 2017/18.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The danger is obviously no greater than
            that of many other viruses. There is no evidence that this
            was more than a false alarm.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A reproach could go along these lines:
            During the Corona crisis the State has proved itself as one
            of the biggest producers of Fake News.<br>
            <br>
            So far, so bad. But it gets worse.<br>
            <br>
            The report focuses on the “manifold and heavy consequences
            of the Corona measures” and warns that these are “grave”.<br>
            <br>
            More people are dying because of state-imposed
            Corona-measures than they are being killed by the virus.<br>
            <br>
            The reason is a scandal in the making:<br>
            <br>
            A Corona-focused German healthcare system is postponing
            life-saving surgery and delaying or reducing treatment for
            non-Corona patients.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Berlin in Denial Mode. The scientists fight back.<br>
              <br>
            </b>Initially, the government tried to dismiss the report as
            “the work of one employee”, and its contents as “his own
            opinion” – while the journalists closed ranks, no questions
            asked, with the politicians.<br>
            <br>
            But the 93-pages report titled “Analysis of the Crisis
            Management” has been drafted by a scientific panel appointed
            by the interior ministry and composed by external medical
            experts from several German universities.<br>
            <br>
            The report was the initiative of a department of the
            interior ministry called Unit KM4 and in charge with the
            “Protection of critical infrastructures”.<br>
            <br>
            This is also where the German official turned whistleblower,
            Stephen Kohn, work(ed), and from where he leaked it to the
            media.<br>
            <br>
            The authors of the report issued a joint press release
            already on Mai 11th, berating the government for ignoring
            expert advise, and asking for the interior minister to
            officially comment upon the experts joint statement:<br>
            <br>
            “Therapeutic and preventive measures should never bring more
            harm than the illness itself. Their aim should be to protect
            the risk groups, without endegearing the availibilty of
            medical care and the health of the whole population, as it
            is unfortunately occurring”<br>
            <br>
            “We in the scientific and medical praxis are experiencing
            the secondary damages of the Corona-measures on our patients
            on a dialy basis.”<br>
            <br>
            “We therefore ask the Federal Ministry of the Interior, to
            comment upon our press release, and we hope for a pertinent
            discussion regarding the [Corona] measures, one that leads
            to the best possible solution for the whole population”<br>
            <br>
            At the time of writing, the German government had yet to
            react.<br>
            <br>
            But the facts are – sadly – vindicating the medical experts’
            worries.<br>
            <br>
            On Mai 23 the German newspaper Das Bild titled: “Dramatic
            consequences of the Corona-Measures: 52,000 Cancer Ops
            delayed.”<br>
            <br>
            Inside, a aeading medical doctor warns that “we will feel
            the side-effects of the Corona crisis for years”.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Shooting the Whistleblower. Ignoring the Message.<br>
              <br>
            </b>As Der Spiegel reported on Mai 15th: “Stephen Kohn [the
            whistleblower] has since been suspended from duty. He was
            advised to obtain a lawyer and his work laptop was
            confiscated.”<br>
            <br>
            Kohn had originally leaked the report on May 9th to the
            liberal-conservative magazine Tichys Einblick one of
            Germany’s most popular alternative media outlets.<br>
            <br>
            News of the report went mainstream in Germany during the
            second week of Mai – but already in the third week media and
            politicians alike stopped discussing the issue by refusing
            to comment upon it.<br>
            <br>
            Emblematic was the approach taken by Günter Krings, the
            representative for Interior Minister Horst Seehofer – the
            whistleblower’s boss:<br>
            <br>
            Asked it he would treat the document seriously, Krings
            replied:<br>
            <br>
            “If you start analyzing papers like that, then pretty soon
            you’ll be inviting the guys with the tin foil hats to
            parliamentary hearings.”<br>
            <br>
            Men in tin foil hats – Aluhut in German – is a term used to
            describe people who believe in conspiracy theories.<br>
            <br>
            Indeed one article by Der Spiegel adressing the Corona
            protest movement and the consequences of the leaked report
            contained the word “conspiracy” no fewer than 17 times!<br>
            <br>
            And no discussions of the issues raised by the report
            itself.<br>
            <br>
            Outside Germany the news has virtually gone unreported.<br>
            <br>
            The Protest Movement – or “Corona-Rebellen”.<br>
            <br>
            Germans begun demonstrating against Lockdowns as early as
            April.<br>
            <br>
            And thousands of citizens keep showing up at demos every
            week-end, even as the government is easing the restrictions.<br>
            <br>
            The demos are not merely against restrictions, which have
            actually been comparatively mild compared to many other
            Western countries.<br>
            <br>
            The demos question the entire Corona Narrative, and even
            more its principals, especially the role Bill Gates is
            playing, as the WHO second biggest donor (the first one
            since Trump suspended U.S. contribution).<br>
            <br>
            Indeed the biggest such demos took place in Stuttgart on May
            9th, where tens of thousands people assempled to say no – to
            the NWO.<br>
            <br>
            Germans are saying no to any orwellian solution the
            government might one day impose out of a questionable
            “emergency status”, from mass surveillance Apps to mandatory
            vaccinations.<br>
            <br>
            The leaked report has proved their fears to be well founded.<br>
            <br>
            At least as far as the fake nature of the “Corona pandemic”
            is concerned.<br>
            <br>
            The rest might soon follow.<br>

                Decimates Rabbits Across the U.S.</b><br>
            </div>
            <b><br>
            </b>A highly contagious and deadly virus is sweeping across
            the US and threatening rabbits.<br>
            Infected rabbits may exhibit no symptoms before suddenly
            dying, or they may suffer fever, swelling, internal bleeding
            and liver failure.<br>
            <br>
            According to officials, the Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease virus
            type 2 is lethal to wild and domestic rabbits, but does not
            affect humans or domestic animals other than rabbits.<br>
            <br>
            RHDV2 is not connected to coronavirus and it only spreads
            among rabbits, hares and pikas – the rabbit’s small
            mountain-dwelling cousin.<br>
            <br>
            The disease has been found in rabbits in western states but
            has spread quickly and if it goes unchecked, it could
            decimate wild rabbit populations.&#8203;<br>
            <br>
            “Unfortunately, we may also see impacts to species that
            depend on rabbits for food, as rabbits are a common prey
            species for many predators,” said Deana Clifford, a CDFW
            senior wildlife veterinarian.<br>
            <br>
            USFW asked those who came across sightings of sick or dead
            rabbits to report the issue but be careful to not handle
            carcasses to minimise spread of the virus, which is
            described as very hardy. Hunters are urged to take
            precautions as well.<b><br>

            </div>
            <b><br>
            </b>Global deaths from covid-19 are on the wane. Most
            countries and states are starting to remove lockdown
            restrictions. And now we're starting to see medical claims
            that the SARS2 virus is losing potency.<br>
            <b><br>
              Is the covid-19 pandemic finally over?<br>
            </b>Not quite, cautions Chris. Yes, there are encouraging
            signs that fatalities are slowing, but there are still a lot
            of unknowns to address before we breathe a sigh of relief.
            The fact that lockdowns are ending at the same time
            thousands are coming into close quarters at protests will
            tell us in just a few weeks how worried we'll need to be
            about a resurgence in infections.<br>
            <br>
            Meanwhile, lots of uncertainty continues to swirl around
            chronic questions like 'Is HCQ helpful or harmful?" and
            'Does covid-19 have lab origins?'. With each day it seems
            there's a new wrinkle released that keeps the skeptics and
            the believers at odds with each other.<br>
            <br>
            Last, the societal trauma and the resulting inequality the
            official "rescue" efforts are creating are manifesting in
            the growing social unrest underlying the recent outbreak of
            protests and riots across the country. We need to keep our
            eyes on the true villains in this story -- primary among
            them the Federal Reserve -- rather than fighting each
            other....<br>

            </b><b>WTF: WHAT THE FED!?!?<br>
            </b>Back in January, Grant Williams, Mike Maloney, Charles
            Hugh Smith, Chris Martenson and Adam Taggart sat down for an
            in-depth discussion on the dangerous distortions to
            financial markets and the global economy that central bank
            intervention is causing.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            That video, titled WTF: What The Fed?!? was released soon
            after the US Federal Reserve had added $200 billion dollars
            to its balance sheet in Q4 2019. At the time, our panel was
            worried about so much liquidity being added to the system so
            quickly could recklessly exacerbate the extreme
            overvaluations in the markets, and further increase the
            instability of our over-indebted economy.<br>
            <br>
            Little could we have guessed that a global pandemic would
            soon ensue, one that has seen the central banks collectively
            flood the world with an additional $4 trillion so far, with
            (much) more anticipated to come. Sure makes that $200
            billion look pretty tiny now…<br>
            <br>
            So, if this group of experts was highly concerned about
            systemic risk pre-coronavirus, what are they thinking now?

              Should Be 'Widely Available And Promoted Immediately' As
              Standard Treatment</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>Hydroxychloroqine - a cheap, widely-prescribed
          anti-malaria drug which was deemed safe for decades until it
          showed efficacy treating coronavirus - needs to be made
          "widely available and promoted immediately for physicians to
          prescribe," according to Yale epidemiologist Dr. Harvey Risch.<br>
          <br>
          In a Wednesday manuscript detailing how high-risk COVID-19
          patients should be treated, Risch notes that the combination
          of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and the antibiotic azithromycin
          (AZ) "has been widely misrepresented in both clinical
          reportsand public media," and that "Five studies, including
          two controlled clinical trials, have demonstrated significant
          major outpatient treatment efficacy."<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin has been
          used as standard-of-care in more than 300,000 older adults
          with multi comorbidities, with estimated proportion diagnosed
          with cardiac arrhythmias attributable to the medications
          47/100,000 users, of which estimated mortality is
          &lt;20%,9/100,000users, compared to the 10,000 Americans now
          dying each week. These medications need to be widely available
          and promoted immediately for physicians to prescribe. - Dr.
          Harvey Risch<br>
          <br>
          Risch recommends the combination of HCQ+AZ "preferably with
          zinc" as a "standard outpatient treatment, at least until we
          find or add something better, whether that could be remdesivir
          or something else."<br>
          <br>
          The manuscript flies in the face of mainstream health
          authorities, which has staged a full court press against HCQ,
          while promoting Gilead's (very expensive) remdesivir as the
          only viable option to treat the COVID-19. Medical experts -
          including Dr. Anthony Fauci of the White House coronavirus
          task force have cautioned against taking the drug despite its
          successful use by doctors around the world, who have claimed
          dramatic improvement in patients with coronavirus.<br>
          <br>
          "Every patient I've prescribed it to has been very, very ill
          and within 8 to 12 hours, they were basically symptom-free,"
          said Los Angeles doctor Dr. Anthony Cardillo, adding "So
          clinically I am seeing a resolution."..<br>

          </b>Tyler LeBaron explains what happens to COVID-19 patients
          when the immune system overreacts and creates various
          dangerous oxygen species and excessive cytokines, called a
          cytokine storm. The process that takes place in the body by
          the immune system is important unless it gets out of control.<br>
          <br>
          LeBaron says “molecular hydrogen (H2 gas) has antioxidant and
          anti-inflammatory effects, which make it potentially useful
          for COVID-19.” Research shows that hydrogen gas can, in many
          cases, help maintain regulation of the immune system. The
          video includes interviews with patients who have benefited
          from the use of hydrogen gas...<br>

          can&nbsp; cause. In order to supply new information, an

          contaminants by means of an Environmental Scanning Electron

          micro- and nanosized particulate matter composed of inorganic

          <br>
          In April, blood clots emerged as one of the many mysterious
          symptoms attributed to Covid-19, a disease that had initially
          been thought to largely affect the lungs in the form of
          pneumonia. Quickly after came reports of young people dying
          due to coronavirus-related strokes. Next it was Covid toes —
          painful red or purple digits.<br>
          <br>
          What do all of these symptoms have in common? An impairment in
          blood circulation. Add in the fact that 40% of deaths from
          Covid-19 are related to cardiovascular complications, and the
          disease starts to look like a vascular infection instead of a
          purely respiratory one.<br>
          <br>
          Months into the pandemic, there is now a growing body of
          evidence to support the theory that the novel coronavirus can
          infect blood vessels, which could explain not only the high
          prevalence of blood clots, strokes, and heart attacks, but
          also provide an answer for the diverse set of head-to-toe
          symptoms that have emerged.<br>
          <br>
          “All these Covid-associated complications were a mystery. We
          see blood clotting, we see kidney damage, we see inflammation
          of the heart, we see stroke, we see encephalitis [swelling of
          the brain],” says William Li, MD, president of the
          Angiogenesis Foundation. “A whole myriad of seemingly
          unconnected phenomena that you do not normally see with SARS
          or H1N1 or, frankly, most infectious diseases.”<br>
          <br>
          “If you start to put all of the data together that’s emerging,
          it turns out that this virus is probably a vasculotropic
          virus, meaning that it affects the [blood vessels],” says
          Mandeep Mehra, MD, medical director of the Brigham and Women’s
          Hospital Heart and Vascular Center...<br>

          </b>...According to the message forwarded to Taiwan News,
          “It’s highly possible to get infected a second time. A few
          people recovered from the first time by their own immune
          system, but the meds they use are damaging their heart tissue,
          and when they get it the second time, the antibody doesn’t
          help but makes it worse, and they die a sudden death from
          heart failure.”<br>
          <br>
          The source also said the virus has “outsmarted all of us,” as
          it can hide symptoms for up to 24 days. This assertion has
          been made independently elsewhere, with Chinese pulmonologist
          Zhong Nanshan saying the average incubation period is three
          days, but it can take as little as one day and up to 24 days
          to develop symptoms...<br>

          </div>
          <div align="center"><i>In recent days a series of leaks across
              the globe have further shown the “official line” on
              coronavirus does not hold water</i><i><br>
            </i><b>Kit Knightly</b><br>
          </div>
          <b> </b>The science of the coronavirus is not disputed. It is
          well documented and openly admitted:<br>
          Most people won’t get the virus<br>
          Most of the people who get it won’t display symptoms.<br>
          Most of the people who display symptoms will only be mildly
          sick.<br>
          Most of the people with severe symptoms will never be
          critically ill.<br>
          And most of the people who get critically ill will survive.<br>
          This is borne out by the numerous serological studies which
          show, again and again, that the infection fatality ratio is on
          par with flu.<br>
          <br>
          There is no science – and increasingly little rational
          discussion – to justify the lockdown measures and overall
          sense of global panic.<br>
          <br>
          Nevertheless, it’s always good to get official acknowledgement
          of the truth, even if it has to be leaked.<br>
          <br>
          Here are three leaks showing that those in power know that the
          coronavirus poses no threat, and in no way justifies the
          lockdown that is going to destroy the livelihoods of so many.<br>
          <br>
          1. “IT’S ALL BULLSHIT!”<br>
          On May 26th Dr Alexander Myasnikov, Russia’s head of
          coronavirus information, gave an interview to
          former-Presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak in which he
          apparently let slip his true feelings.<br>
          <br>
          Believing the interview over, and the camera turned off,
          Myasnikov said:<br>
          <br>
          It’s all bullshit […] It’s all exaggerated. It’s an acute
          respiratory disease with minimal mortality […] Why has the
          whole world been destroyed? That I don’t know,”<br>
          <br>
          2. “COVID-19 CANNOT BE DESCRIBED AS A GENERALLY DANGEROUS
          DISEASE”<br>
          According to an e-mail leaked to Danish newspaper Politiken,
          the Danish Health Authority disagree with their government’s
          approach to the coronavirus. They cover it in two articles
          here and here (For those who don’t speak Danish, thelocal.dk
          have covered the story too).<br>
          <br>
          There’s a lot of interesting information there, not least of
          which is the clear implication that politicians appear to be
          pressing the scientific advisors to overstate the danger (they
          did the same thing in the UK), along with the decision of some
          civil servants to withhold data from the public until after
          the lockdown had been extended.<br>
          <br>
          But by far the most important quote is from a March 15th
          e-mail [our emphasis]:<br>
          <br>
          The Danish Health Authority continues to consider that
          covid-19 cannot be described as a generally dangerous disease,
          as it does not have either a usually serious course or a high
          mortality rate,”<br>
          <br>
          On March 12th the Danish parliament passed an emergency law
          which – among many other things – decreased the power of the
          Danish Health Authority, demoting it from a “regulatory
          authority” to just an “advisory” one.<br>
          <br>
          3. “A GLOBAL FALSE ALARM”<br>
          Earlier this month, on May 9th, a report was leaked to the
          German alternate media magazine Tichys Einblick titled
          “Analysis of the Crisis Management”.<br>
          <br>
          The report was commissioned by the German department of the
          interior, but then its findings were ignored, prompting one of
          the authors to release it through non-official channels.<br>
          <br>
          The fall out of that, including attacks on the authors and
          minimising of the report’s findings, is all very fascinating
          and we highly recommend this detailed report on Strategic
          Culture (or read the full report here in German).<br>
          <br>
          We’re going to focus on just the reports conclusions,
          including [our emphasis]:<br>
          <br>
          The dangerousness of Covid-19 was overestimated: probably at
          no point did the danger posed by the new virus go beyond the
          normal level.<br>
          The danger is obviously no greater than that of many other
          viruses. There is no evidence that this was more than a false
          alarm.<br>
          During the Corona crisis the State has proved itself as one of
          the biggest producers of Fake News.<br>
          <br>
          After being attacked in the press, and suspended from his job,
          the leaker and other authors of the report released a joint
          statement, calling on the government to respond to their
          findings.<br>
          <br>
          If the current crisis was being approached rationally by all
          parties, these leaks would seal the debate.<br>
          <br>
          Evidence is piling up that the people in charge knew, from the
          very beginning, that the virus was not dangerous.<br>
          <br>
          The question remaining is: Why are these leaks happening now?<br>

          <br>
          The body said all healthcare workers in hospitals and some
          frontline personnel could now take the drug for up to several
          weeks under strict medical supervision.<br>
          <br>

          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>"We know that wearing a mask outside health care
          facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection.<br>
          Focusing on universal masking alone may, paradoxically, lead
          to more transmission of Covid-19 if it diverts attention from
          implementing more fundamental infection-control measures.<br>
          <br>
          fear and anxiety are better countered with data and education
          than with a marginally beneficial mask, particularly in light
          of the worldwide mask shortage, but it is difficult to get
          clinicians to hear this message in the heat of the current
          crisis.<br>
          <br>
          The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in
          a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire
          for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over
          the pandemic..."<br>
