            <b><br>
            </b>The danger from the Global Warming crowd is that they
            are misleading the entire world and preventing us from what
            is dangerously unfolding that sparks the rapid decline in
            civilization – GLOBAL COOLING. I previously warned that this
            is not my opinion, but simply our computer. If it were
            really conscious it would be running to store to buy heating
            pads. This year will be much colder for Europe than the last
            three. It will also be cold in the USA. We are in a global
            cooling period and all the data we have in our computer
            system warns that the earth is turning cold not warm.<br>
            <br>
            This cooling is very serious. This decline in the energy
            output of the sun will manifest in a commodity boom in
            agriculture as shortages send food prices higher. We will
            see famine begin to rise as crops fail and that will inspire
            disease and plagues. We will see the first peak in
            agricultural prices come probably around 2024 after the lows
            are established on this cycle. We have been warning that
            this rise would begin AFTER 2017.<br>
            <br>
            Previously, I have reported that NASA confirmed we are going
            into a cooling period – not warming. They have put out a
            forecast of declining sunspot activity. Now NASA has come
            out confirming what our computer has been forecasting. They
            have reported that as the sun is experiencing a rapid
            decline in sunspots, it is also dimming in brightness or
            energy output. NASA’s Spaceweather station has recorded
            during 2017, 96 days (27%) of observing the sun have been
            completely absent of sunspots.<br>
            <br>
            I have also previously warned that there is a 300-year cycle
            to this entire phenomenon. This cycle has aligned with the
            major turning point of the Economic Confidence Model
            2015.75. During 2015, there were ZERO days observed without
            sunspots. The following year, 2016, came in with 9% of the
            days recorded without any sunspot activity. This jump to 27%
            here in 2017 is a substantial jump from 2015 that we cannot
            afford to ignore.<br>
            <br>
            NASA launched a new sensor which is the International Space
            Station named TSIS-1. Its mission is to actually measure the
            dimming of the sun’s irradiance. It will replace the aging
            SORCE spacecraft and NASA has confirmed our computer
            forecast that the number of sunspots in this cycle will fall
            rapidly as it plunges into a date with its 11-year cycle
            minimum.<br>
            <br>
            There was a sharp climate drop in 1916 creating a spike low
            in temperature. This 1916 spike low in our climate coincided
            with war and made this a devastating war aside from the
            poison gas. This was then combined with terrible influenza
            or flu pandemic of 1918 to 1919, which was the deadliest in
            modern history. This pandemic infected an estimated 500
            million people worldwide or about one-third of the entire
            planet’s population. It killed an estimated 20 to 50 million
            victims.<br>
            <br>
            This pandemic began in the spring of 1917 and some sources
            point to troops in France as being the center of the
            pandemic. A significant precursor virus, harbored in birds,
            mutated to pigs that were kept near the front. Others place
            it with troops in Austria. Nevertheless, influenza ran from
            mid-1917, became noticeable by January 1918, and continued
            into December 1920. The unusually deadly influenza pandemic
            shortened the overall life expectancy by 12 years. This
            influenza killed the strong rather than the weak since it
            thrived on the overreaction of the body’s immune system. The
            strong immune reactions of young adults fed the virus,
            whereas the weaker immune systems of children and
            middle-aged adults resulted in fewer deaths, which was very
            unusual.<br>
            <b><br>
            </b>Across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, the sun’s
            output is declining. I personally hate cold. So this is not
            a forecast I want to see happen. Nevertheless, our computer
            has correlated this cooling trend with disease and it
            appears that famine also plays a role in this entire event.
            Additionally, a simple correlation with the energy output of
            the sun reveals that all major earthquakes occurred during
            strong solar minimums, which we are head smack into.<br>
            <br>
            Consequently, there were 7 major earthquakes of 8.0
            magnitude moving into the turning point in 2008-2010. Kiril
            Islands (Russia) twice- 8.1 (November 2006 &amp; January
            2007), Peru-8.0 (August 2007), Sumatra-8.5 (September 2007),
            Sichuan earthquake-8.0 (May 2008), Samoa-8.1 (September
            2009), Maule (Chile)-8.8 (February 2010).<br>

            </b>WikiLeaks has released a John Podesta email that sheds
            light on the artificial sweetener aspartamethat is anything
            but sweet. Besides pointing out how gravely dangerous
            NutraSweet is, the leaked email also shows the treachery
            involved in getting the adulterant approved as a food
            ingredient. According to Wise Mind Healthy Body, an email
            chain was forwarded to Podesta by a Wendy Abrams, in which
            she writes, “I also have a friend who worked for the
            researchers at University of Chicago (which has a top rated
            neurology dept) and the doctors there said when they gave
            nutrasweet to lab mice, it literally blew holes in their
            brains. They said they will tell a pregnant woman to drink
            any amount of alcohol before touching a sip of nutrasweet,
            it is that bad.”<br>
            <br>
            In back and forth emails between Abrams and a man named Don
            Kennedy, the latter explains how aspartame came to be
            legalized:<br>
            <br>
            “He explains that the day after Ronald Reagan’s
            inauguration, January 21, 1981, Searle – the original
            developer of aspartame – applied to the FDA for approval to
            use aspartame in food sweetener for a second time [aspartame
            was previously banned]. Arthur Hayes Hull, Jr., Reagan’s
            newly appointed FDA commissioner, proceeded to appoint a
            5-person scientific commission to review the board of
            inquiry’s decision. When it became clear that the panel was
            going to uphold the ban with a 3–2 decision, Hull placed a
            sixth member on the commission so the vote would become
            deadlocked. Then Hull personally broke the tie in
            aspartame’s favor.”...<b><br>

            <br>
            Infowars.com has learned former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe
            Arpaio’s investigators had discovered bombshell evidence
            that the CIA and or other government entities illegally
            hacked into Hawaii Department of Health records searching
            for birth records on Barack Obama.<br>
            <br>
            According to information received by the investigators, the
            government breaches began on Nov. 14, 2008, just after Obama
            won his first presidential election, and continued until
            Jan. 12, 2011, three months before the White House released
            a computer version of what President Obama claimed was his
            authentic “Long-Form Birth Certificate” from 1961...<br>

            <b>CIA breaches Hawaii government computers in Obama birth
              certificate quest</b><br>
            <br>
            Sheriff Arpaio and Chief Investigator Zullo have identified
            in the database the following breaches of known Hawaii
            government IP [Internet Protocol] address accessed by known
            CIA IP addresses that were used in the breaches: ... [IP
            addresses are being withheld due to security concerns.]<br>
            <br>
            Other data indicates the CIA also breached the University of
            Hawaii’s extensive records on Hawaii history and genealogy.<br>
            <br>
            The IP addresses, both from the Hawaii government offices
            breached and from the CIA proxy IP addresses used in the
            breaches.<br>
            <br>
            “Montgomery also traced the IP data paths of the breached
            servers and discovered on a number of occasions information
            was sent from the breached Hawaii computers, only to be
            routed to a sever located in Jakarta, Indonesia,” Zullo
            said.<br>
            <br>
            From Indonesia, the data was sent back through the server in
            Jakarta, routed back to government servers in the United
            States.&nbsp; Montgomery claims the server used in Jakarta
            was operated by the CIA at the time the breaches were
            executed.”<br>

            </b><br>
            Conservatism has all-too-often found itself unable to
            articulate a coherent positive doctrine. By this I mean
            specifically that the laudable conservative tendency to
            preserve the best of past has too-often manifested itself in
            a series of "thou shalt not" statements, instead of laying
            out a manifesto of fundamental values that might serve to
            unite people around a set of common ambitions. I am
            attempting to rectify this problem with this statement of
            principles, some of which I believe might have the
            additional virtue of being attractive to young people,
            looking for mature and forthright purpose and
            responsibility. <br>
            I am not making the claim that the statement is perfect,
            comprehensive or final.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Background to the talk: </b><br>
            <br>
            I spoke at Carleton Place, a town in Lanark County,
            Thursday, June 15/17. I was invited by Randy Hillier, who is
            a Member of Provincial Parliament for Ontario
            (randyhilliermpp.com). <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;Tenets of a viable 21st century conservatism 1. The
            fundamental assumptions of Western civilization are valid.
            2. Peaceful social being is preferable to isolation and to
            war. In consequence, it justly and rightly demands some
            sacrifice of individual impulse and idiosyncrasy. 3.
            Hierarchies of competence are desirable and should be
            promoted. 4. Borders are reasonable. Likewise, limits on
            immigration are reasonable. Furthermore, it should not be
            assumed that citizens of societies that have not evolved
            functional individual-rights predicated polities will hold
            values in keeping with such polities. 5. People should be
            paid so that they are able and willing to perform socially
            useful and desirable duties. 6. Citizens have the
            inalienable right to benefit from the result of their own
            honest labor. 7. It is more noble to teach young people
            about responsibilities than about rights. 8. It is better to
            do what everyone has always done, unless you have some
            extraordinarily valid reason to do otherwise. 9. Radical
            change should be viewed with suspicion, particularly in a
            time of radical change. 10. The government, local and
            distal, should leave people to their own devices as much as
            possible. 11. Intact heterosexual two-parent families
            constitute the necessary bedrock for a stable polity. 12. We
            should judge our political system in comparison to other
            actual political systems and not to hypothetical utopias.<br>

            The researchers believe that the superconductive electrical

            MOSCOW, December 13. /TASS/. Researchers from the Siberian
            Federal University (SFU) and the Krasnoyarsk Research Center
            at RAS’ Siberian Division have created particles, which
            demonstrate superconductive properties at room temperature,
            the SFU press office reported. This breakthrough opens the
            door to next-generation electro-technical devices. A
            research article on the matter was published in the Journal
            of Superconductivity and Novel Magnetism.<br>
            <br>
            "The increase of current density and unit power, as well as
            the presence of unique physical features which are
            exclusively characteristic for superconductors, predetermine
            the development of superefficient electro-technical
            devices," Chief of UNESCO’s Research and Educational Center
            "New Materials and Technologies" at SFU Anatoly Lepeshev
            said.<br>
            Superconductivity is the ability of some materials to
            transmit an electric current with zero resistance.
            Superconductors are used to create a powerful magnetic
            field, for example, in maglevs, trains levitating at a
            magnetic cushion, in particle accelerators, and in
            tomography for medical diagnostics. The effect of
            superconductivity appears up to now only at extremely low
            temperatures, lower than minus (-100) degrees Centigrade.<br>
            <br>
            The scientists from SFU and Krasnoyarsk Research Center
            applied the Arc-PVD method to synthesize particles comprised
            of one atom of copper and two atoms of oxygen (CuO2) which
            do not exist in nature. The modification has led to the
            appearance of superconductive properties of particles in a
            certain range of magnetic fields (larger than 3 kOe).<br>
            <br>
            Now, the researchers have to overcome the challenge of
            combining the CuO2 nanoparticles into a joint material.
            Consequently, this substance will have a significant feature
            - superconductivity at room temperature, which will open
            wide prospects for its use.<br>
            <br>
            The authors of the study note also that the superconductive
            electrical devices will make it possible to noticeably
            increase power, current density, and some other key
            characteristics of electrical networks. Moreover, these new
            devices are safer for the environment, and the costs of mass
            production are lower than gadgets used nowadays.<br>

            A newly-developed process could create fuel from our waste.
            Researchers at the Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest
            National Laboratory have created a method to turn ordinary
            sewage and other organic waste into biocrude oil.<br>
            <br>
            It may sound like fiction, it does sound yucky, but one day,
            wastewater treatment plants may be powering your car. The
            Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
            researchers have developed a novel process, which they call
            hydrothermal liquefaction, that mimics the geological
            conditions involved in creating crude oil. Using high
            pressures and temperatures, they only need a few minutes and
            the stuff we flush down our toilets to create a liquid that
            takes millions of years to form in nature...<br>
            <br>
            ....Through HTL, organic matter is pressurized to 3,000
            pounds per square inch (about 100 times the pressure in a
            car tire), then fed into a reactor system which cooks it to
            660 degrees Fahrenheit (350 Celsius). These extreme
            conditions break the matter down to its simple chemical
            compounds — the cells in the material rip apart, forming
            biocrude and an aqueous-liquid phase.<br>

        George Merkl is a nuclear physicist and president of Life
        Crystal Incorporated in El Paso, Texas. He has conducted
        research for the past 30 years in his own research laboratories,
        and holds more than 40 U.S., and hundreds of international
        patents on his discoveries and inventions. Dr. Merkl is listed
        in "Who's Who Among the Pioneers in Science Today". His latest
        discovery is the present discovery particle biochemistry and the
        secret of life. He is the author of "Inner Space (Unified
        Theory)", and he has discovered a new treatment which can cure
        AIDS, cancer, and many other degenerative diseases.<br>
        <br>
        LIFE CRYSTAL<br>
        <br>
        Before I start, I would like to explain the difference between
        Life Crystal and Chondriana. Life Crystal does not contain
        Chondriana and Life Crystal cannot induce Chondriana into your
        body although some counterfeit products indicate the contrary.
        Life Crystal is produced by extracting adenosine phosphates,
        guanosine phosphates and five carbon sugars from off the shelf
        food items. It is a material with very high purity. The F.D.A.
        in the United States approved adenosine in 1989 and adenosine
        monophosphate 20 years ago, and they know exactly what they do.
        When a patient is taken to the hospital with a coronary attack,
        this is the first thing they give them to save their lives. The
        injection contains three milligrams and it costs $3,000 per
        injection. That makes it a million dollars a gram. We have ten
        grams of adenosine in every bottle of Life Crystal drink.<br>
        <br>
        When the adenosine and adenosine phosphate, guanosine and
        guanosine phosphate are crystallized and dissolved in double
        distilled water, they depolarize the water. The Life Crystal has
        the same tetrahedral structure as the water, with matching
        frequencies, and therefore it can charge the water with enough
        energy to change the polarity of the water. Once it changes the
        polarity of the water, it will lose the affinity to hydrophilic
        molecules and pick up affinity towards hydrophobic molecules. In
        layman's terms, this means it can dissolve double carbon bonds,
        hydrocarbons, waxes, cholesterols, plaques and sugar deposits,
        and this enables it to clean out the blood vessels. Most of the
        time when an organ fails, it fails because of lack of
        respiration and lack of circulation. Once you clean out the
        blood vessels and re-establish circulation, the organs will
        recover.<br>
        <br>
        Life Crystal has a tetrahedral structure like a pyramid. Because
        of the shape of the tetrahedral crystal, it develops a vortex
        field around the pyramid and then the crystal will deposit
        around the pyramid in a vortex coil. This is the reason why Life
        Crystal can tap into the energy of creation. Light is made up of
        free energy, 918 pairs of scrolls which make up one photon, and
        this is the breath of creation, or the breath of God, whatever
        you want to call it. Without that, life cannot exist. We can
        break down light for the first time. The 918 pairs of photons
        then mould into one electron and 918 pairs of electrons mould
        into one neutron. That is the way free energy is moulded into
        light and light is moulded into matter. We are all made of the
        same substance. This is the reason the Life Crystal is capable
        of tapping into the life energy which is a prerequisite for
        life.<br>
        <br>
        CHONDRIANA<br>
        <br>
        The Chondriana are human in origin. They are our precursors.
        They are micro-organisms which have been synthesized from human
        DNA. The Chondriana existed three and a half billion years ago.
        We had life forms back then that were capable of reproducing or
        mass producing all our organs. There is a micro-organism which
        has been found fossilized in western Australia dated three and a
        half billion years. It is identical to the Chondriana. Every
        organelle in our cells was at one time produced by similar
        Chondriana. In other words, we had life forms, back three and a
        half billion years ago that were capable of reproducing all our
        organs. We had factories in our cells, which we do not have
        today, which produced the organelles inside our cells.<br>
        <br>
        With a reverse procedure, we can recreate those factories in our
        cells and that is what I have done. I took the organelles inside
        our cells and recreated all the factories from which those
        organelles had originated. I was able to produce Chondriana,
        mass producing centrioles, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus and all
        the different organs, including the cell nucleus and cell
        nucleolus.<br>
        <br>
        This means we can bring back our defence system, the defence
        cells we once used to have but which we lost because the sun is
        cooling and we are losing energy. We are not going through
        evolution; we are going through devolution. Our cells are
        becoming punier and punier as time goes on. The massive carbon
        dioxide blankets we are putting up in the sky is accelerating
        the process. But now, re-introducing Life Crystal into the
        system, we can re-awaken our old immune system. We can bring
        back the old giant lymphocytes which are able to protect us.<br>
        <br>
        CIRCULATORY PROBLEMS AND HEART DISEASE<br>
        <br>
        Many clinics are using Life Crystal for chelation. They are
        replacing E.D.T.A. with Life Crystal to clean the blood vessels
        and they are getting much better results. When someone is on
        Life Crystal, even just as a nutritional supplement taken
        orally, if they take it every day, even if their arteries are
        98% plugged, there is no need for heart surgery, and within one
        year the arteries will be cleaned. The body water will dissolve
        the cholesterol and they will urinate off the fat. Chelation may
        be done in two ways using Life Crystal. We recommend a teaspoon
        three times a day for the oral dose. The intravenous treatment
        is given at half a c.c. per week.<br>
        <br>
        DIABETES<br>
        <br>
        Life Crystal cleans out the blood vessels and restores
        circulation. When Life Crystal is administered intravenously to
        a diabetic who needs a kidney transplant, in five weeks, the
        kidneys function normally. If diabetics are scheduled for a leg
        amputation, in five weeks, Life Crystal will dissolve the sugar
        deposits, restore respiration and nutrient flow, eliminate
        claudication, and they can go jogging. We have diabetics now
        whose eyesight has also been restored.<br>
        <br>
        OTHER DISEASES<br>
        <br>
        We have ample clinical evidence from all over the world that
        Life Crystal helps restore health. We have had a few cases of
        Parkinson's Disease and our treatment was successful. We are
        very effective against cancer, environmental illness and all
        diseases. We get a 100% response with HIV, AIDS. We have some
        people now who have been cured from AIDS. All the lupus
        diseases, rheumatic arthritis, circulatory problems, diabetes
        and so on. When people have coronary heart attacks, they may
        administer it every day. Someone who has a serious problem such
        as kidney failure, claudications or blindness, should use the
        intravenous method because it is quicker. In five weeks it
        restores the circulation and respiration, and cleans out the
        blood vessels. Because the Chondriana are precursors of our
        origin, they are part of us. Therefore, you are not taking drugs
        or chemicals.<br>
        <br>
        ACTION OF THE CHONDRIANA IN OUR SYSTEM<br>
        <br>
        Q: How do the Chondriana interact with pathogens and viruses? A:
        The Chondriana themselves are militant. They attack the disease
        directly. They attack it physically, consuming it. Their
        membranes are invasive, so they attack the disease, take it
        apart and recycle it. They break down the genetic material all
        the way to ribosomes and recycle them into their own sequence.
        They grow up on it. They can also produce interferon and
        interleuken II. They can stimulate the T-4 and T-8 cell
        production, or they can pick up the frequency of your immune
        cells and reproduce them. They can reproduce dozens of different
        types of macrophages, each of which has a different type of
        function. They produce oscillators of many different types,
        immune cells which break up the disease and then come and clean
        up like a vacuum cleaner. The Chondriana's mouth is like a sack.
        It is like a shutter of a camera. The neck can narrow and open
        and they use it like a vacuum cleaner. They just mop up the
        disease. Because they are super intelligent, they know the
        sequence of life. They can sequence the DNA molecule to make all
        kinds of life forms. They can make life like you make breakfast.
        They are far more intelligent than we are and they are our
        ancestors.<br>
        <br>
        Q: Are the Chondriana not rejected in the same way an organ
        implant from another person is rejected? A: The Chondriana do
        not come from another person. The Chondriana belong to everyone.
        It doesn't type to my person or any person. When the Chondriana
        are injected into your blood stream, the Chondriana's genetic
        material goes into your blood cells, blows itself up four times
        the size, and you start mass producing your own Chondriana.<br>
        <br>
        Q: Does the human system have Chondriana already? A: In
        dormancy. We used to have it, but we don't have it any more.
        Only the information on the DNA.<br>
        <br>
        Q: Is Life Crystal dependent upon Chondriana? A: No because Life
        Crystal by itself is basically rebuilding, restoring,
        rejuvenating and cleaning out the blood vessels, restoring the
        circulation, respiration and providing nutrients. Ninety-five
        percent of your energy comes from ATP, and Life Crystal is
        loaded with ATP. But you can't make Chondriana without Life
        Crystal.<br>
        <br>
        MAKING OF LIFE CRYSTAL<br>
        <br>
        Q: What is Life Crystal and how do you make it? A: Life Crystal
        is made up of adenosine phosphate, guanosine phosphate and five
        carbon sugars. Our DNA molecules are made from it. They are the
        basic building blocks of life. We take this from plants. The
        adenosine and guanosine phosphates come from genetic material of
        plants, like lettuce, tea etc. The five carbon sugars come from
        fruit juices, organically produced, very high purity fruit
        juices. You reap off the carbon and you have five carbon sugars.
        You add a phosphate to it and you have sugar phosphate (fructose
        and glucose phosphates). These are intermediates in the process
        of a new cell making ATP.<br>
        <br>
        DOSAGE OF CHONDRIANA AND LIFE CRYSTAL<br>
        <br>
        Q: Can you take Life Crystal and Chondriana at the same time? A:
        You can take them independently or you can take them together.
        You put Life Crystal under your tongue. Keep it in your mouth
        for a minute or two, let it absorb before swallowing it. We
        usually recommend a teaspoon. There is no shelf life limit. The
        longer you keep it, the better it is. You can keep it on the
        shelf. You don't have to refrigerate it until you open it. We
        recommend that people use Chondriana if they are sick. If they
        have a bacterial or viral disease, they use half and half: half
        Life Crystal and half Chondriana, since the Life Crystal helps
        to open up the fine blood vessels. When the Chondriana go after
        the disease and kill it, the waste and the toxins can be drained
        much faster because your fine blood vessels are open and you
        have a much lower reaction.<br>
        <br>
        SAFETY OF LIFE CRYSTAL AND ITS USE IN PREGNANCY AND FOR
        INCREASING FERTILITY<br>
        <br>
        Q: Is Life Crystal safe to take whether you are sick or not? A:
        Absolutely. It is very safe. The youngest person to take it is
        four months old. My wife just gave birth to a baby girl and she
        was taking it all through her pregnancy. She was also on
        Chondriana treatment. It is safe to take the nutritional
        supplement, one teaspoon three times a day, not the injectable.
        It is absolutely safe. It will be very interesting to see what
        effects it had on the child. She is too young to draw blood and
        test it, but I will test her later. We have three Chondriana
        babies from different families. Two of them couldn't conceive
        previously. Once they went on Life Crystal, they conceived
        within two or three months because Life Crystal will speed up
        the proliferation of primordial cells, the sex cells, and make
        them very strong. The children are very strong and very healthy
        and all three of them are pretty close to nine pounds and were
        born at eight months, not nine months, and they turned around at
        three months. My wife and I had three other children before and
        this pregnancy was entirely different from the others.<br>
        <br>
        ASTHMA AND EPILEPSY<br>
        <br>
        Q: We have a boy who has chronic asthma. Can he be helped with
        Life Crystal? A: We have a lot of little boys who are just on
        Life Crystal drink alone whose asthma is disappearing. We have a
        lot of children in countries where their mothers were exposed to
        harmful chemicals or insecticides when they were pregnant. All
        these children were born with epilepsy and seizures. They had
        200 to 400 seizures a month, and some had 10 seizures a day.
        They went on Life Crystal drink alone, nothing else, and within
        two months they were normal.<br>
        <br>
        CANDIDA AND EPSTEIN BARR SYNDROME<br>
        <br>
        Q: Is Life Crystal effective for Candida? A: Candida occurs most
        of the time in association with Epstein Barr syndrome. It is a
        major epidemic in English speaking countries. United States have
        60 million Epstein Barr cases and only five percent of the
        population know that they have it. It spreads from passing
        around the bottle. You are spreading it by saliva, drinking or
        eating after someone else. It stays dormant for 15 years, but
        once it breaks out and gets into the active state, you start
        developing the Candidas. Candida eats away your glucose and
        deprives you of ATP, because ATP is made from glucose. Your
        organ cells degenerate, and as a result the disease moves in,
        and the immune cells degenerate, so more disease moves in. Your
        immune cells are not capable of defending you. If you supplement
        ATP, you can freeze the disease, sort of put it on the shelf,
        because you keep your organ cells and your immune cells happy.
        Then you can lead a normal life and you eliminate your chronic
        fatigue. Chronic fatigue occurs because your cells are starved.
        They don't have ATP. Ninety-five percent of energy comes from
        ATP. If you want to get rid of the disease, you have to go
        through Chondriana treatment, 30 injections, which give very
        strong reactions, but you can get rid of the virus. Epstein Barr
        is called the cousin of AIDS. AIDS destroys the immune cells
        directly. In Epstein Barr and Candida, the immune cells are
        starved by deprivation of ATP.<br>
        <br>
        Q: How do you know how many injections to use for the Epstein
        Barr virus? A: In order to determine the number of injections to
        use, we do blood tests. We look for the immunoglobulins. The
        level should be below 20. The more advanced your Epstein Barr
        is, the higher the level is. If someone had 600, they have
        probably had Epstein Barr for about 25 years. If they had 1400,
        they may have had Epstein Barr for 35 years. Those are the final
        stages. In the final stages, Epstein Barr attacks the brain and
        the organs and destroys the organs; people cannot function any
        more.<br>
        <br>
        HEAVY METAL TOXICITY<br>
        <br>
        Q: Is Life Crystal effective against heavy metal toxicity
        including mercury? A: Yes. It is being used as a chelation
        agent. The Life Crystal is a very effective chelating agent but
        not necessarily for the removal of mercury.<br>
        <br>
        LUPUS<br>
        <br>
        Q: Have you had any success with lupus? A: We have very exciting
        results with lupus. We have lupus A, B, C and D. The lupus A
        attacks basically joints. Lupus B and C attack organs and lupus
        D attacks the brain. It usually takes about five or six
        injections to be on the safe side, 10 injections for sure gets
        rid of lupus of any kind, either A, B, C or D. Lupus also occurs
        together with hepatitis, because if you have B and C, they also
        attack your organs including the spleen, liver, kidney and bring
        in hepatitis. So in one sweep we can get rid of all the
        problems.<br>
        <br>
        AGING<br>
        <br>
        Q: Can Life Crystal be used for rejuvenation? A: We can
        reproduce primordial cells which can be turned into new young
        cells in order to reverse your ageing. You can restore your
        body, your organs and your tissues, and not only slow down, but
        actually reverse ageing.<br>
        <br>
        BALDNESS<br>
        <br>
        Q: Can Life Crystal be used for thinning hair and baldness? A:
        Well, look at my hair. Sixty percent of my hair is new and
        whatever I had before was completely white. It grew in about a
        year and a half. You can use it topically.<br>

        &nbsp;It killed 200 million European's in the 1300's: 2 bears
        found in California with the plague: Positive bear samples found
        in 32 counties in California.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        As the Pneumonic plague epidemic in Madagascar is claimed to be
        the biggest outbreak in 50 years,<br>
        the disease which killed an estimated 200 million Europeans in
        the 1300's appears to be making a comeback!<br>
        <br>
        Two black bears exposed to the plague was found in Paradise,
        according to the California Department of Public Health.<br>
        <br>
        The department collected blood in September from two bears
        killed under depredation permits, and the samples tested
        positive for antibodies to Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that
        causes plague.<br>
        <br>
        The California Department of Fish and Wildlife issued the
        depredation permits.<br>
        <br>
        Tanya Espinosa, a spokesperson for U.S. Department of
        Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said
        she could not reveal the location the bears were found because
        they were not on public lands.<br>
        <br>
        They were removed by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services
        because they were damaging private lands and an agricultural
        resource, Espinosa said.<br>
        <br>
        The U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services routinely
        submits blood samples from bears and other predators it
        encounters in wildlife management activities.<br>
        <br>
        This is, in part, to determine whether they have been exposed to
        plague in the past.<br>
        <br>
        Plague is a flea-borne disease spread through contact with
        infected animals, dead or alive, and flea bites.<br>
        <br>
        In the 1300s, it killed millions in Europe and took on the name
        of the Black Death.<br>
        <br>
        Symptoms include fever, nausea, headaches, weakness and swollen,
        tender lymph nodes.<br>
        <br>
        If caught early, it's treatable in the modern age with
        antibiotics.<br>
        <br>
        Predators like bears often prey on rodents, which are the
        primary carriers of plague, according to the state Public Health
        Department.<br>
        <br>
        Historically, about 12 percent of bear samples have tested
        positive for plague antibodies, according to California
        Department of Public Health.<br>
        <br>
        Positive bear samples have been found in 32 counties in
        California.<br>
        <br>
        In June, July and August this year, the plague showed up in the
        U.S. Canada and Russia!<br>
        <br>
        In early August 2017, The Apache County Health Department
        recently notified the public about a new prairie dog die-off in
        Concho, Arizona.<br>
        <br>
        A previous die-off was reported in early July.<br>
        <br>
        The notice bluntly states that "Old Concho is now considered a
        plague-positive area."<br>
        <br>
        “Navajo County Health Department was also urging the public to
        take precautions to reduce their risk of exposure to this
        serious disease, after being found in rodents in the Arizona
        county.<br>
        <br>
        In June this year, two more cases of human plague were confirmed
        in New Mexico.<br>
        <br>
        The New Mexico Department of Health said a 52-year-old woman and
        a 62-year-old woman were recently diagnosed with the plague.
        According to health officials, the first confirmed case of the
        plague this year occurred in June when a 63-year-old man
        contracted the plague.<br>
        <br>
        All three patients, who live in Santa Fe County, were
        hospitalized but there were no deaths.<br>
        <br>
        In July this year, Parks Canada closed off a Saskatchewan
        national park's remote prairie dog colony to the public after
        two rodents from the area tested positive for sylvatic plague —
        the same bacteria that causes the bubonic and pneumonic plagues
        in humans.<br>
        <br>
        Also in July, The notorious bubonic plague, infected a Siberian
        youngster.<br>
        <br>
        A ten-year-old boy in Siberia's Altai Republic contracted
        bubonic plague, local medics told TASS news agency.<br>
        <br>
        "The boy was hospitalized with a high fever and tested positive
        for bubonic plague.<br>
        <br>
        His condition is not known.<br>
        <br>
        All the 17 people, including six children, with whom the boy had
        contact, were quarantined.<br>
        <br>
        According to the World Health Organization, more than 13,000
        people contracted bubonic plague in Asia, Africa and America
        between 2004 and 2013.<br>
        <br>
        Roughly 900 of them died from the disease.<br>
        <br>
        250 have died in Madagascar this year in just two and a half
        months, which is thought to be the biggest outbreak in 50 years.<br>

        <br>
        The team studied non-doped crystals of the oft-analyzed

        and reproduced their surprising results five times on different
        cleaved crystals. University of Amsterdam Professor of Physics
        Jasper van Wezel provided crucial theoretical interpretation of
        the experimental results.<br>
        <br>
        So what exactly is excitonium?<br>
        <br>
        Excitonium is a condensate -- it exhibits macroscopic quantum
        phenomena, like a superconductor, or superfluid, or insulating
        electronic crystal. It's made up of excitons, particles that are
        formed in a very strange quantum mechanical pairing, namely that
        of an escaped electron and the hole it left behind...<br>

        <br>
        Excitons—bound states of electrons and holes in solids—are
        expected to form a Bose condensate at sufficiently low
        temperatures. Excitonic condensation has been studied in systems
        such as quantum Hall bilayers where physical separation between
        electrons and holes enables a longer lifetime for their bound
        states. Kogar et al. observed excitons condensing in the
        three-dimensional semimetal 1T-TiSe2. In such systems,
        distinguishing exciton condensation from other types of order is
        tricky. To do so, the authors used momentum-resolved electron
        energy-loss spectroscopy, a technique developed to probe
        electronic collective excitations. The energy needed to excite
        an electronic mode became negligible at a finite momentum,
        signifying the formation of a condensate.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Bose condensation has shaped our understanding of macroscopic
        quantum phenomena, having been realized in superconductors,
        atomic gases, and liquid helium. Excitons are bosons that have
        been predicted to condense into either a superfluid or an
        insulating electronic crystal. Using the recently developed
        technique of momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy
        (M-EELS), we studied electronic collective modes in the
        transition metal dichalcogenide semimetal 1T-TiSe2. Near the
        phase-transition temperature (190 kelvin), the energy of the
        electronic mode fell to zero at nonzero momentum, indicating
        dynamical slowing of plasma fluctuations and crystallization of
        the valence electrons into an exciton condensate. Our study
        provides compelling evidence for exciton condensation in a
        three-dimensional solid and establishes M-EELS as a versatile
        technique sensitive to valence band excitations in quantum
        materials.<br>

              worsened memory and learning ability in Alzheimer's</b><br>
          </font></div>
        <br>
        Canola oil is one of the most widely consumed vegetable oils in
        the world, yet surprisingly little is known about its effects on
        health. Now, a new study published online December 7 in the
        journal Scientific Reports by researchers at the Lewis Katz
        School of Medicine at Temple University (LKSOM) associates the
        consumption of canola oil in the diet with worsened memory,
        worsened learning ability and weight gain in mice which model
        Alzheimer's disease. The study is the first to suggest that
        canola oil is more harmful than healthful for the brain.<br>
        <br>
        "Canola oil is appealing because it is less expensive than other
        vegetable oils, and it is advertised as being healthy,"
        explained Domenico Praticò, MD, Professor in the Departments of
        Pharmacology and Microbiology and Director of the Alzheimer's
        Center at LKSOM, as well as senior investigator on the study.
        "Very few studies, however, have examined that claim, especially
        in terms of the brain."<br>
        <br>
        Curious about how canola oil affects brain function, Dr. Praticò
        and Elisabetta Lauretti, a graduate student in Dr. Pratico's
        laboratory at LKSOM and co-author on the new study, focused
        their work on memory impairment and the formation of amyloid
        plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in an Alzheimer's disease
        mouse model. Amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau, which is
        responsible for the formation of tau neurofibrillary tangles,
        contribute to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration and memory
        loss in Alzheimer's disease. The animal model was designed to
        recapitulate Alzheimer's in humans, progressing from an
        asymptomatic phase in early life to full-blown disease in aged
        animals.<br>
        <br>
        Dr. Praticò and Lauretti had previously used the same mouse
        model in an investigation of olive oil, the results of which
        were published earlier in 2017. In that study, they found that
        Alzheimer mice fed a diet enriched with extra-virgin olive oil
        had reduced levels of amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau and
        experienced memory improvement. For their latest work, they
        wanted to determine whether canola oil is similarly beneficial
        for the brain.<br>
        <br>
        The researchers started by dividing the mice into two groups at
        six months of age, before the animals developed signs of
        Alzheimer's disease. One group was fed a normal diet, while the
        other was fed a diet supplemented with the equivalent of about
        two tablespoons of canola oil daily.<br>
        <br>
        The researchers then assessed the animals at 12 months. One of
        the first differences observed was in body weight -- animals on
        the canola oil-enriched diet weighed significantly more than
        mice on the regular diet. Maze tests to assess working memory,
        short-term memory, and learning ability uncovered additional
        differences. Most significantly, mice that had consumed canola
        oil over a period of six months suffered impairments in working
        memory.<br>
        <br>
        Examination of brain tissue from the two groups of mice revealed
        that canola oil-treated animals had greatly reduced levels of
        amyloid beta 1-40. Amyloid beta 1-40 is the more soluble form of
        the amyloid beta proteins. It generally is considered to serve a
        beneficial role in the brain and acts as a buffer for the more
        harmful insoluble form, amyloid beta 1-42.<br>
        <br>
        As a result of decreased amyloid beta 1-40, animals on the
        canola oil diet further showed increased formation of amyloid
        plaques in the brain, with neurons engulfed in amyloid beta
        1-42. The damage was accompanied by a significant decrease in
        the number of contacts between neurons, indicative of extensive
        synapse injury. Synapses, the areas where neurons come into
        contact with one another, play a central role in memory
        formation and retrieval.<br>
        <br>
        "Amyloid beta 1-40 neutralizes the actions of amyloid 1-42,
        which means that a decrease in 1-40, like the one observed in
        our study, leaves 1-42 unchecked," Dr. Praticò explained. "In
        our model, this change in ratio resulted in considerable
        neuronal damage, decreased neural contacts, and memory
        impairment."<br>
        <br>
        The findings suggest that long-term consumption of canola oil is
        not beneficial to brain health. "Even though canola oil is a
        vegetable oil, we need to be careful before we say that it is
        healthy," Dr. Praticò said. "Based on the evidence from this
        study, canola oil should not be thought of as being equivalent
        to oils with proven health benefits."<br>
        <br>
        The next step is to carry out a study of shorter duration to
        determine the minimum extent of exposure necessary to produce
        observable changes in the ratio of amyloid beta 1-42 to 1-40 in
        the brain and alter synapse connections. A longer study may be
        warranted in order to determine whether canola oil also
        eventually impacts tau phosphorylation, since no effects on tau
        were observed over the six-month exposure period.<br>
        <br>
        "We also want to know whether the negative effects of canola oil
        are specific for Alzheimer's disease," Dr. Praticò added. "There
        is a chance that the consumption of canola oil could also affect
        the onset and course of other neurodegenerative diseases or
        other forms of dementia."<br>

        The widespread use of air guns in underwater seismic surveys
        could be dramatically reducing populations of the microscopic
        animals at the base of the marine food chain.<br>

        e is not well understood. Robert McCauley at Curtin University
        in Perth, Australia, and his team decided to investigate the
        effects of air-gun signals, similar to those used for the
        detection of oil reserves, in a bay in Tasmania. They towed nets
        through the water before and after firing an air gun, and found
        that the abundance of collected zooplankton fell by more than
        60% within an hour of the noise impulse, and that the number of
        dead animals more than doubled.<br>
        <br>
        Sonar measurements suggest that zooplankton abundance dropped
        more than a kilometre away from the source of the gun shot....<br>

            <b>by Kate Kelland</b></font><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        Doctors in France have found the first evidence that a drug
        normally used to treat lung, kidney or skin cancer may be able
        to eradicate HIV-infected cells in people with the AIDS virus.<br>
        <br>
        In a case described as potentially exciting by scientists who
        also advised caution, doctors said a 51-year old man given
        nivolumab - sold as Opdivo by Bristol-Myers Squibb - saw a
        “drastic and persistent decrease” in the reservoirs of cells
        where HIV normally hides away and evades standard treatments.<br>
        <br>
        The case, at the Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital AP-HP in Paris, was
        detailed in a report in the Annals of Oncology journal, where
        the same doctors also gave a case study of another patient
        treated with Opdivo who did not show any HIV benefit.<br>
        <br>
        “We must remain careful, especially because this is only one
        case,” said Jean-Philippe Spano, a professor and head of the
        medical oncology department at the Paris hospital. “This is the
        first case of such a drastic decrease of the HIV reservoir (but)
        we have...another case where there was no decrease.” ...<br>

        <div align="center"><b> </b><b>BRONNIKOV METHOD "INFORMATION
            HUMAN DEVELOPMENT"</b><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        The method invented by Vyacheslav M. Bronnikov represents the
        combination of the most effective exercises that have been
        mostly taken from different eastern gymnastics for the purpose
        of their highest possible efficiency. The sharp increase in
        human energy potential and synchronization of both cerebral
        hemispheres activity arise from the training according to
        Bronnikov method. As a result hidden unclaimed abilities and
        potentialities of human organism come to light. Furthermore a
        person switches on the contact with one?s super-consciousness.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Cognize yourself, and you cognize whole world</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Man has tremendous abilities, but they are unclaimed because we
        live in technogenic world, shifting performance of many vital
        activities on technical equipment. The volume of the information
        coming to the world now is doubled each 3-4 years, and the
        further, the less this interval! The human mind has not time not
        only to realize and process, but even to perceive the coming
        information! Necessity to correspond to surrounding world
        becomes a condition of a survival of the man and humanity.<br>
        <br>
        Most logically in the given situation is to try to change
        itself. And the real way to achieve it consists in activization
        of not involved parts of own brain. Undoubtedly, that the person
        whom brain works not on 3%-5% as at a great bulk of people, but
        at least on 10%-20%, possesses not only much greater
        adaptability, but also powerful developmental ability.<br>
        <br>
        It is known for a long time, that the right hemisphere of a
        brain is connected with the information phenomena which contact
        to non-material space. This hemisphere of creative people
        functions well. Such people receive the information through
        Super consciousness from a uniform information field. The left
        hemisphere is connected with the material phenomena. If its work
        is disturbed, our body develops various pathologies. In total
        the degree of our consciousness and all organism development
        depends on harmonious work of both hemispheres as a whole.<br>
        <br>
        Vyacheslav M. Bronnikov has offered humanity a unique method of
        development which wakens super psychic abilities incorporated in
        the person from a birth. The method unites modern and ancient
        knowledge on bio-energy and represents a certain algorithm of
        brain development. It is the new integrated psychology forming
        the Homo Conscious, living by knowledge about future, from the
        Homo Reasonable, living empirically.<br>
        <br>
        Some words about the author of a method. He was born and has
        grown in Feodossiya. In his family there were 7 inquisitors (one
        of them - the main inquisitor of Spain, whose godfather was
        Charles V). One of his ancestors participated in building of
        fleet on Azov sea, two others were admirals of the Russian
        fleet. All ancestors possessed art talent. Vyacheslav in the
        first class blinded a bouquet of roses from plasticine ? they
        were like real roses. With especial warmth Vyacheslav
        Mikhajlovich thinks of his grandmother who possessed unusual
        power (many even considered she is witch) and deep esoteric
        knowledge, and gave a lot to her grandson. Till 7 the boy was
        strongly ill, not once he was between life and death. When he
        was 2.5 he has been strongly frightened, began to stammer and
        has almost ceased to speak.<br>
        <br>
        Being the child, he saw world around absolutely differently,
        than other people. His consciousness was fixing the first "the
        subtle-material world", energy-informational structures of
        people, material objects and the nature, and only then -
        everything that we usually see. All his attempts to explain it
        to adults did not have any success. He had noticed that adults
        perceive identical objects absolutely differently. In process of
        becoming adult his abilities were developing and were far away
        from the standard, and the treatment of him by associates was
        more and more aggressive, his attitude of mind was accepted as
        pathology. As a result the state of his health (sight, hearing,
        coordination of movements, memory) has been sharply worsened,
        and speech has been suffered most of all. Doctors even advised
        to get used to an idea on dumbness.<br>
        <br>
        And in 1966 he met a person who saw something unusual in
        Bronnikov and asked him: "When you close your eyes, can you
        see?" "Yes", - the boy has answered. "And what do you see?"
        "Everything: The red bus will come here from behind the corner."
        In a minute there was a bus. The person has been extremely
        surprised. To achieve such ability, it is necessary to be
        engaged 20-40 years, but Bronnikov was born with those
        abilities: to see inside itself, to see events. The subsequent
        meetings with the people possessing certain abilities, have
        helped him to understand, that he is absolutely healthy
        mentally, and have prompted him how gradually to restore the
        broken functions of the organism.<br>
        <br>
        V.M. Bronnikov was trained by different ways, but mainly
        knowledge was transmitted from consciousness to consciousness,
        during a sleep. Thus V.M. Bronnikov was trained since the
        childhood by the Dao monk. Such training at initiated appeared
        as School of Heavenly Immortal Sacred. Received knowledge
        Bronnikov has systematized and has founded the new science ?
        Cosmo-psycho-biology. In its basis there is one of directions of
        Dao yoga which secret knowledge of 5 thousands years were
        replenished, ground and transmitted by teachers to the selected
        followers. Followers should keep and fill up this knowledge,
        hiding them from a great bulk of people - because of
        unavailability of consciousness of mankind to accept this
        knowledge, as main Dao principle says ?a maturity, objectivity
        and timeliness of process!?<br>
        <br>
        The most important principle about which always Bronnikov speaks
        - "a step of the theory, a step of practice". If the person is
        strong in the theory, but nothing can practically do in a life,
        then it is a version of schizophrenia. The person, who is
        active, but not capable to explain anything, is the fanatic.
        Wise, putting sense, generates the theory and applies it into
        practice. Wise is the master. The task of Bronnikov and his
        method is the education of masters.<br>

        <br>
        Long before the discovery of "cold fusion" by Pons and
        Fleischman, other scientists had variously found phenomenal
        evidence of non-radioactive, low-energy transmutation of light
        elements in plant, animals and minerals. These reactions have
        come to be known as "biological transmutations" or
        "nuclido-biological reactions". This class of nuclear reactions
        is of great importance to the progress of human knowledge in the
        fields of physics, cosmology, biology, geology, ecology,
        medicine, nutrition and agriculture. The exact mechanisms of
        biological transmutations remain unknown, though a few theories
        have been proposed to explain them. Biological transmutations
        exist and cannot be denied; they are the very core of living
        nature, which could not function without them. The study of
        biological transmutation can be said to have begun in the 17th
        century with the famous experiment by von Helmont, who grew a
        willow tree in a clay vase with 200 pounds of soil. After 5
        years, he dried the soil and found that its weight had decreased
        by only 2 ounces: "Water alone had, therefore, been sufficient
        to produce 160 pounds of wood, bark and roots" (plus fallen
        leaves which he did not weigh). Presumably, there were some
        minerals in the water he fed to the tree. Nowadays we know that
        plants form carbohydrates from atmospheric carbon dioxide, but
        their mineral content is derived from soil, not air. It may be
        possible, however, that the ORMEs (Orbitally Rearranged
        Monoatomic Elements), discovered by David Hudson in the 1980s,
        exist in the atmosphere and are utilized by plants. In 1799, the
        French chemist Vauquelin became intrigued by the quantity of
        lime which hens excrete every day. He isolated a hen and fed it
        a pound of oats which were analyzed for lime (CaO). Vauquelin
        analyzed the eggs and feces and found five times more Ca was
        excreted than was consumed. He concluded that lime had been
        created, but could not figure out how it happened. <br>

        Mantra, sriyantra and pyramid power increases the plant growth
        and their positive energy has healing qualities. Experiment in
        the design 1 consists of germination of green gram with the
        influence of sriyantra and pyramid. Paper sriyantra and two
        models of pyramids were used. The control sample was kept under
        normal white paper. Result has shown that sample kept in plywood
        pyramid model have maximum percentage emergence and percentage
        change in radical length. In plastic pyramid sample has shown
        maximum percentage change in fresh weight of germinated seeds.
        Paper sriyantra sample has shown maximum percentage change in
        dry weight of germinated seeds. Experiment in the design 2,
        consists of two samples: control and mantra. Each sample
        contained total of 600 fenugreek seeds. Five trials were
        conducted with 120 seeds in each trial. Maha mrtyunjaya mantra
        was chanted for 108 times for sample treatment, twice a day at
        sunrise and at sunset. The result shown that sample treatment
        with maha mrtyunjaya mantra has 1% more in emergence,
        exponential significance in radical length, 0.33 gm more in
        fresh weight of emerged seeds and 0.02 gm more in dry weight of
        emerged seeds compared to control sample. <br>

              Benzoate is So Scary</b></font><br>

          <b>By Deborah Mitchell </b><br>

        <br>
        Sodium benzoate is a synthetic chemical produced when benzoic
        acid, which is found naturally in some fruits and spices, is
        combined with sodium hydroxide. Since sodium benzoate contains a
        natural ingredient, it is probably safe, right? After all, the
        US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Canadian Health
        Protection Branch have pronounced this chemical preservative to
        be acceptable when consumed in low amounts.<br>
        <br>
        In fact, the FDA has granted sodium benzoate GRAS (Generally
        Recognized as Safe) status, and the so-called safe limit in food
        is 0.1 percent by weight. In water, the acceptable limit, set by
        the Environmental Protection Agency, is 5 parts per billion
        (ppb). But this common food additive, which is found in
        carbonated sodas, fruit juice products, salad dressings, and
        fermented foods such as vinegar, wine, and pickles, is not
        natural nor safe. Here’s the story.<br>
        <br>
        Sodium benzoate is a sodium salt that is present at extremely
        low levels in berries, apples, plums, cinnamon, and several
        other natural foods. There’s nothing scary about the chemical in
        these items. But lab-synthesized sodium benzoate (and its close
        relative, benzoic acid) are a different story. When these
        preservatives are added to foods and to the interior of metal
        cans that contain beverages or liquid foods, they can have a
        detrimental effect on your health.<br>
        <br>
        For example, a small percentage of people are hypersensitive to
        sodium benzoate and can experience asthmatic attacks, hives, or
        other allergic reactions when they consume the preservative. A
        more common problem, however, is the combination of sodium
        benzoate and citric acid and/or ascorbic acid (vitamin C). When
        these ingredients get together, they form benzene, a
        cancer-causing chemical associated with leukemia and other blood
        cancers... <br>

        </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder of
        unknown aetiology. It is suggested to involve both genetic
        susceptibility and environmental factors including in the latter
        environmental toxins. Human exposure to the environmental toxin
        aluminium has been linked, if tentatively, to autism spectrum
        disorder. Herein we have used transversely heated graphite
        furnace atomic absorption spectrometry to measure, for the first
        time, the aluminium content of brain tissue from donors with a
        diagnosis of autism. We have also used an aluminium-selective
        fluor to identify aluminium in brain tissue using fluorescence
        microscopy. The aluminium content of brain tissue in autism was
        consistently high. The mean (standard deviation) aluminium
        content across all 5 individuals for each lobe were 3.82(5.42),
        2.30(2.00), 2.79(4.05) and 3.82(5.17) µg/g dry wt. for the
        occipital, frontal, temporal and parietal lobes respectively.
        These are some of the highest values for aluminium in human
        brain tissue yet recorded and one has to question why, for
        example, the aluminium content of the occipital lobe of a 15
        year old boy would be 8.74 (11.59) µg/g dry wt.?
        Aluminium-selective fluorescence microscopy was used to identify
        aluminium in brain tissue in 10 donors. While aluminium was
        imaged associated with neurones it appeared to be present
        intracellularly in microglia-like cells and other inflammatory
        non-neuronal cells in the meninges, vasculature, grey and white
        matter. The pre-eminence of intracellular aluminium associated
        with non-neuronal cells was a standout observation in autism
        brain tissue and may offer clues as to both the origin of the
        brain aluminium as well as a putative role in autism spectrum
        disorder.<br>

              Cures with Hydrogen Peroxide</b><br>
          </font></div>
        <br>
        ... 3% peroxide of hydrogen,almost immediately, wiped out
        diphtheria in the late 19th century. That was reported by JAMA
        in 1888, not know as an alternative health publication:<br>
        <br>
        Anyone who has felt the sting as hydrogen peroxide foams and
        fizzes on a scraped knee knows about the compound's antiseptic
        properties. But new research suggests that hydrogen peroxide
        does more than just kill microbes. It may also call for
        reinforcements, summoning an army of bacteria-fighting cells to
        cuts and wounds.<br>
        Punctured skin sets off a chain reaction of chemical signals
        that activates blood-clotting and attracts an array of immune
        cells to guard against intruding microbes. Some of these cells,
        known as leukocytes, or white blood cells, kill by initiating a
        "respiratory burst," which releases highly reactive
        antimicrobial molecules, including hydrogen peroxide produced by
        the body itself.<br>
        <br>
        Biologist Philipp Niethammer, a postdoctoral researcher at
        Harvard Medical School in Boston, was trying to coax such a
        hydrogen peroxide burst out of a nicked zebrafish tail when he
        noticed something odd. "I saw something bursting at the wound,"
        he says, "but I didn't see leukocytes there." That bursting,
        experiments revealed, was hydrogen peroxide--appearing an
        average of 17 minutes before the arrival of the white blood
        cells that are supposed to produce it. To Niethammer, it
        appeared as if hydrogen peroxide was bringing leukocytes to the
        wound rather than the other way around.<br>
        <br>
        To confirm the theory, Niethammer and his colleagues bathed
        zebrafish larvae in compounds known to inhibit the production of
        hydrogen peroxide. When researchers nicked larvae tails in the
        presence of the inhibitors, leukocytes stayed away: An average
        of fewer than one per larvae appeared at the cut within 42
        minutes, compared with four to six under normal conditions.
        Next, the team used genetic manipulation to pinpoint the enzyme
        responsible for producing hydrogen peroxide. The culprit, a
        protein known as duox, is also found in the thyroid, digestive
        tract, and lungs of humans. Asthma and other disorders result
        from excessive inflammation in these tissues, so duox may play a
        role in those conditions, the researchers report tomorrow in
        Nature.<br>
        <br>
        Paul Martin, a cell biologist at the University of Bristol in
        the United Kingdom, says the work identifies a key time point in
        wound healing. "Now we know the first step," he says.<br>
        <br>
        So, can that brown drugstore bottle of hydrogen peroxide also
        bring leukocytes to a wound? That's an open question, says
        Niethammer.<br>
        <br>
        He's now investigating whether white blood cells detect hydrogen
        peroxide directly or whether the compound is part of a longer
        signaling chain.<br>

        </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        For many years after its discovery, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was
        viewed as a toxic molecule to human tissues; however, in light
        of recent findings, it is being recognized as an ubiquitous
        endogenous molecule of life as its biological role has been
        better elucidated. Indeed, increasing evidence suggests that
        H2O2 may act as a second messenger with a pro-survival role in
        several physiological processes. In addition, our group has
        recently demonstrated neuroprotective effects of H2O2 on in
        vitro and in vivo ischaemic models through a catalase (CAT)
        enzyme-mediated mechanism. Therefore, the present review
        summarizes experimental data supporting a neuroprotective
        potential of H2O2 in ischaemic stroke that has been principally
        achieved by means of pharmacological and genetic strategies that
        modify either the activity or the expression of the superoxide
        dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and CAT enzymes,
        which are key regulators of H2O2 metabolism. It also critically
        discusses a translational impact concerning the role played by
        H2O2 in ischaemic stroke. Based on these data, we hope that
        further research will be done in order to better understand the
        mechanisms underlying H2O2 functions and to promote successful
        H2O2 signalling based therapy in ischaemic stroke.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Historical notes</b><br>
        <br>
        The history of H2O2 began in 1818 when it was discovered by
        Thénard who named it eau oxygénée (Thénard, 1818). Since the
        mid-1800s, H2O2 has been marketed for a wide variety of uses,
        including non-polluting bleaching, oxidizing agent, disinfectant
        in food processing and even fuel for rockets. The presence of
        H2O2 in living systems was identified in 1856 (Schoenbein,
        1856). However, it was only in 1894 that 100% pure H2O2 was
        first extracted from H2O by Wolffenstein through vacuum
        distillation (Wolffenstein, 1894). In 1888, the first medical
        use of H2O2 was described by Love as efficacious in treating
        numerous diseases, including scarlet fever, diphtheria, nasal
        catarrh, acute coryza, whooping cough, asthma hay fever and
        tonsillitis (Love, 1888). Similarly, Oliver and collaborators
        reported that intravenous injection of H2O2 was efficacious in
        treating influenza pneumonia in the epidemic following World War
        I (Oliver et al., 1920). Despite its beneficial effects, in the
        1940s medical interest in further research on H2O2 was slowed
        down by the emerging development of new prescription medicines.
        In the early 1960s, Urschel, and later Finney and co-workers,
        conducted several studies on myocardial ischaemia demonstrating
        a rescue afforded by H2O2, thereby suggesting an important
        protective action of H2O2 against ischaemia-reperfusion (IR)
        injury (Finney et al., 1967; Urschel, 1967). Notably, Farr is
        generally considered to be the pioneer of ‘oxidative therapy’ by
        proposing intravenous infusion of H2O2 to treat a wide variety
        of diseases (Farr, 1988). Later, Willhelm promoted the
        therapeutic use of H2O2 to treat cancer, skin diseases, polio
        and bacteria-related mental illness. He defined H2O2 as ‘God's
        given immune system’ (Willhelm, 1989; Green, 1998). Another
        player in the H2O2 story was Grotz, who obtained pain relief by
        testing H2O2 on himself to treat his arthritis pain (Green,
        1998)...<br>

          <i>An investigation into the CDC's destruction of a study
            linking autism to the MMR vaccine.</i><i><br>
          </i></div>
        <br>
        In 2013, biologist Dr. Brian Hooker received a call from a
        Senior Scientist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
        Prevention (CDC) who led the agency’s 2004 study on the
        Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine and its link to autism. The
        scientist, Dr. William Thompson, confessed that the CDC had
        omitted crucial data in their final report that revealed a
        causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism. Over
        several months, Dr. Hooker records the phone calls made to him
        by Dr. Thompson who provides the confidential data destroyed by
        his colleagues at the CDC. Dr. Hooker enlists the help of Dr.
        Andrew Wakefield, the British gastroenterologist falsely accused
        of starting the anti-vax movement when he first reported in 1998
        that the MMR vaccine may cause autism. In his ongoing effort to
        advocate for children’s health, Wakefield directs this
        documentary examining the evidence behind an appalling cover-up
        committed by the government agency charged with protecting the
        health of American citizens. Interviews with pharmaceutical
        insiders, doctors, politicians, and parents of vaccine-injured
        children reveal an alarming deception that has contributed to
        the skyrocketing increase of autism and potentially the most
        catastrophic epidemic of our lifetime.<br>

        A=440 Hz vs. A=432 Hz. It has been said that music tuned in
        A=432 Hz is more beautiful and harmonious to the ears and
        induces a more inward experience where music tuned in A=440 Hz
        is more outward, mental experience which is projected outwards.
        I am sure you have already seeing the following still photos of
        how the A=440 Hz vs A=432 Hz looks like. They have been
        circulating the net for some time. Well I thought it will be
        cool to generate them using my cymatoscope…and so I did…in real
        time! It is said that “a picture is worth a thousand
        words”...well I would add that "a video is a perfect shot of
        reality..." Conclusion: Don't let yourself be fooled by images
        you have been shown on the net. Investigate the truth yourself!
        This is how the A=440 Hz vs. A=432 Hz patterns look like in real
        time! There is also a sample what happens when both notes are
        played together.<br>

        http://www.witts.ws - World Improvement Through The Spirit
        Ministries is showing the world's most efficient overunity
        ultrasonic water heater. A stainless steel sphere with 1.7
        gallons of water starts at 101 degrees F and rises to 184
        degrees F in two minutes from 1.62 watts input from a 9 volt
        battery supplying .18 amps. Normally 1.7 US gallons of water
        would require 10,296 watts of energy at 100% efficiency to be
        raised from 101 to 184 degrees F in 2 minutes. This is super
        efficient at over 6000 X more heat from the input of
        electricity. There are no catalysts, heavy water or other exotic
        materials required as in cold fusion and no harmful radiation is
        released. The stimulus for this research &amp; development was

              disease found in skin - study</font> </b><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        &nbsp;Rogue proteins which cause the human equivalent of mad cow
        disease have been detected in the skin, raising concerns that
        the deadly disease could be passed through contact not involving
        the brain.<br>
        <br>
        CJD is caused by abnormal infectious protein aggregates called
        prions which cause fatal damage in the brain. There is no
        available treatment for the disease and 90 percent of patients
        die within a year of onset, according to the National Institutes
        of Health.<br>
        <br>
        Now, researchers at Case Western Reserve University School of
        Medicine have found that Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)
        patients can harbor the infectious protein ‘prions’ in their
        skin as well as the brain.<br>
        <br>
        Previously medical experts believed the disease was only
        contractible by eating infected meat or coming into contact with
        the brain or hormones of an infected person, such as during an
        autopsy.<br>
        <br>
        "It is well known that CJD is transmissible via surgical or
        medical procedures involving prion-infected brain tissue," said
        Wenquan Zou, lead researcher of the study.“Our finding of
        infectious prions in skin is important since it not only raises
        concerns about the potential for disease transmission via common
        surgeries not involving the brain, but also suggests that skin
        biopsies and autopsies may enhance pre-mortem and post-mortem
        CJD diagnosis.”<br>
        <br>
        The researchers studied skin samples from 39 patients, finding
        prion protein aggregates in the skin samples of all of the CJD
        patients. However, the levels were 1,000-100,000 times lower
        than in the brain, and only detectable by an extremely sensitive
        assay.<br>
        <br>
        "The level of prion infectivity detected in CJD skin was
        surprisingly significant, but still much lower than that in CJD
        brains," said Qingzhong Kong, Associate Professor of Pathology
        and Neurology at Case Western.<br>
        <br>
        "Prion transmission risk from surgical instruments contaminated
        by skin prions should be much lower than that of instruments
        contaminated by brain tissue," he added.<br>
        <br>
        Research using lab mice showed that these skin prions are
        infectious, and capable of causing disease. A dozen healthy mice
        were exposed to skin extracts from two of the CJD patients, and
        all developed prion disease.<br>
        <br>
        A dozen more mice were exposed to brain extracts from these
        patients. The results revealed that while brain degeneration was
        similar in both groups it took twice as long for the disease to
        develop in the skin group.<br>
        <br>
        “Perspective is important when interpreting these outcomes,”
        said Byron Caughey, a senior investigator at NIAID’s Rocky
        Mountain Laboratories (RML) who helped oversee the study. “There
        is no evidence that transmission can occur in real-world
        situations via casual skin contact. However, the results raise
        transmission questions that warrant further study,” he said.<br>
        <br>
        The findings also present new possibilities for less invasive
        techniques in CJD diagnosis, according to the team.<br>
        <br>
        "Using the skin instead of brain tissue for post-mortem
        diagnosis could be particularly helpful in cultures that
        discourage brain autopsy, such as China and India. These
        countries have the largest populations with the greatest number
        of patients, but brain autopsy is often not performed," said
        Zou.<br>
        <br>
        Medical researchers will carry out further investigation, mainly
        using mouse models to evaluate the potential risk of skin prion
        transmission through non-neurosurgeries.<br>

        <div align="center"><font size="+1"><b>'Minute Difference' In
              Deadly Asteroid's Trajectory Could Have Saved Dinosaurs</b></font><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        The asteroid impact which killed the dinosaurs would not have
        had the same devastating impact had it landed elsewhere on
        Earth, according to a new study which compares the probability
        of extinction at different possible sites of an asteroid strike.<br>
        <br>
        Scientists believe that a mass extinction of animals, including
        the dinosaurs, occurred after a 9-kilometer wide asteroid struck
        the Earth 66 million years ago. The event created the Chicxulub
        crater in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and ended the Cretaceous
        Period of the Earth's history.<br>
        <br>
        The impact heated hydrocarbon and sulfur in the Earth's rocks
        and caused masses of soot and sulfate particles to be released
        into the stratosphere. Thiscooled the climate by 8-10 degrees
        Celsius and led to the extinction of three-quarters of all
        species on Earth, including non-avian dinosaurs and animals
        which lived in warm water. Cold-water dwelling animals such as
        crocodiles survived the event.<br>
        <br>
        According to a new study by researchers at the Japanese
        Meteorological Research Institute and Tohoku University, the
        asteroid site had an unusually high concentration of
        hydrocarbons and sulfur in comparison with most other places on
        Earth, meaning that its impact was more deadly than it would
        have been had it struck somewhere else.<br>
        <br>
        "The probability of mass extinction occurring after an asteroid
        that could hit a random location on the Earth’s surface was
        approximately 13% when the Chicxulub-scale asteroid hit the
        Earth," Kunio Kaiho and Naga Oshima wrote in their paper,
        published in the journal Scientific Reports.<br>
        <br>
        They found that soot is "likely to have been more important than
        sulfate as a cause of mass extinction," and that
        hydrocarbon-rich areas comprise just 13% of the Earth's surface.
        Areas which are rich in hydrocarbons and sulfur comprise just 1%
        of the Earth's surface.<br>

        </div>
        <br>
        Would you like to charge your mobile phone through a plant? This
        is viable thanks to the research carried out by the chemist
        Isaac Céspedes Camacho, who devised a mechanism to take
        advantage of the energy produced during the process of
        photosynthesis, re-direct it to a solar cell and, from there,
        drive it through a cable to the battery of the phone.<br>
        <br>
        It is just the 1st practical example of many other uses that may
        be given in the future to this new source of alternative energy,
        said Céspedes, a professor at the Technological Institute of
        Costa Rica (ITCR).<br>
        <br>
        According to him, little energy was obtained (the mobile phone
        could be charged by 30%). They were able to verify that it is
        possible to imitate what the vegetation does, that is, capture
        the sunlight and convert this energy light in chemical energy,
        which is what plants then use to perform all of their functions.<br>
        <br>
        “From now on, the challenge is to enhance this energy. I hope
        that in a few years, maybe 2, we can develop more advanced
        equipment that allows us to obtain high amounts of clean energy,
        which can be used in our electronic equipment such as computers
        and appliances and other practical uses,” said the scientist.<br>
        <br>
        The so-called spins (a property of the electron) located in the
        leaves are, in fact, responsible throughout this process of
        energy generation.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Spins: key pieces</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        But, what does it consist of? Céspedes explains it in a simple
        way. There are several components which interact in
        photosynthesis; sunlight, for example, generates a reaction in
        the plant where the electrons intervene and, within them, there
        are the spins. These, in turn, react due to the magnetic field
        of the Earth, generating electric energy.<br>
        <br>
        “This is the 1st time that the influence of spins on
        photosynthetic organisms and magnetic fields close to our planet
        is measured. With this discovery, it opens a door to a number of
        practical applications, using spins as an alternative energy
        source, which is not only safe but clean”, said the researcher.<br>
        <br>
        Previously, other findings around the world had made experiments
        on organisms that made photosynthesis but at very high magnetic
        fields. These results gave useful information but were not
        practical. The challenge was to look for lower magnetic fields,
        although there is the recent discovery of the Costa Rican
        scientist to imitate what plants do.<br>
        <br>
        <b>1st steps</b><br>
        <br>
        The history of his findings dates back 4 years ago when he was
        doing his 1st research with the nuclear magnetic resonance teams
        in the Netherlands (in Europe). There, he realized the role that
        spins have during photosynthesis and that, perhaps, energy could
        be obtained from them. With this concern, he returned to Costa
        Rica to continue his research and join the national efforts to
        look for alternative energy sources.<br>
        <br>
        n order to achieve this, he sought support from other scientists
        at the University of Leipzig, Germany. Engineers from Bruker
        Biospin (a company that manufactures scientific
        instrumentation), and ITCR professionals, specifically from the
        School of Chemistry and Environmental Engineering, finally
        joined his project. Currently, the research involves an
        interdisciplinary team composed of chemists, electrical
        engineers, physicists, mathematicians, and biochemists.<br>
        <br>
        “There is much to do. You have to study different plants (up to
        now, only aquatic plants have been used) and organisms that
        produce photosynthesis, and analyze the chemical reactions of
        their spins in order to generalize our discovery to the whole
        plant world. We have to scale up what we have obtained in the
        laboratory, that is, be able to design and build a team that
        imitates the photosynthetic process and generates a considerable
        amount of energy”, the Costa Rican scientist concluded.<br>

        You may have heard of the sugar industry’s attempt to get
        dietary fat blamed for heart disease when it manipulated results
        to cover up sugar’s role in cardiovascular illness. There is
        more to the story…<br>
        <br>
        Last year, three researchers turned heads everywhere when they
        uncovered evidence that the sugar industry secretly funded
        studies on sugar’s effects on mammals, only to then cut off from
        the results when sugar’s links to life-threatening disease
        emerged...<br>

        </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
        <br>
        Early warning signals of the coronary heart disease (CHD) risk
        of sugar (sucrose) emerged in the 1950s. We examined Sugar
        Research Foundation (SRF) internal documents, historical
        reports, and statements relevant to early debates about the
        dietary causes of CHD and assembled findings chronologically
        into a narrative case study. The SRF sponsored its first CHD
        research project in 1965, a literature review published in the
        New England Journal of Medicine, which singled out fat and
        cholesterol as the dietary causes of CHD and downplayed evidence
        that sucrose consumption was also a risk factor. The SRF set the
        review's objective, contributed articles for inclusion, and
        received drafts. The SRF's funding and role was not disclosed.
        Together with other recent analyses of sugar industry documents,
        our findings suggest the industry sponsored a research program
        in the 1960s and 1970s that successfully cast doubt about the
        hazards of sucrose while promoting fat as the dietary culprit in
        CHD. Policymaking committees should consider giving less weight
        to food industry-funded studies and include mechanistic and
        animal studies as well as studies appraising the effect of added
        sugars on multiple CHD biomarkers and disease development.<br>
