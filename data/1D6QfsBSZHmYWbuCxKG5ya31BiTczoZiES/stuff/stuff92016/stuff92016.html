      <big>This is not meant to be tutorial or anything like that. it
        just shows what works the best for me and how you use this
        information is all up to you.<br>
        <br>
        it's very tricky to get the right cups, sometimes you get lucky,
        sometimes not. on a good run, i could get 5-10 cups in 5 minutes
        but on the other hand, i might only get 1-2 so i guess you'll
        get better over time. the primers i made take very strong spring
        and large mass(firing pin) to set off so for lighter firing
        mechanism, you might want to go with softer materials like
        aluminum. if your gun can set of real primers, then you can skip
        all this and buy the real thing.<br>
        <br>
        THIS IS FOR LOW PRESSURE ROUNDS ONLY!!!!! (or percussion guns)<br>
        <br>
        So again, just be very carful with her, she is very sensitive
        and have fun but stay safe!<br>

            of Superbug Gene Found in the United State</b></big><br>
        <br>
        <big><b>Pamela Bofferding</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <big><br>
        This week a toddler in Connecticut was found to have the
        superbug gene MCR-1, which makes E. coli resistant to most
        antibiotics. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have been
        closely monitoring cases like this one since the superbug gene
        first appeared in China. The toddler had been traveling to the
        Caribbean with her family when she first became ill. She was
        treated for E. coli once she returned to her home in Connecticut
        and that’s when the superbug gene was detected after her
        condition worsened.<br>
        <br>
        The superbug is primarily spread through the consumption of food
        (the first case of the bacteria was discovered on a Chinese pig
        in 2015). Analysis of the child’s diet while in the Caribbean
        showed that she had eaten chicken and goat meat from a live
        animal market and also that she interacted closely with a pet
        dog and cat.<br>
        <br>
        MCR-1 has been found in 30 countries on all 5 continents and it
        spreads rapidly in various types of bacteria. We’ve long known
        that taking antibiotics when you aren’t really ill is a leading
        cause for “growing” superbugs. There may also be a connection
        between antibacterial soaps and gels. Scientists warn that if
        the superbug is not discovered early enough, it could make
        humans resistant to multiple drugs. In May, a woman showed
        antibiotic resistance in Pennsylvania but was eventually
        successfully treated after much trial and error. The source of
        that woman’s infection was never identified, but experts were
        able to determine that contamination due to exposure from
        colonized patients was extremely rare (since this woman had the
        superbug for some time and did not infect even her close family
        members living in her home).<br>
        <br>
        Still, researchers wonder if at some point, a superbug will be
        resistant to all modern antibiotics. If this were to happen,
        medicine as we know it would degrade beyond recognition.
        Antibiotics are the basis for most medical advancements—cancer
        treatment, surgeries, and childbirth become extremely risky when
        there is no way to treat infection. The CDC is watching and
        waiting and hopefully they will be able to stay one step ahead
        of the bacteria. This is one SHTF scenario we certainly do not
        want to happen.<b><br>
          <br>
          How to Protect Yourself<br>
          <br>
        </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wash you hands with soap and water:
        Experts recommend singing the “Happy Birthday” song as you
        lather. Traditional soap mechanically removes germs from your
        skin, so time and motion and your friends.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid antibacterial soaps: they aren’t more
        effective than regular soaps, and many of them have also been
        recently banned by the FDA. They also tend to be drying, which
        leads to small cuts in the skin, which is how germs get into
        your body.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moisturize your hands: see number 2. Well
        moisturized hands offer more protection against germs.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid hospitals: Hospitals are breeding
        grounds for germs. Malingerers and those who use the emergency
        room for general treatment are at extremely high risk.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid taking unnecessary antibiotics: studies
        show that those who are most at risk for contracting a superbug
        are people with compromised immune systems (the elderly,
        children, and pregnant women) and people who routinely take
        antibiotics.<br>

        The elephant is the controlled media’s constant attempts to
        distort reality in the minds of their viewers.<br>
        <br>
        If those in public service, the media, medicine, science, or
        academia ever state the unspoken truths, they are promptly
        terminated and blacklisted with contemptuous disapproval.*<br>
        <br>
        *The most overused, feared, and ugly pejoratives in America,
        today, are three in number: anti-Semitic, racist, and homophobe.<br>
        <br>
        Such has been the draconian effort to eliminate our expression
        of free will and free speech.<br>
        <br>
        The list of taboo subjects (seldom found in Presidential
        debates) that one must be careful talking or writing about has
        grown long and is getting longer.<br>
        <br>
        In their efforts to override our free will the dark forces have
        repeatedly told us how to speak (or not speak) on all of the
        following subjects … or … pay an expensive price for not
        complying.<br>
        <br>
        Remember, since 9/11 the United States of America has developed
        a massive domestic surveillance state that rivals the communist
        one in Stasi East Germany ­ so be careful what you say and to
        whom you say it.<br>
        <br>
        The ever-growing list of non-politically correct questions ­<br>
        <br>
        Should America continue its “special” relationship with Israel?<br>
        <br>
        Should we allow gays into our military?<br>
        <br>
        Why have lesbians never supported Trump?<br>
        <br>
        Were Tea Party activists, who objected to the bank bailouts,
        true Americans?<br>
        <br>
        Should men who want to be females be allowed to use women’s
        bathrooms?<br>
        <br>
        Are Hate Crimes legislation a cover for governmental crimes?<br>
        <br>
        Should we return to States’ Rights and a more favorable ratio
        between the individual and government?<br>
        <br>
        Should we limit the size and power of government?<br>
        <br>
        Is there an Intelligent Design to life or are we all an
        accident?<br>
        <br>
        Can we have an impartial free press when a mere six media giants
        own ninety percent of what we read, watch, or listen to ­
        especially when all six of those media giants are owned and

        As the subjects above prove, rather than becoming politically
        awakened, Western civilization has been psy-oped and cowed by
        the ridiculously self-styled Social Justice Warriors, who are
        nothing more than Cultural Marxists* intent on degrading and
        weakening Western society.<br>
        <br>
        *Cultural Marxism is Karl’s Marxism translated from economic
        into cultural terms, with political correctness being their
        chief weapon. Still, the majority of Americans are so
        faint-hearted they are intimidated by mere words, until they
        actually believe the most outrageous concepts … so unlike the
        young lady below.<br>
        <br>
        Understanding the truths of the above subjects should be our
        first step in the wise and selective use of our positive free
        will.<br>
        <br>
        Next comes the wise dissemination of those truths.<br>
        <br>
        Warnings: If you are storing as little as a week’s worth of food
        and water, flashlights, cigarette lighters, firewood, or gold
        and silver coins please keep it to yourself, as such prudent
        actions can make you a target of government.<br>
        <br>
        If you have an old Support Ron Paul sticker on your vehicle,
        please remove it as the police in some jurisdictions have been
        ordered to stop and search such cars and trucks.<br>
        <br>
        And spending cash will become ever more suspicious. Try to avoid
        that when you can.<br>
        <br>
        And please be aware that owning any kind of unregistered firearm
        will soon mean immediate arrest, followed by indefinite
        imprisonment if caught ­ the kind of imprisonment that has no
        trial or notification to lawyers, family, or close friends.
        America is no longer the country your parents grew up in.<br>
        <br>
        Fortunately one’s positive free will does not have to be
        publicized in order for it to be to effective; but it does
        require a degree of enlightenment that must precede one’s
        positive intention of free will in our free will universe.<br>

        Why are the higher levels of the American government and

        dollars they get in US foreign aid) to Zionist oligarchs to give
        to the political campaigns of sexually or morally warped
        politicians?<br>

        <br>
        Since Blacks make up less than 15% of the US population, but

      </b><b>Description</b><br>
      <br>
      An all-sky view of stars in our Galaxy – the Milky Way – and
      neighbouring galaxies, based on the first year of observations
      from ESA’s Gaia satellite, from July 2014 to September 2015.<br>
      <br>
      This map shows the density of stars observed by Gaia in each
      portion of the sky. Brighter regions indicate denser
      concentrations of stars, while darker regions correspond to
      patches of the sky where fewer stars are observed.<br>
      <br>
      The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy, with most of its stars residing
      in a disc about 100 000 light-years across and about 1000
      light-years thick. This structure is visible in the sky as the
      Galactic Plane – the brightest portion of this image –which runs
      horizontally and is especially bright at the centre.<br>
      <br>
      Darker regions across the Galactic Plane correspond to dense
      clouds of interstellar gas and dust that absorb starlight along
      the line of sight.<br>
      <br>
      Many globular and open clusters – groupings of stars held together
      by their mutual gravity – are also sprinkled across the image.<br>
      <br>
      Globular clusters, large assemblies of hundreds of thousands to
      millions of old stars, are mainly found in the halo of the Milky
      Way, a roughly spherical structure with a radius of about 100 000
      light-years, and so are visible across the image.<br>
      <br>
      Open clusters are smaller assemblies of hundreds to thousands of
      stars and are found mainly in the Galactic Plane.<br>
      <br>
      The two bright objects in the lower right of the image are the
      Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, two dwarf galaxies orbiting the
      Milky Way. Other nearby galaxies are also visible, most notably
      Andromeda (also known as M31), the largest galactic neighbor to
      the Milky Way, in the lower left of the image. Below Andromeda is
      its satellite, the Triangulum galaxy (M33).<br>
      <br>
      A number of artifacts are also visible on the image. These curved
      features and darker stripes are not of astronomical origin but
      rather reflect Gaia’s scanning procedure. As this map is based on
      observations performed during the mission’s first year, the survey
      is not yet uniform across the sky.<br>
      <br>
      These artifacts will gradually disappear as more data are gathered
      during the five-year mission.<br>
      <br>
      High resolution versions of the Gaia map, with transparent
      background, are available to download from: <br>

      <br>
      Independent individuals are priceless.<br>
      I know they’re out there, because during the past 15 years I’ve
      been writing at NoMoreFakeNews.com, they’ve been reading my
      articles, signing up for the email list, and ordering my
      collections.<br>
      I know they’re individuals and independent, because I don’t write
      for The Group and I don’t support Group Think. I write against the
      grain of Group Think.<br>
      I have no narrow ideology. I’m on the side of freedom.<br>
      And I also know that, as the old saying goes, responsibility
      accompanies freedom. You make your choices and you accept the
      consequences.<br>
      Because I’m 78, I’ve watched successive generations of people
      become more gullible, more addled, as they’ve bought into various
      versions of the Great Glob—which is a collectivist counterfeit of
      “share and care” that leads to a dead-end of confusion and
      despair. This grotesquery accelerated during the fabled 1960s,
      when the notion of tolerance was taken to such an extreme, people
      surrendered their innate sense of morality and opted to accept
      everything and anything as a version of love.<br>
      When I began writing seriously, in the summer of 1959, the idea
      that I would focus on The Individual was the farthest thing from
      my mind.<br>
      I assumed everyone was an individual. Case closed. Why bother to
      mention it? Why bother to think about it?<br>
      Even then, though, a massive propaganda operation was underway. It
      was aimed at replacing the individual with the group. Some people
      call this cultural Marxism. It’s much larger than that. It’s
      Collectivism at every possible level. It aims to eradicate the
      individual’s awareness that he is an individual. Why? Because if
      he truly knows what he is, then he also knows that highly
      organized society is opposing him. It is dedicated to the creation
      and sustenance of groups. Groups are manageable. Individuals
      aren’t.<br>
      Needless to say, much has happened since that time.<br>
      Skipping ahead, by the late 1990s it had become apparent to me
      that many people were falling by the wayside. Their “universal
      tolerance” was a form of self-sabotage. They were sacrificing
      themselves on the soft buttery altar of “doing good.” It was
      obvious to me, for example, that the notion of repairing all past
      injustices of society was a well with no bottom. It was a covert
      op. It was an attempt to entangle minds in a case of amnesia about
      individual power. Rather than trying to raise people up, it was a
      plan to victimize a permanent (and ever expanding) underclass.<br>
      I wasn’t sure my message about all this would reach many readers.
      I wasn’t sure what their reaction would be. But I didn’t care. I
      was motivated to make my case. So I did. So I do.<br>
      And lo and behold, people have responded. Over and above the
      nonsensical static of trolls and self-appointed victims, a wave of
      confirmation reached me. People were still there—as individuals.
      They knew it. They were seeing the demise of society around them.<br>
      Beyond confirmation, though, what I was aiming at was (and is)
      expansion of individual power. Not just an acknowledgment of it.<br>
      Power. Creative power. The power of imagination. The capacity of
      the individual to conceive of his deepest desires, pursue them,
      and turn them into visible fact in the world. (This is shorthand
      for what I cover extensively in my collection, Exit From The
      Matrix.)<br>
      Since I was a child and read great sea-adventure novels and
      science fiction novels, I assumed that fleshing out a vision of
      what one wants for his future was the obvious and standard
      enterprise for every person. Of course, I was grossly
      overestimating the situation. But I never lost that fundamental
      understanding. And never will.<br>
      Societal reality, consensus reality, “world reality,” is basically
      a gigantic covert op. It’s designed to keep the individual inside
      a set framework of response and consent. It is hugely destructive.
      As a reporter for the past 30 years, I’ve investigated many cases
      and angles of this op, and I’ve published my findings without
      compromise.<br>
      But always, above and beyond that, I’ve been referring to the
      individual and his capacity to create and build better realities
      of his own choosing. Gorgeous, free, open, unfettered, majestic
      realities.<br>
      Consciousness.<br>
      Freedom.<br>
      Power.<br>
      The individual.<br>
      Imagination. Creating new realities.<br>
      Society and civilization as a potential force for helping to
      liberate the individual.<br>
      Underneath all my articles, all my investigations into corruption
      and crime at the highest levels, these above factors have been my
      motivation,<br>
      Who do I write for?<br>
      I write for people who recognize they can do something for
      themselves and others, who can improve their lives and
      consciousness and power.<br>
      I write for people who want to increase their own power.<br>
      I’ve been at this for 33 years. I recognize there are people out
      there who dig down and discover massive chunks of corruption,
      crime, and conspiracy in the world—and then they twist that
      knowledge to say: “See, this is why I can’t make any progress in
      life. This is why I’m blocked. This is why I’m having trouble.
      This is why I can’t do anything.”<br>
      I’m not writing for those people.<br>
      They’re using their hard-won knowledge to doom themselves to a
      life they don’t want. They jumped out of one box and put
      themselves in another one.<br>
      Regardless of how bad things are in this world, there is always
      something a person can do. For himself, and for others.<br>
      In doing that, in moving toward the life he wants most profoundly,
      in taking creative action, he becomes more alive, more conscious,
      more powerful.<br>
      He is the person I’m writing for.<br>
      I’m writing for those men and women.<br>
      There is the Personal and the Planetary. They can’t be entirely
      separated and walled off from each other.<br>
      But that doesn’t mean one sphere should be absorbed in the other.<br>
      You can’t eliminate personal desire from the equation and expect
      to find all the life you want. It doesn’t work.<br>
      power outside the matrix<br>
      I write for people who have at least glimpsed the power of their
      own imaginations, and want to increase that power.<br>
      I write for people who, becoming aware of how fake realities are
      built, cross over and realize they can invent better realities and
      futures.<br>
      I write for people who can wake up to that.<br>
      I write for people who want to understand the details of how
      corrupt and deceptive realities are built. My investigative
      articles serve that purpose.<br>
      I write for the individual.<br>
      I write for myself.<br>
      I write to expose corruption to the light of day, because I want
      to.<br>
      I write for people who understand they can become more alive.<br>
      I write for people who are willing to consider something new, who
      aren’t trapped by the belief that everything important is ancient.<br>
      I write for people who hunger for adventure.<br>
      I write for people who know they have the strength to make
      something happen.<br>
      I write for people who suspect they have latent capabilities that
      can come to the surface.<br>
      I write for people who realize answers and solutions to their own
      lives come from themselves.<br>
      I write for people who refuse to relinquish their individuality.<br>
      I write for people who want to increase the power and range and
      scope of their own imaginations, in order to discover and invent
      new startling enterprises and adventures.<br>
      I write for people who are on a spiritual road that isn’t clouded
      by convenient slogans, who know their journey is unique to them,
      and not part of a system.<br>
      I write for people who’ve taken hold of their own freedom and want
      more freedom.<br>
      I write for people who can follow a train of thought.<br>
      I write for people who have done their best to make their way
      through life, who sense there is something more, who want
      knowledge that will be liberating, not entrapping.<br>
      I write for people who, acknowledging that systems and structures
      can be quite useful, reject the idea that all of life is
      encompassed by a system.<br>
      I write for people who want more power to think, do, create—rather
      than being told what to think and create.<br>
      I write for people who, understanding conspiracies, don’t fold up,
      but rather, as my friend Catherine Austin Fitts says, want to
      start their own (good) conspiracy.<br>
      I write for all these reasons and more.<br>
      I write for people who, when they discover how much corruption
      abounds, refrain from demanding that others tell them what to do
      about it—but rather discover/invent for themselves what actions
      they can take.<br>
      I write for people who don’t give up.<br>
      I write for people who have already found some answers and some
      success, and want more.<br>
      I write for pleasure and enjoyment.<br>
      I write for people who want to read.<br>
      I write for people who want to consider ideas that reach miles and
      miles past the borders of consensus reality.<br>
      I write for people who are sick and tired of how this world is
      being run, and want to do something about it, want to discover the
      creativity within themselves that will provide answers.<br>
      I write for people who never give up.<br>
      I write for people who want to make a better world, by their own
      definition, and will work toward that end.<br>
      I write for people who have thrown away this formula: a) blaming
      others for their own shortcomings; and b) using that blame to
      build their own personal prisons of despair.<br>
      I write as part of the business I run, the sole proprietorship
      called nomorefakenews. On that site, I sell my products. I’m an
      entrepreneur. I believe in giving value for value. Since I started
      nomorefakenews in 2001, I’ve written a stream of articles people
      can, in fact, read for free.<br>
      I write for people who can follow this train of thought: a)
      discover the nuts and bolts of how elites invent reality for rest
      of us (The Matrix Revealed); b) instead, extend the power of their
      own imaginations and invent better realities (Exit From The
      Matrix); and c) attain the power to operate inside and outside the
      Matrix (Power Outside The Matrix). Yes, that’s a plug for my three
      Matrix collections.<br>
      I write for people who aren’t afraid of having power.<br>
      I write for people who know the difference between belonging to a
      group that ultimately asks them to surrender their own
      individuality, and a group composed of true individuals.<br>
      I write for people who do their best to weather every storm.<br>
      I write for people born into a place that has been taken over by
      corrupt fascists.<br>
      I write to rise as high as I can.<br>
      I write to expose every restraint of freedom I can perceive.<br>
      I write to say this space-time box is not the only place there is.<br>
      I write to say every individual who inhabits a physical form is
      immortal, whether he likes it or not…and it’s better to face the
      truth than deny it.<br>
      I write to promote both logic and imagination—each in its own
      sphere of action.<br>
      I hope I write for you.<br>

          Description<br>
          <br>
        </b>An all-sky view of stars in our Galaxy – the Milky Way – and
        neighbouring galaxies, based on the first year of observations
        from ESA’s Gaia satellite, from July 2014 to September 2015.<br>
        <br>
        This map shows the density of stars observed by Gaia in each
        portion of the sky. Brighter regions indicate denser
        concentrations of stars, while darker regions correspond to
        patches of the sky where fewer stars are observed.<br>
        <br>
        The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy, with most of its stars
        residing in a disc about 100 000 light-years across and about
        1000 light-years thick. This structure is visible in the sky as
        the Galactic Plane – the brightest portion of this image –which
        runs horizontally and is especially bright at the centre.<br>
        <br>
        Darker regions across the Galactic Plane correspond to dense
        clouds of interstellar gas and dust that absorb starlight along
        the line of sight.<br>
        <br>
        Many globular and open clusters – groupings of stars held
        together by their mutual gravity – are also sprinkled across the
        image.<br>
        <br>
        Globular clusters, large assemblies of hundreds of thousands to
        millions of old stars, are mainly found in the halo of the Milky
        Way, a roughly spherical structure with a radius of about 100
        000 light-years, and so are visible across the image.<br>
        <br>
        Open clusters are smaller assemblies of hundreds to thousands of
        stars and are found mainly in the Galactic Plane.<br>
        <br>
        The two bright objects in the lower right of the image are the
        Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, two dwarf galaxies orbiting
        the Milky Way. Other nearby galaxies are also visible, most
        notably Andromeda (also known as M31), the largest galactic
        neighbor to the Milky Way, in the lower left of the image. Below
        Andromeda is its satellite, the Triangulum galaxy (M33).<br>
        <br>
        A number of artifacts are also visible on the image. These
        curved features and darker stripes are not of astronomical
        origin but rather reflect Gaia’s scanning procedure. As this map
        is based on observations performed during the mission’s first
        year, the survey is not yet uniform across the sky.<br>
        <br>
        These artifacts will gradually disappear as more data are
        gathered during the five-year mission.<br>
        <br>
        High resolution versions of the Gaia map, with transparent
        background, are available to download from: <br>

          <br>
        </b>Are There Giants Currently Alive or Buried in the U.S. and
        Elsewhere?<br>
        <br>
        Though we have some tall basketball players living today, as 7-8
        feet tall, Giants are just people with some messed up hormones
        (National Geographic once said that two large skeletons found in
        South America had glandular problems causing overgrowth in
        height.) or invented fables, right? <br>
        <br>
        I have been interested in Giants since a child, when I saw the
        skeleton of a Giant exhibited at the Seattle World’s Fair in
        1962. My older siblings also found skeletons in the Kanab, Utah
        area in the 50’s.&nbsp; Those Giant skeletons had a second set
        of teeth growing in, pushing out the original set.&nbsp;
        Although difficult for kids to figure, they were probably around
        12 feet tall.<br>
        <br>
        These experiences led me to track information on Giants all my
        life. I am now in my 67th year.&nbsp; There are reports from
        Japan of some skeletons, found way deep in the Earth, that were
        18 or more feet tall.&nbsp; South America has similar data and
        evidence of underground cities go around the world.&nbsp;
        However, various countries leaders that have this data generally
        work in co-operation, to “officially” keep silence on this
        subject. &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        There may have been some related surface cities (in ancient
        times) at some point but the real reason we don’t see their
        modern or even older cities is they are self-sufficient and
        underground now and obviously restricted.&nbsp; They are not
        small cities and there are a very large number of them. We do
        not see them, their vehicles, their agricultural farms or even
        know anything about their culture…Isn’t that amazing?!<br>
        <br>
        What I am seeing now, in the U.S., is there appears to be a
        relationship between Giants and massive Egyptian-style burials
        here in America.&nbsp; Egyptians in America?&nbsp; Apparently
        so, because there is evidence of connection from the Father
        Crespi information (South America), the Burrows find (Illinois)
        and the Grand Canyon find discovered by G.E. Kinkaid, excavated
        in part by the Smithsonian and then mysteriously closed in
        1908.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

          </b><b><br>
          </b></a><br>
        Then there is the Gordon L. Smith find at or around Mount
        Trumbull (Arizona) close to the Grand Canyon and not far
        downstream from the G.E. Kinkaid discovery, which also has
        Egyptian looking articles in it. Reports have it that Gordon L.
        Smith was traced and pursued after selling large gold medallions
        with Egyptian images on them at pawn shops in Las Vegas, Nevada
        and Flagstaff, Arizona. That was what got him into trouble with
        the law at that time. &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        I recently wrote a letter, to radio commentator and researcher
        Steve Quayle, in response to his letter to me, and have decided
        to expand on it…<br>
        <br>
        1. There are Giants that have been seen alive, as well as dead
        in burials, all over our country (U.S.) as well as many other
        countries, even in recent times. I have seen them as Mummies,
        skeletons and even alive and healthy in my life time. Some of my
        friends have also seen Giants as mummies, skeletons and alive as
        well in recent times. Because of public opinion “political
        correctness diseases” many people I know will not normally
        discuss seeing Giants, because of being scorned, ridiculed and
        or socially ostracized, embarrassed if not persecuted.<br>
        <br>
        2. It has been my observation, personal empirical research and
        experience over many years now that there are civilizations of
        very advanced people technologically that live underneath the
        crust of the earth (Underground Cities, U/C) all around this
        planet. Many of them are Giants, but not all of them are. Some
        of them are indeed red haired &amp; white skinned, yes, but some
        of them are also Negros of large stature likewise.<br>
        <br>
        Some of these underground dwellers are fully grown at about six
        feet in height whereas other related U/P dwellers are only about
        four feet tall when fully grown.&nbsp; The Giants of our planet,
        Giants or Tall People, I suspect may be a result of longevity
        and evolution, 14-16 feet is probably more normal, with a
        lifespan ranging from 250 to thousands of years old, like it may
        have been before the deluge. Ancient people believed that the
        Giants and the small people were related.<br>
        <br>
        3. Now the underground peoples (U/P) are not immortal and so
        they too age and die.&nbsp; They do not bury their dead in their
        cities, but in (graveyards) sepulchers and tombs of various
        types outside of and upside of their cities close to the surface
        of the ground which look like museums inside … in sealed tunnels
        that lead down to their cities. So far I have also noted that
        none of their advanced technology is ever found in their
        sepulchers.<br>
        <br>
        Some of their tombs are carved like a corkscrew or auger into
        stone vertically and then turning into a 90 angle horizontally
        down deeper. These types of tombs are usually up against a
        mountain overhang with dirt piled over them and with a round
        flat rock over the entrance or sometimes cedar wood and then
        dirt on top of that. The vertical part of this type of tomb is
        also usually packed with a layer of sand and a layer of clay for
        many layers deep before or to the horizontal turn. <br>
        <br>
        The burials that are secured, with heavy bronze metal doors, in
        tunnels that connect with the U/C’s, are decorated with many
        artifacts made of precious metals as well as precious jewels.
        The other burials, like the ones in the cliff overhang areas,
        are usually empty of metallic articles or gems. The “tunnel
        burials” that lead to the U/C’s all have heavy, heavy bronze
        doors that are closed &amp; locked tight, apparently so no one
        can enter their cities unauthorized. <br>
        <br>
        In some cases there is a bronze door at both ends of these
        burial tunnels (double protection?)!&nbsp; This seems to me like
        there is a social status pecking order so to speak, where some
        are ceremoniously buried&nbsp; with beautiful articles with them
        and others are buried (in the cliff overhang areas) with
        virtually nothing on their persons and more exposed to the
        elements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        4. The “Skinwalker Ranch” here in Utah as well as the John
        Edmonds place by Buckeye, Arizona area and many others areas (in
        Utah, Arizona, “Zone of Silence”/Mexico and beyond) I have
        personally investigated are all smack-dab on top of underground
        cities with close-to-surface sepulchers. <br>
        <br>
        There is always a magnetic vortex at or within a hundred feet of
        where the strange “Ghost” phenomena often occur. <br>
        <br>
        I measure these magnetic fields, that just scarcely reach the
        surface of the ground (sometimes just under the ground a few
        feet), of these underground cities. This way I can measure the
        approximate size of the city. Some of them are many miles in
        diameter, but so far they have always been square, measuring
        horizontally on or from the surface of the flat or even
        convoluted ground, but pyramid shaped vertically in the earth.
        &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        The magnetic fields that encompass these U/C’s at or under the
        ground level are approximately eight times stronger than our
        regular earth surface magnetic field strength. <br>
        The primary magnetic vortex is always in the very middle or
        center of the UC’s and like all of the Underground Cities, they
        have a North polarity to our West and a South polarity to our
        East, unless it is South of the equator, then it is reversed. <br>
        This makes them easy to find with a large and proper
        dip-compass. <br>
        <br>
        Detecting downward from the surface of the ground to the top of
        a U/C gives me the depth, however as I move away from the center
        in increments and re take the depth in order repeatedly, as I
        move away from the top city center, it is always deeper as I
        move away detecting in increments at a time until I am off of
        the edge of the city. Finally I did the rough math on this and
        calculated that these U/C’s are somewhere between 52 &amp; 54
        degrees, similar to the Egyptian pyramids!<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        5. So far, all of the underground cities (except for dead or
        unoccupied ones) have frequent Un-identified Flying Objects
        around them and at other times intermittently. The abandoned
        U/C’s do not have a North/ South polarity facing East and West,
        but North and South. I am not sure if these are abandoned or in
        some kind of stasis. Perhaps this is the “Underworld” the
        Egyptians spoke of, with both dead and live residents?<br>
        <br>
        6. It is my opinion that the strange phenomena around the
        “Skinwalker Ranch”, John Edmonds place, Zona del Silencio,
        Mexico (at 26°41'43.22"N 103°49'5.05"W) and others (like them) I
        have personally investigated are created or produced by these
        technologically advanced (U/C) people to discourage and spook
        people from living by or being at the main entrance to their
        cities. Kind of like a stranger sleeping on your doorstep to
        them I suspect.&nbsp; The magnetic centers or edges are also
        commonly known for having slightly altered plant and animal life
        and lightning strikes are more common there also. <br>
        <br>
        Another possibility is that these people could be producing a
        sort of Security three-dimensional Hologram Golem to protect
        their Cities!? I have interviewed many people that encounter
        very large snakes, wolves and other spooky creatures, which can
        be an advanced complex hologram?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        7. Besides my own personal experiences I am certainly relatively
        surprised at how many people of various social levels, class,
        position &amp; even religious people are now finally willing to
        speak of what they see of the super-natural or unusual. <br>
        <br>
        At one point a highway was being made through the Virgin Gorge
        between St. George, Utah and Nevada. A lot of blasting was going
        on.&nbsp; Finally this blasting accidently opened up a tunnel,
        that led to an underground city and a lot of light came bursting
        out. The crew went down the tunnel and found a very beautiful,
        clean, lit up city, with crystal balls illuminating very
        brightly as a light source. Many of these men were religious and
        this must have been a shock to most of them.<br>
        <br>
        The military was subsequently notified and soon security guards
        were dispatched to this place, while concrete trucks came and
        filled up the tunnel. This was years back but some of the
        witnesses are still alive.&nbsp; Their opinions, belief and
        theories vary a lot depending on their knowledge, experience and
        background, but they are searching for answers and truths in
        their own way. <br>
        <br>
        It is also amazing how many cowboys, farmers and ranchers see
        strange phenomena, such as UFO’s and even ancient burials
        discovered by accident during work on the ranch.&nbsp;
        Landscaping, building (water well drilling) or even flashfloods
        have uncovered ancient remains. <br>
        <br>
        It has been my understanding that most farmers/ranchers will
        hide as much evidence as they can of any burials on their farm,
        so they will not get involved with the government and all the
        bullying, micro-management and cover-ups that goes along with
        this. <br>
        <br>
        I think they also realize that the government takes and does not
        share, so private research (grassroots) is being
        developed!&nbsp; I sure am glad that private individuals are
        taking this responsibility, however risky it may be!<br>
        <br>
        8. I think Russell Burrows (“Burrows Cave”) (Illinois), Gordon
        L. Smith (Utah) and Earl John Brewer Sr. (Utah) all may have
        broken the law in a severe way by doing their own private
        excavation of ancient antiquities without an official
        archeologist, anthropologist or a permit and could have all gone
        to prison for a very long time if prosecuted &amp; convicted.<br>
        <br>
        I remember back just a few short years ago that a person was
        going to be imprisoned for trafficking or selling Native
        American Artifacts and he committed suicide so he would not have
        to serve time in prison, because this was serious business. <br>
        <br>
        Now some of this makes me truly wonder why Russell Burrows,
        Gordon L. Smith&nbsp; and Earl John Brewer Sr. were never
        prosecuted or convicted for what they did as to their private
        excavations of ancient human materials!??<br>
        <br>
        I suspect, that in order to prosecute them that the evidence
        would have to prove far too many things that the government
        wants to keep covered up! A form of silent immunity so to speak!
        Besides there is evidence that indicates that a sort of truce
        was made between these “grave robbers” or private researchers
        and the government. A sort of a gag-order, so to speak! <b><br>
          <br>
          Who Has Lived Here?<br>
          <br>
        </b>I am part Amerindian myself and I do understand why my
        Native relations are offended by people digging up their
        ancestral graves. Most peoples of all races are offended with
        people digging their ancestral graves also.&nbsp; There are
        accounts the Tall People didn’t like the Spanish robbing their
        sepulchers either and I know of two places (reported to me)
        where Spanish smelted bars and gold artifacts and dead Spaniards
        were all found together in a tunnel. I don’t know if it was
        Amerindian people that killed the Spanish or the Tall People
        that killed them!<br>
        <br>
        However, the “Native American Repatriation Act” did not only
        save my Native American relations from burial disturbances, but
        it also helped with a hidden government (agenda) decree, that
        the common people of this country will remain relatively
        ignorant of the truth of what is underground and so this Act
        helped the government further their own purpose primarily.
        &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        All-the-while many are mostly miss-directed to be looking
        upwards for dangers or technology, instead of downwards where
        the real mystery foundation rests protected by those that live
        under and those that live on and hidden-away safely! &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        9. I suspect that the continuous government “land grab” in Utah
        over the years… making National Parks, National Monuments, and
        for Endangered Species, Wilderness and study areas is a
        government covert way of keeping people off of the land so that
        little or nothing underground is discovered anymore and so the
        lid is kept on. In Utah, a large percentage of the land is
        government owned. There are Federal holdings, State holdings,
        Native American lands, etc. and then a very little left for the
        people on the surface. <br>
        <br>
        The old idea that you couldn’t walk on the Kings land, is
        becoming reality as areas are cut off, blocked off, marked with
        motion sensors, permitted, etc.<br>
        <br>
        The amount of gold in some U/C burials is staggering, and
        believe me; the Spanish were continuously exploiting this when
        they were here, until they were run out in 1680 by the
        Indigenous Peoples at that time. <br>
        <br>
        The Spanish sent people to make permanent villages, to
        accomplish their goals of finding, re-melting and transportation
        of wealth.&nbsp; The building materials from these old villages
        (as bricks, adobes, rocks and metals) were later scavenged by
        homesteaders and pioneers and in some cases, remaining sites
        have been bulldozed, to eliminate evidence of their
        existence.&nbsp; This I have also investigated in a grassroots
        way by personally talking to the elders that saw and remember,
        because “His- tory”, history is far too often tampered with for
        many purposes of politics and intrigue. <br>
        <br>
        The Mormon (L.D.S) Church (early on) fared very well with some
        of this Utah “Spanish gold” as they were friends with Chief
        Walkara of the Ute and he allowed them to take continuous
        amounts of gold from a “Spanish mine” that had smelted gold in
        it piled in bars stacked for about a mile in length and several
        feet high. <br>
        <br>
        Early on the Ute had many stories of the underground cities
        about the country; some of this is mentioned in an old book
        called “Indian Joe” that I have a copy of, received from a Ute
        Medicine Man who is a grandson of the Medicine Man it talks
        about. Usually these U/C’s were referred to as “The Seven Sacred
        Caves” by the Ute. Perhaps these are the “Seven Cities of Cibola
        spoken of by the Spanish”? However there are far more than seven
        U/C’s in Utah.<br>
        <br>
        I well remember that Heinrich Schliemann (German archaeologist)
        found the ancient city of Troy from the so called myths and
        stories mentioned in the Iliad of Homer. A good researcher or
        explorer will pay very close attention to these written or oral
        myths and legends, because they are based on varying amounts of
        truth passed down from ages long ago.<br>
        <br>
        10. I have been in the professional detection business for about
        25 years now and have used many types of detection
        machines.&nbsp; Why do so many people have machines and find so
        little? There is a lot of science going on that the other
        machines don’t have and the people don’t understand or cover,
        like element discrimination and identification and “ghost
        images” that foil accurate detection.&nbsp; Six inches to six
        feet in depth perception also misses a tremendous
        amount.&nbsp;&nbsp; Modern satellite images are finding massive
        underground cities, but most of this is proprietary information.
        <br>
        <br>
        Things as satellite images have been confirming the science
        studies and tests I run, with my inventions, because they
        essentially detect the same locations as I do, except that I
        identify the various elements, their weight and even metal
        alloys. <br>
        <br>
        11. Steve, a thought on your question about the bronze door in
        the U/C sepulchers and the "evil demons" that can be around
        these places. <br>
        <br>
        I don't really think these underworld people are necessarily
        evil, but I do see that they send out "evil energy such
        as&nbsp;hologram pictures or images" to frighten people
        away&nbsp;as a security/protection measure. We also have borders
        with security and patrols, to keep unauthorized people out of
        our country also. <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        One time I camped on one of these protected places and had a
        very strong visible experience with this spook phenomena or
        strategy.&nbsp; Another time my wife camped in an area and
        experienced this also, she was not pleased at being threatened,
        so I checked the area out and it was, as can be expected,
        another U/C site! <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        A friend of mine&nbsp;has had a lot of trouble, with this
        "demon" phenomena in their house.&nbsp; I checked his house and
        yard out&nbsp;and there was a small magnetic mono-pole there
        that went to a U/C below, so I placed a metal shield there that
        blocked most of it.&nbsp;This stopped the “demon” problem <br>
        <br>
        or substantially reduced it. Next time I will recommend using
        more metal or a special counter-polarity magnetic shield to
        neutralize it better! <br>
        <br>
        Steve, as far as I know there are no large Giant bones that
        anyone excavated that will be allowed to be displayed. This is
        probably out of fear.<br>
        <br>
        DNA work done by BYU in Utah on a Giant mummy from a hair sample
        (from the “Brewer Cave”) was covered over.&nbsp; It was
        (quietly) leaked out that this human specimen is the healthiest
        person they’d ever tested or heard of.&nbsp; Other similar
        remains have been stolen since, from Southern Utah. &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Over the years I have offered to help reveal where some Giant
        bones are, for those that want to do&nbsp; DNA tests, but so far
        no one wants to take the responsibility or cover the cost of
        excavating to open a tomb and there are also permits that take
        time.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        It is usually "gimmee, gimmee, gimmee"
        and&nbsp;I&nbsp;personally cover the cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most are
        "tire thumpers", without the financial backing to get a job
        done. <br>
        <br>
        One tomb is on private property and I have permission to
        excavate, but no takers that will pay for this cost! I even had
        a couple approach me a few weeks ago and ask me to use my
        professional equipment, knowledge and experience to do some
        detection work looking for ancient materials and wanted a
        "freebee".&nbsp; I said no and then they offered me a very, very
        small amount of pay and I of course declined and I was happy to
        see them go!&nbsp;Perhaps I look too much like Santa Claus, ha,
        ha! &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        I thought I still had a lead plate from the "Brewer Cave" but I
        think it <br>
        was put back in the cave by Brewer. I still have a Forensic
        Report on it that Robert “Ghost Wolf” helped me get done, as
        well as Forensic Reports on some other articles from a Southern
        Utah Giant burial.<br>
        <br>
        (This is the end of the sent letter and revisions to it.)<br>
        <b><br>
          Our Point in Time<br>
          <br>
        </b>We, as surface peoples, are “sitting on a powder keg”.&nbsp;
        Why? The lures of very high technologies, libraries and human
        ideas of wealth have become the focus of many past and present
        World Powers and perhaps intrigue games beyond that.&nbsp; In
        our current time are massive machines, bombs, secret groups that
        can cause fast and rapid havoc the world over.&nbsp; Could
        “Might Makes Right” or “Manifest Destiny” be their motto? is a
        good question. &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        The Bible indicates the Giants were to remain separate and to a
        degree, they apparently have.&nbsp; We have grown up generally
        not knowing that our world was one of massive cities right under
        our feet, whether in the crust or below waters.&nbsp; They have
        space ships with “Star Trek” capabilities.&nbsp; Who knew??? We
        have used horses, burros, camels, elephants, bicycles, cars,
        boats and planes, but our modern technology is very new and
        young. &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        On the surface, we struggle with economic and mental problems,
        as well as starvation, illnesses, environmental damage, short
        lives, diseases…. Do you remember the admonition on Star Trek
        programs to leave other planets and civilizations to their
        development without interference disturbing them? Perhaps this
        is the policy here on the surface of the earth and it appears to
        be the governments mandate to the common peoples!<br>
        <br>
        The Bible also says there are problems with corruption at all
        levels.&nbsp; Is God's enforced or mandated separation and peace
        now in the process of being broken, under land, on land and in
        space?&nbsp; The earlier account of some of the Watchers
        (Nephilim) breaking guidelines and providing inappropriate
        technology levels and hybridizing with mankind, which then
        hampered or altered Man’s development for the worse, is a
        Biblical piece of this history.<br>
        <br>
        There are stories of both friendly human/Tall People
        encounters…as hikers being rescued…and other unfriendly ones…
        even rumors of slavery, in world stories and incidents.&nbsp;
        Native Americans in the U.S. had both friendly and unfriendly
        interactions with the U/P’s.&nbsp; Some are peaceful
        co-guardians of old places, so I think that we cannot generalize
        or stereotype these underground people and place them all in the
        same category, any more than we can do the same on Earth with
        our respective surface peoples around the world where we have
        both good, in-between and evil all living parallel or and or
        close to one another. The Hopi talk about a time when the U/P
        took them inside for protection.<br>
        <br>
        The Navajo have had terrible troubles with disruption and
        displacement of their people and their own “Trail of
        Tears”.&nbsp; Still, they have managed the preservation of an
        underground library over a mile in diameter, which they say are
        the “records of the world” and they fought the Spanish to keep
        them out of it. I spent a little time above this library doing
        detection work to record whatever I could get and this detection
        indicated as much, so then it is again another piece of oral
        history that matched up with examination. <b><br>
          <br>
          Testing, Testing<br>
          <br>
        </b>The U.S. government at one point apparently sent an
        experimental missile to Mexico over “The Zone of Silence”, a
        place known to cause cars to fail, planes to go down and people
        generally to stay out of.<br>
        <br>
        Locally it is called “The Zone of Silence” because no air
        traffic is possible there.&nbsp; What happened to that
        missile?&nbsp; According to the story, it was driven to the
        ground, unexploded, and the government had to go quietly and
        manually retrieve it.<br>
        <br>
        Another account (I personally interviewed) is of a fighter jet
        pilot over the Kanab, UT area.&nbsp; (Jets fly through there a
        lot, as well as remote controlled small drones flying on routes
        through the air are commonplace.)&nbsp; On a moments impulse,
        this pilot is said to have aimed an armed missile at the ground,
        and suddenly noted (on his screen) his onboard computer
        detecting a missile being aimed at him and he was now becoming
        the target of an active missile.&nbsp; He apparently rapidly
        scrambled to deactivate his targeting missile and move far away
        from that area fast.<br>
        <br>
        Finally, a few years later, two reliable sources told me about a
        UFO that was brought down by another UFO in the hills just west
        of Kanab, Utah. It was not known of by the general public.&nbsp;
        Subsequently, the U.S. government located and salvaged the
        wreckage and removed it, mostly at night. I was also able to
        verify this personally. I can still remember the sight, ground
        vibration and sound of the heavy, heavy military helicopters
        maneuvering in that area at night.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b><br>

        </b>In his own quiet life, Earl J. Brewer Sr. became a Guardian
        of an ancient underground tomb.&nbsp; His family didn’t like it
        or value it much and people hounded him a lot.&nbsp; He worked
        hard at common hard work and had no glory or recognition.&nbsp;
        I knew him very well for over three decades. I also spent many
        hours talking with him and he told me something that I <br>
        believed and never forgot, but he also asked me to keep it
        secret as long as he was alive and so I have.&nbsp; Now that he
        has crossed over, I can mention it briefly. <br>
        <br>
        Earl J. Brewer told me that he was invited by the underground
        people to spend about a day with them in their city and attend a
        meeting. He accepted and was taken there. He told me that,
        “There were many other people, from someplace else there, that
        were also invited to the meeting.”&nbsp; Some were very
        obviously not human and with visible differences in physical
        looks as well as sizes, colors and shapes. Some of them he said
        did not even breathe air as we do, but looked to be enclosed in
        a bubble of a sort with some kind of gas. Apparently there was
        an important person giving a message to all of these beings and
        Earl was privileged to be there, but would not reveal what the
        lecture subject was about. <br>
        <br>
        The rumors that there are UFO’s and aliens to deal with are
        true. We as a surface world people will have a problem of
        sorting the sources, origin and owners of things, such as copies
        of stolen ships and energy drives, and other technologies that
        have appeared in our societies in the last half a century.&nbsp;
        Much of our modern computers are said to have come from
        reverse-engineering things on a crashed ship like from Roswell,
        New Mexico in 1948. <br>
        <br>
        Are such things as internet, subliminal holograms, media,
        security cameras, part of this borrowed technology and is it now
        being used to help, or as mind and physical controls?&nbsp;
        Tools are only as good as the values of the users. <br>
        <br>
        I know a man (retired from NASA) that developed a very valuable
        scientific instrument that is not commonly known of by the
        public, but I suspect that he did not personally develop it, but
        was allowed to claim it as his, for purposes of covering up the
        real source it came from, which I believe is from elsewhere.
        Besides, he is relatively poor, lives very conservatively in a
        small cheap house with few resources, when he would be very
        wealthy with an invention like he showed me! <br>
        <br>
        I have only done a very small brief on the above. There is a lot
        for all of us to learn and I am still at it.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        If you ever need a place of refuge, here is something to think
        on…<br>

            About 6 Weeks Away From Housing Collapse</b><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        Over the past couple of months, we have written frequently about
        the impact of Chinese money laundering operations on home prices
        in a couple of large cities around the globe.&nbsp; So far, the
        Vancouver market has seemingly been the hardest hit with homes
        prices collapsing over 20% in one month after the city passed a
        15% property tax on foreign buyers on July 25, 2016 (see "As The
        Vancouver Housing Market Implodes, The "Smart Money" Is Rushing
        To Get Out Now"). <br>
        <br>
        Now, a U.S. based think tank, International Strategic Studies
        Association (ISSA), is warning that similar efforts to restrict
        Chinese investment in Australian real estate could send prices
        tumbling there as well.&nbsp; In speaking with news.com.au, Greg
        Copley, President of ISSA, predicted that Australia has about 6
        weeks before real estate prices start to collapse...<br>

          code of organisms makes living cells more photo-toxic</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>by</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Lisa Zyga</b><br>

      <b><br>
      </b>In 2014, the incorporation of two artificial letters of
      genetic code into the DNA of Escherichia coli gave the bacteria
      the distinction of becoming the world's first stable semisynthetic
      organism.<br>
      <br>
      The modification was intended to illustrate the possibility of
      enabling organisms to incorporate and replicate an artificial base
      pair for the future biosynthesis of novel proteins. But now in a
      new study, scientists have discovered that the artificial base
      pair has an unintended consequence on living cells: phototoxicity.
      The new results show that the artificial base pair makes living
      cells more susceptible to damage from low doses of sunlight and
      standard fluorescent light bulbs, leading to a significant
      decrease in cell survival and growth.<br>
      <br>
      The study, titled "Unintended Consequences of Expanding the
      Genetic Alphabet," is published in a recent issue of the Journal
      of the American Chemical Society by a team of researchers led by
      Carlos E. Crespo-Hernández from Case Western Reserve University,
      along with coauthors from Case Western and Columbia University.<br>
      <br>
      "There is currently an ongoing quest to genetically modify living
      cells and organisms with different purposes," Crespo-Hernández
      told Phys.org. "Our work clearly cautions scientists that care
      must be exercised when efforts are made to expand the genetic
      alphabet, especially if the synthetic organisms may be exposed to
      light— a fact that has been hitherto overlooked."<br>
      <br>
      The artificial base pair consists of two nucleosides (which are
      nucleotides without a phosphate group) called d5SICS and dNaM.
      These artificial nucleosides have different chemical structures
      than the natural nucleosides, which are those made of the adenine,
      guanine, thymine, and cytosine nucleobases. Due to their different
      chemical structures, the artificial and natural nucleosides absorb
      light at different wavelengths. The artificial nucleosides
      strongly absorb light with wavelengths in the near-visible range,
      or just under 400 nm. In contrast, natural nucleosides absorb
      light most strongly at higher energies, those with wavelengths
      less than 300 nm.<br>
      <br>
      Since everyday lighting, such as the sunlight that reaches Earth's
      surface and fluorescent light bulbs, contains much more light in
      the near-visible range than in the higher-energy ultraviolet
      range, we receive significantly greater exposure to light with
      near-visible wavelengths.<br>
      <br>
      To investigate how this light absorption difference may affect
      living cells, the researchers in the new study performed an
      experiment with living cancer cells from human skin (epidermoid
      carcinoma cells). When exposed to a low dose of near-visible
      light, cells that had not been treated with the artificial
      nucleoside d5SICS exhibited no change in cell survival. Cells that
      had been treated with the artificial nucleoside, but not exposed
      to near-visible light, were similarly unaffected. But cells
      containing the artificial nucleoside that were briefly exposed to
      near-visible light exhibited a substantial decrease in cell
      proliferation, indicating that the artificial nucleoside had
      photosensitized these cells to near-visible light, resulting in
      photochemical damage.<br>
      <br>
      Based on further investigation, the researchers think that one of
      the most probable mechanisms of the light-induced damage is that
      light exposure produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) inside the
      cells. High levels of ROS are known to cause cell damage, and the
      living cells containing the artificial nucleoside exhibited much
      higher levels of ROS upon exposure to near-visible light than
      untreated cells did.<br>
      <br>
      Overall, the results illustrate the complexities involved in the
      ways that making even a small modification to an organism's
      genetic code may have far-reaching and unforeseen consequences for
      the entire organism.<br>
      <br>
      The upside, however, is that some of the unforeseen consequences
      may have benefits if used in a controlled way. For instance, the
      researchers are currently investigating how the phototoxicity of
      the artificial nuceloside could be used as a method to treat
      cancer.<br>
      <br>
      "The significant phototoxic activity of d5SICS in epidermoid
      carcinoma cells has the potential to open new opportunities for
      its use in topical photodynamic therapy applications, as our group
      and others have recently proposed for several nucleobase
      analogues," Crespo-Hernández said.<br>

      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Scientists from Forschungszentrum Juelich have developed the
      first complete and compact design for an artificial photosynthesis
      facility. This is a decisive step towards applying the technology.
      The concept is flexible both with respect to the materials used
      and also the size of the system. The researchers have now
      published their findings in the journal Nature Communications.<br>
      <br>
      In future, sun and wind will supply the lion's share of our
      energy. The fluctuating nature of these renewable energy sources
      means that current research is focusing more intensively on
      efficient storage technologies. Like the energy sources
      themselves, these technologies should be environmentally friendly
      and affordable. This trend is particularly apparent in research on
      direct photoelectrochemical water splitting, that is to say
      artificial photosynthesis employing a combination of solar cell
      and electrolyser. In this way, solar energy can be directly
      converted into the universal storage medium of hydrogen. This
      process was first investigated in the 1970s, but has only begun to
      attract increasing attention in recent years. As yet, research has
      focused on materials science for new absorber materials and
      catalysts to further improve efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      Juelich solar cell researchers Jan-Philipp Becker and Bugra Turan,
      however, are concentrating on an aspect that has so far largely
      been neglected: a realistic design that can take this technology
      from the scientists' laboratories and put it into practical
      applications. "To date, photoelectrochemical water splitting has
      only ever been tested on a laboratory scale," explains Burga
      Turan. "The individual components and materials have been
      improved, but nobody has actually tried to achieve a real
      application."<b><br>
        <br>
        Compact, complete, and expandable<br>
        <br>
      </b>The design created by the two experts from Juelich's Institute
      of Energy and Climate Research is clearly different from the usual
      laboratory experiments. Instead of individual components the size
      of a finger nail that are connected by wires, the researchers have
      developed a compact, self-contained system -- constructed
      completely of low-cost, readily available materials.<br>
      <br>
      With a surface area of 64 cm2, their component still appears
      relatively small. The trick is in its flexible design. By
      continuously repeating the basic unit, it will in future even be
      possible to fabricate systems that are several square metres in
      size. The basic unit itself consists of several solar cells
      connected to each other by a special laser technique. "This series
      connection means that each unit reaches the voltage of 1.8 volt
      necessary for hydrogen production," says Jan-Philipp Becker. "This
      method permits greater efficiency in contrast to the concepts
      usually applied in laboratory experiments for scaling up."<b><br>
        <br>
        Compatible with a wide range of technologies<br>
        <br>
      </b>At the moment, the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of the
      prototype is 3.9 %. "That doesn't sound like much," admits Bugra
      Turan. "But naturally this is only the first draft for a complete
      facility. There's still plenty of room for improvement." In fact
      -- the scientists add -- natural photosynthesis only achieves an
      efficiency of one per cent. Jan-Philipp Becker is of the opinion
      that within a relatively short time the Jülich design could be
      increased to around 10 % efficiency using conventional solar cell
      materials. However, there are also other approaches. For instance,
      perovskites, a novel class of hybrid materials, with which it is
      already possible to achieve efficiencies of up to 14 %.<br>
      <br>
      "This is one of the big advantages of the new design, which
      enables the two main components to be optimized separately: the
      photovoltaic part that produces electricity from solar energy and
      the electrochemical part that uses this electricity for water
      splitting." The Jülich researchers have patented this concept,
      which can be flexibly applied for all types of thin-film
      photovoltaic technology and for various types of electrolyser.
      "For the first time, we are working towards a market launch," says
      Becker. "We have created the basis to make this reality."<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>The Code is an ancient matrix system built up of monuments all
      across the globe. These monuments include megalithic stone works,
      pyramids, circular works, effigies, and ancient earth mound. Each
      structure is a point in a remarkable global matrix which explains
      a global positioning system involving the mathematical precisions
      of the Earth. In order to "read" this matrix one must first change
      the current Prime Meridian back to the pyramid fields at Giza. For
      longitude the ancient builders referenced their original Prime
      Meridian that ran from pole to pole marked by The Great Pyramid at
      Giza. Today it can be found at 31 degrees, 08 minutes, and 00.8
      seconds to the east of our modern Greenwich Prime Meridian. For
      latitude, ancient monuments were referenced to the same equator
      that we use today.<br>
      <br>
      Once we do this, properly, the monuments of the global matrix
      system become as the individual pages of an encyclopedia,
      beautifully preserved through numbers and maps. Batteries not
      included or required. The access key is curiosity.<b><br>

          viable after all</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
        Microsoft researchers have teamed up with physicists from the
        University of California, Santa Barbara, to show how time
        crystals might be possible.<br>
        <br>
        First proposed by Nobel-prize winning theoretical physicist
        Frank Wilczek, time crystals are hypothetical systems that
        spontaneously break time-translational symmetry (TTS) – a
        fundamental symmetry in physics. In plain language, they exhibit
        tiny movements without using energy.<br>
        <br>
        Crystals have a rigid arrangement of atoms that break
        translational symmetry. Their structure is not symmetrical in
        space, unlike a sphere, which looks the same from all
        directions.<br>
        <br>
        Time crystals break the symmetry of space and time. Wilczek
        considered a group of atoms in their ground state moving in
        perpetual circular motion, which is considered an impossible
        idea because ground states do not have enough energy to
        spontaneously move.<br>
        <br>
        Dominic Else, co-author of the paper, published in Physical
        Review Letters and a physicist at UCSB, said that there was a
        “crucial difference” between explicit and spontaneous symmetry
        breaking.<br>
        <br>
        "If a symmetry is broken explicitly, then the laws of nature do
        not have the symmetry any more; spontaneous symmetry breaking
        means that the laws of nature have a symmetry, but nature
        chooses a state that doesn't," Else told Phys.org.<br>
        <br>
        For time crystals the laws of nature don’t change with time, but
        the time crystals themselves change as it chooses a ground-state
        motion which spontaneously breaks TTS.<br>
        <br>
        The team of researchers have many rules for their hypothetical
        quantum time crystal systems, known as
        “Floquet-many-body-localized driven systems".<br>
        <br>
        The Floquet time crystals must never reach thermal equilibrium
        and radiate heat or they would lose rotational energy. When the
        size of the system grows, the time it takes for TTS to decay
        into a time-translational independent state is infinite, so TTS
        is broken forever without violating the second law of
        thermodynamics.<br>
        <br>
        "The significance of our work is two-fold: on one hand, it
        demonstrates that time-translation symmetry is not immune to
        being spontaneously broken," said co-author Bela Bauer, a
        researcher at Microsoft Station Q.<br>
        <br>
        "On the other hand, it deepens our understanding that
        non-equilibrium systems can host many interesting states of
        matter that cannot exist in equilibrium systems," Bauer added.<br>
        <br>
        Spontaneous symmetry breaking is commonly found in physics, the
        paper said.<br>
        <br>
        “For almost every symmetry imaginable, there is a model whose
        ground state breaks it:crystals break the continuous
        translational and rotational symmetries of Coulomb interactions;
        magnetically ordered materials break time-reversal symmetry and
        spin symmetry, and superfluids break global gauge symmetry.”<br>
        <br>
        But, no one has ever observed the breaking of TTS.<br>
        <br>
        The researchers believe they can demonstrate this elusive
        property by using oscillating trapped ions or superconducting
        qubits to represent a floquet time crystal. The experiment would
        observe how the system evolves over time to see whether TTS
        broke spontaneously.<br>

        <br>
        We define what it means for time translation symmetry to be
        spontaneously broken in a quantum system and show with
        analytical arguments and numerical simulations that this occurs
        in a large class of many-body-localized driven systems with
        discrete time-translation symmetry.<br>

            Could be Cure for Dementia</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Whereas sharks' reputation as man-eaters might be a bit
      exaggerated, their keen sense for blood is legendary. An average
      shark can detect a drop of blood from many kilometers away. Today,
      sharks could donate their own blood to save humankind from
      dangerous brain diseases, Danish scientists argue.<br>

      expectancy in the West being steadily on the rise, various brain
      diseases have are becoming increasingly prevalent. A group of
      Danish researchers aims to investigate the possibilities of using
      shark blood to finally find a cure for serious brain diseases such
      as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or dementia. <br>
      <br>
      The research group, named DEMKIP, unites marine biologists,
      bio-chemists, engineers, doctors and professors, and is determined
      to obtain the necessary funding for further research via
      crowdfunding. According to DEMKIP, which hopes to provide a
      biological drug with few to no side-effects at all, previously
      conducted research shows that the progression of brain diseases
      such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's can be stopped or even
      reversed by using an innovative biomolecular approach. By its own
      admission, DEMKIP's two-year research revealed that damage caused
      by neurodegenerative diseases may be partially restored, thus
      alleviating the plight of the patients. We have won more than 19
      prestigious awards and nominations. Be a part of our dream. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      ​"We are campaigning to raise money to create a shark preservation
      program… we will be able to develop a treatment that can cure or
      even reverse brain diseases," DEMKIP wrote on its crowdfunding
      site at Indiegogo. DEMKIP is working in close cooperation with the
      University of Copenhagen, the Technical University of Denmark
      (DTU) and the National University of Singapore. Many of the
      participants have family members struggling with brain diseases,
      such as dementia. With its crowdfunding efforts, researchers hope
      to raise a million US dollars over the next few months. As a
      bonus, the shark lab may be used for the conservation and
      protection of endangered shark species.&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      shark blood was believed to contain antibodies that may serve as a
      basis for a treatment for breast cancer. In 2013, the University
      of Aberdeen, Scotland, received over $320,000 from the UK-based
      non-profit Association for International Cancer Research (AICR) to
      study shark blood's potential to stop cancer cells from growing,
      news outlet CBS News reported. Sharks have antibodies that are
      particularly effective to mobilize the human body's immune
      defense, which can be utilized in the fight against human cancers.
      Australian researchers at La Trobe University in Melbourne have
      extracted these antibodies, which are also believed to be helpful
      in a range of diseases, such as fibrosis, malaria and rheumatoid
      arthritis. In Denmark alone, there are 85,000 people living with
      dementia, with about 8,500 new cases registered every year. The
      number of sick is expected to rise to 140,000 by 2040. The total
      cost of dementia treatment amounts to 20 billion DKK a year
      (roughly $3 billion). Dementia is the fifth most common cause of
      death in Denmark.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      As he mentioned in his March 21, 2016 Coast to Coast interview, he
      appears to be keeping to his own words that he doesn't see any
      reason to continue his work beyond 2016... (yet, so soon, Ed?)<br>
      <br>
      I had not seen nor heard anything about the message he gave there
      until Aug 29 when I got an email from Marshall Master's YOWUSA.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Quote Ed Dames – Exposing Planet X, 8/27/2016 – PX is Real and
        Inbound!</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Marshall Masters | August 29, 2016</b><br>
      <br>
      For months those of us with an interest in Planet X have waited
      with anticipation to find out what remote viewing instructor,
      Major Ed Dames, would reveal at his recent Exposing Planet X Event
      in Las Vegas on August 27, 2016. In this interview you are going
      to learn the key points that were made at that event by Dames.<br>
      <br>
      Although Ed Dames only spent 40 minutes that day talking about
      planet X, what he said was groundbreaking and courageous – Planet
      X is real, it is inbound, and it is going to cause a tribulation.
      After the event reliable sources gave me and my wife, Jennifer,
      detailed information about what Ed said and when he said it. That
      same afternoon I recorded this interview with Rex Bear of Live
      Leak.<br>
      <br>
      Over these last few months many have wondered if Ed would take the
      safe route and spout the elite line, or would he have the stones
      to break free? Well, that’s exactly what he did. At this event Ed
      announced that he will retire at the end of this month, and he
      divulged breathtaking remote viewing information about Planet X.<br>
      <br>
      As a researcher I was impressed because the vast majority of what
      Ed said directly corroborates what I have written in my two books,
      Being In It for the Species: The Universe Speaks, and, Surviving
      the Planet X Tribulation: a Faith-Based Leadership Guide.<br>

      <br>
      Some may wonder why it took Ed Dames so long to reveal this
      information. What they do not understand is that when it comes to
      the topic of Planet X, researchers have the right to follow the
      truth straight to the bottom of an unmarked grave.<br>
      <br>
      Planet X is a deadly topic. There are times when you can speak,
      times when you can push the edge of the envelope, and times when
      you can make peace with your awareness. Ed spoke. Ed pushed the
      edge of the envelope. Ed made peace with his awareness. After
      listening to this Live Leak interview, ask yourself, can you do
      the same?<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Here's How NASA Thinks Society Will
            Collapse</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Too much inequality and too few natural resources could leave the
      West vulnerable to a Roman Empire-style fall.<br>
      <br>
      [ Not to mention Muslim invasion, Jewish subversion, &amp;
      psychopathic politicians &amp; bankers ]<br>
      <br>
      Few think Western civilization is on the brink of collapse — but
      it's also doubtful the Romans and Mesopotamians saw their own
      demise coming either.<br>
      <br>
      If we're to avoid their fate, we'll need policies to reduce
      economic inequality and preserve natural resources, according to a
      NASA-funded study that looked at the collapses of previous
      societies.<br>
      <br>
      "Two important features seem to appear across societies that have
      collapsed," reads the study. "The stretching of resources due to
      the strain placed on the ecological carrying capacity and the
      economic stratification of society into Elites and Masses."<br>
      <br>
      In unequal societies, researchers said, "collapse is difficult to
      avoid.... Elites grow and consume too much, resulting in a famine
      among Commoners that eventually causes the collapse of society."<br>
      <br>
      As limited resources plague the working class, the wealthy,
      insulated from the problem, "continue consuming unequally" and
      exacerbate the issue, the study said.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, resources continue to be used up, even by the
      technologies designed to preserve them. For instance, "an increase
      in vehicle fuel efficiency technology tends to enable increased
      per capita vehicle miles driven, heavier cars, and higher average
      speeds, which then negate the gains from the increased
      fuel-efficiency," the study said.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers used what they termed a Human And Nature DYnamical
      (HANDY) formula to reach their conclusions. The formula uses
      factors such as birth rates, resources, and income classes to
      create a mathematical equation to project outcomes.<br>
      <br>
      The study was sponsored by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and
      headed by the National Science Foundation's Safa Motesharrei.<br>
      <br>
      For those who think modern society is immune from the problems
      that brought down ancient civilizations, a "brief overview of
      collapses demonstrates not only the ubiquity of the phenomenon,
      but also the extent to which advanced, complex and powerful
      societies are susceptible to collapse," the study said.<br>
      <br>
      So how do we save ourselves? "Collapse can be avoided, and
      population can reach a steady state at the maximum carrying
      capacity, if the rate of depletion of nature is reduced to a
      sustainable level, and if resources are distributed equitably,"
      reads the report.<br>

            power from graphene</b><br>
        </big><br>
        <b>by Han Lin</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Swinburne University researchers have invented a new, flexible
      energy-storage technology that could soon replace the batteries in
      our cars, phones and more.<br>
      <br>
      Han Lin's new super battery (actually, a supercapacitor) can store
      as much energy per kilogram as a lithium battery, but charges in
      minutes, or even seconds, and uses carbon instead of expensive
      lithium.<br>
      <br>
      The majority of batteries used in Australia are lead-acid
      batteries. These have three main disadvantages: they can take
      hours to charge, they have a limited lifespan for charging and
      discharging, and they're bad for the environment, therefore
      requiring special, expensive disposal processes.<br>
      <br>
      Han's supercapacitor charges extremely fast, can be charged and
      discharged millions of time, and is environmentally friendly.<br>
      <br>
      Previously, a major problem with supercapacitors has been their
      low capacity to store energy. But Han has overcome this problem by
      using sheets of a form of carbon known as graphene, which has a
      very large surface area available to store energy.<br>
      <br>
      Large scale production of the graphene that would be needed to
      produce these supercapacitors was once unachievable, but using a
      3-D printer, Han is able to produce graphene at a low cost.<br>
      <br>
      And because the technology is extremely flexible and thin (as thin
      as ordinary printing paper) the new super batteries could be
      potentially be built into clothing, or worn as a watch strap, to
      achieve a wearable power supply.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Breakthrough in materials science:
            Kiel research team can bond metals with nearly all surfaces
          </b><br>
        </big></div>
      <big> </big><br>
      Through this "nanoscale-sculpturing" process, metals such as
      aluminium, titanium, or zinc can permanently be joined with nearly
      all other materials, become water-repellent, or improve their
      biocompatibility. The potential spectrum of applications of these
      "super connections" is extremely broad, ranging from metalwork in
      industry right through to safer implants in medical technology.
      Their results have now been published in the prestigious journal
      Nanoscale Horizons of the Royal Society of Chemistry.<br>
      <br>
      "We have now applied a technology to metals that was previously
      only known from semiconductors. To use this process in such a way
      is completely new," said Dr. Jürgen Carstensen, co-author of the
      publication. In the process, the surface of a metal is converted
      into a semiconductor, which can be chemically etched and thereby
      specifically modified as desired. "As such, we have developed a
      process which - unlike other etching processes - does not damage
      the metals, and does not affect their stability," emphasised
      Professor Rainer Adelung, head of the "Functional Nanomaterials"
      team at the Institute for Materials Science. Adelung stressed the
      importance of the discovery: "In this way, we can permanently
      connect metals which could previously not be directly joined, such
      as copper and aluminium."<br>
      <br>
      <b>How does the "nanoscale-sculpturing" process work exactly?</b><br>
      <br>
      The surfaces of metals consist of many different crystals and
      grains, some of which are less chemically stable than others.
      These unstable particles can be specifically removed from the
      surface of a metal by a targeted etching. The top surface layer is
      roughened by the etching process, creating a three-dimensional
      surface structure. This changes the properties of the surface, but
      not of the metal as a whole. This is because the etching is only
      10 to 20 micrometers deep - a layer as thin as a quarter of the
      diameter of human hair. The research team has therefore named the
      process "nanoscale-sculpturing".<br>
      <br>
      The change due to etching is visible to the naked eye: the treated
      surface becomes matt. "If, for example, we treat a metal with
      sandpaper, we also achieve a noticeable change in appearance, but
      this is only two-dimensional, and does not change the
      characteristics of the surface," explained Dr. Mark-Daniel
      Gerngross of the research team on materials sciences from Kiel.<br>
      <br>
      Through the etching process, a 3D-structure with tiny hooks is
      created. If a bonding polymer is then applied between two treated
      metals, the surfaces inter-lock with each other in all directions
      like a three-dimensional puzzle. "These 3-D puzzle connections are
      practically unbreakable. In our experiments, it was usually the
      metal or polymer that broke, but not the connection itself," said
      Melike Baytekin-Gerngross, lead author of the publication.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Surfaces with multifunctional properties</b><br>
      <br>
      Even a thin layer of fat, such as that left by a fingerprint on a
      surface, does not affect the connection. "In our tests, we even
      smeared gearbox oil on metal surfaces. The connection still held,"
      explained Baytekin-Gerngross. Laborious cleaning of surfaces, such
      as the pre-treatment of ships' hulls before they can be painted,
      could thus be rendered unnecessary.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the research team exposed the puzzle connections to
      extreme heat and moisture, to simulate weather conditions. This
      also did not affect their stability. Carstensen emphasised: "Our
      connections are extremely robust and weather-resistant." A
      beneficial side-effect of the process is that the etching makes
      the surfaces of metal water-repellent. The resulting hook
      structure functions like a closely-interlocked 3D labyrinth,
      without holes which can be penetrated by water. The metals
      therefore possess a kind of built-in corrosion protection. "We
      actually don't know this kind of behaviour from metals like
      aluminium. A lotus effect with pure metals, i.e. without applying
      a water-repellent coating, that is new," said Adelung.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Potentially limitless applications</b><br>
      <br>
      "The range of potential applications is extremely broad, from
      metalworking industries such as ship-building or aviation, to
      printing technology and fire protection, right through to medical
      applications," said Gerngross. Because the "nanoscale-sculpturing"
      process not only creates a 3D surface structure, which can be
      purely physically bonded without chemicals, the targeted etching
      can also remove harmful particles from the surface, which is of
      particularly great interest in medical technology.<br>
      <br>
      Titanium is often used for medical implants. To mechanically fix
      the titanium in place, small quantities of aluminium are added.
      However, the aluminium can trigger undesirable side-effects in the
      body. "With our process, we can remove aluminium particles from
      the surface layer, and thereby obtain a significantly purer
      surface, which is much more tolerable for the human body. Because
      we only etch the uppermost layer on a micrometer scale, the
      stability of the whole implant remains unaffected," explained
      Carstensen.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers have so far applied for four patents for the
      process. Businesses have already shown substantial interest in the
      potential applications. "And our specialist colleagues in
      materials sciences have also reacted enthusiastically to our
      discoveries," said a delighted Adelung.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>New material to revolutionize water
            proofing</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Scientists at The Australian National University (ANU) have
      developed a new spray-on material with a remarkable ability to
      repel water.<br>
      <br>
      The new protective coating could eventually be used to waterproof
      mobile phones, prevent ice from forming on aeroplanes or protect
      boat hulls from corroding.<br>
      <br>
      "The surface is a layer of nanoparticles, which water slides off
      as if it's on a hot barbecue," said PhD student William Wong, from
      the Nanotechnology Research Laboratory at the ANU Research School
      of Engineering.<br>
      <br>
      The team created a much more robust coating than previous
      materials by combining two plastics, one tough and one flexible.<br>
      <br>
      "It's like two interwoven fishing nets, made of different
      materials," Mr Wong said.<br>
      <br>
      The water-repellent or superhydrophobic coating is also
      transparent and extremely resistant to ultraviolet radiation.<br>
      <br>
      Lead researcher and head of the Nanotechnology Research
      Laboratory, Associate Professor Antonio Tricoli, said the new
      material could change how we interact with liquids.<br>
      <br>
      "It will keep skyscraper windows clean and prevent the mirror in
      the bathroom from fogging up," Associate Professor Tricoli said.<br>
      <br>
      "The key innovation is that this transparent coating is able to
      stabilise very fragile nanomaterials resulting in ultra-durable
      nanotextures with numerous real-world applications."<br>
      <br>
      The team developed two ways of creating the material, both of
      which are cheaper and easier than current manufacturing processes.<br>
      <br>
      One method uses a flame to generate the nanoparticle constituents
      of the material. For lower temperature applications, the team
      dissolved the two components in a sprayable form.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to waterproofing, the new ability to control the
      properties of materials could be applied to a wide range of other
      coatings, said Mr Wong.<br>
      <br>
      "A lot of the functional coatings today are very weak, but we will
      be able to apply the same principles to make robust coatings that
      are, for example, anti-corrosive, self-cleaning or oil-repellent,"
      he said.<b><br>

            super glass</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A new transparent, bioinspired coating makes ordinary glass tough,
      self-cleaning and incredibly slippery. <br>
      <br>
      A new transparent, bioinspired coating makes ordinary glass tough,
      self-cleaning, and incredibly slippery, a team from the Wyss
      Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard
      University and Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences
      (SEAS) reported online in the July 31 edition of Nature
      Communications.<br>
      <br>
      The new coating could be used to create durable, scratch-resistant
      lenses for eyeglasses, self-cleaning windows, improved solar
      panels, and new medical diagnostic devices, said principal
      investigator Joanna Aizenberg, Ph.D., who is a Core Faculty Member
      at the Wyss Institute, Amy Smith Berylson Professor of Materials
      Science at SEAS, and a Professor of Chemistry and Chemical
      Biology.<br>
      <br>
      The new coating builds on an award-winning technology that
      Aizenberg and her team pioneered called Slippery Liquid-Infused
      Porous Surfaces (SLIPS) -- the slipperiest synthetic surface
      known. The new coating is equally slippery, but much more durable
      and fully transparent. Together these advances solve longstanding
      challenges in creating commercially useful materials that repel
      almost everything.<br>
      <br>
      SLIPS was inspired by the slick strategy of the carnivorous
      pitcher plant, which lures insects onto the ultraslippery surface
      of its leaves, where they slide to their doom. Unlike earlier
      water-repelling materials, SLIPS repels oil and sticky liquids
      like honey, and it resists ice formation and bacterial biofilms as
      well.<br>
      <br>
      While SLIPS was an important advance, it was also "a proof of
      principle" -- the first step toward a commercially valuable
      technology, said lead author Nicolas Vogel, Ph.D., a postdoctoral
      fellow in applied physics at Harvard SEAS.<br>
      <br>
      "SLIPS repels both oily and aqueous liquids but it's expensive to
      make and not transparent," Vogel said.<br>
      <br>
      The original SLIPS materials also need to be fastened somehow to
      existing surfaces, which is often not easy.<br>
      <br>
      "It would be easier to take the existing surface and treat it in a
      certain way to make it slippery," Vogel explained.<br>
      <br>
      Vogel, Aizenberg, and their colleagues sought to develop a coating
      that accomplishes this and works as SLIPS does. SLIPS's thin layer
      of liquid lubricant allows liquids to flow easily over the
      surface, much as a thin layer of water in an ice rink helps an ice
      skater glide.<br>
      <br>
      To create a SLIPS-like coating, the researchers corral a
      collection of tiny spherical particles of polystyrene, the main
      ingredient of Styrofoam, on a flat glass surface, like a
      collection of Ping-Pong balls. They pour liquid glass on them
      until the balls are more than half buried in glass. After the
      glass solidifies, they burn away the beads, leaving a network of
      craters that resembles a honeycomb. They then coat that honeycomb
      with the same liquid lubricant used in SLIPS to create a tough but
      slippery coating.<br>
      <br>
      "The honeycomb structure is what confers the mechanical stability
      to the new coating," said Aizenberg.<br>
      <br>
      By adjusting the width of the honeycomb cells to make them much
      smaller in diameter than the wavelength of visible light, the
      researchers kept the coating from reflecting light. This made a
      glass slide with the coating completely transparent.<br>
      <br>
      These coated glass slides repelled a variety of liquids, just as
      SLIPS does, including water, octane, wine, olive oil, and ketchup.
      And, like SLIPS, the coating reduced the adhesion of ice to a
      glass slide by 99 percent. Keeping materials frost-free is
      important because adhered ice can take down power lines, decrease
      the energy efficiency of cooling systems, delay airplanes, and
      lead buildings to collapse.<br>
      <br>
      Importantly, the honeycomb structure of the SLIPS coating on the
      glass slides confers unmatched mechanical robustness. It withstood
      damage and remained slippery after various treatments that can
      scratch and compromise ordinary glass surfaces and other popular
      liquid-repellent materials, including touching, peeling off a
      piece of tape, and wiping with a tissue.<br>
      <br>
      "We set ourselves a challenging goal: to design a versatile
      coating that's as good as SLIPS but much easier to apply,
      transparent, and much tougher -- and that is what we managed,"
      Aizenberg said.<br>
      <br>
      The team is now honing its method to better coat curved pieces of
      glass as well as clear plastics such as Plexiglas, and to adapt
      the method for the rigors of manufacturing.<br>
      <br>
      "Joanna's new SLIPS coating reveals the power of following
      Nature's lead in developing new technologies," said Don Ingber,
      M.D., Ph.D., the Wyss Institute's Founding Director. "We are
      excited about the range of applications that could use this
      innovative coating." Ingber is also the Judah Folkman Professor of
      Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's
      Hospital, and Professor of Bioengineering at Harvard SEAS...<br>

      After a rain, the cupped leaf of a pitcher plant becomes a
      virtually frictionless surface. Sweet-smelling and elegant, the
      carnivore attracts ants, spiders, and even little frogs. One by
      one, they slide to their doom.<br>
      <br>
      Adopting the plant's slick strategy, a group of applied scientists
      at Harvard have created a material that repels just about any type
      of liquid, including blood and oil, and does so even under harsh
      conditions like high pressure and freezing temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      The bio-inspired liquid repellence technology, described in the
      September 22 issue of Nature, should find applications in
      biomedical fluid handling, fuel transport, and anti-fouling and
      anti-icing technologies. It could even lead to self-cleaning
      windows and improved optical devices.<br>
      <br>
      "Inspired by the pitcher plant, we developed a new coating that
      outperforms its natural and synthetic counterparts and provides a
      simple and versatile solution for liquid and solid repellency,"
      says lead author Joanna Aizenberg, Amy Smith Berylson Professor of
      Materials Science at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied
      Sciences (SEAS), Director of the Kavli Institute for Bionano
      Science and Technology at Harvard, and a Core Faculty member at
      the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at
      Harvard.<br>
      <br>
      By contrast, current state-of-the-art liquid repellent surfaces
      have taken cues from a different member of the plant world. The
      leaves of the lotus resist water due to the tiny microtextures on
      the surface; droplets balance on the cushion of air on the tips of
      the surface and bead up.<br>
      <br>
      The so-called lotus effect, however, does not work well for
      organic or complex liquids. Moreover, if the surface is damaged
      (e.g., scratched) or subject to extreme conditions, liquid drops
      tend to stick to or sink into the textures rather than roll away.
      Finally, it has proven costly and difficult to manufacture
      surfaces based on the lotus strategy.<br>
      <br>
      The pitcher plant takes a fundamentally different approach.
      Instead of using burr-like, air-filled nanostructures to repel
      water, the plant locks in a water layer, creating a slick coating
      on the top. In short, the fluid itself becomes the repellent
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      "The effect is similar to when a car hydroplanes, the tires
      literally gliding on the water rather than the road," says lead
      author Tak-Sing Wong, a postdoctoral fellow in the Aizenberg lab.
      "In the case of the unlucky ants, the oil on the bottom of their
      feet will not stick to the slippery coating on the plant. It's
      like oil floating on the surface of a puddle."<br>
      <br>
      Inspired by the pitcher plant's elegant solution, the scientists
      designed a strategy for creating slippery surfaces by infusing a
      nano/microstructured porous material with a lubricating fluid.
      They are calling the resulting bio-inspired surfaces "SLIPS"
      (Slippery Liquid-Infused Porous Surfaces).<br>
      <br>
      "Like the pitcher plant, SLIPS are slippery for insects, but they
      are now designed to do much more: they repel a wide variety of
      liquids and solids," says Aizenberg. SLIPS show virtually no
      retention, as very little tilt is needed to coax the liquid or
      solid into sliding down and off the surface.<br>
      <br>
      "The repellent fluid surface offers additional benefits, as it is
      intrinsically smooth and free of defects," says Wong. "Even after
      we damage a sample by scraping it with a knife or blade, the
      surface repairs itself almost instantaneously and the repellent
      qualities remain, making SLIPS self-healing." Unlike the lotus,
      the SLIPS can be made optically transparent, and therefore ideal
      for optical applications and self-cleaning, clear surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the near frictionless effect persists under extreme
      conditions: high pressures (as much as 675 atmospheres, equivalent
      to seven kilometers under the sea) and humidity, and in colder
      temperatures. The team conducted studies outside after a
      snowstorm; SLIPS withstood the freezing temperatures and even
      repelled ice.<br>
      <br>
      "Not only is our bio-inspired surface able to work in a variety of
      conditions, but it is also simple and cheap to manufacture," says
      co-author Sung Hoon Kang, a Ph.D. candidate in the Aizenberg lab.
      "It is easily scalable because you can choose just about any
      porous material and a variety of liquids."<br>
      <br>
      To see if the surface was truly up to nature's high standards,
      they even did a few experiments with ants. In tests, the insects
      slid off the artificial surface or retreated to safer ground after
      only a few timorous steps.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers anticipate that the pitcher plant-inspired
      technology, for which they are seeking a patent, could one day be
      used for fuel- and water-transport pipes, and medical tubing (such
      as catheters and blood transfusion systems), which are sensitive
      to drag and pressure and are compromised by unwanted
      liquid-surface interactions. Other potential applications include
      self-cleaning windows and surfaces that resist bacteria and other
      types of fouling (such as the buildup that forms on ship hulls).
      The advance may also find applications in ice-resistant materials
      and may lead to anti-sticking surfaces that repel fingerprints or
      graffiti.<br>
      <br>
      "The versatility of SLIPS, their robustness and unique ability to
      self-heal makes it possible to design these surfaces for use
      almost anywhere, even under extreme temperature and pressure
      conditions," says Aizenberg. "It potentially opens up applications
      in harsh environments, such as polar or deep sea exploration,
      where no satisfactory solutions exist at present. Everything
      SLIPS!"<br>

      Creating a robust synthetic surface that repels various liquids
      would have broad technological implications for areas ranging from
      biomedical devices and fuel transport to architecture but has
      proved extremely challenging1. Inspirations from natural
      nonwetting structures2, 3, 4, 5, 6, particularly the leaves of the
      lotus, have led to the development of liquid-repellent
      microtextured surfaces that rely on the formation of a stable
      air–liquid interface7, 8, 9. Despite over a decade of intense
      research, these surfaces are, however, still plagued with problems
      that restrict their practical applications: limited oleophobicity
      with high contact angle hysteresis9, failure under pressure10, 11,
      12 and upon physical damage1, 7, 11, inability to self-heal and
      high production cost1, 11. To address these challenges, here we
      report a strategy to create self-healing, slippery liquid-infused
      porous surface(s) (SLIPS) with exceptional liquid- and
      ice-repellency, pressure stability and enhanced optical
      transparency. Our approach—inspired by Nepenthes pitcher
      plants13—is conceptually different from the lotus effect, because
      we use nano/microstructured substrates to lock in place the
      infused lubricating fluid. We define the requirements for which
      the lubricant forms a stable, defect-free and inert ‘slippery’
      interface. This surface outperforms its natural counterparts2, 3,
      4, 5, 6 and state-of-the-art synthetic liquid-repellent surfaces8,
      9, 14, 15, 16 in its capability to repel various simple and
      complex liquids (water, hydrocarbons, crude oil and blood),
      maintain low contact angle hysteresis (&lt;2.5°), quickly restore
      liquid-repellency after physical damage (within 0.1–1 s), resist
      ice adhesion, and function at high pressures (up to about
      680 atm). We show that these properties are insensitive to the
      precise geometry of the underlying substrate, making our approach
      applicable to various inexpensive, low-surface-energy structured
      materials (such as porous Teflon membrane). We envision that these
      slippery surfaces will be useful in fluid handling and
      transportation, optical sensing, medicine, and as self-cleaning
      and anti-fouling materials operating in extreme environments.<br>

      The present disclosure describes a strategy to create
      self-healing, slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPS).
      Roughened (e.g., porous) surfaces can be utilized to lock in place
      a lubricating fluid, referred to herein as Liquid B to repel a
      wide range of materials, referred to herein as Object A (Solid A
      or Liquid A). SLIPS outperforms other conventional surfaces in its
      capability to repel various simple and complex liquids (water,
      hydrocarbons, crude oil and blood), maintain low-contact-angle
      hysteresis (&lt;2.5 DEG ), quickly restore liquid-repellency after
      physical damage (within 0.1-1 s), resist ice, microorganisms and
      insects adhesion, and function at high pressures (up to at least
      690 atm). Some exemplary application where SLIPS will be useful
      include energy-efficient fluid handling and transportation,
      optical sensing, medicine, and as self-cleaning, and anti-fouling
      materials operating in extreme environments.<br>

            material with exceptional negative compressibility</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Our intuition tells us that a sample of material compressed
      uniformly from all sides should reduce its dimensions. Only a few
      materials subjected to hydrostatic compression exhibit the
      opposite behavior, expanding slightly in one or two directions. A
      new material has now been discovered with exceptionally high
      negative compressibility and a previously unknown mechanism
      responsible for it. <br>

      Our intuition tells us that a sample of material compressed
      uniformly from all sides should reduce its dimensions. Only a few
      materials subjected to hydrostatic compression exhibit the
      opposite behaviour, expanding slightly in one or two directions.
      At the Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Polish Academy of
      Sciences a material has been discovered with exceptionally high
      negative compressibility and a previously unknown mechanism
      responsible for it.<br>
      <br>
      When you squeeze something, you usually expect it to shrink,
      particularly when the pressure exerted acts uniformly from all
      sides. However, there are materials which when subjected to
      hydrostatic pressure elongate slightly in one or two directions.
      During the search for optimal compounds for hydrogen storage at
      the Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Polish Academy of
      Sciences (IPC PAS) in Warsaw an accidental, albeit very
      interesting, discovery has been made: while the pressure was being
      increased one of the tested materials suddenly elongated
      significantly.<br>
      <br>
      "Usually the increase in dimensions observed in materials with
      negative compressibility subjected to high hydrostatic pressure is
      small. We are talking here about values of the order of a single
      percentage point or even less. We have found a material of very
      high negative compressibility, of up to 10% in one direction.
      Interestingly, the elongation occurred abruptly at a pressure of
      approx. 30 thousand atmospheres," says Dr. Taras Palasyuk (IPC
      PAS).<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Palasyuk is conducting research on materials subjected to
      hydrostatic pressures of one to several million atmospheres (the
      prefix hydro- means that the pressure acts on the material from
      all sides). Such high pressures are produced in the laboratory
      using diamond anvils, between which a micrometre-sized sample is
      placed. The sample is in a seal ensuring that the exerted pressure
      acts on the test material uniformly from all directions. To lead
      to an increase in pressure, the anvils are compressed by means of
      a screw. A ruby crystal placed next to the sample acts as a
      pressure gauge. It changes its mode of fluorescence depending on
      the pressure exerted upon it.<br>
      <br>
      The volume of the material samples exposed to increasing pressure
      decreases, which is associated with a reduction of usually all
      spatial dimensions. However, there are also atypical crystalline
      materials whose volume decreases during compression (because
      according to thermodynamics it must) whilst at the same time the
      crystal elongates in one or two directions. The mechanism
      responsible for this elongation has always been of a geometric
      nature: under pressure individual elements of the crystal
      structure simply moved relative to each other to varying degrees
      in different directions.<br>
      <br>
      "In our laboratory using laser light we analyzed how the manners
      of vibration of molecules in the crystal changed with increasing
      pressure and on this basis we drew conclusions about the structure
      of the material. We quickly discovered that in the crystal we were
      examining, which was sodium amidoborane, the elongation could not
      be explained by changes in geometry alone," says PhD student
      Ewelina Magos-Palasyuk, the lead author of the publication in the
      journal Scientific Reports.<br>
      <br>
      Sodium amidoborane is a relatively readily available compound with
      the chemical formula Na(NH2BH3) forming transparent crystals with
      an orthorhombic structure. The results of research on crystals of
      this compound obtained at the IPC PAS using Raman spectroscopy
      were confronted with theoretical model predictions. It turned out
      that the negative compressibility of sodium amidoborane crystals
      has to be a consequence of the elongation of the chemical bonds
      between nitrogen and hydrogen and boron and nitrogen, caused by
      the abrupt formation of new hydrogen bonds between adjacent
      molecules in the crystal.<br>
      <br>
      "Sodium amidoborane is thus the first material known to us where
      the negative compressibility is primarily of a chemical nature,"
      says Dr. Taras Palasyuk and stresses that in contrast to other
      materials, in which the which the symmetry of the crystal
      structure changes under high pressure, in sodium amidoborane there
      are no drastic changes. He adds: "Our preliminary results,
      obtained by X-ray diffraction at the National Synchrotron
      Radiation Research Center in Taiwan, also confirm that the
      material retains its original symmetry. It is precisely because it
      does not have to rebuild that the increase in the linear
      dimensions occurs here in such an abrupt manner."<br>
      <br>
      The discovery of a previously unknown mechanism responsible for
      negative compressibility opens up interesting avenues in the
      search for new materials with similarly exotic physical
      properties. However, the first applications can already be thought
      of right now. The significant, abrupt and reversible increase in
      length of the sodium amidoborane crystals at a clearly defined
      value of pressure makes the material an interesting candidate for
      e.g. components of detectors of a certain threshold pressure of
      approx. 30 thousand atmospheres (in industry pressures as high as
      up to 300 thousand atmospheres are used). Another potential
      application of sodium amidoborane could be active bulletproof
      vests, which would behave like airbags in a car under the
      influence of the sharp increase in pressure caused by the missile
      strike.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Over the past few years we have been witnessing a surge of
      scientific interest to materials exhibiting a rare mechanical
      effect such as negative linear compressibility (NLC). Here we
      report on strong NLC found in an ionic molecular crystal of sodium
      amidoborane (NaAB) – easily-accessible, optically transparent
      material. In situ Raman measurements revealed abnormal elongation
      of B-N and N-H bonds of NaAB at pressure about 3 GPa. Ab initio
      calculations indicate the observed spectroscopic changes are due
      to an isostructural phase transition accompanied by a stepwise
      expansion of the crystal along c axis. Analysis of calculated
      charge density distribution and geometry of molecular species
      (NH2BH3) univocally points to a chemically driven mechanism of NLC
      – pressure-induced formation of hydrogen bonds. The new H-bond
      acts as a “pivot screw” coupling N-H covalent bonds of neighbor
      molecular species – a system resembling a two-lever “jack device”
      on a molecular scale. A mechanism based on formation of new bonds
      stands in apparent contrast to mechanisms so far reported in
      majority of NLC materials where no significant alteration of
      chemical bonding was observed. The finding therefore suggests a
      qualitatively new direction in exploration the field towards
      rational design of incompressible materials…<br>

      <br>
      Nanoparticles containing bee venom toxin melittin can destroy
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) while at the same time leaving
      surrounding cells unharmed, scientists from Washington University
      School of Medicine reported in the March 2013 issue of Antiviral
      Therapy.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers said that their finding is a major step toward
      creating a vaginal gel that can prevent HIV spread. HIV is the
      virus that causes AIDS.<br>
      <br>
      Melittin destroys some viruses and malignant tumor cells Melittin
      is a powerful toxin found in bee venom. It can poke holes in the
      protective viral envelope that surrounds the human
      immunodeficiency virus, as well as other viruses. Free melittin in
      large-enough quantities can cause considerable damage.<br>
      <br>
      Senior author, Samuel A. Wickline, MD, the J. Russell Hornsby
      Professor of Biomedical Sciences, has demonstrated that
      nanoparticles loaded with melittin have anti-cancer properties and
      have the capacity to kill tumor cells. Linking bee venom with
      anticancer therapies is not new, in 2004 Croatian scientists
      reported in the Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture
      that honey-bee products, including venom, could well have
      applications in cancer treatment and prevention.<br>
      <br>
      Normal cells remain intact - the scientists showed that
      nanoparticles loaded with melittin do not harm normal, healthy
      cells. Protective bumpers were added to the nanoparticles surface,
      so that when they come into contact with normal cells (which tend
      to be much larger), the nanoparticles bounce off rather than
      attach themselves.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists have discovered a powerful toxin in bee venom that
      could end up playing a crucial role in preventing the spread of
      HIV.<br>
      <br>
      HIV is much smaller than the nanoparticles and fits in between the
      bumpers. When HIV comes across a nanoparticle it goes in between
      the bumpers and comes into direct contact with its surface, which
      is coated with the bee toxin, which destroys it.<br>
      Hood explained "Melittin on the nanoparticles fuses with the viral
      envelope. The melittin forms little pore-like attack complexes and
      ruptures the envelope, stripping it off the virus."<br>
      <br>
      While most anti-HIV medications work on inhibiting the virus'
      ability to replicate, this one attacks a vital part of its
      structure. The problem with attacking a pathogen's ability to
      replicate is that it does not stop it from starting an infection.
      Some HIV strains have found ways to circumvent
      replication-inhibiting drugs, and reproduce regardless.<br>
      <br>
      Hood said: "We are attacking an inherent physical property of HIV.
      Theoretically, there isn't any way for the virus to adapt to that.
      The virus has to have a protective coat, a double-layered membrane
      that covers the virus."<br>

      in a dose-dependent manner in vitro as shown by MTT assay, flow
      cytometry and laser scanning confocal microscopy. Administration
      of matrine inhibited the growth of primary tumors and their
      metastases to lungs and livers, in a dose-dependent manner, in a
      highly metastatic model of 4T1 breast cancer established in
      syngeneic Balb/c mice. Tumors from matrine-treated mice had a
      smaller proliferation index, shown by immunostaining with an
      anti-Ki-67 antibody, a greater apoptosis index, shown by
      TUNEL-staining, and a less microvessel density, shown by
      immunostaining with an anti-CD31 A antibody, compared to the
      controls. Western blot analysis of tumoral homogenates indicated
      that matrine therapy reduced the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, downregulated
      the expressions of VEGF and VEGFR-2, and increased the activation
      of caspase-3 and caspase-9. This study suggests matrine may be a
      potent agent, from a natural resource, for treating metastatic
      breast cancer because of its anti-apoptotic, anti-proliferative
      and anti-angiogenic activities.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Matrine, an alkaloid extracted from a Chinese herb, Sophora
      flavescens AIT., has exhibited anti-proliferative and
      pro-apoptotic abilities against various types of cancer cells.
      This study aims to investigate its anti-cancer activity and
      underlying mechanisms in human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro
      and in vivo. Human BxPC-3 and PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells, and
      human HL-7702 liver cells were incubated with matrine at different
      concentrations. Cell viability was assessed by
      3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
      assay, and cell apoptosis, by flow cytometry. Subcutaneous BxPC-3
      xenograft tumors were established in nude BALB/c mice, and matrine
      was intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered. The tumors were
      monitored and harvested. Tumor sections were immunostained with an
      anti-Ki-67 antibody (Ab) to examine cell proliferation, or stained
      with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated deoxyuridine
      triphosphate (dUTP) nick-end labeling (TUNEL) to evaluate in situ
      cell apoptosis. The expression of proliferating cell nuclear
      antigen (PCNA) and several apoptosis-related proteins in cells and
      tumor tissues were evaluated by Western blot analysis. In in vitro
      assays, matrine inhibited cell viability by downregulating the
      expression of PCNA, and induced cell apoptosis by reducing the
      ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, upregulating Fas, and increasing activation of
      caspases-8,-3 and -9, in a dose-dependent manner. Administration
      of matrine inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner, and
      regulated tumoral gene expression consistent with the in vitro
      results. But matrine had no significant effects on the viability
      of HL-7702 cells or the bodyweight of mice compared to controls.
      These results indicate matrine may be a potential and promising
      agent of natural resource to treat pancreatic cancer.<br>

      Purpose: The aim of the present study was to investigate the
      effects of matrine on proliferation and apoptosis in human breast
      cancer MCF-7 cells and its relevant molecular mechanisms. Methods:
      Breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 was cultured with series
      concentrations of Matrine in vitro. The proliferation and
      apoptosis of MCF-7 cells were investigated by 3-(4,
      5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
      assay, flow cytometry, and Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)
      measurements. The expression levels of Bax and Bcl-2 proteins were
      detected by Annexin V/propidium iodide coupled staining. The
      morphological changes of MCF-7 cell were examined. Results: The
      inhibition rates of MCF-7 cells were 6.01%-37.01%, 7.56%-53.92%,
      and 10.86%-70.23% for 24, 48, and 72 hours after Matrine
      treatment, respectively. The proliferation of MCF-7 cells was
      significantly inhibited by Matrine administration, with a time and
      dose dependent manner. The rates apoptotic cells was between
      4.17±0.25% and 19.63±0.17% in 0.25-2.0 mg/ml Matrine groups, which
      had significant increased compare with the control groups
      (1.10±0.08%, P&lt;0.05). Meanwhile, increased Bax expression, but
      decreased Bcl-2 expression was observed in MCF-7 cell line. MMP
      were significantly decreased by Matrine treatment. Conclusions:
      Matrine significantly inhibited the growth and induced apoptosis
      in breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells, which is related to Bax, Bcl-2

      Matrine is an alkaloid found in plants from the Sophora genus. It
      has a variety of pharmacological effects, including anti-cancer
      effects,[1] as well as κ-opioid and μ-opioid receptor
      agonism.[2][3]<br>
      <br>
      Matrine possesses strong antitumor activities in vitro and in
      vivo. Inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis
      are the likely mechanisms responsible for matrine's antitumor
      activities.[4] Matrine is a component of the traditional Chinese
      medical herb Sophora flavescens Ait.<br>
      <br>
      Mu opioid agonism is associated with euphoria, while kappa opioid
      agonism is associated with dysphoria and psychotomimetic
      hallucinations (as seen in the kappa-agonist Salvinorin A). Both
      receptors are known to produce analgesia when activated.<br>
      <br>
      Matrine and the related compound oxymatrine have an antifeedant
      effect against formosan subterranean termite.[5]<br>

      Scientists Anthony Samsel and Stephanie Seneff have just gotten
      the fifth peer reviewed paper on Glyphosate published. Its named
      "Glyphosate pathways to modern diseases V: Amino acid analogue of
      glycine in diverse proteins".<br>
      <br>
      In this regard Tony Mitra interviewed Anthony Samsel, to cover the
      newly emerging scientific findings on Glyphosate and how it can
      and does hurt creatures including humans.<br>
      <br>
      In the course of the interview, Anthony Samsel mentioned the
      issues being covered in their next paper, the 6th one. This covers
      a number of vaccines that use animal byproducts such as egg
      protein and gelatine. He suspected these products might be
      contaminated with Glyphosate, if the vaccine makers were using
      factory farmed animals fed with Glyphosate laced GMO feed.<br>
      <br>
      To verify, he got a large number of vaccines that do use egg
      proteins and gelatine and got them analyzed in multiple labs. The
      results confirmed his doubt. The vaccines themselves are largely
      contaminated with Glyphosate and pose serious hazard to those that
      are and will be vaccinated using these products.<br>

      to obtain peace of mind. It is believed that quantum entanglement
      from this physical world can carry information which might be
      vulnerable to a human's quantum mind especially when one is
      performing meditation, exercising Qi-Gong, taking rest or
      relaxation, or at sleep. Protection is thus needed to protect a
      quantum mind during these mentally weakened situations.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      One challenge facing people living without access to electricity
      is access to refrigeration for perishable food. The Evaptainer
      promises to help fix that.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <a href="http://www.evaptainers.com/" "><b>http://www.evaptainers.com/</b></a><b><br>

      <div align="center"><b>Electricity free mobile refrigeration
          technology to keep food fresher, longer using only sun and
          water</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Evaptainers solves a huge problem in the food production
      infrastructure of developing markets by intersecting modern
      design, materials, and production with time tested evaporative
      cooling technology creating a effective, scalable, electricity
      free, mobile refrigeration solution.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Science</b><br>
      <br>
      Evaptainers harness the power of evaporative cooling to keep food
      fresh.<br>
      <br>
      Evaporative cooling is something you have experienced: when you
      get out of the water after swimming, a wind blows and suddenly you
      feel a bit chilled; that is evaporative cooling in action.<br>
      <br>
      So how do you use evaporative cooling to make an evaporative
      cooler? <br>
      <br>
      <b>Company</b><br>
      <br>
      Evaptainers started at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in a
      class that challenged its students to create something that would
      help improve the lives of 1 billion people.<br>
      <br>
      Since then we have developed a Mission and a Team to deliver on
      this challenge by creating modular and completely mobile
      refrigeration units that preserve produce along the supply chain.
      They utilize the phenomenon of evaporative cooling, rather than
      more energy-intensive vapor compression refrigeration, allowing
      for low-cost, electricity-free cooling. Rudimentary Evaporative
      cooling devices has proven to be effective for agricultural use,
      tripling or quadrupling the shelf-life of most produce. Our
      company has taken these inventions and upgraded them for modern
      and commercial use. Using state-of-the art materials and improved
      design, we’ve created more effective, more durable, easier to use,
      mass-producible units. Our discoveries are patent pending and
      there are currently no other devices similar to ours in the
      market.<br>

      <div align="center"><i>Inspired by nature to work with nature, the
          technology behind Sure Chill makes the impossible, possible</i><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>A cool problem</b><br>
      <br>
      From refrigerators that chill cans of cola in a hot Manhattan
      summer to those that store medicines and support blood banks in
      remote medical centres, refrigeration systems are essential to
      every part of people’s lives. But they’re inefficient. They need
      to have constant connection to power and, even in the best
      conditions, do not control temperature well.<br>
      <br>
      But more than that, conventional coolers are in a constant battle
      with nature. While the sun heats the world vast amounts of energy
      are used to cool things down again. There is a need for a
      sustainable cooling solution that works. And keeps on working.<br>
      <br>
      <b>A simple idea</b><br>
      <br>
      We started with water. It’s all around us but it’s also
      incredible. It has an amazing property that’s unique in the
      universe. At four degrees, water is at its heaviest. At four
      degrees it sinks. At any other temperature it rises. This
      scientific fact inspired us to create a new kind of refrigeration
      system. A seemingly intelligent system that adapts its temperature
      naturally so it automatically cools to the optimum temperature: a
      constant four degrees even without power.<br>
      <br>
      A<b>n ingenious solution</b><br>
      <br>
      Sure Chill is a brand new kind of cooling system. It doesn’t need
      a constant power source. In an on-grid situation with intermittent
      power, it works perfectly well. In an off-grid situation, where a
      solar panel may be used, a Sure Chill powered refrigerator doesn’t
      even need a rechargeable battery. It shouldn’t work but it does.
      And it works beautifully.<br>
      <br>
      Water surrounds a Sure Chill refrigeration compartment. When it
      has power, the water cools and forms ice above the compartment
      leaving only water at four degrees cooling the contents. When the
      power is switched off, the water warms and rises while the ice
      begins to melt, keeping only four-degree water cooling the
      contents of the compartment. So it has its own internal and
      entirely natural energy store that maintains a completely steady
      temperature. The system can operate like this, without power, for
      days and weeks.<br>
      <br>
      <b>A better future</b><br>
      <br>
      Sure Chill is a cooling system that’s life-changing. And
      life-saving. Because the system is based on a law of nature,
      appliances using it are reliable and robust even in the harshest
      environments. Because a Sure Chill refrigerator is designed to
      work without power for many days, it can help get life-saving
      medicines to remote communities. And because it’s Smart Grid
      ready, in places with advanced power networks it can be powered
      whenever energy is cheapest, saving money for consumers and energy
      companies as well as saving resources for the planet.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      Stanford engineers have developed a low-cost, plastic-based
      textile that, if woven into clothing, could cool your body far
      more efficiently than is possible with the natural or synthetic
      fabrics in clothes we wear today.<br>
      <br>
      Describing their work in Science, the researchers suggest that
      this new family of fabrics could become the basis for garments
      that keep people cool in hot climates without air conditioning.<br>
      <br>
      "If you can cool the person rather than the building where they
      work or live, that will save energy," said Yi Cui, an associate
      professor of materials science and engineering and of photon
      science at Stanford.<br>
      <br>
      This new material works by allowing the body to discharge heat in
      two ways that would make the wearer feel nearly 4 degrees
      Fahrenheit cooler than if they wore cotton clothing. <br>
      <br>
      The material cools by letting perspiration evaporate through the
      material, something ordinary fabrics already do. But the Stanford
      material provides a second, revolutionary cooling mechanism:
      allowing heat that the body emits as infrared radiation to pass
      through the plastic textile.<br>
      <br>
      All objects, including our bodies, throw off heat in the form of
      infrared radiation, an invisible and benign wavelength of light.
      Blankets warm us by trapping infrared heat emissions close to the
      body. This thermal radiation escaping from our bodies is what
      makes us visible in the dark through night-vision goggles.<br>
      <br>
      "Forty to 60 percent of our body heat is dissipated as infrared
      radiation when we are sitting in an office," said Shanhui Fan, a
      professor of electrical engineering who specializes in photonics,
      which is the study of visible and invisible light. "But until now
      there has been little or no research on designing the thermal
      radiation characteristics of textiles."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Super-powered kitchen wrap</b><br>
      <br>
      To develop their cooling textile, the Stanford researchers blended
      nanotechnology, photonics and chemistry to give polyethylene --
      the clear, clingy plastic we use as kitchen wrap -- a number of
      characteristics desirable in clothing material: It allows thermal
      radiation, air and water vapor to pass right through, and it is
      opaque to visible light.<br>
      <br>
      The easiest attribute was allowing infrared radiation to pass
      through the material, because this is a characteristic of ordinary
      polyethylene food wrap. Of course, kitchen plastic is impervious
      to water and is see-through as well, rendering it useless as
      clothing.<br>
      <br>
      The Stanford researchers tackled these deficiencies one at a time.<br>
      <br>
      First, they found a variant of polyethylene commonly used in
      battery making that has a specific nanostructure that is opaque to
      visible light yet is transparent to infrared radiation, which
      could let body heat escape. This provided a base material that was
      opaque to visible light for the sake of modesty but thermally
      transparent for purposes of energy efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      They then modified the industrial polyethylene by treating it with
      benign chemicals to enable water vapor molecules to evaporate
      through nanopores in the plastic, said postdoctoral scholar and
      team member Po-Chun Hsu, allowing the plastic to breathe like a
      natural fiber.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Making clothes</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      That success gave the researchers a single-sheet material that met
      their three basic criteria for a cooling fabric. To make this thin
      material more fabric-like, they created a three-ply version: two
      sheets of treated polyethylene separated by a cotton mesh for
      strength and thickness.<br>
      <br>
      To test the cooling potential of their three-ply construct versus
      a cotton fabric of comparable thickness, they placed a small
      swatch of each material on a surface that was as warm as bare skin
      and measured how much heat each material trapped.<br>
      <br>
      "Wearing anything traps some heat and makes the skin warmer," Fan
      said. "If dissipating thermal radiation were our only concern,
      then it would be best to wear nothing."<br>
      <br>
      The comparison showed that the cotton fabric made the skin surface
      3.6 F warmer than their cooling textile. The researchers said this
      difference means that a person dressed in their new material might
      feel less inclined to turn on a fan or air conditioner.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers are continuing their work on several fronts,
      including adding more colors, textures and cloth-like
      characteristics to their material. Adapting a material already
      mass produced for the battery industry could make it easier to
      create products.<br>
      <br>
      "If you want to make a textile, you have to be able to make huge
      volumes inexpensively," Cui said.<br>
      <br>
      Fan believes that this research opens up new avenues of inquiry to
      cool or heat things, passively, without the use of outside energy,
      by tuning materials to dissipate or trap infrared radiation.<br>
      <br>
      "In hindsight, some of what we've done looks very simple, but it's
      because few have really been looking at engineering the radiation
      characteristics of textiles," he said.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      When the microwave radiation destroys and deforms food molecules,
      new harmful compounds form (radiolytic compounds). These dangerous
      compounds harm the body in many ways.<br>
      <br>
      Microwaved meals change blood chemistry<br>
      <br>
      The research, from Search for Health (Spring, 1992): After study
      participants consumed microwaved vegetables, Swiss Scientist
      Hertel measured the following effects:<br>
      <br>
      Cholesterol levels increased rapidly.<br>
      <br>
      Hemoglobin decreased significantly (creating anemic tendencies.)<br>
      <br>
      Lymphocytes (white blood cells) showed a significant term
      decrease.<br>
      <br>
      Increased stress (evidence by the increase of leukocyte)<br>
      <br>
      NOTE: Leukocyte response can indicate pathogenic effects such as
      poisoning and cell damage.<br>
      <br>
      Microwaving human breast milk:<br>
      <br>
      The research, from Pediatrics (vol. 89, no. 4, April 1992) on
      microwaving human breast milk:<br>
      <br>
      Cuts down on lysozyme activity<br>
      <br>
      Reduces key antibodies<br>
      <br>
      Promotes potentially dangerous bacteria<br>
      <br>
      Milk heated to 72 degrees lost a full 96% of all immunoglobulin-A
      antibodies, which fight invading microbes.<br>
      <br>
      Researcher’s conclusion: microwaving likely reduces and reverses
      the potential benefits of food, above and beyond the harm heating
      itself causes.<br>
      <br>
      Another study of microwave problems reported in the journal The
      Lancet showed that when infant formula was microwaved for ten
      minutes, it altered the structure of its component amino acids,
      possibly resulting in functional, structural and immunological
      abnormalities.<br>

            re-grow bone with a single molecule</b></big><br>
        <br>
        <b>Lucy Ingham</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Re-growing damaged bone could become a standard practice in the
      future, thanks to a new technique involving nothing more than stem
      cells and a single molecule that naturally occurs in the human
      body.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists from the University of California San Diego have
      discovered that by feeding the molecule adenosine to human
      pluripotent stem cells, they could make them regenerate bone
      tissue.<br>
      <br>
      The research has already been successfully demonstrated in mice,
      and could in the future lead to a quick and affordable treatment
      for bone defects and injuries, a key aspect of the scientists’
      research.<br>
      <br>
      “One of the broader goals of our research is to make regenerative
      treatments more accessible and clinically relevant by developing
      easy, efficient and cost-effective ways to engineer human cells
      and tissues,” explained study lead author Shyni Varghese, a
      bioneering professor at UC San Diego.<br>
      <br>
      The research, which was published today in the journal Science
      Advances, is extremely significant for bioengineering because of
      how simply it achieves differentiation: the process where
      pluripotent stem cells transform into a cell specific a particular
      part of the body.<br>
      <br>
      Normally this is an immensely complicated process, often involving
      many steps and ingredients to produce the desired results. There
      is also a risk of teratomas; tumours that can develop when the
      tissue is transplanted.<br>
      <br>
      However all the scientist needed to do in this case was to add
      adenosine to the growth medium, causing the human pluripotent stem
      cells to develop into functional osteoblasts – the cells that
      build bone in the body. These osteoblasts were implanted into mice
      with bone defects, where they developed bone tissue with blood
      vessels, while showing no signs of teratomas.<br>
      <br>
      “It’s amazing that a single molecule can direct stem cell fate,”
      marvelled Verghese. “We don’t need to use a cocktail of small
      molecules, growth factors or other supplements to create a
      population of bone cells from human pluripotent stem cells like
      induced pluripotent stem cells.”<br>
      <br>
      While considerable work will need to be done to make the approach
      a viable treatment for humans, Verghese also wants to determine
      exactly how and why adenosine can make stem cells turn into
      bone-building tissue – an insight that may have wider implications
      for the differentiation of other cell types.<br>
      <br>
      So far the scientists have determined that adenosine signals the
      stem cells through a receptor on their surface known as the A2bR
      receptor, but more work needs to be done to get the full picture.

      Permanent brain damage from a stroke may be reversible thanks to a
      developing therapeutic technique, a USC-led study has found.<br>
      <br>
      The novel approach combines transplanted human stem cells with a
      special protein that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration already
      approved for clinical studies in new stroke patients.<br>
      <br>
      "This USC-led animal study could pave the way for a potential
      breakthrough in how we treat people who have experienced a
      stroke," said Jim Koenig, a program director at the National
      Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, which funded the
      research. "If the therapy works in humans, it could markedly
      accelerate the recovery of these patients."<br>
      <br>
      Berislav Zlokovic, senior author of the Aug. 22 Nature Medicine
      study, and his colleagues identified a protein that spurs neural
      stem cells to become functional neurons: 3K3A-APC, a variant of
      the human protein "activated protein C."<br>
      <br>
      The created compound is being tested as a neuroprotectant.

      clinical trial administer 3K3A-APC to patients who have very
      recently (within a few hours) suffered from an ischemic stroke,
      when a clot blocks blood from reaching the brain. About 87 percent
      of all strokes are ischemic, according to the Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention.<br>
      <br>
      However, Zlokovic, director of the Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute
      at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, said he and his colleagues
      are the first to use 3K3A-APC to produce neurons from human stem
      cells grafted into the stroke-damaged mouse brain.<br>
      <br>
      "We showed that 3K3A-APC helps the grafted stem cells convert into
      neurons and make structural and functional connections with the
      host's nervous system," said Zlokovic, a scientific founder of ZZ
      Biotech, a company devoted to developing therapeutics using
      variants of activated protein C. "No one in the stroke field has
      ever shown this, so I believe this is going to be the gold
      standard for future studies."<br>
      <br>
      Although other researchers have experimented with grafting stem
      cells into injured brain areas, they have met with limited
      success—partially because transplanted stem cells diminish with
      time. The therapeutic compound stops that from happening.<br>
      <br>
      Every year more than 795,000 people in the United States have a
      stroke, according to the CDC. These debilitating seizures reduce
      mobility in more than half of stroke survivors age 65 and older.<br>
      <br>
      More than 70 percent of stroke survivors live with substantial
      neurological symptoms such as muscle weakness or paralysis,
      according to Yaoming Wang, co-lead author of the study and a
      senior research associate at the Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute at
      the Keck School.<br>
      <br>
      "The need for an efficacious, practical and late treatment of
      stroke remains unmet," Wang said. "Regenerative medicine with stem
      cells holds great promise for the treatment of stroke."<br>
      <br>
      <b>How combination therapy works</b><br>
      <br>
      A week—the equivalent of several months in humans—after scientists
      induced a stroke in mice, the researchers placed human neural stem
      cells next to damaged brain tissue. Then they administered the
      immunosuppressant cyclosporine and four doses of 3K3A-APC or a
      placebo solution over a span of seven days.<br>
      <br>
      The transplanted stem cells matured into neurons and other brain
      cells. Mice treated with the special compound had 16 times more
      human stem cell-derived neurons than those who were treated with
      the placebo.<br>
      <br>
      "Functional deficit after five weeks of stroke were minimized, and
      the mice were almost back to normal in terms of motor and
      sensorimotor functions," Zlokovic said. "Synapses formed between
      transplanted cells and host cells, so there is functional
      activation and cooperation of transplanted cells in the host
      circuitry."<br>
      <br>
      To test whether the injected stem cells caused the observed motor
      and sensorimotor improvements, USC researchers used an assassin
      toxin to exterminate neurons that developed from human stem cells.
      They found that these mice lost improvements in motor or sensory
      tests, suggesting the neurons that grew from implanted stem cells
      were necessary for recovery from stroke-induced disability.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The motor and sensory tests</b><br>
      <br>
      Researchers tested motor functions by having mice walk forward on
      a rotating rod without falling off. They tested sensory and motor
      function by placing tape on the mouse's forepaw and observed how
      long it took the mice to remove the adhesive.<br>
      <br>
      Rodents given human stem cells and treated with 3K3A-APC performed
      much better on these performance tests, said Zhen Zhao, co-lead
      author and an assistant professor of research physiology and
      biophysics at the Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Functional integration</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To test the brain's circuitry after the stroke, researchers
      labeled stem cells with an indicator of neuronal activity and then
      stimulated the paws of the mice with a mechanical vibration. They
      noted the injured area in 3K3A-APC-treated mice was activated much
      more than in mice treated with the placebo. Moreover, the response
      time was much closer to that of uninjured mice.<br>
      <br>
      These results suggest that neurons which grew from the stem cells
      are functionally integrated into the host's brain circuitry.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The future of stem cell therapy</b><br>
      <br>
      In June, Stanford University researchers drilled a hole into the
      skulls of people whose motor and sensory abilities had been
      compromised because of stroke. Then they injected stem cells
      harvested from the bone marrow of adult donors. Although the study
      involved only 18 patients, researchers noted meaningful recovery,
      such as the ability to walk again. Stanford researchers said the
      stem cells seemed to trigger a biochemical process that enhanced
      the brain's ability to regenerate neurons. The transplanted stem
      cells themselves did not become neurons.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast, researchers in the USC-led study were able to
      stimulate transplanted stem cells to becoming neurons in a mouse
      study.<br>
      <br>
      Zlokovic and his team now hope to pursue a new Phase II clinical
      trial to test whether their combination therapy that stimulated
      the growth of neurons in mice can be replicated in human stroke
      patients. If the trial succeeds, they plan to extend the neural
      stem cell grafts and 3K3A-APC treatment to other neurological
      conditions, such as spinal cord injuries. <br>

      How do you boil water? Eschewing the traditional kettle and flame,
      MIT engineers have invented a bubble-wrapped, sponge-like device
      that soaks up natural sunlight and heats water to boiling
      temperatures, generating steam through its pores.<br>
      <br>
      The design, which the researchers call a "solar vapor generator,"
      requires no expensive mirrors or lenses to concentrate the
      sunlight, but instead relies on a combination of relatively
      low-tech materials to capture ambient sunlight and concentrate it
      as heat. The heat is then directed toward the pores of the sponge,
      which draw water up and release it as steam.<br>
      <br>
      From their experiments—including one in which they simply placed
      the solar sponge on the roof of MIT's Building 3—the researchers
      found the structure heated water to its boiling temperature of 100
      degrees Celsius, even on relatively cool, overcast days. The
      sponge also converted 20 percent of the incoming sunlight to
      steam.<br>
      <br>
      The low-tech design may provide inexpensive alternatives for
      applications ranging from desalination and residential water
      heating, to wastewater treatment and medical tool sterilization.<br>
      <br>
      The team has published its results today in the journal Nature
      Energy. The research was led by George Ni, an MIT graduate
      student; and Gang Chen, the Carl Richard Soderberg Professor in
      Power Engineering and the head of the Department of Mechanical
      Engineering; in collaboration with TieJun Zhang and his group
      members Hongxia Li and Weilin Yang from the Department of
      Mechanical and Materials Engineering at the Masdar Institute of
      Science and Technology, in the United Arab Emirates.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Building up the sun</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The researchers' current design builds on a solar-absorbing
      structure they developed in 2014—a similar floating, sponge-like
      material made of graphite and carbon foam, that was able to boil
      water to 100 C and convert 85 percent of the incoming sunlight to
      steam.<br>
      <br>
      To generate steam at such efficient levels, the researchers had to
      expose the structure to simulated sunlight that was 10 times the
      intensity of sunlight in normal, ambient conditions.<br>
      <br>
      "It was relatively low optical concentration," Chen says. "But I
      kept asking myself, 'Can we basically boil water on a rooftop, in
      normal conditions, without optically concentrating the sunlight?
      That was the basic premise."<br>
      <br>
      In ambient sunlight, the researchers found that, while the black
      graphite structure absorbed sunlight well, it also tended to
      radiate heat back out into the environment. To minimize the amount
      of heat lost, the team looked for materials that would better trap
      solar energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>A bubbly solution</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In their new design, the researchers settled on a
      spectrally-selective absorber—a thin, blue, metallic-like film
      that is commonly used in solar water heaters and possesses unique
      absorptive properties. The material absorbs radiation in the
      visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum, but it does not
      radiate in the infrared range, meaning that it both absorbs
      sunlight and traps heat, minimizing heat loss.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers obtained a thin sheet of copper, chosen for its
      heat-conducting abilities and coated with the spectrally-selective
      absorber. They then mounted the structure on a
      thermally-insulating piece of floating foam. However, they found
      that even though the structure did not radiate much heat back out
      to the environment, heat was still escaping through convection, in
      which moving air molecules such as wind would naturally cool the
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      A solution to this problem came from an unlikely source: Chen's
      16-year-old daughter, who at the time was working on a science
      fair project in which she constructed a makeshift greenhouse from
      simple materials, including bubble wrap.<br>
      <br>
      "She was able to heat it to 160 degrees Fahrenheit, in winter!"
      Chen says. "It was very effective."<br>
      <br>
      Chen proposed the packing material to Ni, as a cost-effective way
      to prevent heat loss by convection. This approach would let
      sunlight in through the material's transparent wrapping, while
      trapping air in its insulating bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      "I was very skeptical of the idea at first," Ni recalls. "I
      thought it was not a high-performance material. But we tried the
      clearer bubble wrap with bigger bubbles for more air trapping
      effect, and it turns out, it works. Now because of this bubble
      wrap, we don't need mirrors to concentrate the sun."<br>
      <br>
      The bubble wrap, combined with the selective absorber, kept heat
      from escaping the surface of the sponge. Once the heat was
      trapped, the copper layer conducted the heat toward a single hole,
      or channel, that the researchers had drilled through the
      structure. When they placed the sponge in water, they found that
      water crept up the channel, where it was heated to 100 C, then
      turned to steam.<br>
      <br>
      Chen and Ni say that solar absorbers based on this general design
      could be used as large sheets to desalinate small bodies of water,
      or to treat wastewater. Ni says other solar-based technologies
      that rely on optical-concentrating technologies typically are
      designed to last 10 to 20 years, though they require expensive
      parts and maintenance. This new, low-tech design, he says, could
      operate for one to two years before needing to be replaced.<br>
      <br>
      "Even so, the cost is pretty competitive," Ni says. "It's kind of
      a different approach, where before, people were doing high-tech
      and long-term [solar absorbers]. We're doing low-tech and
      short-term."<br>
      <br>
      "What fascinates us is the innovative idea behind this inexpensive
      device, where we have creatively designed this device based on
      basic understanding of capillarity and solar thermal radiation.
      Meanwhile, we are excited to continue probing the complicated
      physics of solar vapor generation and to discover new knowledge
      for the scientific community," Zhang says.<br>

            bio-superlens</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Scientists at the UK's Bangor and Oxford universities have
      achieved a world first: using spider-silk as a superlens to
      increase the microscope's potential.<br>
      <br>
      Extending the limit of classical microscope's resolution has been
      the 'El Dorado' or 'Holy Grail' of microscopy for over a century.
      Physical laws of light make it impossible to view objects smaller
      than 200 nm - the smallest size of bacteria, using a normal
      microscope alone. However, superlenses which enable us to see
      beyond the current magnification have been the goal since the turn
      of the millennium.<br>
      <br>
      Hot on the heels of a paper (Sci. Adv. 2 e1600901,2016) revealing
      that a team at Bangor University's School of Electronic
      Engineering has used a nanobead-derived superlens to break the
      perceived resolution barrier, the same team has achieved another
      world first.<br>
      <br>
      Now the team, led by Dr Zengbo Wang and in colloboration with
      Prof. Fritz Vollrath's silk group at Oxford University's
      Department of Zoology, has used a naturally occurring material -
      dragline silk of the golden web spider, as an additional
      superlens, applied to the surface of the material to be viewed, to
      provide an additional 2-3 times magnification.<br>
      <br>
      This is the first time that a naturally occurring biological
      material has been used as a superlens.<br>
      <br>
      In the paper in Nano Letters (DOI: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b02641,
      Aug 17 2016), the joint team reveals how they used a cylindrical
      piece of spider silk from the thumb sized Nephila spider as a
      lens.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Zengbo Wang said: "We have proved that the resolution barrier
      of microscope can be broken using a superlens, but production of
      manufactured superlenses invovles some complex engineering
      processes which are not widely accessible to other reserchers.
      This is why we have been interested in looking for a naturally
      occurring superlens provided by 'Mother Nature', which may exist
      around us, so that everyone can access superlenses."<br>
      <br>
      Prof Fritz Vollrath adds: "It is very exciting to find yet another
      cutting edge and totally novel use for a spider silk, which we
      have been studying for over two decades in my laboratory."<br>
      <br>
      These lenses could be used for seeing and viewing previously
      'invisible' structures, including engineered nano-structures and
      biological micro-structures as well as, potentially, native germs
      and viruses.<br>
      <br>
      The natural cylindrical structure at a micron- and submicron-scale
      make silks ideal candidates, in this case, the individual
      filaments had diameters of one tenth of a thin human hair.<br>
      <br>
      The spider filament enabled the group to view details on a
      micro-chip and a blue- ray disk which would be invisible using the
      unmodified optical microscope.<br>
      <br>
      In much the same was as when you look through a cylindrical glass
      or bottle, the clearest image only runs along the narrow strip
      directly opposite your line of vision, or resting on the surface
      being viewed, the single filament provides a one dimensional
      viewing image along its length.<br>
      <br>
      Wang explains: "The cylindrical silk lens has advantages in the
      larger field-of-view when compared to a microsphere superlens.
      Importantly for potential commercial applications, a spider silk
      nanoscope would be robust and economical, which in turn could
      provide excellent manufacturing platforms for a wide range of
      applications."<br>
      <br>
      James Monks, a co-author on the paper comments: "it has been an
      exciting time to be able to develop this project as part of my
      honours degree in electronic engineering at Bangor University and
      I am now very much looking forward to joining Dr Wang's team as a
      PhD student in nano-photonics."<br>

      It was recently discovered that transparent microspheres and
      cylinders can function as a super-resolution lens (i.e.,
      superlens) to focus light beyond the diffraction limit. A number
      of high-resolution applications based on these lenses have been
      successfully demonstrated and span nanoscopy, imaging, and
      spectroscopy. Fabrication of these superlenses, however, is often
      complex and requires sophisticated engineering processes. Clearly
      an easier model candidate, such as a naturally occurring
      superlens, is highly desirable. Here, we report for the first time
      a biological superlens provided by nature: the minor ampullate
      spider silk spun from the Nephila spider. This natural
      biosuperlens can distinctly resolve 100 nm features under a
      conventional white-light microscope with peak wavelength at 600
      nm, attaining a resolution of λ/6 that is well beyond the
      classical limit. Thus, our work opens a new door to develop
      biology-based optical systems that may provide a new solution to
      integrating optics in biological systems.<br>

      In 1972, animal behaviorist John Calhoun built a mouse paradise
      with beautiful buildings and limitless food. He introduced eight
      mice to the population. Two years later, the mice had created
      their own apocalypse. Here’s why.<br>
      <br>
      Universe 25 started out with eight mice, four males and four
      females. By day 560, the mouse population reached 2,200, and then
      steadily declined back down to unrecoverable extinction. At the
      peak population, most mice spent every living second in the
      company of hundreds of other mice. They gathered in the main
      squares, waiting to be fed and occasionally attacking each other.
      Few females carried pregnancies to term, and the ones that did
      seemed to simply forget about their babies. They’d move half their
      litter away from danger and forget the rest. Sometimes they’d drop
      and abandon a baby while they were carrying it.<br>
      <br>
      The few secluded spaces housed a population Calhoun called, “the
      beautiful ones.” Generally guarded by one male, the females—- and
      few males — inside the space didn’t breed or fight or do anything
      but eat and groom and sleep. When the population started declining
      the beautiful ones were spared from violence and death, but had
      completely lost touch with social behaviors, including having sex
      or caring for their young.<br>
      <br>
      In 1972, with the baby boomers coming of age in a
      ever-more-crowded world and reports of riots in the cities,
      Universe 25 looked like a Malthusian nightmare. It even acquired
      its own catchy name, “The Behavioral Sink.” If starvation didn’t
      kill everyone, people would destroy themselves. The best option
      was to flee to the country or the suburbs, where people had space
      and life was peaceful and natural.<br>
      <br>
      Today, the experiment remains frightening, but the nature of the
      fear has changed. A recent study pointed out that Universe 25 was
      not, if looked at as a whole, too overcrowded. Pens, or
      "apartments" at the very end of each hallway had only one entrance
      and exit, making them easy to guard. This allowed more aggressive
      territorial males to limit the number mice in that pen,
      overcrowding the rest of the world, while isolating the few
      "beautiful ones" who lived there from normal society. Instead of a
      population problem, one could argue that Universe 25 had a fair
      distribution problem.<br>
      <br>
      The fact remains that it had a problem, and one that eventually
      led to its destruction. If this behavior is shared by both mice
      and humans, can we escape Universe 25's fate?<br>

      A ‘miracle drug’ found in the soil at Easter Island is believed to
      have qualities that could one day help humans live longer – and it
      may already be working for dogs.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists from the University of Washington are testing the
      effects of a drug called rapamycin on dogs to see if it will slow
      down the aging process.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers were shocked by results of the initial trials, finding
      that some dogs showed improved heart functionality after just a
      few weeks.<br>
      <br>
      The study is led by biologist Matt Kaeberlein and his colleague,
      Daniel Promislow.<br>
      <br>
      According to Fusion, the researchers began clinical trials this
      year, expanding on earlier findings that rapamycin increases the
      lifespan of mice. <br>
      <br>
      Rapamycin is a bacterial by-product discovered in the shadows of
      the island's famous statues and is named after Rapa Nui, the
      Polynesian name for Easter Island.<br>
      <br>
      Dogs age very quickly compared to a human lifespan; most live
      between 10 and 13 years.<br>
      <br>
      This allows researchers to study the entire aging process in a
      short amount of time.<br>
      <br>
      The team recruited 40 dog-owners, who were each to give their pets
      three tablets of rapamycin a week, Fusion reports.<br>
      <br>
      Rapamycin is a bacterial by-product discovered in the shadows of
      the island's famous statues and is named after Rapa Nui, the
      Polynesian name for Easter Island, pictured above. It is already
      used in transplant patients to prevent organ rejection and
      scientists say it can improve learning and help treat cognitive
      decline<br>
      <br>
      After the researchers weeded out dogs with heart conditions and
      other medical factors, they were left with 24 middle-aged dogs,
      who would each receive low doses of the drug.<br>
      <br>
      This continued over the course of 10 weeks, and the researchers
      took echocardiograms throughout to determine any changes in the
      animal’s heart function.<br>
      <br>
      The team discovered that dogs receiving rapamycin showed improved
      heart functionality, or showed no change. <br>
      <br>
      And, those who had come in with worse conditions initially saw the
      most improvement, Fusion reports.<br>
      <br>
      Kaeberlein says the results are 'astonishing' and he was 'shocked'
      when he got the data. <br>
      <br>
      The team discovered that dogs receiving rapamycin showed improved
      heart functionality, or showed no change. And, those who had come
      in with worse conditions initially saw the most improvement.
      Moving forward, the researchers plan to conduct further tests with
      the drugs that will span multiple years<br>
      <br>
      Rapamycin is already used in transplant patients to prevent organ
      rejection and several years ago, and scientists in the journal
      Neuroscience said it can improve learning and help treat cognitive
      decline.<br>
      <br>
      In mice, it has been shown to extend the lives of mice by 13 per
      cent in females and nine per cent in males.<br>
      <br>
      Now, the researchers say it may help dogs live longer as well.<br>
      <br>
      ‘It is almost certain that rapamycin can slow the effects of aging
      in dogs and people,’ Kaeberlein told Fusion.<br>
      <br>
      ‘The only question is whether it can slow aging with doses that
      don’t have significant side effects.’<br>
      <br>
      Moving forward, the researchers plan to conduct further tests with
      the drugs that will span multiple years – and they hope it will be
      approved for humans in the next decade.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Researchers Reveal How Specific
            Wavelengths of Light Can Heal, Kill Bacteria</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) causes progressive paralysis by destroying
      nerve cells and the spinal cord. It interrupts vision, balance and
      even thinking. On a suggestion from a colleague, Jeri-Anne Lyons
      decided to test how the disease responded to a radical therapy –
      exposure to a certain wavelength of light called near-infrared
      (NIR).<br>
      <br>
      “Never in a million years did I think it would help,” says Lyons,
      an associate professor of biomedical sciences at the University of
      Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM), who studies the role of the immune
      response in MS.<br>
      <br>
      But it did. In rodent models, early MS-like symptoms were treated
      with exposure to NIR light for a week, alternating with a week of
      no light. The clinical condition of the mice improved.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Janis Eells, who shared the idea with Lyons, had the
      same initial reaction after she used NIR therapy on rats to treat
      blindness caused by poisoning, a condition thought to be
      permanent. Repeating experiments again and again, she found that
      certain doses of NIR light allowed lab animals to regain their
      sight.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists have known for years that certain wavelengths of light
      in certain doses can heal, but they are only now uncovering
      exactly how it works, thanks in large part to three UWM faculty
      researchers, including Chukuka S. Enwemeka, dean of UWM’s College
      of Health Sciences who is internationally known for his work in
      phototherapy.<br>
      <br>
      Enwemeka researches the effects of both NIR and blue light in the
      visible range on healing wounds. Among his discoveries is that
      some wavelengths of blue light can clear stubborn infections –
      even MRSA, the antibiotic-resistant “superbug” form of
      Staphylococcus aureus.<br>
      <br>
      Together, the UWM cluster has found that NIR and blue light repair
      tissue in dramatically different ways, but both act on the same
      enzyme in the cell’s energy supply center: the mitochondria. The
      studies have revealed key information about managing the effects
      of aging and disease.<br>
      <br>
      So how is light accomplishing such wonders?<br>
      <br>
      In applying NIR light therapy to MS, Lyons has identified the
      right timing and dose. But she’s also dug deeper, analyzing the
      effect the light had on the activities of the animal’s genes. It
      turns out, molecules that would make the disease worse were
      weakened after exposure to the light, and the ones responsible for
      improvement were strengthened.<br>
      <br>
      Eells says NIR light acts on the mitochondria and a particular
      enzyme, cytochrome C oxidase, to stimulate cell repair.<br>
      <br>
      Light can do all that?<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      “We’re not talking about white light [all wavelengths in the
      visible spectrum combined] as treatment, but only certain
      wavelengths, at a certain intensity, for a certain amount of
      time,” says Lyons. “Like ingested medication, it’s all about the
      dose.”<br>
      <br>
      Determining the best wavelength of light for phototherapy is a
      difficult task. Studies show that 670 nanometer (nm) and 830 nm
      light are beneficial, but 730 nm is not. The other difficult task
      is determining the appropriate dose and dose regimen for
      delivering the light.<br>
      <br>
      Even more exciting is phototherapy’s potential to improve a host
      of other degenerative diseases. Damaged mitochondria lead to a
      rise in destructive “free radicals,” which play a key role in
      aging and cancer.<br>
      <br>
      “It’s why we try to put antioxidants into our diets,” says Lyons,
      “to fight that process.”<br>
      <br>
      One source of free radicals comes from the inflammation caused by
      the body’s immune response. The researchers have found that after
      an injury or illness triggers the immune response, NIR light
      resets the mitochondria so they function normally again.<br>
      <br>
      “NIR reduces inflammation,” says Eells. “If you can tone down the
      inflammation in an eye disease like retinitis pigmentosa, you slow
      the progression of the disease.”<br>
      <br>
      A similar observation with inflammation occurred in a study on
      recalcitrant bedsores, she adds. Wounds treated with phototherapy
      healed two and a half times more quickly than untreated wounds.
      “Chronic non-healing wounds are ‘stuck’ in the inflammatory phase
      of wound healing” The light removes that obstacle,” says Eells.<br>
      <br>
      She has been working with Tim Kern at Case Western Reserve in
      treating an animal model of diabetic retinopathy with NIR light,
      which has been shown to slow progression and reduce the severity
      of the condition. Kern hopes to initiate a clinical trial in the
      near future.<br>
      <br>
      NIR light heals by ensuring that cytochrome oxidase binds with
      oxygen to turn on protectors and stimulate cell metabolism. Blue
      light, on the other hand, causes a toxic environment when the
      immune response has been triggered. That poisonous effect hastens
      healing of topical wounds by killing bacteria that cause
      infection.<br>
      <br>
      The question is, “What gives light in the longer wavelength its
      antibiotic effect?”<br>
      <br>
      Enwemeka’s studies suggest that blue light also acts on the
      mitochondrial enzyme site, but allows cytochrome oxidase to bind
      with nitric oxide, a free radical that is elevated in the immune
      response. It’s a pairing that poisons the invader.<br>
      <br>
      This theory is still unproven, but the therapy has achieved
      undeniable results in the lab with methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Enwemeka demonstrated that one dose
      of irradiation killed as much as 92 percent of two pervasive
      strains of MRSA.<br>
      <br>
      He is working to improve that success rate by getting the light to
      penetrate deeper in order to finish off the few colonies that
      survive irradiation.<br>
      <br>
      Enwemeka is leading a research effort in Brazil and at UWM that he
      hopes will ultimately lead to clinical use of NIR and blue light
      in the U.S. for the treatment of wounds.<br>
      <br>
      In the six years since he was asked to test the effects of blue
      light on MRSA, he says, research on the topic has picked up. But
      currently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not
      sanctioned the use of blue light in treating wounds, or NIR light
      for conditions other than wounds and pain.<br>
      <br>
      With so much success, why isn’t phototherapy being used more
      widely?<br>
      <br>
      “It’s considered alternative therapy in Western medicine. It seems
      too simple for people to accept,” says Lyons.<br>
      <br>
      What the FDA is waiting for, says Enwemeka, is confirmation from a
      large-scale clinical study before approving phototherapy for a
      wider variety of ailments. It’s something Enwemeka and Harry
      Whelan, a UWM alumnus and physician-researcher at the Medical
      College of Wisconsin, are determined to accomplish.<br>
      <br>
      “To see people who have not had relief see their wounds heal and
      not return,” says Enwemeka of the Brazilian patients who have
      benefited from therapy, “is very touching.”<br>

        <b>and the Alliance for Natural Health USA</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Purpose</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Since the modern inception of public mistrust in vaccines in the
      late 1990s, in the wake of a since-retracted study published in
      The Lancet by Andrew Wakefield in 1998,[1] a handful of sporadic
      and hastily completed epidemiological studies have been used by
      the media and various government agencies as evidence that
      vaccines are safe. As Mark Twain quipped, “Facts are stubborn, but
      statistics are more pliable.” There are many ways in which data is
      chosen, manipulated, and compared, and the average person with
      only a basic knowledge of statistical methods must take the word
      of the author that the results are “proof.” Important policy
      decisions and laws are being made, and public debate is being
      suppressed, based on the unexamined assumption that the science on
      vaccine safety has been settled. The Alliance for Natural Health
      USA (ANH-USA) and Dr. Brian Hooker have teamed up to rigorously
      scrutinize twelve of the papers most often cited as proof positive
      that vaccines are safe. Each review presents the study’s overview
      and findings, along with an analysis of the findings, and a final
      statement of the authors’ conflicts of interest.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary of Findings</b><br>
      <br>
      Generally speaking, each study was conducted by researchers
      connected to government immunization offices or drug companies,
      thereby giving them a vested interest to “prove” that vaccines are
      universally safe. Other problems were identified: poor sample

            injury of tomato</b></big><br>

        <i>End-of-day far-red and blue light work synergistically to
          prevent edema in tomato seedlings grown under UV-deficient
          conditions</i><br>

      <br>
      TUSCON, AZ - Intumescence injury, also known as edema or oedema,
      is a nonpathogenic physiological disorder that can cause blister-
      or callus-like tumor growths to develop on the surface of leaves,
      petioles, and stems of plants. Problematic intumescence injury has
      been observed in many different plant species. Researchers from
      the School of Plant Sciences at The University of Arizona
      published a study in the June 2016 issue of HortScience in which
      they report on recommended light treatments to mitigate the
      disorder for tomato plants grown in UV light-deficient
      environments.<br>
      <br>
      Tomomi Eguchi, Ricardo Hernández, and Chieri Kubota said they had
      previously observed intumescence injury in some cultivars of
      tomato rootstocks seedlings cultivated in indoor production
      systems under electric lighting (especially under LEDs). In the
      current study, the scientists examined effects of end-of-day
      far-red (EOD-FR) light and high blue photon flux (PF) ratio during
      the photoperiod on intumescence injury using 'Beaufort'
      interspecific tomato rootstock seedlings, a cultivar highly
      susceptible to intumescence injury.<br>
      <br>
      The study included two experiments. In the first, the scientists
      examined EOD-FR light treatment as a means to inhibit intumescence
      injury of tomato plants grown under UV-deficient light. 'Beaufort'
      tomato plants were grown under cool-white fluorescent lamps or
      10B-90R% light-emitting diodes without or with high dose of EOD-FR
      light treatment (67 mmol·m-2).<br>
      <br>
      In the second experiment, the scientists examined the relationship
      between intumescence injury and daily EOD-FR dose in which the
      daily minimum dose (intensity x duration) required to maximally
      inhibit intumescence injury was quantified. 'Beaufort' plants were
      grown under 10B-90R% or 75B-25R% LEDs without or with varied daily
      dose of EOD-FR light treatment (1-76 mmol·m-2). Additionally, they
      examined the combination of high blue PF ratio during the
      photoperiod and EOD-FR light for intumescence injury, plant
      growth, and morphology.<br>
      <br>
      Results showed that EOD-FR light treatment alleviated intumescence
      injury of tomato plants grown under red and blue LEDs deficient in
      UV-B radiation. "The mitigation response was saturated at a FR
      dose as low as 1.1 mmol·m-2·d-1," the authors noted.<br>
      <br>
      High blue PF ratio (75B-25R%) during the photoperiod also
      mitigated intumescence injury. "When the plants were grown under
      high blue PF ratio (75%) during the photoperiod combined with
      EOD-FR light treatment, the intumescence injury was further and
      sufficiently inhibited," the authors explained. "Also, under the
      combination of high blue PF ratio during the photoperiod and
      EOD-FR light treatment, undesirable stem elongation by EOD-FR
      light treatment was mitigated."<br>
      <br>
      The researchers concluded that applying a small dose of EOD-FR
      light and high blue PF ratio during the photoperiod may provide a
      potential means to mitigate the problematic intumescence injury of
      tomato plants grown under LEDs or other environments deficient in
      UV light. "The synergistic effect of FR and blue was possibly
      through different photoreceptors and their interaction," they
      said.<br>

            Mitigate Intumescence Injury of Tomato Plants Grown Under

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Intumescence injury is an abiotic-stress-induced physiological
      disorder associated with abnormal cell enlargement and cell
      division. The symptom includes blister- or callus-like growths on
      leaves, which occur on sensitive cultivars of tomato when they are
      grown under ultraviolet (UV)-deficit light environment, such as
      light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Previous studies suggest that
      intumescence can be reduced by increasing far-red (FR) or blue
      light. In the present study, effects of end-of-day FR (EOD-FR)
      light and high blue photon flux (PF) ratio during the photoperiod
      on intumescence injury were examined using ‘Beaufort’
      interspecific tomato rootstock seedlings (Solanum lycopersicum ×
      Solanum habrochaites), a cultivar highly susceptible to
      intumescence injury. Our study showed that EOD-FR light treatment
      moderately suppressed intumescence injury. Using EOD-FR light
      treatment, the percent number of leaves exhibiting intumescences
      was reduced from 62.0–70.7% to 39.4–43.1%. By combining high blue
      PF ratio (75%) during the photoperiod and EOD-FR light treatment,
      the percent number of leaves exhibiting intumescences was further
      suppressed to 5.0%. Furthermore, the combination of high blue PF
      ratio and EOD-FR light treatment inhibited undesirable stem
      elongation caused by EOD-FR light treatment. We found that high
      blue PF ratio during the photoperiod combined with a small dose of
      EOD-FR lighting (≈1 mmol·m−2·d−1 provided by 5.2 µmol·m−2·s−1 FR
      PF for 3.3 minutes) could inhibit the problematic intumescence
      injury of tomato plants grown under LEDs without negatively
      influencing growth or morphology.<br>

      And the highways shall lie waste.<br>
      The glory of the forests shall be consumed,<br>
      And the fruitful field;<br>
      Yea, the trees shall be so few,<br>
      That a child may count them.<br>
      Behold, the day shall come,<br>
      That all that is in the earth,<br>
      And all that which thy fathers have laid up in store,<br>
      Shall be carried up in smoke,<br>
      For ye have forgotten thy Heavenly Father<br>
      And thy Earthly Mother,<br>
      And ye have broken the Holy Law.<br>
      oh that thou wouldst rend the heavens,<br>
      That thou wouldst come down,<br>
      That the mountains might flow down at thy presence<br>
      When thy hand showed forth the power of thy Law<br>
      Thou camest down in fury:<br>
      The mountains flowed down at thy presence,<br>
      And the melting fires burned.<br>

      We are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest,<br>
      Whose waters cast up mire and dirt.<br>
      We trust in vanity, and speak lies;<br>
      Our feet run to evil,<br>
      Wasting and destruction are in our paths.<br>
      We grope for the wall like the blind,<br>
      We stumble at noon day as in the night,<br>
      We are in desolate places as dead men.<br>
      But now, O Heavenly Father, thou art our father:<br>
      We are the clay, and thou our potter,<br>
      And we are all thy people.<br>
      Thy holy cities are a wilderness,<br>
      Thy forests are consumed,<br>
      All thy earth is a desolation.<br>

      I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled,<br>
      And all the hills moved lightly.<br>
      I beheld, and, lo, there was no man,<br>
      And all the birds of the heavens<br>
      I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness,<br>
      And all the cities thereof were broken down<br>
      At the presence of the Lord, and by his fierce anger.<br>
      For thus hath the Lord said,<br>
      The whole land shall be desolate;<br>
      Yet will I not make a full end.<br>

      And flowing streams in the desert.<br>
      And the parched ground shall become a pool,<br>
      And the thirsty land springs of water.<br>
      And an highway shall be there, and a way,<br>
      And it shall be called the Way of the Law:<br>
      The unclean shall not pass over it,<br>
      But it shall be for the Children of Light<br>
      To cross over the Eternal River unto the hidden place<br>
      Where standeth the Tree of Life.<br>
      And the children of men shall return to the earth,<br>
      And come unto the Infinite Garden<br>
      With songs and everlasting joy upon their heads:<br>
      They shall obtain joy and gladness,<br>
      And sorrow and sighing shall flee away,<br>
      And it shall come to pass in the last days,<br>
      That the mountain of the Lord's house<br>
      Shall be established in the top of the mountains,<br>
      And shall be exalted above the hills;<br>
      And all the sons of men of the earth shall flow unto it.<br>
      And many people shall go and say,<br>
      'Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,<br>
      To the tabernacle of the Holy Law,<br>
      And the Holy Angels will teach us<br>
      of the ways of the Heavenly Father<br>
      And the Earthly Mother,<br>
      And we will walk in the paths of the righteous:<br>
      For out of the Garden of the Brotherhood<br>
      Shall go forth the Law,<br>
      And the word of the Lord from the Children of Light.<br>
      And the Lord shall judge among the nations,<br>
      And shall rebuke many people:<br>
      And they shall beat their swords into plowshares,<br>
      And their spears into pruning hooks:<br>
      Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,<br>
      Neither shall they learn war any more.<br>
      Hear the voices of the Brothers,<br>
      Which cry aloud in the wilderness:<br>
      Prepare ye the way of the Law!<br>
      Make straight in the desert a highway for our God!<br>
      Every valley shall be exalted,<br>
      And every mountain and hill shall be made low:<br>
      And the crooked shall be made straight,<br>
      And the rough places plain:<br>
      And the voice of the Heavenly Father shall be heard:<br>
      1, even I, am the Law; and beside me there is no other.<br>
      Yea, before the day was I am he:<br>
      And there is none that can deliver out of my hand.<br>
      Hearken unto me, O Children of Light!<br>
      I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.<br>
      Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth,<br>
      And my right hand hath spanned the heavens.<br>
      Hearken unto me, O Children of Light!<br>
      Ye that know righteousness,<br>
      My children in whose hearts is my Law:<br>
      Ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace:<br>
      The mountains and the hills<br>
      Shall break forth before you into singing,<br>
      And all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.<br>
      Arise, shine, O Children of Light!<br>
      For my Light is come upon thee,<br>
      And thou shalt make the Glory of the Law<br>
      To rise upon the new earth!<br>
