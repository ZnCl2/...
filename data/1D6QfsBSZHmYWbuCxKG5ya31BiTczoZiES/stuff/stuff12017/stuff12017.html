            Fully Assembled ER50 ready NOW<br>
          </big></b><br>
        Details to order a FULLY ASSEMBLED ER50 are below...<br>
        Breathing / Drinking BG UPDATE:<br>
        In addition to all the personal benefits I listed in the '
        Plants Don't Lie' document, I've recently noticed that all the
        warts on my body have disappeared.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        I've had hand warts since childhood, got them from my best
        friend (he's still my best friend).&nbsp; They were generally
        pretty benign and small (I'd clip out any that grew in size),
        but now they are GONE!&nbsp; I literally can't find one and
        there were usually at least a dozen.&nbsp; I do not know when
        they left but it's good to see them gone :)<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Then there's the plantar wart that was on my foot (gross, I
        know).&nbsp; I'd have to peal it off (the excess skin)
        occasionally (about once every two months) or it'd be painful
        (like a stone in my shoe).&nbsp; I THINK it must have pealed off
        when the severe psoriasis left my feet (all my skin) baby skin
        smooth.&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        I thought the thick callus on hands, elbows, knees and feet was
        normal, because I've had them from a child, working hard on my
        Dad's ranch.&nbsp; I didn't know the thick white pealing skin
        was psoriasis.&nbsp; I'm amazed at how smooth my skin is
        compared to friends my age (nearly 60).&nbsp; I've can't
        remember a time when I've had skin so smooth!&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        I don't use any 'rejuvenation' or 'hydrating' creams, etc.&nbsp;
        I guess being a guy, I never felt the need (it was an advantage
        to look older).&nbsp; Now that I'm actually older I was
        considering it... but the BG seems to be doing everything such
        creams promise, from the inside out.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        Again I think... "If this is what I'm seeing on the OUTSIDE,
        what must be happening on the INSIDE?!"<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        I’ve updated the ‘ Plant’s Don’t Lie’ pdf, if you’ve downloaded
        it, it’d be good to&nbsp; download it again.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Here's an article discussing Chronic De-Hydration as the cause
        of most disease.&nbsp; <br>
        I've also learned that chronically de-hydrated people lose the
        ability to discern between hunger and thirst and thus often eat
        instead of drink.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        Helpful healthful dieting tip: I find it helpful to drink a
        quart (liter) of (BG Bubbled) water when I feel hungry, then if
        I still feel hungry 1/2 hour later, to eat a reasonable portion
        of healthy food.&nbsp; This technique helped me lose 30 excess
        pounds. I'm also starting to exercise.&nbsp; I noticed some
        muscle definition just from the BG water / breathing but just
        having muscle doesn't mean it's toned or strong.&nbsp; For that
        you need to USE your muscles.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        After only a couple of weeks going to the gym (you can do it at
        home with exercises like&nbsp; in this book) I already feel
        stronger and more stable (good thing in the winter).<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        As people get their&nbsp; ER50's kits built and operational I'm
        hearing more amazing testimonials.&nbsp; Most are unwilling to
        go public and I respect that.&nbsp; <br>
        You can see some testimonials posted at the bottom of the&nbsp;
        ER50 Kit Sales Page.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        On my ' Brown's Gas for Health' page you can also find a link to
        a PATENT where a Korean man was using my ER1200 WaterTorches in
        his clinics to cure many illnesses (the patent lists the
        illnesses and provides proofs).<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        In addition to those, I have people telling me that their vision
        is improving (like mine is) and one person, who had access to a
        microscope, shared that a blood sample taken before breathing BG
        had clumped corpuscles and immediately after breathing the BG,
        the corpuscles were all individually free (unclumped).&nbsp; I'm
        thinking this is a GOOD THING :)<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        And I STILL HAVEN'T BEEN SICK except for occasional sniffle,
        since 2006.&nbsp; I have NOT taken&nbsp; antibiotics or&nbsp;
        vaccines in all that time (I would in an emergency).&nbsp; I
        attribute this 'wellness' mostly to Drinking / Breathing the BG
        and (for the very seldom sniffle) I take a supplement like&nbsp;
        Immune FX,&nbsp; Nutrilite TriGuard Echinacea and/or&nbsp;
        Immune 7 by Purica.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        I also have a folder of Brown's Gas for Health testimonials from
        Loyd Jacob, a chiropractor in Spokane Washington, who has
        treated people with Brown's Gas (mostly topically) for
        years.&nbsp; His clients love the treatments, which he primarily
        uses to loosen muscles and stop pain (though there were also
        many healthful side effects).&nbsp; I'll get these posted as
        soon as I can find the time.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        FULLY ASSEMBLED ER50s<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        In the meantime, my big news is that when I recently offered to
        assemble ER50 kits (last eNews) several people took me up on the
        offer and the result was that they all got working ER50s, AND
        that I'm now set up to offer&nbsp; FULLY ASSEMBLED ER50s to
        everyone.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        This is the FIRST TIME I'm making this offer&nbsp;
        publicly.&nbsp; I've always sold the ER50 as Kits because I was
        convinced that I needed to keep the cost down as low as possible
        and that people who 'find me' were mostly DIY skilled or had
        access to DIY friends.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        BUT I now see that many people just do not have the time, tools,
        skills, space, etc. to put kits together.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        These people need&nbsp; Brown's Gas for Health just as much as
        the 'handymen'.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        So I've set up a new&nbsp; FULLY ASSEMBLED ER50 Sales Page on my
        website.&nbsp; This will allow people to buy an ER50 that is
        'ready to use'.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Buying now will get you an ER50 that is PERSONALLY hand built by
        me (George Wiseman) the original inventor of this super simple
        and efficient version of Brown's Gas (BG or HHO)
        technology.&nbsp; If sales pick up I'll need to hire people to
        assemble these units so you won't get my personal touch.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        A bit of relevant 'SUPPRESSION' history I hadn't shared yet:<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Starting August 2014 (just after my BG presentation in
        Albuquerque) The USPS (and UPS) started SMASHING my 'chamber
        assembled' ER50s.&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Because I know that the USPS is capable of finding and tracking
        specific packages (previous suppression experience) I tried
        several shipping changes to keep them from being smashed, but
        each time I made a change (to confuse their automatic tracking
        computers), they'd figure it out within a couple of shipments
        and then start smashing them again.&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Such shipping changes usually allowed me to slip an ER50 through
        to a customer who had received a smashed one but I had to send 4
        to one customer before he got an unbroken one (the unbroken one
        was in a crate, see below).&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Before the Alburquerque presentation I had shipped out (since
        2001) dozens of 'chamber assembled' ER50's and the USPS (and
        UPS) hadn't broken a single one.&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Obviously (in my opinion) the Alburquerque presentation caught
        the eye of the Vested Interest. (this isn't my first experience
        with Vested Interest using USPS suppression techniques).<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        I then tried to putting a padded ER50 into a box, with more
        padding inside another box with wooden supports....and I kid you
        NOT! The USPS OPENED both the boxes, smashed the ER50 and
        repacked the boxes... so they wouldn’t have to pay my insurance
        claim (because there was no damage to the boxes).&nbsp;&nbsp; My
        jaw literally dropped when my customer showed me the pictures.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        It was also STUPID CRAZY to get the USPS to pay all the other
        insurance claims... I spent HOURS fulfilling all their
        'requirements'.&nbsp; After a few I got really good at doing it
        (I made templates).<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        I ended up pointing out (literally to a USPS lawyer) that I was
        taking steps to sue the USPS and I'd go into court Pro Se
        (without a lawyer), because it didn't matter if I won or lost
        the court case, because the PUBLICITY I'd get from suing (being
        an inventor suing the USPS for deliberately smashing my
        products) would allow me to make a HUGE number of sales.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        NOTE: This wasn't my first rodeo, so I had been gathering
        information on their shenanigans as it happened, so when they
        erased the information from their computers (which they did
        BTW), I still had copies (proof of this particular craziness).<br>
        <br>
        They immediately paid all the claims, (except the one where they
        opened the boxes).<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Since the 'double box' packing (that USPS recommended) didn't
        work, I now put the ER50’s into a CRATE, using #2 Robertson head
        screws…&nbsp; Roberson head screwdrivers aren't common in the
        USA, so they work as a USPS tamper resistant feature.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        So far none of these crated ER50s has been smashed (I’m lucky
        they are lazy bast….s)or 'lost' (I do pay the extortionist
        tracking and insurance fees).&nbsp; But it’s costing me an
        additional $70 to build the crate, higher shipping cost, etc.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        ON the bright side; I figured out how to assemble the ER50 right
        IN THE CRATE, so solving this 'smashing issue' has actually
        helped me advance the ER50 usability.&nbsp; I can now offer
        FULLY ASSEMBLED ER50s and can be reasonably sure they'll reach
        you unbroken.<br>
        <br>
        It'll be 'interesting' to see what Suppression Technique they'll
        use on me next.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        This may be another GOOD REASON to buy your&nbsp; FULLY
        Assembled ER50 now, rather than later...Because in my experience
        the Vested Interest gets real active on people who actually
        offer FINISHED PRODUCT.&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        They care little about books (maybe they think most people don't
        read anymore) and They care only a bit about kits (thinking most
        people won't put them together).&nbsp; They care a LOT about
        plug and play product that could cost them BILLIONS in lost
        revenue. It's also embarrassing (to them) that WATER, specially
        made at HOME, can cure or mitigate many <br>
        illnesses that they are currently using DRUGS, antibiotics and
        vaccines to treat symptoms (not cure). For people who find the
        price of the&nbsp; Fully Assembled ER50 steep ($968), I do offer
        a (PayPal&nbsp; sponsored) financing option at the bottom of
        the&nbsp; Fully Assembled ER50 sales page.<br>

        BAE Systems are designing a directed energy laser system that
        could allow military commanders to spy on enemy activities from
        space.<br>
        <br>
        BAE believe that within 50 years, one of their aircraft could
        use an “atmospheric lens” to observe people from very long
        distances using the Earth’s atmosphere as a tool.<br>
        <br>
        The lasers temporarily change the Earth’s atmosphere into
        magnifying glass structures which can alter light and radio
        signals.<br>
        <br>
        This means users can listen into radio signals for thousands of
        miles.<br>
        <br>
        A spokesperson said: “Within the next 50 years, scientists at
        BAE Systems believe that battlefield commanders could deploy a
        new type of directed energy laser and lens system, called a
        Laser Developed Atmospheric Lens which is capable of enhancing
        commanders’ ability to observe adversaries’ activities over much
        greater distances than existing sensors.”<br>
        <br>
        “Working with some of the best scientific minds in the UK, we’re
        able to incorporate emerging and disruptive technologies and
        evolve the landscape of potential military technologies in ways
        that, five or ten years ago, many would never have dreamed
        possible,” added Professor Nick Colosimo, BAE Systems’ Futurist
        and Technologist.<br>
        <br>
        High powered pulsed lasers will create a lens by manipulating
        the Earth’s atmosphere, scientists at BAE claim Battlefield
        commanders could spy on foes using a laser streamed from space<br>
        <br>
        A high pulsed power laser system will temporarily heat a small
        region of atmosphere so it will mimic the ionosphere – which
        bounces radio signals<br>
        <br>
        Laser technology is hotting up, with Britain unleashing a&nbsp;
        Star Wars’ style laser cannon dubbed Dragonfire.<br>
        <br>
        The concept mimics the ionosphere, a naturally occurring layer
        of the Earth’s atmosphere which can be reflective to radio
        waves.<br>
        <br>
        The radio signals bounce off the ionosphere allowing them to
        travel very long distances through the air and over the Earth’s
        surface, picking up every radio signal in its wake.<br>
        BAE Systems claimed the lens could also be used as a form of
        “deflector shield” too.<br>
        <br>
        The Laser Developed Atmospheric Lens (LDAL) concept was
        developed by technologists at the Company’s military aircraft
        facility in Warton, Lancashire.<br>

        <br>
        ...Since its discovery in 2004, scientists have speculated that
        graphene may also have the capacity to be a superconductor.
        Until now, superconductivity in graphene has only been achieved
        by doing it with, or by placing it on, a superconducting
        material - a process which can compromise some of its other
        properties.<br>
        <br>
        But in the new study, researchers at the University of Cambridge
        managed to activate the dormant potential for graphene to
        superconduct in its own right. This was achieved by coupling it
        with a material called praseodymium cerium copper oxide
        (PCCO)...<br>
        <br>
        It remains unclear what type of superconductivity the team
        activated, but their results strongly indicate that it is the
        elusive "p-wave" form. If so, the study could transform the
        ongoing debate about whether this mysterious type of
        superconductivity exists, and - if so - what exactly it is...<br>

        </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
        <br>
        Electron pairing in the vast majority of superconductors follows
        the Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer theory of superconductivity, which
        describes the condensation of electrons into pairs with
        antiparallel spins in a singlet state with an s-wave symmetry.
        Unconventional superconductivity was predicted in single-layer
        graphene (SLG), with the electrons pairing with a p-wave or
        chiral d-wave symmetry, depending on the position of the Fermi
        energy with respect to the Dirac point. By placing SLG on an
        electron-doped (non-chiral) d-wave superconductor and performing
        local scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy, here we
        show evidence for a p-wave triggered superconducting density of
        states in SLG. The realization of unconventional
        superconductivity in SLG offers an exciting new route for the
        development of p-wave superconductivity using two-dimensional
        materials with transition temperatures above 4.2?K.<br>

        ...Last year, a report commissioned by the UK government
        outlined a grim possible future that could "cast us back into
        the dark ages of medicine," where our drugs simply don't work
        and rampant antibiotic-resistant bacteria are responsible for up
        to 10 million deaths per year. That report predicted those
        horrors for the year 2050, but unfortunately, the killer bugs
        might be ahead of schedule: our last line of defense against
        bacteria, a class of antibiotics called carbapenems, are already
        beginning to fail in large numbers....<br>
        <br>
        Some of the most devastating bacteria get their antibiotic
        resistance by producing an enzyme known as New Delhi
        Metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1). It's this enzyme that the new
        research is targeting, by developing a molecule called a
        peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer
        (PPMO). This inhibits the bacteria's expression of NDM-1,
        essentially destroying its antibiotic resistance and allowing
        existing drugs to be effective once again.<br>
        <br>
        "The significance of NDM-1 is that it is destroys carbapenems,
        so doctors have had to pull out an antibiotic, colistin, that
        hadn't been used in decades because it's toxic to the kidneys,"
        Geller explains. "That is literally the last antibiotic that can
        be used on an NDM-1-expressing organism, and we now have
        bacteria that are completely resistant to all known antibiotics.
        But a PPMO can restore susceptibility to antibiotics that have
        already been approved, so we can get a PPMO approved and then go
        back and use these antibiotics that had become useless."...<br>

        Objectives: The objective of this study was to test the efficacy
        of an inhibitor of the New Delhi metallo-β- lactamase (NDM-1).
        Inhibiting expression of this type of antibiotic-resistance gene
        has the potential to restore antibiotic susceptibility in all
        bacteria carrying the gene.<br>
        <br>
        Methods: We have constructed a peptide-conjugated
        phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PPMO) that selectively
        inhibits the expression of NDM-1 and examined its ability to
        restore susceptibility to meropenem in vitro and in vivo.<br>
        <br>
        Results:In vitro, the PPMO reduced the MIC of meropenem for
        three different genera of pathogens that express NDM-1. In a
        murine model of lethal E. coli sepsis, the PPMO improved
        survival (92%) and reduced systemic bacterial burden when given
        concomitantly with meropenem.<br>
        <br>
        Conclusions: These data show that a PPMO can restore antibiotic
        susceptibility in vitro and in vivo and that the combination of
        PPMO and meropenem may have therapeutic potential against
        certain class B carbapenem-resistant infections in multiple
        genera of Gram-negative pathogens.<br>

        A green, rechargeable battery that is suitable for powering
        electric vehicles and stationary power storage applications, and
        that would survive tens of thousands of charge cycles in a
        useful life of 100 years without loss of capacity. What could be
        a better innovation for our times? Such a battery has been
        developed, and recently improved by Stanford researchers. Oh,
        one other thing. The battery was invented by Thomas Edison in
        1901.<br>
        <br>
        ...Lead-acid batteries were used to store electricity in most
        electric cars until about 1900, when alternate batteries with
        competitive energy storage, power capacity, and cost began to be
        developed.<br>
        <br>
        Arguably the most popular of these alternate batteries was
        Thomas Edison's nickel-iron battery. The strong points of the
        nickel-iron battery included a virtually unlimited useful life,
        a physical and chemical makeup enormously resistant to abuse,
        and a 42 percent increase in energy density. The weak points
        included higher cost as well as low voltage, power density, and
        charge rate. In combination, these weaknesses meant that a bank
        of nickel-iron batteries had about double the weight and volume
        as a set of lead-acid batteries of equal performance. The extra
        cost for a set of nickel-iron batteries for an electric car was
        US$600 - some $10,000 in current dollars.<br>
        <br>
        The competing batteries both held strong positions in the market
        until the gasoline engine improved to the point of clear
        superiority over electric cars. Then small lead-acid batteries
        won out as power sources for starting internal combustion
        engines, and nickel-iron batteries retained only a small
        position, mostly in stationary applications.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Pictorial of the charge and discharge chemistry of the
          nickel-iron battery</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        The nickel-iron battery uses an electrolyte of potassium or
        sodium hydroxide and contains no lead or other heavy metals. It
        is therefore without risk of acid spills and its construction
        and disposal are largely without significant environmental
        damage. The density of the electrolyte does not change with the
        level of charge, as the electrolyte remains unchanged by the
        operation of the battery. The battery chemistry in a nickel-iron
        battery, during both charging and discharging, acts to transfer
        oxygen from one electrode to the other. This type of cell is
        sometimes called an oxygenlift cell, with the voltage generated
        by a change in oxidization potential between the electrodes.<br>
        <br>
        A group of researchers at Stanford has significantly improved
        the performance of nickel-iron batteries, which may lead to new
        applications for this venerable battery. The Stanford team has
        created an ultrafast nickel-iron battery that can be fully
        charged in about two minutes and discharged in less than 30
        seconds, making the new batteries ideal to supplement
        slow-charging lithium-ion batteries in regenerative braking.<br>
        <br>
        To improve the performance of the nickel-iron battery, the
        Stanford team grew nanocrystals of iron oxide onto graphene
        sheets and nanocrystals of nickel hydroxide onto multi-walled
        carbon nanotubes. <br>
        <br>
        By doing so, they produced strong chemical bonding between the
        metal-containing nanocrystallites and the carbon nanostructures.
        The coupling of the carbon gives a low resistance pathway for
        electrical charges to move between the nanocrystallites (where
        the charging and discharging activity is taking place) and a
        device being powered by the battery.<br>
        <br>
        Stanford's Professor Dai says, "the result is an ultrafast
        version of the nickel-iron battery that's capable of charging
        and discharging in seconds." Unlike lead-acid or lithium-ion
        batteries, nickel-iron batteries will neither explode nor catch
        fire at high charging/discharging rates.<br>

        <b>Abstract</b><br>
        <br>
        Ultrafast rechargeable batteries made from low-cost and abundant
        electrode materials operating in safe aqueous electrolytes could
        be attractive for electrochemical energy storage. If both high
        specific power and energy are achieved, such batteries would be
        useful for power quality applications such as to assist
        propelling electric vehicles that require fast acceleration and
        intense braking. <br>
        <br>
        Here we develop a new type of Ni–Fe battery by employing novel
        inorganic nanoparticle/graphitic nanocarbon (carbon nanotubes
        and graphene) hybrid materials as electrode materials. We
        successfully increase the charging and discharging rates by
        nearly 1,000-fold over traditional Ni–Fe batteries while
        attaining high energy density. The ultrafast Ni–Fe battery can
        be charged in ~2 min and discharged within 30 s to deliver a
        specific energy of 120 Wh kg−1 and a specific power of 15 kW
        kg−1. These features suggest a new generation of Ni–Fe batteries
        as novel devices for electrochemical energy storage.<br>

            Bosch innovation reduces fuel consumption by up to 13
            percent</b><br>
        </div>
        <b> </b><br>
        Did you know that even advanced gasoline engines waste roughly a
        fifth of their fuel? Especially at high engine speeds, some of
        the gasoline is used for cooling instead of for propulsion. With
        its new water injection, Bosch shows that it does not have to be
        that way. Particularly when accelerating quickly or driving on
        the freeway, the injection of additional water makes it possible
        to reduce fuel consumption by up to 13 percent. “With our water
        injection, we show that the combustion engine still has some
        tricks up its sleeve,” says Dr. Rolf Bulander, chairman of the
        Bosch Mobility Solutions business sector and member of the board
        of management of Robert Bosch GmbH. The fuel economy offered <br>
        by this Bosch technology comes especially to the fore in three-
        and four-cylinder downsized engines: in other words, in
        precisely the kind of engines to be found under the hood of any
        average midsize car. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Extra boost for the turbocharged engine</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        But it is not only in the area of fuel economy that the Bosch
        innovation comes into play. It can make cars more powerful as
        well. “Water injection can deliver an extra kick in any
        turbocharged engine,” says Stefan Seiberth, president of the
        Gasoline Systems division at Bosch. Earlier ignition angles mean
        that the engine is operated even more efficiently. On this
        basis, engineers can coax additional power out of the engine,
        even in powerful sports cars.<br>
        <br>
        The basis of this innovative engine technology is a simple fact:
        an engine must not be allowed to overheat. To stop this
        happening, additional fuel is injected into nearly every
        gasoline engine on today’s roads. This fuel evaporates, cooling
        parts of the engine block. With water injection, Bosch engineers
        have exploited this physical principle. Before the fuel ignites,
        a fine mist of water is injected into the intake duct. Water’s
        high heat of vaporization means that it provides effective
        cooling.<br>
        <br>
        This is also the reason only a small additional volume of water
        is needed: for every one hundred kilometers driven, only a few
        hundred milliliters are necessary. As a result, the compact
        water tank that supplies the injection system with distilled
        water only has to be refilled every few thousand kilometers at
        the most.<br>
        <br>
        And if the tank should run empty, there is nothing to worry
        about: the engine will still run smoothly – albeit without the
        higher torque and lower consumption provided by water injection.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Additional questions and answers</b><br>
        <br>
        Is this technology already in production?<br>
        <br>
        The BMW M4 GTS is the first production vehicle to feature an
        innovative and groundbreaking water injection system. In the
        vehicle’s turbocharged six-cylinder engine, it offers improved
        performance and consumption even at full load. Bosch supplies
        water injection parts for the BMW M4 GTS.<br>
        <br>
        How high is fuel consumption in the driving cycle?<br>
        <br>
        In the future consumption test (WLTC), water injection makes it
        possible to save up to 4 percent fuel. In real driving
        conditions, even more is possible: here, fuel consumption can be
        reduced by up to 13 percent when accelerating quickly or driving
        on the freeway.<br>
        <br>
        Doesn’t water injection cause the engine to rust?<br>
        <br>
        No. No water is left in the combustion chamber. The water
        evaporates before combustion happens in the engine. All the
        water is expelled into the environ-ment, together with the
        exhaust.<br>
        <br>
        How is water refilled?<br>
        <br>
        Water injection only requires a small amount of water to be kept
        on board. On average, it only has to be refilled every 3,000
        kilometers. The separate water tank has to be filled with
        distilled water.<br>
        <br>
        Can the water in the tank freeze?<br>
        <br>
        When the engine is stopped, the water flows back into its tank,
        where it may freeze. Following engine restart, the water thaws
        again.<br>
        <br>
        Is there such a thing as direct water injection?<br>
        <br>
        Bosch uses a port injection system, since it has clear technical
        advantages and costs less. This makes water injection suitable
        for large-scale production, as well as for many vehicle
        segments. <br>

        <div align="center"><b>New engine performance due to hydropower</b><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        Good news: with Bosch WaterBoost, the combustion engine is once
        again ready to overtake and has its best days ahead. The secret
        of its success is a tuning formula with demineralized water,
        which boosts power generation, lowers fuel consumption, and
        minimizes concerns about CO2 emissions. So if you soon come
        across a turbocharged gasoline direct-injection engine, which
        despite concerted downsizing can keep the competition in its
        performance class on its toes even at high engine speeds, you'll
        know what's driving it: Bosch WaterBoost. From the world of
        motorsport. For more fun to drive.<br>
        <br>
        up to 5% greater engine performance without increasing engine
        displacement or boost pressure<br>
        up to 13% less fuel consumption at higher accleration or long
        motorway journeys<br>
        up to 4% less CO2 emitted in the WLTC*<br>
        *Worldwide harmonized Light-duty Test Cycle<br>
        <br>
        Due to Bosch's WaterBoost complete system – the only one of its
        kind in the world – the gasoline-driven powertrain is well on
        its way to redefining itself. When a direct-injection engine
        with little displacement but high levels of turbocharging is
        pushing its limits, bringing H2O into the mix of elements
        immediately pushes performance boundaries upward. The water
        actively cools the air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber,
        thus reducing knocking that harms the engine, allowing earlier
        ignition, and ultimately resulting in increased engine
        performance. The higher compression ratio in the engine also
        leads to a CO2 reduction of up to 4% in WLTC. Overall, the
        combustion process takes place at a better temperature and
        therefore in a more controlled fashion. Ignition happens sooner
        and the earlier center of heat release leads to a better level
        of efficiency. Benefits that we make available for gasoline
        engines with water injection. More than anything else, we
        believe "Invented for life" means enriching everyday driving
        with genuinely tangible improvements. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Fundamental for improved fuel efficiency</b><b><br>
        </b><b>The benefits of turbo air cooling</b><br>
        <br>
        It's an exciting challenge: as soon as the really fun driving
        starts, even the strongest engine breaks into a figurative sweat
        and responds with an increasing thirst for fuel. In these
        high-load situations, a welcome dose of refreshment is just the
        thing: a microfine spray from Bosch WaterBoost. Sprayed directly
        into the intake port, the fine mist of water droplets cools the
        hot combustion air down to a tolerable level.<br>
        <br>
        Successful WaterBoost effect: even at high engine speeds, the
        engine doesn't get "out of breath," since it receives the
        explosive air-fuel mixture sooner. And yet the result is not
        uncontrolled misfiring. That's because targeted use of water
        also protects the components in the powertrain interior.
        Incidentally, filling an additional tank with just 5 liters of
        the demineralized water lasts around 3,000 km. And even if the
        water runs dry from time to time, there's no effect on how the
        vehicle operates.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Water provides more oxygen</b><b><br>
        </b><b>Advantages of improving engine performance</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Horsepower is only truly powerful when it has enough room and
        air to give its driving force free rein. Whether or not
        turbocharging really gives direct-injection gasoline engines
        that extra kick forward is therefore decided in the highly
        compressed confines of the combustion chamber. Add in the fact
        that increasingly strict emissions guidelines of the past few
        years have not produced larger engine displacement; in fact,
        despite the rising overall demand for performance, it has
        actually gotten smaller.<br>
        <br>
        If the horses under the hood are reined in more and more
        tightly, allowing them to "breathe" properly becomes even more
        important. That's why Bosch boosts oxygen saturation by cooling
        off the incoming charge air using water injection in the
        combustion chamber. The results are gratifying: driving is
        noticeably more dynamic and enjoyable and the engine freely
        shifts into gear for top performance. Up to 5% more horsepower
        with the same boost pressure and displacement? The proven
        technology makes this a thoroughly credible promise.<br>

        ...Afsaneh Rabiei, a professor of mechanical and aerospace
        engineering at North Carolina State University, last year
        produced a foam metal shield that could block X-rays, various
        forms of gamma rays and neutron radiation, giving it potential
        as a lightweight alternative to the bulky radiation shielding
        currently available. <br>
        <br>
        Building on this previous work, Rabiei then set about building
        high-strength armor. The shield was comprised of boron carbide
        ceramics as the strike face, with composite metal foam (CMF) as
        the bullet kinetic energy absorber layer and Kevlar panels as
        backplates. To test its durability, Rabiei and her team took aim
        with a 7.62 x 63 mm M2 armor-piercing projectile, which was
        fired in line with the standard testing procedures established
        by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ).<br>

        "We could stop the bullet at a total thickness of less than an

        to 44 mm (1.73 in) indentation in the back of an armor."..<br>

        <br>
        The application of advance materials to manufacture hard armor
        systems has led to high performance ballistic protection. Due to
        its light-weight and high impact energy absorption capabilities,
        composite metal foams have shown good potential for applications
        as ballistic armor. A high-performance light-weight composite
        armor system has been manufactured using boron carbide ceramics
        as the strike face, composite metal foam processed by powder
        metallurgy technique as a bullet kinetic energy absorber
        interlayer, and aluminum 7075 or Kevlar™ panels as backplates
        with a total armor thickness less than 25 mm. The ballistic
        tolerance of this novel composite armor system has been
        evaluated against the 7.62 × 51 mm M80 and 7.62 × 63 mm M2 armor
        piercing projectiles according to U.S. National Institute of
        Justice (NIJ) standard 0101.06. The results showed that
        composite metal foams absorbed approximately 60–70% of the total
        kinetic energy of the projectile effectively and stopped both
        types of projectiles with less depth of penetration and
        backplate deformation than that specified in the NIJ 0101.06
        standard guidelines. Finite element analysis was performed using
        Abaqus/Explicit to study the failure mechanisms and energy
        absorption of the armor system. The results showed close
        agreement between experimental and analytical results.<br>

        <br>
        After the Fukushima nuclear plant accident occurred, hundreds of
        millions of gallons of radioactive water was left over. That
        water is still being stored, as no one knows quite what to do
        with it. <br>
        <br>
        Scientists from Texas' Rice University and Russia's Kazan
        Federal University, however, may have an answer. They've
        developed a type of carbon that can reportedly filter
        radionuclides from water.<br>
        <br>
        Known as oxidatively modified carbon (OMC), the material is made
        by treating existing carbon particles with oxidizing chemicals
        in order to increase their surface area and add oxygen molecules
        to their structure. Actually, two inexpensive types of carbon
        are used, due to their porous nature. <br>
        <br>
        One is called C-seal F, and it's already used in the oil
        industry as an ingredient in drilling fluids. The other,
        shungite, occurs naturally – mainly in Russia.<br>
        <br>
        In lab tests, OMC has reportedly been highly effective at
        absorbing radioactive metal cations such as cesium and strontium
        from contaminated water. These are two of the main elements that
        were released into the environment when the Fukushima plant
        melted down. It can also trap elements that enter waterways
        during oil extraction, including uranium, thorium and radium.<br>
        <br>
        According to the scientists, water could simply be run through
        OMC filters in a single pass, going straight into the ocean. The
        used filters would then have to been incinerated, leaving a
        relatively small amount of radioactive ash to be contained.<br>
        <br>
        The research is being led by Rice chemist James Tour and Kazan
        research professor Ayrat Dimiev. It's described in a paper

        </b><br>
        There is a constant need to develop advantageous materials for
        removing radioactive waste from aqueous systems. Here we propose
        a new carbon-based material prepared by oxidative treatment of
        various natural carbon sources. The as-prepared oxidatively
        modified carbon (OMC) has an oxygen-rich surface, and retains
        its particulate granular texture. It has relatively low cost and
        can be used in traditional filtration columns. The sorption
        ability of OMC toward several metal cations is demonstrated. It
        is especially efficient toward Cs+ cations, the species that are
        among the most difficult to remove from the waters at the
        Fukushima nuclear plant.<br>

        In some embodiments, the present disclosure pertains to methods
        of capturing contaminants (i.e., radionuclides and metals) from
        a water source by applying an oxidatively modified carbon to the
        water source. This leads to the sorption of the contaminants in
        the water source to the oxidatively modified carbon. In some
        embodiments, the methods also include a step of separating the
        oxidatively modified carbon from the water source after the
        applying step. In some embodiments, the oxidatively modified
        carbon comprises an oxidized carbon source. In some embodiments,
        the carbon source is coal. <br>
        <br>
        In some embodiments, the oxidatively modified carbon comprises

        </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
        <br>
        Telomeres are found at the end of chromosomes and are important
        for chromosome stability. Here, we describe a specific
        telomere-associated protein: TZAP (Telomeric Zinc
        finger-Associated Protein). TZAP binds preferentially to long
        telomeres that have a low concentration of shelterin complex,
        competing with the telomeric repeat binding factors TRF1 and
        TRF2. When localized at telomeres, TZAP triggers “telomere
        trimming,” a process that results in the rapid deletion of
        telomeric repeats. <br>
        <br>
        Based on these results, we propose a model for telomere length
        regulation in mammalian cells: The reduced concentration of the
        shelterin complex at long telomeres results in TZAP binding and
        initiation of telomere trimming. Binding of TZAP to long
        telomeres represents the switch that triggers telomere trimming,
        setting the upper limit of telomere length<br>

        Rocket Crafters, Inc. (RCI) announced today a U.S. patent was
        granted to co-founder, President &amp; CTO <br>
        <br>
        Ronald Jones for a method for designing and fabricating
        flawless, high-performance, safer handling fuel grains for
        hybrid rocket engines using additive manufacturing technology
        (also known as 3D printing) which will allow the fabrication of
        an inherently safe and less expensive launch vehicle with only
        two moving parts. Jones stated that 3D printing of the rocket
        combustion chamber allows RCI’s expendable motors to deliver
        small satellites to orbits at as low as half current launch
        costs...<br>
        <br>
        The patented method (US 9,453,479) uses a design and fabrication
        technique that is only possible using advanced 3D printing
        technology to boost rocket engine performance while eliminating
        the historical inconsistencies and sources of excessive
        vibration that have plagued traditionally designed hybrid
        rockets for decades.&nbsp; His patented method takes advantage
        of 3D printing’s unique ability to precisely fabricate fuel
        grains (a tubular shaped structure that dually serves as the
        rocket’s solid fuel source and combustion chamber) which
        features internal geometric patterns designed to significantly
        increase the amount of fuel that is available for combustion on
        a second-by-second basis during the rocket engine’s operation...<br>

        <br>
        A solid fuel grain suitable for use in hybrid propulsion systems
        has a generally cylindrical shape and defines a center port. The
        solid fuel grain is formed as a series of concentric layers
        arrayed around the center port. When incorporated into a rocket,
        an oxidizer is introduced into the solid fuel grain along a
        pathway defined by the center port, with combustion occurring
        along the exposed surface area of the solid fuel grain section
        adjacent to the center port. Each concentric layer has a surface
        pattern that serves to increase the surface area for combustion,
        a surface pattern that persists even as the fuel burns. To
        achieve such a construction, the concentric layers of the solid
        fuel grain are preferably manufactured using any one of several
        available freeform-fabrication machines capable of fabricating
        articles in a polymeric material suitable for a hybrid
        propulsion system.<br>

        </b>...Scientists have been experimenting with alternatives to
        conventional pesticides and thanks to a newly developed
        gene-silencing technique, farmers might be able to strengthen
        their crops' defense systems without any potential gene-altering
        fallout.<br>
        <br>
        The study, led by agricultural biotechnologist Neena Mitter at
        the University of Queensland (UQ), involves the development of
        BioClay, a spray that makes use of microscopic sheets of clay
        that contain double-stranded RNA (ribonucleic acid). This is
        released when a plant is threatened, triggering a process known
        as RNA interference (RNAi), a natural process that leads to the
        plant silencing the genes of the harmful virus. What makes this
        so fascinating is that this plant defense system is highly
        adaptive. Its responses are not one-size-fits-all but tailored
        to counter each virus that enters its system based on the
        information it receives from the latter's genome... <br>
        <br>
        "Once BioClay is applied, the plant 'thinks' it is being
        attacked by a disease or pest insect and responds by protecting
        itself from the targeted pest or disease," explains Mitter. "A
        single spray of BioClay protects the plant and then degrades,
        reducing the risk to the environment or human health." <br>

        <br>
        Topical application of pathogen-specific double-stranded RNA
        (dsRNA) for virus resistance in plants represents an attractive
        alternative to transgenic RNA interference (RNAi). However, the
        instability of naked dsRNA sprayed on plants has been a major
        challenge towards its practical application. We demonstrate that
        dsRNA can be loaded on designer, non-toxic, degradable, layered
        double hydroxide (LDH) clay nanosheets. Once loaded on LDH, the
        dsRNA does not wash off, shows sustained release and can be
        detected on sprayed leaves even 30 days after application. We
        provide evidence for the degradation of LDH, dsRNA uptake in
        plant cells and silencing of homologous RNA on topical
        application. Significantly, a single spray of dsRNA loaded on
        LDH (BioClay) afforded virus protection for at least 20 days
        when challenged on sprayed and newly emerged unsprayed leaves.
        This innovation translates nanotechnology developed for delivery
        of RNAi for human therapeutics to use in crop protection as an
        environmentally sustainable and easy to adopt topical spray.<br>

          Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease are classic age-related
          disorders characterised by the accumulation of sticky protein
          clumps that over time damage the nervous system to erode
          mobility or memory. The human suffering they cause, as well as
          the strain on healthcare, are enormous. But there is hope on
          the horizon. Chemicals extracted from the prickly pear and
          brown seaweed, two ubiquitous Mediterranean plants, have been
          elevated to possible drug candidates to combat the
          neurodegenerative disease, according to research by scientists
          from the University of Malta and the Centre National de la

          equivalent to around one year in humans, the results are
          dramatic. Interestingly, the mobility of sick flies was

          </b><br>
          A signature feature of age-related neurodegenerative
          proteinopathies is the misfolding and aggregation of proteins,
          typically amyloid-β (Aβ) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and
          α-synuclein (α-syn) in Parkinson’s disease (PD), into soluble
          oligomeric structures that are highly neurotoxic. Cellular and
          animal models that faithfully replicate the hallmark features
          of these disorders are being increasing exploited to identify
          disease-modifying compounds. Natural compounds have been
          identified as a useful source of bioactive molecules with
          promising neuroprotective capabilities. In the present report,
          we investigated whether extracts derived from two ubiquitous
          Mediterranean plants namely, the prickly pear Opuntia
          ficus-indica (EOFI) and the brown alga Padina pavonica (EPP)
          alleviate neurodegenerative phenotypes in yeast (Saccharomyces
          cerevisiae) and fly (Drosophila melanogaster) models of AD and
          PD. Pre-treatment with EPP or EOFI in the culture medium
          significantly improved the viability of yeast expressing the
          Arctic Aβ42 (E22G) mutant. Supplementing food with EOFI or EPP
          dramatically ameliorated lifespan and behavioural signs of
          flies with brain-specific expression of wild-type Aβ42 (model
          of late-onset AD) or the Arctic Aβ42 variant (model of
          early-onset AD). <br>
          <br>
          Additionally, we show that either extract prolonged the
          survival of a PD fly model based on transgenic expression of
          the human α-syn A53T mutant. Taken together, our findings
          suggest that the plant-derived extracts interfere with shared
          mechanisms of neurodegeneration in AD and PD. This notion is
          strengthened by evidence demonstrating that EOFI and to a
          greater extent EPP, while strongly inhibiting the
          fibrillogenesis of both Aβ42 and α-syn, accumulate remodelled
          oligomeric aggregates that are less effective at disrupting
          lipid membrane integrity. Our work therefore opens new avenues
          for developing therapeutic applications of these natural plant
          extracts in the treatment of amyloidogenic neurodegenerative
          disorders.<br>

              drug, could revolutionise dental treatments</i><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          A new method of stimulating the renewal of living stem cells
          in tooth pulp using an Alzheimer’s drug has been discovered by
          a team of researchers at King’s College London.<br>
          <br>
          Following trauma or an infection, the inner, soft pulp of a
          tooth can become exposed and infected. In order to protect the
          tooth from infection, a thin band of dentine is naturally
          produced and this seals the tooth pulp, but it is insufficient
          to effectively repair large cavities. Currently dentists use
          man-made cements or fillings, such as calcium and
          silicon-based products, to treat these larger cavities and
          fill holes in teeth. This cement remains in the tooth and
          fails to disintegrate, meaning that the normal mineral level
          of the tooth is never completely restored.<br>
          <br>
          However, in a paper published today in Scientific Reports,
          scientists from the Dental Institute at King’s College London
          have proven a way to stimulate the stem cells contained in the
          pulp of the tooth and generate new dentine – the mineralised
          material that protects the tooth - in large cavities,
          potentially reducing the need for fillings or cements.<br>
          <br>
          The novel, biological approach could see teeth use their
          natural ability to repair large cavities rather than using
          cements or fillings, which are prone to infections and often
          need replacing a number of times. Indeed when fillings fail or
          infection occurs, dentists have to remove and fill an area
          that is larger than what is affected, and after multiple
          treatments the tooth may eventually need to be extracted. As
          this new method encourages natural tooth repair, it could
          eliminate all of these issues, providing a more natural
          solution for patients.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Significantly, one of the small molecules used by the team to
          stimulate the renewal of the stem cells included Tideglusib,
          which has previously been used in clinical trials to treat
          neurological disorders including Alzheimer’s disease. This
          presents a real opportunity to fast-track the treatment into
          practice.<br>
          <br>
          Using biodegradable collagen sponges to deliver the treatment,
          the team applied low doses of small molecule glycogen synthase
          kinase (GSK-3) inhibitors to the tooth. They found that the
          sponge degraded over time and that new dentine replaced it,
          leading to complete, natural repair. Collagen sponges are
          commercially-available and clinically-approved, again adding
          to the potential of the treatment’s swift pick-up and use in
          dental clinics.<br>
          <br>
          Lead author of the study, Professor Paul Sharpe from King’s
          College London said: “The simplicity of our approach makes it
          ideal as a clinical dental product for the natural treatment
          of large cavities, by providing both pulp protection and
          restoring dentine.<br>
          <br>
          “In addition, using a drug that has already been tested in
          clinical trials for Alzheimer’s disease provides a real
          opportunity to get this dental treatment quickly into
          clinics.”<br>

          </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
          <br>
          The restoration of dentine lost in deep caries lesions in
          teeth is a routine and common treatment that involves the use
          of inorganic cements based on calcium or silicon-based mineral
          aggregates. Such cements remain in the tooth and fail to
          degrade and thus normal mineral volume is never completely
          restored. Here we describe a novel, biological approach to
          dentine restoration that stimulates the natural formation of
          reparative dentine via the mobilisation of resident stem cells
          in the tooth pulp. Biodegradable, clinically-approved collagen
          sponges are used to deliver low doses of small molecule
          glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3) antagonists that promote the
          natural processes of reparative dentine formation to
          completely restore dentine. Since the carrier sponge is
          degraded over time, dentine replaces the degraded sponge
          leading to a complete, effective natural repair. This simple,
          rapid natural tooth repair process could thus potentially
          provide a new approach to clinical tooth restoration.<br>

              into a virus killer</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Innovative improvement on surgical masks will make them
          effective by empowering them to kill viruses<br>
          <br>
          A University of Alberta engineering researcher has developed a
          new way to treat common surgical masks so they are capable of
          trapping and killing airborne viruses. His research findings
          appear in the prestigious journal Scientific Reports,
          published by Nature Publishing Group.<br>
          <br>
          Hyo-Jick Choi, a professor in the University of Alberta
          Department of Chemical and Materials <br>
          <br>
          Engineering, noticed that many people wear a simple
          surgical-style mask for protection during outbreaks of
          influenza or other potentially deadly viruses such as severe
          acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory
          syndrome (MERS).<br>
          <br>
          Trouble is, the masks weren't designed to prevent the spread
          of viruses."Surgical masks were originally designed to protect
          the wearer from infectious droplets in clinical settings, but
          it doesn't help much to prevent the spread of respiratory
          diseases such as SARS or MERS or influenza," says Choi.<br>
          <br>
          Airborne pathogens like influenza are transmitted in aerosol
          droplets when we cough or sneeze. The masks may well trap the
          virus-laden droplets but the virus is still infectious on the
          mask. Merely handling the mask opens up new avenues for
          infection. Even respirators designed to protect individuals
          from viral aerosols have the same shortcoming--viruses trapped
          in respirators still pose risks for infection and
          transmission.<br>
          <br>
          Masks capable of killing viruses would save lives, especially
          in an epidemic or pandemic situation. During the 2014-2015
          season nearly 8,000 Canadians were hospitalized with the flu.
          That same year, deaths related to influenza in Canada reached
          an all-time high of nearly 600.<br>
          <br>
          Knowing that the masks are inexpensive and commonly used, Choi
          and his research team went about exploring ways to improve the
          mask's filter. And this is where a problem he is struggling
          with in one field of research--the development of oral
          vaccines like a pill or a lozenge--became a solution in
          another area.<br>
          <br>
          A major hurdle in the development of oral vaccines is that
          when liquid solutions dry, crystals form and destroy the virus
          used in vaccines, rendering the treatment useless. In a nifty
          bit of engineering judo, Choi flipped the problem on its head
          and turned crystallization into a bug buster, using it as a
          tool to kill active viruses.<br>
          <br>
          Choi and his team developed a salt formulation and applied it
          to the filters, in the hope that salt crystals would
          "deactivate" the influenza virus.<br>
          <br>
          The mechanics of simple chemistry make the treatment work.
          When an aerosol droplet carrying the influenza virus contacts
          the treated filter, the droplet absorbs salt on the filter.
          The virus is exposed to continually increasing concentrations
          of salt. As the droplet evaporates, the virus suffers fatal
          physical damage when the salt returns to its crystalized
          state.<br>
          <br>
          While developing solid vaccines, Choi observed that sugar used
          for stabilizing the vaccine during the drying process
          crystalizes as it dries out. When crystals form, sharp edges
          and spikes take shape and they physically destroy the virus
          vaccine.<br>
          <br>
          "We realized that we could use that to our advantage to
          improve surgical masks," said Choi.<br>
          <br>
          In a series of experiments and tests at the University of
          Alberta and in the Department of Medical Zoology at the Kyung
          Hee University School of Medicine in Seoul, South Korea, the
          team arrived at a perfect treatment that improves the efficacy
          of the fibre filter inside the masks.<br>
          <br>
          By using a safe substance (table salt) to improve an existing,
          approved product, Choi sees very few roadblocks to
          implementing the innovation.<br>
          <br>
          The research was funded by the University of Alberta. Choi has
          been awarded a provisional patent for the development of virus
          deactivation systems based on the salt-crystallization
          mechanism.<br>

          </b><br>
          Aerosolized pathogens are a leading cause of respiratory
          infection and transmission. Currently used protective measures
          pose potential risk of primary/secondary infection and
          transmission. Here, we report the development of a universal,
          reusable virus deactivation system by functionalization of the
          main fibrous filtration unit of surgical mask with sodium
          chloride salt. The salt coating on the fiber surface dissolves
          upon exposure to virus aerosols and recrystallizes during
          drying, destroying the pathogens. When tested with tightly
          sealed sides, salt-coated filters showed remarkably higher
          filtration efficiency than conventional mask filtration layer,
          and 100% survival rate was observed in mice infected with
          virus penetrated through salt-coated filters. Viruses captured
          on salt-coated filters exhibited rapid infectivity loss
          compared to gradual decrease on bare filters. Salt-coated
          filters proved highly effective in deactivating influenza
          viruses regardless of subtypes and following storage in harsh
          environmental conditions. Our results can be applied in
          obtaining a broad-spectrum, airborne pathogen prevention
          device in preparation for epidemic and pandemic of respiratory
          diseases...<br>
          <br>
          <b>Methods</b><b><br>
          </b><b>Bare and salt-coated filter samples preparation</b><br>
          <br>
          The commercial surgical masks had a three-ply structure. The
          middle layer is the filter media, whereas the inner and outer
          layers provide support and protect the filter against wear and
          tear. The metal nose clips and elastic ear loops were removed
          and circular samples (radius: 3 cm) were cut from the masks.
          The PP filters (middle layer) were isolated by removing the
          inner and outer protective layers (bare filters, Filterbare).
          The coating solution was prepared by dissolving sodium
          chloride (NaCl; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in filtered DI
          water (0.22 μm pore size; Corning, Tewksbury, MA) under
          stirring at 400 rpm and 90 °C, followed by the addition of
          Tween 20 (Fisher Scientific) to a final concentration of
          29.03 w/v% of NaCl and 1 v/v% of Tween 20. To obtain the
          salt-coated filters, the mask bare PP filters were pre-wet to
          contain approximately 600 μL of coating solution by incubating
          overnight at room temperature. Any remaining dry areas were
          removed by applying gentle strokes with tweezers to the
          filters while immersed in the coating solution. Subsequently,
          the filters were deposited in the desired volume of coating
          solution (0, 100, 300, 600, 900 and 1200 μL, of which
          corresponding membranes are abbreviated as Filterwet,
          Filterwet+100μL, Filterwet+300μL, Filterwet+600μL,
          Filterwet+900μL, and Filterwet+1200μL, respectively) on petri
          dishes (60 × 15 mm; Fisher Scientific) to control the amount
          of NaCl per unit area and dried in an oven (Isotemp Incubator,
          Fisher Scientific) at 37 °C for 1 day....<br>

          The invention concerns the deactivation of HIV and other
          viruses which have a high chemical affinity with multivalent
          heavy metal. The virus proteins are cationized and made into
          virucides and their chemically-active amino or carboxyl groups
          react with a monovalent cation of the first main group
          of&nbsp; the "periodic system" that is higher in the
          electrochemical series. The chemically-bonded heavy metals are
          converted into a heavy solution through chemical reactions,
          preferably into a "chelate complex". The use of given
          concentrations of a monovalent metal cation in the form of a
          carbonate or hydroxide makes possible the cationization of
          virus proteins and the deactivation of viruses as well as the
          suppression of the immobilization of the virus spikes from the
          heavy metals chemically bonded to them. Thus there is the
          basis for the healing of virus infections of various kinds and
          the requirement for the preparation of corresponding vaccinal
          substances is created.<br>

          ...Researchers in the UK have announced a new laser therapy

          Called Vascular-Targeted Photodynamic therapy (VTP), the new

          called WST11, into the bloodstream via fiber lasers that are
          inserted into the prostate gland. The laser then activates the
          drug to destroy the tumor tissue. Interestingly, WST11 is
          derived from deep-sea bacteria that have evolved a mechanism
          to survive in the dark by efficiently converting whatever
          little light it can get into energy. Researchers were able to

          array that can identify the chemical signatures of 17
          different diseases, possibly bringing us closer to the day
          when doctors might be able to use a medical tricorder a la
          Star Trek to instantly diagnose a patient's conditions...<br>
          <br>
          "Just as each of us has a unique fingerprint that
          distinguishes us from others, each disease has a chemical
          signature that distinguishes it from other diseases and from a
          normal state of health," explains lead researcher Hossam
          Haick, an Israeli nanotech expert whose name is synonymous
          with disease-detecting sensors. "These odor signatures are
          what enables us to identify the diseases using the technology
          that we developed."<br>

          We report on an artificially intelligent nanoarray based on
          molecularly modified gold nanoparticles and a random network
          of single-walled carbon nanotubes for noninvasive diagnosis
          and classification of a number of diseases from exhaled
          breath. The performance of this artificially intelligent
          nanoarray was clinically assessed on breath samples collected
          from 1404 subjects having one of 17 different disease
          conditions included in the study or having no evidence of any
          disease (healthy controls). Blind experiments showed that 86%
          accuracy could be achieved with the artificially intelligent
          nanoarray, allowing both detection and discrimination between
          the different disease conditions examined. Analysis of the
          artificially intelligent nanoarray also showed that each
          disease has its own unique breathprint, and that the presence
          of one disease would not screen out others. <br>
          <br>
          Cluster analysis showed a reasonable classification power of
          diseases from the same categories. The effect of confounding
          clinical and environmental factors on the performance of the
          nanoarray did not significantly alter the obtained results.
          The diagnosis and classification power of the nanoarray was
          also validated by an independent analytical technique, i.e.,
          gas chromatography linked with mass spectrometry. This
          analysis found that 13 exhaled chemical species, called
          volatile organic compounds, are associated with certain
          diseases, and the composition of this assembly of volatile
          organic compounds differs from one disease to another.
          Overall, these findings could contribute to one of the most
          important criteria for successful health intervention in the
          modern era, viz. easy-to-use, inexpensive (affordable), and
          miniaturized tools that could also be used for personalized
          screening, diagnosis, and follow-up of a number of diseases,
          which can clearly be extended by further development.<br>

          <br>
          Lluís Gil and Xavier Cañavate, researchers and professors at
          the Terrassa School of Industrial, Aerospace and Audiovisual
          Engineering (ESEIAAT) of the Universitat Politècnica de
          Catalunya (UPC), in collaboration with the companies COMSA and
          Gestión Medioambiental de Neumáticos (GMN), have created a new
          material from textile fibres of used tyres. This product
          incorporates a tyre component that was previously not reused.
          <br>
          <br>
          Vehicle tyres are essentially made of three materials: latex,
          fabric and steel fibres. The only thing that could not be
          reused up to now was the fabric, which ended up in landfills
          or incinerators.<br>
          <br>
          Lluís Gil, of the Laboratory for Technological Innovation in
          Structures and Materials (LITEM), and Xavier Cañavate, of the
          POLQUITEX research group, both on the UPC's Terrassa Campus,
          in collaboration with the companies COMSA and GMN, have
          developed a new textile material from disused tires.
          ProfessorTeresa Vidal, of the UPC's Paper Engineering Research
          Group (CELBIOTECH), also participated in the project.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Recycling and competitiveness</b><br>
          <br>
          One of the strengths of the project is that it adapts the
          final product to customer requirements and supplies it in the
          form of sacks or panels. After several tests, the key to
          obtaining the new material was the combination of three
          components: fibres, recycled paper pulp and white glue. The
          new material has proven to be very effective in the
          construction sector and for railway projects because it is a
          good insulator.<br>
          <br>
          According to Lluís Gil, “this new material is technically
          equivalent to the rock wool and glass wool materials
          previously used for thermal and acoustic insulation of
          buildings, but it is cheaper”.<br>
          <br>
          Xavier Cañavate says “our material can reuse millions of tons
          of fibres that were previously sent to landfills at the end of
          the tyres' life, thus saving energy and CO2 emissions. It also
          incorporates recycled paper pulp, which is very difficult to
          reuse”.<br>
          <br>
          The new material was created thanks to the participation of
          the companies COMSA and GMN and funding of €130,000 from the
          INNPACTO programme of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and
          Competitiveness. In addition, the project has generated eight
          bachelor's theses and a master's thesis.<br>

          </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Small-winged drones can face highly varied aerodynamic
          requirements, such as high manoeuvrability for flight among
          obstacles and high wind resistance for constant ground speed
          against strong headwinds that cannot all be optimally
          addressed by a single aerodynamic profile. Several bird
          species solve this problem by changing the shape of their
          wings to adapt to the different aerodynamic requirements. <br>
          <br>
          Here, we describe a novel morphing wing design composed of
          artificial feathers that can rapidly modify its geometry to
          fulfil different aerodynamic requirements. We show that a
          fully deployed configuration enhances manoeuvrability while a
          folded configuration offers low drag at high speeds and is
          beneficial in strong headwinds. We also show that asymmetric
          folding of the wings can be used for roll control of the
          drone. The aerodynamic performance of the morphing wing is
          characterized in simulations, in wind tunnel measurements and
          validated in outdoor flights with a small drone.<br>

          <br>
          &nbsp;Lowly sawdust, the sawmill waste that's sometimes tossed
          onto home garage floors to soak up oil spilled by amateur
          mechanics, could receive some new-found respect thanks to
          science.<br>
          <br>
          Researchers at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest
          National Laboratory have chemically modified sawdust to make
          it exceptionally oil-attracting and buoyant, characteristics
          that are ideal for cleaning oil spills in the icy, turbulent
          waters of the Arctic. The nontoxic material absorbs up to five
          times its weight in oil and stays afloat for at least four
          months.<br>
          <br>
          "Most of today's oil remediation materials are designed for
          warm water use," said PNNL microbiologist George Bonheyo, who
          leads the modified sawdust's development from PNNL's Marine
          Sciences Laboratory.<br>
          <br>
          "But as ice retreats in the Arctic Sea, fossil fuel developers
          are looking north, and we need new oil spill response methods
          that perform well in extreme conditions," added Bonheyo, who
          also holds a joint appointment in bioengineering with
          Washington State University.<br>
          <br>
          "The chance of an oil spill in the Arctic is real," said
          fellow PNNL microbiologist Robert Jeters, who is also part of
          the project. "We hope materials like our modified sawdust can
          help if an accident happens."<br>
          <br>
          <b>Fire &amp; ice</b><b><br>
          </b><b> </b><br>
          Containing oil spills in cold waters is especially tricky, as
          bobbing ice chunks push oil below the water's surface, making
          it difficult to collect. The same goes for rough waters, whose
          tall, clashing waves disperse oil.<br>
          <br>
          The modified saw dust pulls double duty. Beyond absorbing oil,
          it also enhances another approach to combatting oil spills —
          controlled burns. If changing weather or tides move spilled
          oil toward a sensitive area fast, oil can be burned before it
          can cause further harm. Called in-situ burning, the practice
          can significantly reduce the amount of oil in water and
          minimize its adverse environmental effects.<br>
          <br>
          Bonheyo and his team looked to develop an environmentally
          friendly and inexpensive material that floats despite rough or
          freezing waters and can support in-situ burning. Not wanting
          to create more pollution if emergency responders can't
          retrieve oil cleanup material, Bonheyo's team considered other
          natural ingredients like rice hulls and silica. But they
          ultimately found their winner in a fine dust called wood
          flour. A woodworking byproduct, wood flour is often used to
          make wood composites.<br>
          <br>
          To turn the dust into a thirsty oil mop, researchers
          chemically attach components of vegetable oil onto the
          material's surface. These attachments make the modified
          material oil-grabbing and water-shunning. The final product is
          a light, fluffy, bleached powder. The team is also trying out
          adding tiny, oil-eating microbes — fungi and bacteria — to the
          powder's surface so any left-behind material could naturally
          break down oil over time.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Just a sprinkle</b><br>
          <br>
          Applying the modified sawdust is simple: sprinkle a thin layer
          over oil on the water's surface. The material immediately
          starts soaking up oil, creating a concentrated and solid slick
          that stays afloat thanks to the material's buoyant nature. The
          oil-soaked material can either be burned or retrieved.<br>
          <br>
          The team is using PNNL's unique Arctic simulation lab in
          Sequim, Washington to evaluate the material in icy waters. The
          facility is a customized shipping container that cools down to
          as low as 5 degrees Fahrenheit, which prompts researchers to
          don snowmobile suits and ski masks while they work. Ice slush
          forms on the surface of water that circulates inside a
          290-gallon raceway pond placed inside the bitterly cold lab
          space. Oil is spilled on the slushy surface, followed by a
          sprinkle of modifiedsawdust. Tests have shown the material's
          water-repellent nature prevents ice from forming on it,
          allowing it to soak up oil and remain at the surface.<br>
          <br>
          Researchers are also testing how well the material performs in
          controlled burns. They conducted initial burns this fall at
          the U.S. Coast Guard and Naval Research Laboratory's Joint
          Maritime Test Facility near Mobile, Alabama. Burn tests
          continue today at PNNL's Marine Science Laboratory. Early
          results indicate a small amount of material enables burning of
          both thin and thick layers of spilled oil.<br>
          <br>
          In the coming months, PNNL will further evaluate the modified
          sawdust. The material will need additional testing and
          approval by multiple agencies before it can be used at actual
          oil spills.<br>
          <br>
          PNNL is developing the material for the Department of
          Interior's Bureau of Safety of Environmental Enforcement. BSEE

          ensuring environmental protection related to the offshore
          energy industry, primarily oil and natural gas on the U.S.
          Outer Continental Shelf.<br>

          Magnets instead of antibiotics could provide a possible new
          treatment method for blood infection. <br>
          <br>
          This involves the blood of patients being mixed with magnetic
          iron particles, which bind the bacteria to them after which
          they are removed from the blood using magnets. The initial
          laboratory tests at Empa in St. Gallen have been successful,
          and seem promising.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;Blood poisoning is still fatal in more than 50% of
          cases, but can be cured if treated at an early stage. The
          highest priority is therefore to act quickly. For this reason,
          doctors usually administer antibiotics even in the event of a
          suspicion of blood poisoning, without first ascertaining
          whether it is actually a bacterial sepsis, which in turn
          greatly increases the risk of resistance to antibiotics
          developing. It is therefore important to identify and develop
          a fast and effective therapy, if possible without the need to
          use antibiotics.<br>
          <br>
          An antibody for everything<br>
          <br>
          Empa researcher Inge Herrmann and her team are developing a
          solution in collaboration with modelling expert Marco Lattuada
          from the Adolphe Merkle Institute&nbsp; and doctors from the
          Harvard Medical School. <br>
          <br>
          The idea for the treatment is the magnetic purification of
          blood. The principle is, at least in theory, quite
          straightforward. Iron particles are coated with an antibody
          that detects and binds the harmful bacteria in the blood. As
          soon as the iron particles are attached to the bacteria, they
          are removed from the blood magnetically.<br>
          <br>
          However, there is (still) a small catch: So far, it has only
          been possible to coat the iron particles with antibodies that
          recognise one type of bacteria – but many&nbsp; different
          types of bacteria may be involved, depending on the species
          causing the blood poisoning. Using blood analysis, doctors
          must therefore first determine which bacteria is causing the
          poisoning before the appropriate antibodies can be used. "This
          blood analysis is time-consuming and time plays a vital role
          in the treatment of blood poisoning," explains Herrmann. This
          is also the reason for magnetic dialysis rarely having been
          used to date.<br>
          <br>
          But a team at the Harvard Medical School led by Gerald Pier
          has now developed an antibody that can bind almost all the
          bacteria that can trigger blood poisoning - so if there is a
          suspicion of sepsis, the magnetic treatment could be started
          immediately, regardless of which pathogen is in the blood. <br>

          A Wyss Institute team has engineered a method for directly
          bonding biocompatible chitosan materials to living tissues,
          which could be used to quickly patch life threatening wounds <br>
          <br>
          Chitosan, a biomaterial derived from the chitin shells of
          crustaceans and insects, has already been developed by
          scientists at Harvard’s Wyss Institute for Biologically
          Inspired Engineering into an environmentally-friendly and
          fully biodegradable substitute for plastic. It is only natural
          that the team, led by Wyss Institute Founding Director Donald
          Ingber, has also become interested in extending chitosan’s
          usefulness into the clinical realm.<br>
          <br>
          “What’s good for the environment is also good for us,” said
          Javier Fernandez, who first developed a chitosan bioplastic
          called ‘Shrilk’&nbsp; with Ingber back in 2014.<br>
          <br>
          Now Ingber and Fernandez have unveiled a new study in the
          journal Tissue Engineering that demonstrates biodegradable
          chitosan bioplastics can be used to bond bodily tissues to
          repair wounds or even to hold implanted medical devices in
          place. As chitosan is already approved for clinical use and it
          has antimicrobial properties, the approach could one day be
          utilized to immediately seal tissue tears or other serious
          injuries, preventing infection from setting in before a
          patient can be moved to a hospital for more in-depth care.<br>
          <br>
          “This work really spans the entire mission of the Wyss, as we
          have developed a biomaterial that could be used in sustainable
          consumer products and packaging or, as we now show, be adapted
          for clinical uses,” said Fernandez, Ph.D., the first author on
          the new study, who is a former Wyss Institute Postdoctoral
          Fellow and is currently an Assistant Professor at Singapore
          University of Technology and Design. “The material is
          non-toxic and biodegradable, leaving behind no trace once it
          has served its purpose.”<br>
          <br>
          To adapt chitosan to seal wounds and surgical incisions,
          Ingber and Fernandez searched for a way to quickly and tightly
          bond chitosan materials to living tissues.&nbsp; They zeroed
          in on transglutaminase (TG), a naturally occurring enzyme
          found in the body – where it keeps skin strong and strengthens
          blood clots – that has also been adopted to bond proteins
          together during commercial food processing.<br>
          <br>
          “As we started thinking about going in vivo, we faced the
          challenge of how to adhere chitosan to living tissues,” said
          Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., who is senior author on the new study and
          in addition to directing the Wyss Institute is Judah Folkman
          Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and
          the Vascular Biology Program at Boston Children’s Hospital as
          well as Professor of Bioengineering at Harvard’s John A.
          Paulson School of Engineering an Applied Sciences. “We
          explored using different formulations of transglutaminase to
          bond various forms of chitosan materials, including sheets,
          foams and sprays, to many different types of tissues.”<br>
          <br>
          A sheet of chitosan may be applied with a transglutaminase
          powder to patch wounds, as the team demonstrated using an ex
          vivo porcine intestine with a large hole in it. A pressure
          test revealed that the chitosan patch was even stronger than
          the native intestinal tissue.<br>
          <br>
          For the spray, a stream of liquid chitosan and liquid
          transglutaminase combine during application to quickly bond
          chitosan to tissue and close wounds. The team used this
          approach to seal a porcine lung that had sustained a puncture
          wound while it was cyclically insufflated with air to mimic
          inspiration and expiration. The spray application could also
          be useful for covering large areas of vulnerable tissue, like
          might be found on someone whose skin had sustained serious
          burns.<br>
          <br>
          To treat even larger and more traumatic wounds like those that
          might occur on the battlefield or during a motor vehicle
          accident, Ingber and Fernandez formulated a chitosan foam that
          could potentially be used to fill and seal larger wound
          cavities until a patient can be transported to a hospital for
          surgical intervention.<br>
          <br>
          The team’s findings also suggest that their approach could be
          tailored to bond inorganic surfaces – which make up crucial
          components of many different kinds of biomedical implants and
          microfluidic devices – to tissue or chitosan.<br>
          <br>
          “Right now our approach is very general, but we could
          theoretically take this concept and adapt it into almost any
          form imaginable for a broad number of possible uses,” said
          Fernandez.<br>
          <br>
          Looking ahead, the team hopes to develop an array of specific
          applications through collaboration with clinical partners.<br>

          </b><b>ABSTRACT</b><br>
          <br>
          Natural biomaterials, such as chitosan and collagen, are
          useful for biomedical applications because they are
          biocompatible, mechanically robust, and biodegradable, but it
          is difficult to rapidly and tightly bond them to living
          tissues. In this study, we demonstrate that the microbial
          transglutaminase (mTG), can be used to rapidly (&lt;5 min)
          bond chitosan and collagen biomaterials to the surfaces of
          hepatic, cardiac, and dermal tissues, as well as to
          functionalized polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) materials that are
          used in medical products. The mTG-bonded chitosan patches
          effectively sealed intestinal perforations, and a newly
          developed two-component mTG-bonded chitosan spray effectively
          repaired ruptures in a breathing lung when tested ex vivo. The
          mechanical strength of mTG-catalyzed chitosan adhesive bonds
          were comparable to those generated by commonly used surgical
          glues. These results suggest that mTG preparations may be
          broadly employed to bond various types of organic materials,
          including polysaccharides, proteins, and functionalized
          inorganic polymers to living tissues, which may open new
          avenues for biomedical engineering, medical device
          integration, and tissue repair.<br>

              tyres finds a cleaner diesel blend</b><br>
          </div>
          <b> </b><br>
          Old tyres can be completely recycled into lower emission
          diesel engine oil, instead of being dumped in dangerous,
          highly flammable stockpiles that become breeding grounds for
          malaria and dengue-carrying mosquitoes.<br>
          <br>
          QUT mechanical engineers tested the oil extracted from old
          tyres in a process developed by Australian company Green
          Distillation Tecnologies (GDT).<br>
          <br>
          QUT’s Professor Richard Brown and PhD student Farhad Hossain
          tested the oil’s emissions and output at QUT's Biofuel Engine
          Research Facility.<br>
          <br>
          Professor Brown said that when the oil was blended with diesel
          it was found to produce a fuel with reduced emissions and no
          loss of engine performance.<br>
          <br>
          “Globally, 1.5 billion tonnes of tyres are discarded each
          year. Australia, alone, will generate 55 million disused tyres
          a year by 2020," Professor Brown said.<br>
          <br>
          “Getting rid of old tyres in an environment-friendly way is a
          universal nightmare.<br>
          <br>
          “Stockpiles of used tyres around the world are a health
          hazard, as demonstrated by the recent Broadmeadows fire in
          Victoria, which was difficult to put out and generated huge
          amounts of toxic smoke.”<br>
          <br>
          Mr Farhad said the QUT engineering team, including process
          engineer Dr Tom Rainey and air-quality expert Professor Zoran
          Ristovski, performed rigorous tests on the oil.<br>
          <br>
          “We tested the oil which GDT produces from both recycled
          natural and synthetic rubber tyres in 10 per cent and 20 per
          cent diesel blends,” Mr Farhad said.<br>
          <br>
          “We tested the tyre oil blends in a turbocharged, common rail,
          direct injection, six-cylinder engine in the Biofuel Engine
          Research Facility at QUT.<br>
          <br>
          “The engine is typical of engine types used in the transport
          industry.<br>
          <br>
          “Our experiments were performed with a constant speed and four
          different engine loads of 25, 50, 75 and 100 per cent of full
          load.<br>
          <br>
          “We found a 30 per cent reduction in nitrogen oxide which
          contributes to photochemical smog, and lower particle mass
          which means fewer problems for emission treatment systems.”<br>
          <br>
          GDT chief&nbsp; operating officer Trevor Bayley said the oil
          could also be used as a heating fuel or further refined into
          automotive or aviation jet fuel.<br>
          <br>
          “The process recycles end-of-life tyres into oil, carbon and
          steel, leaving nothing wasted and even uses some of the
          recovered oil as the heat source,” Mr Bayley said.<br>
          <br>
          “Carbon is the most common recovered ingredient and the steel
          rim and framework is the third most common ingredient, while
          the oil is the most valuable.<br>
          <br>
          “We are delighted at the findings of the QUT research as it
          will help us promote the sustainable use for end-of-life&nbsp;
          tyres.<br>
          <br>
          “The potential of this source of biofuel feedstock is immense,
          and it is more sustainable than other bio-oils from plants
          such as corn, or algae.<br>
          <br>
          “A recycled 10kg car tyre yields 4 litres of oil, 1.5kg of
          steel and 4 kg of carbon,, and a 70kg truck tyre provides 28
          litres of oil, 11kg of steel and 28kg of carbon.<br>
          <br>
          “GDT plans to have the first fully operational commercial
          plant delivering eight million litres of oil a year from
          mid-2017, followed by a world-first mining tyre processing
          plant in either Qld or WA.”<br>

              Technology First</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Green Distillation Technologies has achieved an Australian
          world technological breakthrough by effectively and profitably
          recycling end of life car and truck tyres (ELTs) into saleable
          commodities of oil, carbon and steel.<br>
          <br>
          End of life car and truck tyres are a blight on the
          environment ever since they were invented over a century ago,
          because until now no means had been found to effectively and
          economically recycle them.<br>
          <br>
          Grinding up old tyres to make crumbs or flakes is not a means
          of recycling tyres as the rubber has not been changed and
          there is a limit to how much of this material can be used for
          kindergarten playgrounds and soccer fields and using it as a
          furnace fuel in Asia creates noxious greenhouse damaging
          emissions.<br>
          <br>
          As well as the environmental problem caused by dumps of old
          tyres or illegally discarding them in bushland and waterways,
          after rain they become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and a
          source of such dangerous diseases as Dengue and Ross River
          Fever.<br>
          <br>
          However, using a technique known as destructive distillation,
          Green Distillation Technologies is able to convert this wasted
          resource and an environmental hazard into high demand valuable
          raw materials.The process is emission free and the recycled
          oil is used as the heat source for the production process.<br>
          <br>
          The GDT Tyre Recycling Process – How It Works<br>
          <br>
          Destructive Distillation is the name GDT gives to their tyre
          recycling process which is developed from basic chemistry, the
          genius of Technical Director Denis Randall and his thirty five
          years of study and experimentation into organic waste streams.
          As a result GDT has developed the knowledge of getting the
          chemical reaction to occur.<br>
          <br>
          The process begins by loading whole end of life tyres into a
          process chamber, which is evacuated of air and sealed. In the
          initial steps no further processing of the tyres, such as
          chopping or crumbing is required.<br>
          <br>
          Heat is applied, which acts as a catalyst for the chemical
          reaction, which sees the tyre destructed into different
          compounds, one of which is collected and condensed into
          ‘manufactured’ oil. At the end of the process and the chemical
          reaction is over, the carbon and steel can be extracted cooled
          and separated.<br>

          PNNL researchers saw for the first time a phenomenon that was
          theorized more than 20 years ago. Shown here is a PNNL
          illustration of the phenomenon, "solvent cavitation under
          solvo-phobic confinement," which PNNL researchers saw occur
          with carbon-rich nanorods they mistakenly created. PNNL's
          viewing of the phenomenon involved liquid spontaneously
          evaporating after being confined within tiny spaces in between
          touching nanorods.<br>
          <br>
          RICHLAND, Wash. – After their nanorods were accidentally
          created when an experiment didn't go as planned, the
          researchers gave the microscopic, unplanned spawns of science
          a closer look.Chemist Satish Nune was inspecting the solid,
          carbon-rich nanorods with a vapor analysis instrument when he
          noticed the nanorods mysteriously lost weight as humidity
          increased. Thinking the instrument had malfunctioned, Nune and
          his colleagues moved on to another tool, a high-powered
          microscope.They jumped as they saw an unknown fluid
          unexpectedly appear between bunches of the tiny sticks and
          ooze out. Video recorded under the microscope is shaky at the
          beginning, as they quickly moved the view finder to capture
          the surprising event again.<br>
          <br>
          The team at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest
          National Laboratory would go on to view the same phenomenon
          more than a dozen times. Immediately after expelling the
          fluid, the nanorods' weight decreased by about half, causing
          the researchers to scratch their heads even harder.<br>
          <br>
          A paper published today in Nature Nanotechnology describes the
          physical processes behind this spectacle, which turned out to
          be the first experimental viewing of a phenomenon theorized
          20-some years ago. The discovery could lead to a large range
          of real-world applications, including low-energy water
          harvesting and purification for the developing world, and
          fabric that automatically pulls sweat away from the body and
          releases it as a vapor.<br>

          </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Three water adsorption–desorption mechanisms are common in
          inorganic materials: chemisorption, which can lead to the
          modification of the first coordination sphere; simple
          adsorption, which is reversible; and condensation, which is
          irreversible. Regardless of the sorption mechanism, all known
          materials exhibit an isotherm in which the quantity of water
          adsorbed increases with an increase in relative humidity.
          Here, we show that carbon-based rods can adsorb water at low
          humidity and spontaneously expel about half of the adsorbed
          water when the relative humidity exceeds a 50–80% threshold.
          The water expulsion is reversible, and is attributed to the
          interfacial forces between the confined rod surfaces. At wide
          rod spacings, a monolayer of water can form on the surface of
          the carbon-based rods, which subsequently leads to
          condensation in the confined space between adjacent rods. As
          the relative humidity increases, adjacent rods (confining
          surfaces) in the bundles are drawn closer together via
          capillary forces. At high relative humidity, and once the size
          of the confining surfaces has decreased to a critical length,
          a surface-induced evaporation phenomenon known as solvent
          cavitation occurs and water that had condensed inside the
          confined area is released as a vapour.<br>

          </b> Her conclusions:<br>
          <br>
          - For the NASA panel, they exhibited "guarded" body language
          about the idea of a brown dwarf, but showed no signs of stress
          about any imminent threat, ie Planet X. So they literally knew
          of nothing to worry about.<br>
          <br>
          - For Greer, she says he tries to make himself appear bigger
          and more important than he actually is, basically exhibiting
          narcissistic behavior. He has collected a lot of public
          information and then constructed additional stories around it.
          Her conclusion is to assume that he is just "telling you a
          story."<br>
          <br>
          - For Corey Goode, she concludes that he seems to truly
          believe what he's saying based on his body language, but that
          this doesn't necessarily mean what he says is true. So he
          could be a MILAB or he could just be coo-coo for Coco Puffs. I
          know from personal experience that Goode is not above lying so
          I wonder if he's not been coached in some way considering the
          "career" he has chosen for himself.<br>

          -bitcoin will top $425 3 times before taking off.<br>
          -Bitcoin will slice through the $500's.<br>
          -Chinese flock to Bitcoin.<br>
          Nearly a month ago his predictions said the following:<br>
          <br>
          -Bitcoin will begin to take off July.12th moving from a solid
          $688 to $1000 by the End of the Year.<br>
          -when it touches $1000 for the first time it will drop down to
          $900.<br>
          -When it slices through $1000, the trip to $2000 will be
          talked about regarding how fast it went.<br>
          <br>
          Well, today - January 1st, 2017 we recorded $1000 Bitcoin.
          According to his predictions it will fall to $900 and than we
          will see $2000 Bitcoin in 2017. This recent video by Clif

          Clif High believes all humans are psychic but only a few
          realise it. All others unconsciously "leak" their psychic
          predictions out on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and other places
          online through things they post. High's "web bot" crawls the
          internet for these psychic premonitions. That is what this
          post is based on.<br>
          Edit: For example, High predicts a major earthquake in
          continental American in 2017, based on internet chatter.
          Geologists, meanwhile, can barely predict earthquakes a few
          hours ahead of time.Never sell bitcoin until you don't need to

          The scum who run the NZ government use 1080 poison dropped
          from helicopters over huge tracts of wilderness with the
          stated aim of killing off all deer, as they are an introduced
          species, as well as possums. What happens is that they kill
          off the entire ecosystem. From a conservation viewpoint this
          makes absolutely no sense at all --- the only plausible reason
          is to eliminiate all wild sources of food. Why? So that when
          the rats flee to NZ the locals, the few who will not take
          kindly to their arrival, will have nothing to eat when they go
          bush into wilderness areas, and they risk death from eating
          and in some cases drinking from the 1080 poisoned ecosystem.
          If you think the 1080 will break down, it won't do for a long
          time under normal circumstances in the wilderness ... and
          anything that dies keeps on poisoning the ecosystem anyway.<br>
          <br>
          Deer head for water when dying from 1080, the eels eat them
          and die, the freshwater crayfish eat the eels and die ...
          everything dies. Save the native birds you reckon? No, most
          die. NZ has been taken over by scum getting ready for the
          influx of their mates. Airfields have been built at taxpayer
          expense. And most NZers are too stupid now to understand, let
          alone do anything to stop this. (See youtube "poisoning

          </b> ...Russia has already eclipsed Saudi Arabia as the
          world’s biggest oil producer. This means the big Saudi oil
          fields are drying up. And the government knows that, but they
          can’t tell us this because it’ll create a panic. One would
          think this would motivate the United States to get cozier with
          Russia. However, what the United States government fears is
          that if we do that, Russia will twig to the motive for it, and
          realize it has the United States over a barrel. An oil barrel.
          At which point the price goes up. Not to mention extracting
          concessions in the global sphere of influence.<br>
          <br>
          Thus, what the United States is playing at here is trying to
          install a different “regime” in Russia. That being, one that
          Vladimir Putin does not control or have any influence over.
          This is easier said than done and the United States knows
          this. But the stakes are quite a bit higher than controlling
          the dwindling oil supply in the Middle East. Russia is
          obviously in control of most of the world’s remaining oil
          reserves. The United States needs a puppet regime in Russia to
          have access to that oil without paying the correct market
          price for it...<br>
          <br>
          ..The truth is this: Our entire economic system is based on
          petroleum and low-cost petroleum at that. But the actual
          nightmare is that our entire agricultural system is based on
          cheap oil.<br>
          <br>
          The United States diet, especially for average Americans, is
          based on only three crops: Corn, wheat, and soy. Every
          processed food you see is based on fractions of those three
          staples. Meat is fed those three staples, even the farm-raised
          salmon you see in the store. Without those three crops, the
          United States would undergo a famine not seen in the United
          States ever at any point. The United States cannot feed itself
          without those three crops. What’s more, many large parts of
          the world depend on those three crops exported from the United
          States to feed themselves, too. Therefore, without them, the
          famine would turn into a runaway famine of global proportions.<br>
          <br>
          Those three crops require large inputs of oil to grow,
          maintain, fertilize, and harvest. The corn alone depletes the
          soil to the extent synthetic fertilizer made by the Haber
          Process is an absolute requirement. That synthetic fertilizer
          requires oil to produce. The tractors and combines to plant
          and harvest these crops run on oil. All the transportation
          involved runs on oil. People have been led to believe we’ve
          discovered domestic oil reserves that will give us
          self-sufficiency. Who’s telling us this? The oil companies who
          are in bed with the government. The fact is, if we have to
          rely on these reserves alone, they will need to be devoted to
          agriculture alone. Or we won’t eat...<br>
          <br>
          ...we better start thinking about the fact food is about to
          get a lot more expensive. The days of .99 cent super bags of
          corn chips are about to come to an end. Soon.<b><br>
            <br>
          </b> Keep in mind that the government heavily subsidizes those
          three crops as it is. Otherwise, food would be a LOT more
          expensive. Understand this: We are all on food stamps because
          the government subsidizes corn, wheat, and soy. If they did
          not, many people would not be able to afford food at all. What
          you see in the store is not the real and actual cost of that
          food. You’re seeing it after the government paid up to half
          (or more) of the cost to grow that corn, wheat, and soy.
          Including that which was fed to animals, we eat. Meaning, if
          you think beef is expensive at $6.99 a pound, the actual cost
          is $15.99 a pound if the government did not subsidize the corn
          fed to that cattle.<br>
          <br>
          That can only take place because the oil is relatively cheap.
          Were the oil not cheap and the government still had to
          subsidize the food crops, the money will probably have to be
          diverted from Social Security, interstate highways, and the
          military budget. So you can see the corner the government has
          painted themselves into. They can’t afford to do nothing but
          they can’t afford to get into an actual war with Russia,
          either. However, the steps they are taking carry the very real
          seeds of a war, but the government is willing to risk that,
          gambling a certain future of food riots against the
          possibility of a war. It’s a lose-lose proposition, but the
          government and Wall Street are stubbornly refusing to own up
          to the truth. They have staked “growth” of the economy on the
          price of oil. We are in a suicide pact with them right now...<br>
          <br>
          This is the “end game”. This is the future. There can be no
          other reason the United States is willing to risk war with
          Russia. Oil is always the reason the United States goes to war
          since the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo showed us how vulnerable we
          really are. But this time, we’ve got a “false prosperity” and
          millions of people born solely because of the cheap food
          brought to us by cheap oil. When that oil is gone, guess what?
          We will not be able to feed all those people born because
          cheap oil made feeding them possible. You do the math on what
          that means.<b><br>

          <b><br>
          </b> Ever since agribusiness giant Monsanto began pushing its
          GM crops on the public, the company has maintained that the
          technology is safe, and that consumption of Frankenfood
          products, such as genetically-modified corn, causes no ill
          effects in either animals or humans.<br>
          <br>
          Monsanto propaganda holds that GMOs have been proven safe, but
          the truth is that few real safety studies have ever been
          conducted, while much of the existing scientific literature on
          the subject is bogus industry-backed drivel. However, despite
          Monsanto’s efforts to control the narrative, independent
          researchers have been finding evidence that contradicts the
          company’s claims.<br>
          <br>
          GM Watch recently published the results of one such study,
          conducted by two researchers at the Faculty of Medicine at
          Tanta University, Egypt.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers fed Monsanto GM corn – a genetically-altered
          version of a local Egyptian corn variety – to laboratory rats
          over a 90-day period, with a control group being fed a non-GM
          variety of local corn. (RELATED: Stay informed about all the
          news on GMOs at GMO.news)<br>
          Researchers find ‘alarming signs’<br>
          <br>
          The rats which were fed the GM corn (MON810: Ajeeb YG)
          developed “serious damage to the surface mucous membranes of
          the jejunum (part of the small intestine).”<br>
          <b><br>
          </b> From GM Watch:<br>
          <br>
          “In the GM-fed rats, some areas of the villi – finger-like
          structures in the intestine that absorb nutrients from food –
          were damaged. They were distorted and flattened, with some
          cells joined together. The damage can clearly be seen in the
          images included in the study. The crypts (mucosal glands) were
          disrupted and blood vessels were congested. Signs of
          inflammation – white blood cell infiltration – were seen
          around areas of damage. In addition, the cells of the
          intestinal lining were abnormal in structure.<br>
          <br>
          “Other signs of damage included increased shedding of mucosal
          cells, increased numbers of mucous-secreting goblet cells, and
          higher rates of division of cells lining the crypts.”<br>
          <br>
          The researchers concluded that despite Monsanto’s assurances,
          the consumption of GM corn “profoundly altered the
          histological structure of the jejunal mucosa at many levels
          and revealed several alarming signs.”<br>
          <br>
          Two earlier Egyptian studies involving rats that consumed the
          same Monsanto GM variety corn revealed other types of damage.
          One of the studies found “differences in organ and body
          weights and in blood biochemistry” between rats that consumed
          MON810: Ajeeb YG and those which ate a non-GM version of the
          same variety, suggesting that the GM corn might produce
          “potential adverse health/toxic effects.”<br>
          <br>
          The second study, conducted by the same research team, found
          “toxic effects” in several organs of lab rats caused by the
          same GM variety – including damage to the liver, kidneys,
          intestines and testes.<b><br>
            <br>
          </b> The publication of the study comes as the European
          Commission pushes plans to begin growing MON810 corn in 2017.
          A vote is scheduled for January 17.<br>
          <br>
          Monsanto GM corn strain poses genetic contamination risk<br>
          <br>
          Interestingly, there appears to be another problem with
          MON810. Independent nonprofit research institute Test Biotech
          has reported that MON810 poses a risk of GM transgenes
          spreading to other plant species, and is calling for a
          withdrawal of Monsanto’s application to the EU for approval of
          its cultivation.<br>
          <br>
          It’s become increasingly evident that GM technology has turned
          out to be – as many predicted – a dangerous experiment gone
          completely awry. GM crops have failed to produce the promised
          yields, while more and more studies are uncovering health
          risks associated with the technology.<br>
          <br>
          Glyphosate, the main ingredient in Monsanto’s Roundup – an
          herbicide essential to the whole Monsanto biotech equation –
          is a highly toxic and carcinogenic chemical. Glyphosate has
          now become the most widely used herbicide in history, and
          roughly 19 percent of all glyphosate produced since it was
          first introduced in 1974 has been dumped on the United States
          alone. (Related: We also cover glyphosate “RoundUp” news at

          <b><br>
          </b> It’s time for a complete global ban on GM agriculture and
          the use of glyphosate.<br>

          <div align="center"><b>Physicists have created a new form of
              hydrogen</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b> <em>The most abundant element in the Universe just got
            interesting.<br>
          </em><b><br>
          </b> As the element that makes up 75 percent of all the mass
          in the Universe, and more than 90 percent of all the atoms,
          we’re all pretty well acquainted with hydrogen. <br>
          <br>
          But the simplest and most abundant element in the Universe
          still has some tricks up its sleeve, because physicists have
          just created a never-before-seen form of hydrogen - negatively
          charged hydrogen clusters.<br>
          <br>
          To understand what negatively charged hydrogen clusters are,
          you first have to wrap your head around their far more common
          counterparts - positively charged hydrogen clusters.<br>
          <br>
          Positively charged hydrogen clusters are pretty much exactly
          what they sound like - positively charged clusters of a few or
          many hydrogen molecules.<br>
          <br>
          Known simply as hydrogen ion clusters, they form at very low
          temperatures, and can contain as many as 100 individual atoms.
          <br>
          <br>
          Physicists confirmed the existence of hydrogen ion clusters
          some 40 years ago, and while a negative counterpart to these
          clusters boasting large numbers of atoms were theorised, no
          one could figure out how to create one.<br>
          <br>
          But that didn't stop a team of physicists led by Michael
          Renzler from the University of Innsbruck in Austria from
          giving it a shot.<br>
          <br>
          First, they injected cold liquid helium droplets with hydrogen
          (H2) molecules. This caused the mixture to form clusters with
          a neutral charge.<br>
          <br>
          Next, they exposed these H2-infused droplets to an electron
          beam, and that caused some of the hydrogen molecules to
          ionise, and be flung out into the surrounding vacuum as
          negatively charged hydrogen ions.<br>
          <br>
          Soon, nearby hydrogen molecules started clustering around the
          negatively charged ions, and the researchers discovered that
          these newly formed groups could boast a few, or many molecules
          each.<br>
          <br>
          As is often the case with the most elusive structures in
          particle physics, these negatively charged hydrogen clusters
          existed only for an incredibly fleeting moment - several
          microseconds (1 microsecond = 0.000001 seconds).<br>
          <br>
          But that was enough time for the team to determine their
          geometric structures.<br>
          <br>
          As Michael Schirber reports for the American Physical Society,
          the researchers found that the clusters only had odd atom
          numbers, ranging from n= 5 to n = 129.<br>
          <br>
          The most stable clusters had a central, negatively charged H−
          ion core sounded by shells that were completely filled up by
          hydrogen molecules.<br>
          <br>
          "The odd values implied that the clusters were a combination
          of several H2 molecules and a single H− ion core, held
          together through an induced dipole attraction," Schirber
          explains.<br>
          <br>
          The most commonly recorded clusters had the atomic numbers n =
          25, n = 65, and n = 89.<br>
          <br>
          These 'magic numbers', as the team calls them, correspond to
          symmetrical, almost solid arrangements of H2 molecules, such
          as a 20-sided icosahedron. (You can see one of these
          formations in the image at the top of the page.)<br>
          <br>
          So why does all this matter? For years now, researchers have
          suspected that these large hydrogen clusters could form
          naturally in outer space, either in cold, dense clouds, or the
          atmospheres of gas planets. <br>
          <br>
          Now that we know that negatively charged hydrogen clusters
          aren't impossible, and what their most common and stable form
          could be, it could make it easier to identify them in nature
          for the time.<br>
          <br>
          And at a time when researchers are questioning if dark matter
          - the stuff that hypothetically makes up 27 percent of the
          observable Universe - even exists, we need all the help we can
          get when it comes to deciphering the smallest constituents of
          the space around us.<br>
          <br>
          The research has been published in Physical Review Letters.<br>

          <div align="center"><b>Synopsis: Hydrogen Clusters Go Negative</b><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b> Negatively charged hydrogen ion clusters—consisting of
          five or more hydrogen atoms—have been observed for the first
          time.<br>
          <br>
          At very low temperatures, hydrogen (H) can form ionized
          clusters containing as many as a hundred atoms. Previously
          only observed with positive charge, researchers have now
          detected negatively charged clusters. The number of hydrogen
          atoms in these clusters is always odd, but certain numbers of
          atoms appear more often than others. The results suggest that
          the clusters are based on a solid-like structure in which a
          single H−<br>
          ion is surrounded by an ordered arrangement of H2 molecules.<br>
          <br>
          Theorists long ago predicted that hydrogen clusters with large
          atom numbers may form in outer space, and lab experiments
          confirmed the existence of positively charged clusters 40
          years ago. Negatively charged clusters (or anions) have proved
          more elusive. Until now, the largest hydrogenic anion was H−3<br>
          <br>
          In their experiment, Michael Renzler from the University of
          Innsbruck in Austria and his colleagues injected H2 molecules
          into cold liquid-helium droplets, where the molecules form
          neutral clusters. When the team exposed the droplets to an
          electron beam, the clusters ionized and escaped into the
          surrounding vacuum. The H−n clusters were stable for at least
          several microseconds—long enough for them to reach a mass
          spectrometer that recorded a range of odd atom numbers from
          n=5 to n=129. The odd values implied that the clusters were a
          combination of several H2 molecules and a single H− ion core,
          held together through an induced dipole attraction. The
          highest observed abundances were for n=25, 65, and 89. These
          “magic numbers” correspond to symmetrical solid-like
          arrangements of H2 molecules, such as a 20-sided icosahedron.
          Future studies may explore the chemistry of these large anions
          and possible quantum effects in the vibrational excitations of
          the crystalline structures..<br>

            Abstract<br>
            <br>
          </b> We report the first experimental observation of
          negatively charged hydrogen and deuterium cluster ions, H−n
          and D−n, where n≥5. These anions are formed by an electron
          addition to liquid helium nanodroplets doped with molecular
          hydrogen or deuterium. The ions are stable for at least the
          lifetime of the experiment, which is several tens of
          microseconds. Only anions with odd values of n are detected,
          and some specific ions show anomalously high abundances. The
          sizes of these “magic number” ions suggest an icosahedral
          framework of H2 (D2) molecules in solvent shells around a
          central H− (D−) ion. The first three shells, which contain a
          total of 44 H2 or D2 molecules, appear to be solidlike, but
          thereafter a more liquidlike arrangement of the H2 (D2)
          molecules is adopted.<b><br>

          </b> I've been working with, and researching, chlorine dioxide
          for two years. I've made my own batches of nearly 100%, using
          a different formula. There are more than eight formulas to
          make chlorine dioxide. I have the Genesis II Church member
          card. I'm not anti-MMS.<br>
          <br>
          Jim Humble is a great humanitarian, and must have been a good
          NASA engineer. However, his chemistry is bad, which he has
          said in his book. And his understanding of body biochemistry
          is completely wrong. My main purpose, for this paper, is to
          correct his mistakes.<br>
          <br>
          The medical establishment's attack, against MMS, is based on a
          simplistic, uninformed, negative, buzz word slander. Clorox
          bleach is not labeled with the skull poison symbol. Like many
          products, it has warnings. And the warnings are exaggerated,
          as usual. For instance, it warns of burns to the skin. Hah,
          I've had bleach on my hands many times. It feels slimy, but
          doesn't cause a burn. They also use the word "industrial"
          bleach. "Industrial" makes it sound bad. Supermarket packaged
          foods are made in a factory. It's an industry. There's nothing
          bad about being industrial. Sodium chlorite and chlorine
          dioxide are in the general category of "bleach". That's good
          if you want to disinfect. And chlorine dioxide is used, for
          instance in municipal water supplies, because it is the safest
          one. As I will cover later, bleach oxidizers can do damage. So
          concentrations must be low.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b> I'm experienced enough to be aware of the inner works of
          some groups, especially ones like the FDA. The whole attack,
          on MMS, may possibly be traced to one man, Mr. Mizer in the US
          Dept. of Justice, since everyone is repeating his slander,
          about bleach. There's a cadre of such people who hate
          Christianity, and so can't stand medical people using the
          words "cure" or "miracle". For sure, the attack is uninformed,
          and so it is illegitimate.<br>
          <br>
          To begin correcting Jim's mistaken ideas about chemistry.
          Chlorine dioxide is not an ion. It does not have a charge. It
          is a molecule. Molecules do not have a charge. Chlorine
          dioxide is unusual, in that it doesn't dissolve, ionize, in
          water. Body cells are a complex structure of many molecules.
          They do not have a charge. So chlorine dioxide is not repelled
          by body cells, and it is not attracted to only bad bacteria.
          Bacteria are cells, and so do not have a charge. The Gram
          Stain is not a positive or negative charge. The positive and
          negative means yes or no for the bacteria becoming stained
          with a dye. Chlorine dioxide is a free radical, meaning it has
          an unfilled electron space. This is how it oxidizes. When
          reacting with organic molecules, chlorine dioxide usually
          functions as a highly selective oxidant due to its unique,
          one-electron transfer mechanism where it is reduced back to
          the chlorite ion. When oxidizing some inorganics, like ferric
          oxide, it can accept a total of five electrons, which would
          break it down to a chloride ion, as in salt, and two oxygen
          ions. Jim's claim that electron shells hold atoms together,
          and that the nucleus would fly apart if the electrons are
          drawn away, is false. It takes a high-powered atom smasher to
          do that.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b> Chlorine dioxide is said to work differently on different
          pathogens. Bacteria, fungi, parasite and tumor cells are
          vulnerable to oxidants because of these components; thiols,
          polyamines, purines, amino acids with thiols, phenols, and
          amines [Dr. Thomas Hesselink's paper about malaria]. The
          method of chlorine dioxide bacterial kill, at low ppm
          concentration, seems to occur by the disruption of protein
          synthesis and enzyme inactivation. This is similar to the
          non-toxic mechanism of some common antibiotics. It does not
          blow a hole in cell walls. It acts on good as well as bad
          bacteria, so probiotics should be taken after treatment is
          finished. Oxidation of RNA and DNA do not appear to take
          place, or are at least unimportant in the process. The site of
          action lies in the soluble fraction of the cell and there
          appears to be no damage to internal structural components such
          as ribosomes. At high ppm, the method of rapid bacterial and
          viral kill appears to be the softening and destroying of the
          cell wall, or viral capsid.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b> Chlorine dioxide can definitely hurt body tissue, as well
          as pathogens. It kills algae, parasite organisms, and some
          insect eggs or larvae, such as mosquitoes. If the
          concentration is high enough, it can kill zebra mussels and
          some fish, such as trout (the lethal LC50 for rainbow trout is
          290 ppm for 96 hours). Since I believed Jim's harmlessness
          claim, at first, I took massive doses of pure chlorine
          dioxide, and inhaled full breaths of it. Once, my lungs hurt
          for three days afterwards. And massive doses caused my ears to
          ring, probably damaging sensitive inner ear nerve hairs. So
          doses should be kept small, and luckily chlorine dioxide works
          with the lowest doses, compared to other disinfectants. There
          are many institutional papers assessing the toxicity of
          chlorine dioxide, sodium chlorite and chlorate. The main
          problem area is red blood cells. With prolonged, higher dose
          (up to 1000 ppm for chlorine dioxide, and 100 ppm for chlorite
          and chlorate) daily use in rat's drinking water, for 1-2
          months, some hemoglobin can be oxidized to methemoglobin which
          doesn't carry oxygen. Also, red blood cell count can decrease.
          Chlorate (ClO3-), which can rupture RBCs, is the worst with
          serious RBC loss after nine months. There is a claim that some
          chlorate can be produced in MMS reactions, such as with pH
          less than 3, and some chemical studies claim chlorine dioxide
          can change into some chlorate in water. Red blood cells have
          glutathione to protect them from oxidation, but cell levels
          can be decreased with prolonged treatment. Other studies show
          no methemoglobin at these dose levels. There is a reference
          stating that there's an enzyme that reduces methemoglobin back
          to normal hemoglobin. One study with low dose, single dose,
          pure chlorine dioxide using people, showed no problems at 0.34
          mg/kg of body weight. In these studies, the doses of sodium
          chlorite and chlorate were only 1/10th of the amount of
          chlorine dioxide, evidently for safety reasons, meaning they
          considered chlorine dioxide much safer. Different studies have
          found the following safe levels of chlorine dioxide in all of
          the drinking water, per day: 15 mg/kg in mice for 1 month; 9
          mg/kg in green monkeys for 1-2 months; 2 mg/kg in
          Sprague-Dawley rats for 3 months. At higher doses there could
          be some nasal irritation from chlorine dioxide gas evaporating
          at the drinking tube. Effect on newborn rat pups: decreased
          pup development, decreased thyroid hormone levels (thyroid
          hormones T3 and T4 are phenols), and decreased brain cell
          count, were found at 14 mg/kg of body weight per day in
          drinking water for the mother rats during gestation and
          lactation. Dosing below 14 mg/kg had no observed effect, such
          as in a 3 mg/kg test. I don't think anyone should take
          maintenance doses for years, especially with so much sodium
          chlorite in the MMS mix. And doses should be in mg/kg or
          /pound of body weight, not in drops. Also, Jim is wrong about
          MMS lasting only one hour in the body. Rat studies show that
          100% chlorine dioxide, not the MMS mix, reaches peak blood
          level in 2 hours, with half absorbed in 3.5 hours. The
          leftover sodium chlorite, in the MMS mix, reaches peak blood
          level in 8 hours. 21% of it is still in the blood after 72
          hours. So dosing every hour is not a good idea. Studies use
          one dose per day. There probably hasn't been much research
          about the effect of chlorite and chlorine dioxide on
          prescription drugs in the body, but oxidizers are one thing
          used by illegal drug users to nullify drugs in their urine
          test. So they probably can affect some prescription drugs in
          the body. For myself, I would only take low dose pure chlorine
          dioxide, such as chlorine dioxide solution (CDS), or the new
          MMS1 tablets in a glass of water [do not swallow the tablet].
          Precautions must be employed in people with
          glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency disease, as they
          are especially sensitive to oxidants of all kinds.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b> As chlorine dioxide is a free radical, antioxidants will
          quench it back into a chlorite ion. This happens with many
          antioxidants; Vit. E, Vit. A, CoQ10, flavonoids,
          Beta-carotene, Lycopene, Lutein, etc., not only vitamin C. So
          no antioxidant supplements, or natural juices or foods should
          be consumed with chlorine dioxide. Lemon, or lime juice, has
          vitamin C and other antioxidants, so are not good to mix with
          chlorine dioxide.<br>
          <br>
          Jim believes that MMS gets completely changed into chlorine
          dioxide, in the stomach, if you swallow it. This is no more
          true than what happens when activating MMS in a glass beaker.
          There is only a small continuous basal secretion of gastric
          acid, on an empty stomach, of usually less than 10 mEq/hour.
          It takes food to stimulate the secretion of gastric fluid, and
          then the HCl is only 0.5 to 1% of it. And acidifying sodium
          chlorite does not produce chlorine dioxide as the first step.
          It produces chlorous acid, HClO2. [HCl + NaClO2 = HClO2 +
          NaCl] HClO2 is unstable, and breaks down into chlorine dioxide
          and hydrochloric acid. [5 HClO2 decomposes to 4 ClO2 + HCl + 2
          H2O] Furthermore, at a pH in the range of 2.3 - 3.2, only
          about 30% chlorous acid is produced from the acidification.
          That leaves about 70% leftover sodium chlorite. Citric acid is
          a weak acid, and only produces about 10% chlorine dioxide. And
          citric acid can have the taste problem. Luckily, the leftover
          sodium chlorite is also a disinfectant, although it is much
          harsher than chlorine dioxide, and not as selective. With
          exact concentrations and conditions, HCl can produce nearly
          100% chlorine dioxide. Also, the acidification of 1.3M sodium
          chlorite with 10% acetic acid yielded almost entirely chlorine
          dioxide as the major product of the disproportionation.
          Acidified Sodium Chlorite is used by many food processing
          companies, and the short-lived chlorous acid is also a
          disinfectant.<br>
          <br>
          Sodium chlorite is a different animal. I have brushed my teeth
          with less than one ounce of 80% sodium chlorite solution.
          Afterwards, one corner of my lips hurt, and my gums were red
          and sore, with a small amount of bleeding when brushed. This
          took several days to heal. A single dose of 105 mg/kg weight
          will kill half of rats tested. That's called the LD50, lethal
          dose. For a 150 lb person, that's a little over 7 grams. In
          another test, with cats, a single dose of 1.5 mg/kg caused as
          much as 32% methemoglobin. That's losing about 1/3 of your
          blood oxygen supply. This loss does reverse back into normal
          hemoglobin over time. A 90 day study on rats found a No
          Adverse Effect Level at 1 mg/kg. Another 13 week study found
          very serious consequences at the highest doses; death,
          increased spleen and adrenal weights, ulceration, chronic
          inflammation and edema in the stomach. In a 90 day study, red
          blood cell glutathione levels, in a high dose group, were 40%
          below those of controls. MMS with citric acid has about 90%
          sodium chlorite leftover. So it's safer to use only chlorine
          dioxide alone.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b> Under some circumstances, calcium hypochlorite, MMS2,
          solutions can decompose to form some chlorate. In water it
          reacts to form hypochlorous acid and calcium hydroxide. This
          is the same chemistry as Clorox, sodium hypochlorite. The
          hydroxide part is caustic. It eats into body tissue. It's well
          known that these pool chemicals can irritate the eyes, if you
          swim a long time. He notes that hypochlorous acid is formed in
          the body. Yes. However it is formed inside white blood cells
          when they find an invading micro-organism, and only then. So
          it works only on the invader. Normal mammalian body cells, as
          well as bacteria, do not have a catalytically active
          detoxifying mechanism for it. So the hypochlorous acid can
          destroy body tissue as well as invaders. And ingesting it puts
          it in your bloodstream and body. Also, it's not as effective
          as chlorine dioxide. So it offers nothing new. No one should
          ingest MMS2, calcium hypochlorite, in any way. Swallowing a
          capsule containing solid calcium hypochlorite must surely
          "burn" the stomach. Also, calcium hypochlorite reacts with
          hydrochloric acid, stomach acid, to produce chlorine gas.
          Chlorine gas is the worst of all types of chlorine compounds.<br>
          <br>
          Here's a quote from one of Jim's books: "Actually my friend
          next door in the Nevada desert, Bill Boynton, came over one
          day and said that calcium hypochlorite killed germs in
          swimming pools and it might just be another MMS. He suggested
          that we try taking small amounts and see what happens. I
          figured if he was game to do it, I was too. We made up some
          gel capsules with calcium hypochlorite in them and started
          taking them and when they didn't kill us, we had some friends
          take them. ... I decided to use the gel caps and started
          sending it out to people in the gel cap form. It's something a
          doctor could never do. He has the Hippocratic Oath and AMA and
          FDA looking over his shoulder. But I am an inventor and never
          took that oath." p.112.<b><br>
            <br>
          </b> Stabilized Oxygen, as sodium chlorite, is known by some
          people as a biocide for killing parasites. And at first, this
          is what Jim used, alone, to cure malaria. It's not clear who
          started selling Stabilized Oxygen, or why the mistaken name
          was used. It goes back far enough that the ingredient was not
          listed, leading to confusion. In 1929, Dr. Moisés de Guevarra
          was selling a dry powder named "stabilized oxygen". In 1971,
          Dr. La Mar was the first to use a solution with "stabilized
          oxygen" to increase blood oxygen level. Evidently, it's
          unknown if either of these was sodium chlorite. E.D. Goodloe,
          1971, sold "aerobic stabilized oxygen", produced in a
          2-month-long production process in 14 stages. The oxygen is in
          association with sodium chloride, not sodium chlorite. Sodium
          chlorite could be used alone, as long as doses are below the
          vomiting threshold. Making up a new name, for Stabilized
          Oxygen (sodium chlorite), is what commercial companies do to
          sell a product. And changing the wording, of MMS, only causes
          confusion. Health newsletters simply use the names of the
          chemicals.<b><br>
            <br>
          </b> Getting sick, with Jim's method, is not a herxheimer
          reaction. The herxheimer reaction (Jarrisch and Herxheimer) is
          a phenomena originally observed in the treatment of syphilis.
          In general terms, it is described as a temporary increase of
          symptoms when antibiotics are administered. This effect
          happens with only a few diseases. Similar reactions have been
          found to occur in two kinds of borreliosis (Lyme disease and
          relapsing fever), brucellosis, Q fever, and trypanosomiasis.
          Herxheimer can occur within days to weeks after the onset of
          antibiotic therapy. The most common effects include: increased
          joint or muscle pain, headaches, chills, fever (usually
          low-grade), drop in blood pressure, hives and rash. Lyme is
          the main one, now, to have this problem. The extremely large
          doses of pure chlorine dioxide, that I took, caused no nausea,
          vomiting or diarrhea. In fact I felt high until the next
          morning. I've also swallowed a half eye-dropper of the 80%
          liquid sodium chlorite alone in water. It caused a vomit
          stomach spasm reaction within 30 minutes. Chlorous acid is
          evidently the one that causes liquid diarrhea. I got that with
          my first use of MMS with lime juice. The vomiting and diarrhea
          are the body's attempt to get rid of what you ingested. They
          are not a die-off or Herxheimer effect.<b><br>
            <br>
          </b> We owe Jim for making this subject public, and his other
          work. But I discovered, from being on the Genesis II Church
          Forum, that everyone was extremely closed minded about saying
          anything that disagreed with Jim. They even ban people who
          disagree with anything, even a chemist. So I have to conclude
          that Jim's history, with NASA or otherwise, has made him
          somewhat arrogant. I don't like to criticize people, but he's
          created an atmosphere that he is perfect, and knows more.
          That's the kind of problem in cults. Chlorine dioxide, and
          acidified sodium chlorite, are not new. There's been plenty of
          official health research, and patents, long before Jim found
          that "stabilized oxygen" (sodium chlorite) kills the malaria
          parasite. And some of his protocols may have too much sodium
          chlorite per day. He's so unprofessional that he doesn't give
          dosages per pound of weight of the patient. Obviously Jim has
          done no stomach sample tests, or blood tests to prove his
          claims. Chlorine dioxide has been said, by a chemist society,
          to be the best anti-pathogen. But do your own research.<b><br>
            <br>
          </b> I'm not trying to scare you away from MMS. As long as you
          stay within the No Adverse Effect Levels, it's usable. If I
          had a deadly disease, I would use it even at somewhat damaging
          levels. For recommended dose levels of the sodium chlorite
          part, see Dr. Hesselink's table below. One benefit of these
          chlorine oxidants is that, in low doses, they can stimulate
          white blood cells to produce cytokines which stimulate other
          white blood cells, activating the immune system.<b><br>
            <br>
          </b> There's a great Patent, from 1990's work, with very
          exacting biochemical research. The test studies showed that
          sodium chlorite alone is successful at treating autoimmune
          diseases, which may include diabetes-1, Parkinson, MS,
          hepatitis, etc. [Use of a chemically-stabilized chlorite

          mold, algae, spores, protozoans, cryptosporidia,
          actinomycetes, cysts, giardia and larval eggs (mosquito, tse
          tse fly), insect eggs and larvae (agricultural pests, fruit

          Unlike chlorine, ClO2 has the ability to kill water-borne
          viruses such as legionella, cholera, dengue, hepatitis and
          typhoid. ClO2 also kills airborne viruses when misted into
          air. Airborne viruses include anthrax, influenza, SARS,
          smallpox, chickenpox and avian flu. ClO2 kills all known
          bacteria, including coliform, salmonella, E-coli, listeria and
          cinobacteria. ClO2 eliminates microbial slime (biofilm).<br>

        </b>The rise and fall of civilisations can be predicted by a
        simple equation, and our civilisation is in for a fall some time
        soon.<br>
        <br>
        This is according to Peter Turchin, from the University of
        Connecticut, who says mathematics can explain human behaviour
        far more accurately than you might think. <br>
        <br>
        And if his calculations are correct, the world should be
        prepared for years of political turmoil that will peak at some
        point in the next century. <br>
        <b><br>
        </b>A professor of Ecology and Mathematics from the University
        of Connecticut, Peter Turchin has led the development of a
        cross-disciplinary subject called 'cliodynamics'.<br>
        <br>
        'Cliodynamics is a new 'transdisciplinary discipline' that
        treats history as just another science,' Professor Turchin says.<br>
        <br>
        He started out using maths to predict human activity from 1500
        B.C.E. to 1500 C.E.<br>
        <br>
        Then three years ago, using similar models, he began to forecast
        the future.<br>
        <br>
        'My model indicated that social instability and political
        violence would peak in the 2020s,' he says.<br>
        <br>
        The presidential election which we have experienced,
        unfortunately, confirms this forecast. <br>
        <br>
        'We seem to be well on track for the 2020s instability peak.'<br>
        <br>
        Exactly what will happen when this 'peak' occurs is unknown, and
        Professor Turchin says the theory does not predict events. but
        trends.<br>
        <br>
        He said the turmoil would be driven by a process of 'elite
        overproduction' in which the number of rich, elite people in
        society grows larger and they become ever more distant from
        those poorer.<b><br>

        <b>January 4, 2017 by Peter Turchin<br>
          <br>
        </b>Cliodynamics is a new "transdisciplinary discipline" that
        treats history as just another science. Ten years ago I started
        applying its tools to the society I live in: the United States.
        What I discovered alarmed me.<br>
        <br>
        My research showed that about 40 seemingly disparate (but,
        according to cliodynamics, related) social indicators
        experienced turning points during the 1970s. Historically, such
        developments have served as leading indicators of political
        turmoil. My model indicated that social instability and
        political violence would peak in the 2020s.<br>
        <br>
        The presidential election which we have experienced,
        unfortunately, confirms this forecast. We seem to be well on
        track for the 2020s instability peak. And although the election
        is over, the deep structural forces that brought us the current
        political crisis have not gone away. If anything, the negative
        trends seem to be accelerating.<br>
        <br>
        My model tracks a number of factors. Some reflect the
        developments that have been noticed and extensively discussed:
        growing income and wealth inequality, stagnating and even
        declining well-being of most Americans, growing political
        fragmentation and governmental dysfunction (see Return of the
        Oppressed). But most social scientists and political
        commentators tend to focus on a particular slice of the problem.
        It's not broadly appreciated that these developments are all
        interconnected. Our society is a system in which different parts
        affect each other, often in unexpected ways.<br>
        <br>
        Furthermore, there is another important development that has
        been missed by most commentators: the key role of "elite
        overproduction" in driving waves of political violence, both in
        historical societies and in our own (see Blame Rich,
        Overeducated Elites as Our Society Frays). As I wrote three
        years ago, "Increasing inequality leads not only to the growth
        of top fortunes; it also results in greater numbers of
        wealth-holders. The '1 percent' becomes '2 percent.' Or even
        more. … from 1983 to 2010 the number of American households
        worth at least $10 million grew to 350,000 from 66,000. Rich
        Americans tend to be more politically active than the rest of
        the population. … In technical terms, such a situation is known
        as 'elite overproduction.' … Elite overproduction generally
        leads to more intra-elite competition that gradually undermines
        the spirit of cooperation, which is followed by ideological
        polarization and fragmentation of the political class. This
        happens because the more contenders there are, the more of them
        end up on the losing side. A large class of disgruntled
        elite-wannabes, often well-educated and highly capable, has been
        denied access to elite positions."<br>
        <br>
        This was written when Donald Trump was known only as a real
        estate mogul and reality show host; well before this
        presidential election characterized by an unprecedented collapse
        of social norms governing civilized discourse – "epic ugliness,"
        in the words of the New York Times columnist Frank Bruni.<br>
        <br>
        The victory of Donald Trump changes nothing in this equation.
        The "social pump" creating new aspirants for political offices
        continues to operate at full strength. In addition to
        politically ambitious multi-millionaires, the second important
        source of such aspirants is U.S. law schools, which every year
        churn out twice as many law graduates as there are job openings
        for them – about 25,000 "surplus" lawyers, many of whom are in
        debt. It is emblematic that the 2016 election pitted a
        billionaire against a lawyer.<br>
        <br>
        Another visible sign of increasing intra-elite competition and
        political polarization is the fragmentation of political
        parties. The Republican Party is in the process of splitting up
        into three factions: Traditional Republicans, Tea Party
        Republicans, and Trump Populists. These divisions run so deep
        that many Republicans refused to endorse Trump, and some even
        voted for Clinton. Similar disintegrative forces have also been
        at work within the Democratic Party, with a major fault line
        dividing Bernie Sanders' Democratic Socialists from the
        Establishment Democrats of Obama and Clinton.<br>
        <br>
        So far in this analysis I have emphasized elite overproduction.
        There are two reasons for it. First, as I mentioned before,
        other factors are much better understood, and have been
        discussed, by social scientists and political commentators.
        Secondly, cliodynamic research on past societies demonstrates
        that elite overproduction is by far the most important of the
        three main historical drivers of social instability and
        political violence (see Secular Cycles for this analysis).<br>
        <br>
        But the other two factors in the model, popular immiseration
        (the stagnation and decline of living standards) and declining
        fiscal health of the state (resulting from falling state
        revenues and rising expenses) are also important contributors.<br>
        <br>
        From what I have seen so far, it seems unlikely that the Trump
        administration will succeed in reversing these negative trends.
        And some of the proposed policies will likely make them worse.
        For example, drastically reducing taxes on wealthy Americans
        will hardly strengthen the fiscal health of the state.<br>
        <br>
        Thus I see no reason to revise the forecast I made three years
        ago: "We should expect many years of political turmoil, peaking
        in the 2020s."<br>
        <br>
        But this is a science-based forecast, not a "prophecy". It's
        based on solid social science, the workings of which I have left
        "under the hood" in this article intended for a general
        audience. But the science is there. If you are interested in
        looking under the hood, see my recently published book, Ages of
        Discord.<br>
        <br>
        Because it's a scientific theory, we also need to understand the
        limitations of what it can forecast. Cliodynamics is about broad
        social trends and deep structural causes of these developments.
        It did not predict that Donald Trump would become the American
        President in 2016. But it did predict rising social and
        political instability. And, unless something is done,
        instability will continue to rise.<br>
        <br>
        So what's to be done? I find myself in the shoes of Hari Seldon,
        a fictional character in Isaac Asimov's Foundation, whose
        science of history (which he called psychohistory) predicted the
        decline and fall of his own society. Should we follow Seldon's
        lead and establish a Cliodynamic Foundation somewhere in the
        remote deserts of Australia?<br>
        <br>
        This would be precisely the wrong thing to do. It didn't work
        even in Isaac Asimov's fictional universe. The problem with
        secretive cabals is that they quickly become self-serving, and
        then mire themselves in internecine conflict. Asimov came up
        with the Second Foundation to watch over the First. But who
        watches the watchers? In the end it all came down to a uniquely
        powerful and uniquely benevolent super-robot, R. Daneel Olivaw.<br>
        <br>
        No, the only way forward is through an open discussion of
        problems and potential solutions, and broad-based collective
        action to implement them. It's messy and slow, but that's how
        lasting positive change usually comes about.<br>
        <br>
        Another important consideration is that in Foundation, Seldon's
        equations told him that it would be impossible to stop the
        decline of the Galactic Empire – Trantor must fall. In real
        life, thankfully, things are different. And this is another way
        in which the forecasts of cliodynamics differ from prophecies of
        doom. They give us tools not only to understand the problem, but
        also potentially to fix it.<br>
        <br>
        But to do it, we need to develop much better science. What we
        need is a nonpolitical, indeed a fiercely non-partisan
        center/institute/think tank that would develop and refine a
        better scientific understanding of how we got into this mess;
        and then translate that science into policy to help us get out
        of it.<br>
        <br>
        Our society, like all previous complex societies, is on a
        rollercoaster. Impersonal social forces bring us to the top;
        then comes the inevitable plunge. But the descent is not
        inevitable. Ours is the first society that can perceive how
        those forces operate, even if dimly. This means that we can
        avoid the worst – perhaps by switching to a less harrowing
        track, perhaps by redesigning the rollercoaster altogether.<b><br>

            Hydrogen Production</b><br>
        </div>
        <b><br>
        </b>A team of UConn chemists led by professors Steven Suib and
        James Rusling has developed a new material that could make
        hydrogen capture more commercially viable and provide a key
        element for a new generation of cheaper, light-weight hydrogen
        fuel cells.<br>
        <br>
        The new metal-free catalyst uses carbon graphene nanotubes
        infused with sulfur...<br>
        <br>
        Current hydrogen production uses intense heat to separate
        hydrogen from hydrocarbons found in crude oil. But the resulting
        hydrogen isn't very pure, and byproducts must be scrubbed out.<br>
        <br>
        An alternate process, capturing hydrogen in water, is cleaner
        and more sustainable, but it too has limitations.
        Electrocatalysts involved in this process are usually made of
        rare earth metals like platinum and iridium. But they are very
        expensive, making the commercialization of pure hydrogen fuels
        difficult...<br>
        <br>
        Suib and Rusling, an expert in electrochemistry, knew that
        sulfur-infused carbon graphene nanotubes were a potentially
        efficient non-metal catalyst for an oxygen reduction reaction.
        An oxygen reduction reaction, or ORR, happens when oxygen and
        hydrogen molecules are converted to water. The reaction is a key
        component of hydrogen-based fuel cells. Hydrogen gas used to
        power the cells passes through a catalyst, currently a
        corrosive-resistant metal like platinum, causing an oxygen
        reduction electrochemical reaction that creates energy and – as
        a byproduct – water.<br>
        <br>
        But reversing that process – starting with water and extracting
        pure hydrogen from it, a procedure known as an oxygen evolution
        reaction – is much more of a challenge electrochemically. Suib
        and Rusling, working with a team of graduate students led by
        Ph.D. candidates Abdelhamid El-Sawy and Islam Mosa, decided to
        give it a shot.<br>
        <br>
        The key, Suib says, was manipulating the sulfur and carbon atoms
        to create stable bonds and structures within the nanotubes,
        while also maintaining or improving the tubes' electrochemical
        potential so that it mirrored those found in the rare metals...<br>
        <br>
        The process developed in Suib's and Rusling's labs uses a dual
        doping procedure involving sulfur and benzyl disulfide treated
        at high heat. The researchers had to carefully add heteroatoms
        of sulfur at extremely low levels to strike the delicate balance
        needed to maintain usability and stability. Add too much sulfur
        and the sample would be unstable; not enough and it would be
        ineffective...<br>
        <br>
        In the end, he says, the sulfur-doped nanotubes used much less
        energy in the chemical reaction process than other known
        processes, and were much more active and efficient catalysts
        than other known products.<br>
        <br>
        Most importantly, he points out, the sulfur-infused nanotubes
        are efficient for both separating hydrogen from water and
        reducing oxygen into water. Materials with those dual properties
        are rare, he notes...<b><br>

        </b>Doctors have found a way to manipulate wounds to heal as
        regenerated skin rather than scar tissue. The method involves
        transforming the most common type of cells found in wounds into
        fat cells -- something that was previously thought to be
        impossible in humans. Researchers began this work at the
        Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania,
        which led to a large-scale, multi-year study in connection with
        the Plikus Laboratory for Developmental and Regenerative Biology
        at the University of California, Irvine. They published their
        findings online in the journal Science on Thursday, January 5th,
        2017.<br>
        <br>
        Fat cells called adipocytes are normally found in the skin, but
        they're lost when wounds heal as scars. The most common cells
        found in healing wounds are myofibroblasts, which were thought
        to only form a scar. Scar tissue also does not have any hair
        follicles associated with it, which is another factor that gives
        it an abnormal appearance from the rest of the skin. Researchers
        used these characteristics as the basis for their work --
        changing the already present myofibroblasts into fat cells that
        do not cause scarring.<br>
        <br>
        "Essentially, we can manipulate wound healing so that it leads
        to skin regeneration rather than scarring," said George
        Cotsarelis, MD, the chair of the Department of Dermatology and
        the Milton Bixler Hartzell Professor of Dermatology at Penn, and
        the principal investigator of the project. "The secret is to
        regenerate hair follicles first. After that, the fat will
        regenerate in response to the signals from those follicles."<br>
        <br>
        The study showed hair and fat develop separately but not
        independently. Hair follicles form first, and the Cotsarelis lab
        previously discovered factors necessary for their formation. Now
        they've discovered additional factors actually produced by the
        regenerating hair follicle to convert the surrounding
        myofibroblasts to regenerate as fat instead of forming a scar.
        That fat will not form without the new hairs, but once it does,
        the new cells are indistinguishable from the pre-existing fat
        cells, giving the healed wound a natural look instead of leaving
        a scar. As they examined the question of what was sending the
        signal from the hair to the fat cells, researchers identified a
        factor called Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP). It instructs the
        myofibroblasts to become fat. This signaling was groundbreaking
        on its own, as it changed what was previously known about
        myofibroblasts...<b><br>

          Abstract<br>
          <br>
        </b>Although regeneration via the reprogramming of one cell
        lineage to another occurs in fish and amphibians, it is not
        observed in mammals. We discovered in mouse that during wound
        healing adipocytes regenerate from myofibroblasts, a cell type
        thought to be differentiated and non-adipogenic. Myofibroblast
        reprogramming required neogenic hair follicles, which triggered
        BMP signaling and then activation of adipocyte transcription
        factors expressed during development. Overexpression of the BMP
        antagonist, noggin, in hair follicles or deletion of the BMP
        receptor in myofibroblasts prevented adipocyte formation.
        Adipocytes formed from human keloid fibroblasts when treated
        with either BMP or when placed with human hair follicles in
        vitro. Thus, we identify the myofibroblast as a plastic cell
        type that may be manipulated to treat scars in humans.<br>

            promise in helping people shed body fat</b><br>
        </div>
        <b><br>
        </b>University of Alabama at Birmingham researchers are trying
        to find out whether changing a person's eating schedule can help
        them lose weight and burn fat.<br>
        <br>
        The first human test of early time-restricted feeding, or eTRF,
        found that this meal-timing strategy reduced swings in hunger
        and altered fat and carbohydrate burning patterns, which may
        help with losing weight. With eTRF, people eat their last meal
        by the mid-afternoon and do not eat again until breakfast the
        next morning. The findings were unveiled during a presentation
        at The Obesity Society Annual Meeting at Obesity Week 2016 in
        New Orleans, Louisiana.<br>
        <br>
        "Eating only during a much smaller window of time than people
        are typically used to may help with weight loss," said Courtney
        Peterson, Ph.D., an associate professor in the Department of
        Nutrition Sciences at UAB. "We found that eating between 8 a.m.
        and 2 p.m. followed by an 18-hour daily fast kept appetite
        levels more even throughout the day, in comparison to eating
        between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., which is what the average American
        does."<br>
        <br>
        This new research, funded by a TOS Early Career Research Grant
        awarded in 2014, suggests that eating a very early dinner, or
        even skipping dinner, may have some benefits for losing weight,
        although further studies need to take place to confirm that
        theory. Previous animal studies showed that eTRF helped rodents
        burn more fat...<br>

        </b>"Glyphosate tolerant genetically modified (GM) maize NK603
        was assessed as "substantially equivalent" to its isogenic
        counterpart by a nutrient composition analysis in order to be
        granted market approval. We have applied contemporary in depth
        molecular profiling methods of NK603 maize kernels (sprayed or
        unsprayed with Roundup) and the isogenic corn to reassess its
        substantial equivalence status. Proteome profiles of the maize
        kernels revealed alterations in the levels of enzymes of
        glycolysis and TCA cycle pathways, which were reflective of an
        imbalance in energy metabolism. Changes in proteins and
        metabolites of glutathione metabolism were indicative of
        increased oxidative stress. The most pronounced metabolome
        differences between NK603 and its isogenic counterpart consisted
        of an increase in polyamines including N-acetyl-cadaverine
        (2.9-fold), N-acetylputrescine (1.8-fold), putrescine (2.7-fold)
        and cadaverine (28-fold), which depending on context can be
        either protective or a cause of toxicity. Our molecular
        profiling results show that NK603 and its isogenic control are
        not substantially equivalent.<br>

              Book and Nelson Book</b></big><br>
          <b>By Steven B. Krivit, <br>
            <br>
          </b></div>
        <b>Publisher and Senior Editor, New Energy Times<br>
          Published Dec. 20, 2016<br>
          <br>
        </b>In 2014, Oxford University Press published a book written by
        Marco Fontani, Mariagrazia Costa and Mary Virginia Orna, and
        edited by Jeremy Lewis, called The Lost Elements: The Periodic
        Table’s Shadow Side. Fontani and Costa are chemists at the
        University of Florence, Italy. Orna is a professor of chemistry
        at the College of New Rochelle, New York.<br>
        <br>
        The 530-page book is an eloquent, interesting description of
        supposed discoveries of new elements which turned out to be
        illusory. The dust jacket reads, "Throughout its formation, the
        periodic table of elements has seen false entries, good-faith
        errors, retractions and dead ends. In fact, there have been more
        falsely proclaimed elemental discoveries throughout history than
        there are elements on the table as we know it today."<br>
        <br>
        The book contains a 33-page section called "Modern Alchemy: The
        Dream to Transmute the Elements Has Always Been With Us." This
        section is primarily about elemental transmutation research that
        took place in the 1910s and 1920s. The authors also briefly
        discuss modern science experiments in the field of low-energy
        nuclear reaction (LENR) research.<br>
        <br>
        When I learned about the Lost Elements book, I had just
        completed the manuscript for my book Lost History: Explorations
        in Nuclear Research, Vol. 3. Lost History describes the
        elemental transmutation research that took place in the 1910s
        and 1920s.<br>
        <br>
        By 1930, the research from the previous two decades had largely
        been dismissed as errors and mistakes. However, very few
        confirmed errors or mistakes were ever identified. The reason
        the research was dismissed was that the results were not
        theoretically understood and the experiments were difficult to
        repeat. Consequently, the research was omitted from subsequent
        scientific reference material.<br>
        <b><br>
          Another Author<br>
          <br>
        </b>News of this forgotten body of research didn't resurface
        until the 1980s, when a researcher and author named Robert
        Nelson spent many days poring through Chemical Abstracts at the
        University of California, Berkeley. Nelson suspected that the
        research had merit, and a chapter in my book discusses Nelson
        and his quest.<br>
        <br>
        In the mid-1980s, Nelson began self-publishing his research
        findings in a book called Adept Alchemy. Nelson appears to be
        the only person who has found and documented this body of lost
        research — at least in the English-language — since the 1930s.<br>
        <br>
        In 2012, I began writing my book Hacking the Atom: Explorations
        in Nuclear Research, Vol. 1, describing nuclear transmutation
        work performed during 1990-2015. At that time, I was aware of
        only a fraction of the 1910s and 1920s research. As I began
        checking that research, I found Nelson's book and discovered,
        through his work, that a substantial additional body of
        important scientific history existed.<br>
        <br>
        I decided that it was of sufficient scope and importance to
        merit its own book, and this led to my critical analysis of that
        research and writing of my book Lost History. Although I have
        done my own research and investigation for Lost History, Nelson
        provided the road map for me as well as many of the
        bibliographical references that led me to the original
        scientific papers.<br>
        <b><br>
          Another Book<br>
          <br>
        </b>In August 2015, one of my editors was checking facts and
        brought Fontani's book, Lost Elements, to my attention. I was
        surprised to learn that Lost Elements broadly (but
        superficially) discussed most of the transmutation experiments
        that took place in the 1910s and 1920s. I assumed that Fontani,
        Costa and Orna had performed their own research, analysis, and
        writing. The book is well-written and appears to be a scholarly
        reference.<br>
        <br>
        I noticed that some of the facts in the Fontani-Costa-Orna book
        conflicted with facts I obtained from my own investigation. I
        began to check references that the authors had cited. Rather
        quickly, I ascertained that Fontani, Costa and Orna apparently
        had not performed their own research, analysis or writing for
        that section of their book.<br>
        <br>
        The structure of the Fontani-Costa-Orna "Modern Alchemy" section
        not only mirrors the scope of coverage in Nelson's book, it also
        duplicates, without attribution, many complete sentences and
        paragraphs; some with tiny changes and others verbatim
        duplications without attribution. The authors knew of Nelson's
        book. In their "Modern Alchemy" section, they provide more than
        100 references to sources. Yet despite directly copying an
        abundance of Nelson's text without attribution, they cite
        Nelson's 1998 book as one of their sources. They also list his
        book in their bibliography, and they say nothing more about
        Nelson.<br>
        <br>
        <b>The Same Text<br>
          <br>
        </b>Within a few pages, the pattern became clear to me. When
        Fontani, Costa and Orna discussed specific technical details of
        the 1910s and 1920s research, they copied text directly from
        Nelson without giving him any credit.<br>
        <br>
        I did a few spot checks further into the "Modern Alchemy"
        section. Not only did I find that the plagiarism in this section
        recurred, but I also found that the authors made strategic
        omissions and changes in the descriptions they appropriated from
        Nelson in order to bolster their thesis that all of these
        reported transmutations were invalid. In some cases, Fontani,
        Costa and Orna made statements that appear to be incorrect,
        though they are not fully to blame; some of these errors were in
        the original Nelson text.<br>
        <br>
        The Fontani-Costa-Orna book was produced with the financial
        support of Ente Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze. In the
        acknowledgments, the authors cite assistance from people at the
        University of Siena, the University of Florence, the University
        of Illinois, Oregon State University, the Italian Chemical
        Society, the Committee of the International Congress of History
        of Chemistry, the Italian Society for the Advancement of
        Science, the Tokyo Institute of Technology, the Japan Isotopes
        Data Institute, the Chemical Heritage Foundation, the American
        Chemical Society, and the Institute for Chemicals and Fuels from
        Alternative Sources (Canada), among others. The authors even
        acknowledged people who assisted with the book but who have
        since died.<br>
        <br>
        The authors give a special thanks to Peter van der Krogt, "who
        published the specialized Web page dedicated to the chemical
        elements and their history." Yet among the more than 100 named
        individuals, the authors did not acknowledge Robert Nelson, nor
        did Fontani, Costa and Orna identify any assistants who did
        research and writing on their behalf. I do not know whether all
        three authors were involved in the plagiarism. I have not
        examined other sections of the book for similar problems.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Nelson's Work<br>
          <br>
        </b>Nelson, on the other hand, was meticulous in citing his
        sources. He was professionally trained as paralegal who
        specialized in contracts and his expertise is evident in his
        citations of sources. His precise bibliography made it very easy
        for me to conduct my own research.<br>
        <br>
        Fontani, Costa and Orna wrote in the acknowledgments that an
        Italian version of their book was published in 2009 by the
        Italian Chemical Society. That 544-page book is De Reditu Eorum:
        Sulle Tracce Degli Elementi Scomparsi, [On Their Return: On the
        Trail of the Missing Elements], by Marco Fontani and Mariagrazia
        Costa.<br>
        <br>
        Nelson appears to have self-published his print version of Adept
        Alchemy in 1998. Not only do Fontani, Costa and Orna cite
        Nelson's book, his book is also cited by Mark Morrisson in
        Modern Alchemy, published by Oxford University Press. Nelson's
        book is cited, but not dated, in Joseph Farrell's self-published
        2009 book Philosopher's Stone. In 1998, Nexus magazine published
        one of Nelson's chapters, "The Transmutation of Mercury Into
        Gold," in its Oct.-Nov. issue.<br>
        <br>
        Nelson registered the domain name for his Web site in 2000, and
        at some point, perhaps in 2005 (but certainly no later than May
        2006), published an Internet version of his book at the address
        <br>
        <b><br>
          <a href="adept/aacont.htm"
            ">http://rexresearch.com/adept/aacont.htm</a><br>
          <br>
        </b>According to the Internet Archive
        (http://tinyurl.com/oyznkz9), Nelson's book was online by May
        10, 2006. Nelson has graciously given me permission to upload a
        copy (PDF) of his book to the New Energy Times Web site.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Insidious Changes<br>
          <br>
        </b>I began my review of the Fontani-Costa-Orna book on page 451
        and examined the next three pages in detail. Once I saw the
        pattern of blatant plagiarism, I only made spot checks on pages
        461, 468 and 476. Each of those three pages showed the same
        pattern of plagiarism and I did not feel the need to check any
        other pages.<br>
        <br>
        Fontani, Costa and Orna also made several insidious changes that
        distort and misrepresent this history. The first one I noticed
        was on page 451 of their book. They discuss the work of chemists
        Gerald Wendt and Clarence Irion at the University of Chicago.<br>
        <br>
        Fontani, Costa and Orna wrote two sentences about Wendt and
        Irion without citing sources: 1) "Their work was viewed with
        suspicion at the time and, today, cognizant physicists have
        commented that their experimental design was faulty" and 2) "The
        harsh criticism of Harkins and Allison was a hard blow for
        Wendt, one that eventually interrupted his research activities."<br>
        <br>
        Although Fontani, Costa and Orna borrowed ample text from Nelson
        on this page, they omitted Nelson's quote of Wendt which gives
        the actual reason for his and Irion's termination of the work:
        "The work was stopped by the failure of the health of the senior
        author."<br>
        <br>
        Nelson, in turn, had quoted (and cited) Wendt from a primary
        source. The Wendt/Irion paper published in the Journal of the
        American Chemical Society, and footnote 8, page 1893 reads: "The
        work was stopped by the failure of the health of the senior
        author, necessitating a complete rest for a year or more."<br>
        <br>
        On Sept. 9, 2015, before I had any idea about the plagiarism, I
        sent an e-mail to Fontani and asked him for his sources on the
        uncited statements above. Fontani replied the following day with
        a secondary source that was published 73 years after the fact:
        "We consulted the original papers of the persons you mention in
        your email, and we also consulted several secondary sources,
        listed below: Le bugie della Scienza. Perché e come gli
        scienziati imbrogliano by Federico Di Trocchio (1995), Genio
        incompreso by Federico Di Trocchio (1996)"<br>
        <br>
        That's when I began to examine the Fontani-Costa-Orna text more
        closely and found the duplications. On Fontani, Costa and Orna's
        page 468, which is significantly borrowed, I found another
        insidious change on the topic of unexplained production of neon
        and helium in vacuum tubes.<br>
        <br>
        Here is Nelson's original text: "... neon in vacuum tubes. The
        matter has not been resolved. The first such report ... "<br>
        <br>
        Here is the changed Fontani, Costa and Orna text: "... neon in
        vacuum tubes. Eventually, when the phenomena could not be
        reliably reproduced, most scientists concluded that the results
        were due to contamination. The first report ... "<br>
        <br>
        I published this report on New Energy Times on Dec. 20, 2016. At
        that time, I notified Fontani, Costa, Orna, Nelson, the Oxford
        University Press office in the U.K. Lewis, the OUP editor in the
        U.S., and Nobel Prize winner Roald Hoffman, who wrote the
        preface to Lost Elements.<br>

        Steven B. Krivit's Explorations in Nuclear Research three-book
        series describes the emergence of a new field of science, one
        that bridges chemistry and physics. The books give readers an
        understanding of low-energy nuclear reaction (LENR) research and
        its history and provide a rare behind-the-scenes look at the
        players and personalities involved.<br>
        <br>
        Lost History, written for scientists and science historians,
        covers the period from 1912 to 1927, and explores the story of
        forgotten chemical transmutation research, a precursor to modern
        low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR) research. The book tells the
        story of century-old research that has been absent from
        the&nbsp; scientific dialogue for a hundred years — research
        that is surprisingly similar to events in the modern era.<br>
        <br>
        In the formative years of atomic science in the early 20th
        century, at the same time that Niels Bohr introduced his model
        of the atom, and when nuclear science belonged to chemists and
        physicists alike, some scientists reported inexplicable
        experimental evidence of elemental transmutations. Papers were
        published in the top scientific journals of the day, including
        Physical Review, Science and Nature. <br>
        <br>
        Prominent scientists around the world participated in the
        research. The research was reported in popular newspapers and
        magazines, such as the New York Times and Scientific American.
        The book relies heavily on published journal papers.<br>
        <br>
        The experiments, using relatively simple, low-energy benchtop
        apparatus, did not use radioactive sources, so the results
        defied prevailing theory. This, coupled with the fact that the
        experiments were not easily repeated, caused most scientists by
        1930 to dismiss the entire body of research as a mistake.<br>
        <br>
        This history of research was omitted from historical references
        — until now. With the benefit of hindsight, and in light of
        modern low-energy nuclear research (LENR) and theory, this lost
        history, after a 60-year hiatus, is told here for the first
        time. Lost History is the first book that provides critical
        analyses of the original published scientific papers of the
        transmutation experiments performed between 1912 and 1927. This
        book reveals the fascinating story of these experiments and
        provides significant insights about our understanding of the
        history of physics, chemistry and nuclear science.<br>
        <br>
        Lost History chronicles the following events that have been
        either forgotten or misreported:<br>
        <br>
        From 1912 to 1914, several independent researchers detected the
        production of noble gases: helium-4, neon, argon, and an
        as-yet-unidentified element of mass-3, which we now identify as
        tritium. Two of these researchers were Nobel laureates.<br>
        <br>
        In 1922, two chemists at the University of Chicago created
        helium using the exploding electrical conductor method.<br>
        <br>
        In 1924, a German scientist accidentally found gold and possibly
        platinum in the residue of mercury vapor lamps that he had been
        using for photography.<br>
        <br>
        In 1925, scientists in Amsterdam carried out a similar
        experiment, but starting with lead, and observed the production
        of mercury and the rare element thallium.<br>
        <br>
        In 1925, a prominent Japanese scientist, in a related
        experiment, reported the production of gold and another metal
        that was later identified as platinum.<br>
        <br>
        In 1926, two German chemists pumped hydrogen gas into a chamber
        with finely divided palladium powder and reported the
        transmutation of hydrogen into helium. One of them later tried
        to dismiss the results, but he was never able to completely

        <br>
        A controversial new hypothesis that suggests our understanding
        of gravity is wrong has just passed an important first test.<br>
        <br>
        First proposed back in 2010, the new hypothesis states that
        gravity might behave and arise very differently than Einstein
        predicted, and an independent study of more than 30,000 galaxies
        has now found the first evidence to back this up. <br>
        <br>
        The hypothesis is referred to as 'Verlinde's hypothesis of
        gravity' after the theoretical physicist who came up with it,
        Erik Verlinde from the University of Amsterdam. If it can stand
        up to further testing, it could completely overhaul over a
        century of physics - including getting rid of dark matter
        altogether.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        Verlinde's approach, on the other hand, says we don't need dark
        matter at all, we just need to rethink gravity.<br>
        <br>
        As we described back in November:<br>
        <br>
        "His suggestion is that gravity isn't a fundamental force of
        nature at all, but rather an emergent phenomenon - just like
        temperature is an emergent phenomenon that arises from the
        movement of microscopic particles.<br>
        <br>
        In other words, gravity is a side effect, not the cause, of
        what's happening in the Universe."<br>

        <div align="center"><b>First test of Verlinde's theory of
            Emergent Gravity using Weak Gravitational Lensing
            measurements</b><br>
          <b>Margot M. Brouwer, et al.</b></div>
        <br>
        Verlinde (2016) proposed that the observed excess gravity in
        galaxies and clusters is the consequence of Emergent Gravity
        (EG). In this theory the standard gravitational laws are
        modified on galactic and larger scales due to the displacement
        of dark energy by baryonic matter. EG gives an estimate of the
        excess gravity (described as an apparent dark matter density) in
        terms of the baryonic mass distribution and the Hubble
        parameter. In this work we present the first test of EG using
        weak gravitational lensing, within the regime of validity of the
        current model. Although there is no direct description of
        lensing and cosmology in EG yet, we can make a reasonable
        estimate of the expected lensing signal of low redshift galaxies
        by assuming a background LambdaCDM cosmology. We measure the
        (apparent) average surface mass density profiles of 33,613
        isolated central galaxies, and compare them to those predicted
        by EG based on the galaxies' baryonic masses. To this end we
        employ the ~180 square degrees overlap of the Kilo-Degree Survey
        (KiDS) with the spectroscopic Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA)
        survey. We find that the prediction from EG, despite requiring
        no free parameters, is in good agreement with the observed
        galaxy-galaxy lensing profiles in four different stellar mass
        bins. Although this performance is remarkable, this study is
        only a first step. Further advancements on both the theoretical
        framework and observational tests of EG are needed before it can
        be considered a fully developed and solidly tested theory. <br>

        </b>Stanley Jacobs has been fascinated with ancient Egypt for as
        long as he can recall, but his obsession with one particular
        passage in one particular document started a little over 15
        years ago. At an annual meeting of Egyptology enthusiasts, he
        hunted down, on the recommendation of a patient, an ancient
        Egyptian text about surgery known as the Edwin Smith Papyrus.<br>
        <br>
        This document is “one of the two most important medical texts
        from ancient Egypt,” according to Egyptologist James Allen, and
        the case studies it contains date back 5,000 years, to the time
        when Egypt’s great pyramids were built. It’s one of the oldest
        records of surgery in the entire world, and when Jacobs first
        read through, he was impressed.<br>
        <br>
        A plastic surgeon himself, he found that most of the cases were
        about “really good reconstruction after traumatic injury, of the
        nose, the neck, the spinal cord,” and that its techniques were
        surprisingly well thought out for a millennia-old book. What
        really intrigued him, though, was a recipe at the back of the <br>
        book, titled “Transforming an Old Man Into a Youth.”<br>
        <br>
        This section of the papyrus is a long and complicated set of
        instructions for making what is, essentially, a face cream. The
        original translator of the papyrus, the Egyptologist James
        Breasted, hadn’t been much impressed by it, writing that the
        recipe “proves to be nothing more than a face paste believed to
        be efficacious in removing wrinkles.”<br>
        <br>
        As a doctor who spends a lot of time thinking about skin,
        beauty, and age, though, Jacobs wasn’t so quick to discount it.
        “I realized that if they’re that serious about their surgical
        treatments, they’re probably serious about this,” he says. <br>
        <br>
        Jacobs wanted to try this recipe out himself, but when he
        examined the recipe, he ran into a problem. The key ingredient
        was “hemayet-fruit,” and he had no inkling of what that might
        be...<br>
        <br>
        To Jacobs, the recipe for transforming a man to a youth did seem
        to involve some serious science. The key ingredient, hemayet, is
        subjected to a complicated series of manual and chemical
        procedures—husked, winnowed, sifted, boiled in water, dried,
        washed, ground, and boiled again. As much as a recipe, it looked
        like a set of chemistry instructions.<br>
        <br>
        The first translation of hemayet he found, though, identified it
        as fenugreek, which didn’t make sense to Jacobs. Fenugreek is a
        wispy plant, its seeds easily harvested: it wouldn’t have needed
        to be winnowed and boiled so aggressively. But no one seemed to
        know what else it might be. Jacobs started calling <br>
        Egyptologist after Egyptologist, asking if they knew what this
        word might mean, and no one did. Finally, about eight years
        after he first became curious about the recipe, someone directed
        him to Allen, who in 2005 had published a new translation of the
        papyrus.<br>
        <br>
        Allen had an answer, based on the work of an earlier scholar,
        more experienced than the one who had guessed fenugreek. Hemayet
        was bitter almonds...<br>
        <br>
        But once Jacobs and his colleagues processed the nuts, just as
        the papyrus instructed, they found that all that washing leached
        the poisonous compounds from the almonds. The bitterness
        leaving, Jacobs says, meant the poison was gone, too.<br>
        <br>
        After the transformation, one of the compounds produced from the
        nuts was mandalic acid. For a dermatologist, this compound, a
        known extract of bitter almonds, would already have been
        familiar — starting just a few years before Jacobs got
        interested in the papyrus, dermatologists had started testing it
        as a treatment for acne and other skin problems. For Jacobs, it
        was a revelation: since first discovering the secret of hemayet,
        he has developed a patented formula for mandalic acid-based skin
        care products and written about his quest in a forthcoming book,
        Nefertiti’s Secret...<br>

            Egypt-Inspired Skin Care Line Received a Patent in October</b><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        After studying the 3,600-year-old Edwin Smith Papyrus, San
        Francisco plastic surgeon Dr. Stanley Jacobs blended modern
        technology with ancient knowledge to revitalize an ancient serum
        for youthful skin<br>
        <br>
        Long fascinated by aesthetics, Ancient Egyptian culture, and
        medicine, San Francisco plastic surgeon Dr. Stanley Jacobs
        combined his passions into a singular, eight-year endeavor that
        ultimately resulted in the creation of a unique skin care line
        and securing a patent awarded in October 2016.<br>
        <br>
        The process began when Dr. Jacobs noticed a section titled
        "Transforming an old man into a youth" in the famous Edwin Smith
        Papyrus, a scroll considered to be the world's oldest document
        exploring the subject of surgery. The hieratic script revealed a
        formula for facial rejuvenation, though one ingredient --
        "hemayet" -- proved to be a puzzle. Dr. Jacobs worked with other
        experts to determine that hemayet referred to a substance made
        from bitter almonds, today known as mandelic acid.<br>
        <br>
        This discovery formed the foundation of the Stanley Jacobs MD®
        Skin Care line, anchored by Visco-elastic Transforming Serum and
        further developed to include the Visco-elastic Transforming
        Creme and Transforming Synergy Peel. Dr. Jacobs worked with
        Jules Zecchino, a chemist formerly of Estee Lauder, to create
        the <br>
        line.<br>
        <br>
        In November 2013, a patent was filed for a "tritightening skin
        care formulation" comprised of "at least one hydrophilic
        polymer, at least one desquamatory agent and alpha hydroxyl
        acid." The patent -- number 9,474,708 -- was granted on Oct. 25,
        2016.<br>
        <br>
        Research and testing included measurements of skin elasticity
        before, during, and after treatments, made by a Cutometer™. This
        vacuum-powered German device pulls up skin and measures how far
        it stretches, then releases it and measures the rate at which it
        returns to its pre-pulled state. Results of clinical trials
        showed that applying the three products to skin yielded a 43
        percent increase in elasticity.<br>
        <br>
        Improved elasticity reduces lines and wrinkles. Mandelic acid
        can also even out pigmentation and minimize skin breakouts...<br>

        Medical Biomagnetism, also called Biomagnetic Pair, is a natural
        therapy that proposes diagnosing and treating a large number of
        illnesses through the use of pairs of magnets of medium
        intensity that seek to equalize the organism’s pH level. Dr.
        Isaac Goiz Durán has been claiming since Dr. Broeringmeyer´s
        death to be its discoverer (See below the alternative&nbsp;
        theory).<br>
        <br>
        According to medical biomagnetism, a large number of illnesses,
        including cancer and many other complex diseases, are associated
        with fundamental alterations in the pH level in the internal
        organs and with the presence of viruses, bacteria, fungus,
        parasites, toxins, and other harmful factors. The development of
        <br>
        illness cannot happen with a balanced pH level.<br>
        <br>
        This new complementary therapy identifies diseases according to
        their genuine etiology and not just their manifestation (see the
        Article). Once the symptoms or signs of illness have appeared,
        it is also capable of reestablishing the acidic-alkaline balance
        in the organism and restore health, attacking the cause of the
        problem and not just the symptomatology.<br>
        <br>
        The Biomagnetic Pair therapy is different from magnetic therapy
        and magnetic acupuncture, and it adopts a new paradigm. Unlike
        these last two, the Biomagnetic Pair uses pairs of magnets of
        opposite charges to depolarize areas in the body that are
        unbalanced due to pathogens or other factors that resonate
        energetically and vibrationally. It is also different in that it
        has the ability to diagnose the etiology and combat the real
        cause of the disease, especially viruses.<br>
        <br>
        The Biomagnetic Pair is a clean and innocuous system. And still
        more importantly, it is capable of detecting, diagnosing, and
        correcting an abnormal condition even before the symptomatologic
        manifestation. It is, therefore, a preventive therapy, as well
        as healing.<br>
        <br>
        The Biomagnetic Pair Therapy is indeed claimed to have been
        discovered by mexican Dr. Isaac Goiz Durán in 1988. However,
        there are certain indications that would point to Dr. Richard
        Broeringmeyer as to the real discoverer of this therapy.
        According to these new indications, Dr. Goiz would have just
        been its main <br>
        developer after Dr. Broeringmeyer´s death.<br>
        <br>
        Richard Broeringmeyer was a prominent scientist from Kentucky,
        USA. He was NASA Chief Medical in the 1980s. He had a
        disciplined, meticulous and patient scientific mind. He was the
        person responsible for deciding what astronauts could fly into
        space or not and examining the physiological constants and
        physical condition of the astronauts before going to space and
        after returning.<br>
        <br>
        Dr. Broeringmeyer began to realize in the 80s that astronauts
        returning from space would do so with one of their two legs
        longer than the other one, by the fact of having been exposed to
        a changing magnetic field.<br>
        <br>
        Dr. Broeringmeyer began working methodically with these early
        observations. He discovered how the legs changed in length when
        exposed to magnetic fields applied in certain unbalanced points.
        He was careful and consistent in his writings, his essays were
        rigorous and well written, honoring his prestigious position.
        And so Dr. Broeringmeyer went gradually and painstakingly
        discovering one by one the first 150 Biomagnetic Pairs and
        developing the theory of what is now known as the Biomagnetic
        Pair Therapy.<br>
        <br>
        Even if Dr. Broeringmeyer had been seriously forbidden and
        warned against talking about his revolutionary new discoveries,
        he nevertheless traveled to Mexico City to deliver a lecture for
        doctors at a large public hospital in Mexico City because he
        knew the importance of his discovery. But unfortunately, he was
        probably being closely watched too.<br>
        <br>
        Dr. Goiz attended that lecture and showed special interest in
        the topics presented at the conference. For this reason or
        another, it seems that Dr. Broeringmeyer allowed exclusive
        access to Dr. Goiz (only Dr. Goiz knew about it) to all his
        priceless writings that formed the theory of the Biomagnetic
        Pair therapy so that they could be kept in custody just in case
        “something” happened to him.<br>
        <br>
        And indeed, very shortly after that lecture, Dr. Richard
        Broeringmeyer surprinsingly died in strange circumstances. Very
        little is known nowadays about Dr. Richard Broeringmeyer´s life
        and work, which is not consistent with the important position
        that he held for years.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, according to this theory, Dr. Goiz would have taken
        advantage of the big and revolutionary work of Dr. Broeringmeyer
        and would have just developed it further, especially in terms of
        discovering new pairs.<br>

            flight envelope and roll control of small drones</b><br>
          <b>M. Di Luca, S. Mintchev, G. Heitz, F. Noca, D. Floreano</b><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <b>Abstract -- </b>Small-winged drones can face highly varied
        aerodynamic requirements, such as high manoeuvrability for
        flight among obstacles and high wind resistance for constant
        ground speed against strong headwinds that cannot all be
        optimally addressed by a single aerodynamic profile. Several
        bird species solve this problem by changing the shape of their
        wings to adapt to the different aerodynamic requirements. Here,
        we describe a novel morphing wing design composed of artificial
        feathers that can rapidly modify its geometry to fulfil
        different aerodynamic requirements. We show that a fully
        deployed configuration enhances manoeuvrability while a folded
        configuration offers low drag at high speeds and is beneficial
        in strong headwinds. We also show that asymmetric folding of the
        wings can be used for roll control of the drone. The aerodynamic
        performance of the morphing wing is characterized in
        simulations, in wind tunnel measurements and validated in
        outdoor flights with a small drone.<br>

            pattern on force generation of a bat-inspired membrane wing</b><br>
          <b>Cosima Schunk, Sharon M. Swartz, Kenneth S. Breuer</b><br>
        </div>
        <b><br>
        </b><b>Abstract</b> -- Aspect ratio (AR) is one parameter used
        to predict the flight performance of a bat species based on wing
        shape. Bats with high AR wings are thought to have superior
        lift-to-drag ratios and are therefore predicted to be able to
        fly faster or to sustain longer flights. By contrast, bats with
        lower AR wings <br>
        are usually thought to exhibit higher manoeuvrability. However,
        the half-span ARs of most bat wings fall into a narrow range of
        about 2.5–4.5. Furthermore, these predictions do not take into
        account the wide variation in flapping motion observed in bats.
        To examine the influence of different stroke patterns, we
        measured lift and drag of highly compliant membrane wings with
        different bat-relevant ARs. A two degrees of freedom shoulder
        joint allowed for independent control of flapping amplitude and
        wing sweep. We tested five models with the same variations of
        stroke patterns, flapping frequencies and wind speed velocities.
        Our results suggest that within the relatively small AR range of
        bat wings, AR has no clear effect on force generation. Instead,
        the generation of lift by our simple model mostly depends on
        wingbeat frequency, flapping amplitude and freestream velocity;
        drag is mostly affected by the flapping amplitude.<br>

            leading-edge vortex in flapping flight</b><br>
          <b>Nathan Phillips, Kevin Knowles, Richard J. Bomphrey</b><br>
        </div>
        <b><br>
          Abstract -- </b>The wings of many insect species including
        crane flies and damselflies are petiolate (on stalks), with the
        wing planform beginning some distance away from the wing hinge,
        rather than at the hinge. The aerodynamic impact of flapping
        petiolate wings is relatively unknown, particularly on the
        formation of the lift-augmenting leading-edge vortex (LEV): a
        key flow structure exploited by many insects, birds and bats to
        enhance their lift coefficient. We investigated the aerodynamic
        implications of petiolation P using particle image velocimetry
        flow field measurements on an array of rectangular wings of
        aspect ratio 3 and petiolation values of P = 1–3. The wings were
        driven using a mechanical device, the ‘Flapperatus’, to produce
        highly repeatable insect-like kinematics. The wings maintained a
        constant Reynolds number of 1400 and dimensionless stroke
        amplitude ?* (number of chords traversed by the wingtip) of 6.5
        across all test cases. Our results showed that for more
        petiolate wings the LEV is generally larger, stronger in
        circulation, and covers a greater area of the wing surface,
        particularly at the mid-span and inboard locations early in the
        wing stroke cycle. In each case, the LEV was initially arch-like
        in form with its outboard end terminating in a focus-sink on the
        wing surface, before transitioning to become continuous with the
        tip vortex thereafter. In the second half of the wing stroke,
        more petiolate wings exhibit a more detached LEV, with
        detachment initiating at approximately 70% and 50% span for P =
        1 and 3, respectively. As a consequence, lift coefficients based
        on the LEV are higher in the first half of the wing stroke for
        petiolate wings, but more comparable in the second half.
        Time-averaged LEV lift coefficients show a general rise with
        petiolation over the range tested.<br>

          <b>Harm van Bakel, et al.</b><br>

        </div>
        <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Cannabis sativa has been cultivated throughout human history as
        a source of fiber, oil and food, and for its medicinal and
        intoxicating properties. Selective breeding has produced
        cannabis plants for specific uses, including high-potency
        marijuana strains and hemp cultivars for fiber and seed
        production. The <br>
        molecular biology underlying cannabinoid biosynthesis and other
        traits of interest is largely unexplored.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Results</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        We sequenced genomic DNA and RNA from the marijuana strain
        Purple Kush using shortread approaches. We report a draft
        haploid genome sequence of 534 Mb and a transcriptome of 30,000
        genes. Comparison of the transcriptome of Purple Kush with that
        of the hemp cultivar 'Finola' revealed that many genes encoding
        <br>
        proteins involved in cannabinoid and precursor pathways are more
        highly expressed in Purple Kush than in 'Finola'. The exclusive
        occurrence of D9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase in the
        Purple Kush transcriptome, and its replacement by cannabidiolic
        acid synthase in 'Finola', may explain why the <br>
        psychoactive cannabinoid ?9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is
        produced in marijuana but not in hemp. <br>
        <br>
        Resequencing the hemp cultivars 'Finola' and 'USO-31' showed
        little difference in gene copy numbers of cannabinoid pathway
        enzymes. However, single nucleotide variant analysis uncovered a
        relatively high level of variation among four cannabis types,
        and supported a separation of marijuana and hemp.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Conclusions</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        The availability of the Cannabis sativa genome enables the study
        of a multifunctional plant that occupies a unique role in human

        <b><br>
        </b><b>Summary:</b><br>
        <br>
        Sounds, such as music and noise, are capable of reliably
        affecting individuals' moods and emotions, possibly by
        regulating brain dopamine, a neurotransmitter strongly involved
        in emotional behavior and mood regulation. However, the
        relationship of sound environments with mood and emotions is
        highly variable across individuals. A putative source of
        variability is genetic background, a study shows...<br>
        <br>
        ...In more details, results showed mood improvement after music
        exposure in GG subjects and mood deterioration after noise
        exposure in GT subjects. Moreover, the music as opposed to noise
        environment decreased the striatal activity of GT subjects as
        well as the prefrontal activity of GG subjects while processing
        emotional faces...<br>
        <br>
        ..."This study represents the first use of the imaging genetics
        approach in the field of music and sounds in general. We are
        really excited about our results because they suggest that even
        a non-pharmacological intervention such as music, might regulate
        mood and emotional responses at both the behavioral and neuronal
        level," says Professor Elvira Brattico.... <br>

        <br>
        NASA’s much-hyped EM Drive – often described as a ‘Warp Drive’ –
        made shockwaves around the world, with a propulsion system which
        seems to defy the laws of physics.<br>
        <br>
        But now China claims not only to have a rival device – but that
        it’s in space already, and working.<br>
        <br>
        The engine works by bouncing microwaves around inside an
        enclosed container – and could revolutionise space travel,
        allowing spaceships to reach Mars in weeks.<br>
        <br>
        The engine has no exhaust, and would outperform any current
        booster used in space – and NASA tests showed it was working
        earlier this year.<br>
        <br>
        But a team from the China Academy of Space Technology has said
        that NASA’s results ‘re-confirm’ their own work – and plan to
        use the drive in satellites ‘as quickly as possible’.<br>
        <br>
        The team claim that the thruster has already been tested in low
        Earth orbit on board China’s Tiangong-2 space station. <br>

            Double-Entry Bookkeeping &amp; Money Creation</b><b> </b><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        Colin McKay is an Australian born entrepreneur living in New
        South Wales. From 2010-2014 he blogged on finance, economics,
        and Australian politics and in 2010 he served as board member
        and bookkeeper for the Center for Economic Stability. In 2011 he
        presented his own concept for Deror, an alternate currency <br>
        ecosystem where "everyone is their own central banker.” McKay
        blogs at Psalmistice.com and is presently writing a book tracing
        the foundations of double-entry accounting to ancient Semitic
        cults.<br>
        <br>
        Colin is with us to provide a detailed overview of his essay
        “The Money Shot: Even Banking Is All About Sex,” which presents
        the history and mechanisms of el modo vinegia (“the Venetian
        method”) of double-entry bookkeeping. He explains how this
        Hermetic-Kabbalist system for calculating debts that was
        formalized during the early Renaissance period has been used for
        deliberately concealing the immoral practice of usury in the
        banking system. Colin describes how the ancient Semitic worship
        of the androgynous goddess Inanna-Ishtar and the principle of
        the unity of opposites (male/female, order/disorder,
        creation/destruction), used in combination with trickery in the
        form of deceitful words, is the fundamental underlying concept
        of creating “money” out of nothing. He illustrates how this
        “magick” is represented by the Hermetic-Kabbalist alchemical
        symbol of the hexagram (Seal of Solomon) and breaks down the
        two-sided, sexual nature of the process at the heart of usury.
        Then, we discuss Professor Richard Werner’s investigations of
        the central banking system in Japan and his legal perspective of
        <br>
        credit. Colin also talks about the practice of money lending
        within the Catholic church and the 14th century transformation
        of modern banking that occurred when the church adopted the
        Venetian method.<br>
        <br>
        In the members’ segment, Colin addresses the importance of
        understanding the mechanisms of the central banking system and
        the creation of credit by private banks. He explains how the
        predatory banking system’s core fraud revolves around the
        changing of labels that lead borrowers to mistake substance for
        form. Then, Colin introduces his alternate currency, Deror, an
        honor based system that can be understood by looking at ancient
        Cuneiform record keeping, which used a bartering system of IOUs
        overseen by central authorities such as temple priests. He lays
        out how the algorithm works on the concept of a triangular
        balance sheet, with credits on one side, debts on another, and
        an honor rating at the top, and he gives examples of the
        exchange as a social interaction based on trust. Colin says the
        idea behind this system is that everyone is able to be a “money
        god” with infinite potential to create money. Later, we look at
        the idea that Bitcoin shares similar problems with conventional
        money in that its worth is based in a value that can be
        increased through saving rather than spending. At the end, Colin
        illuminates the occult concept of expanding or lengthening
        balance sheets as a metaphor for the power of lenders over those
        they manipulate.<br>

        Eating ham or sausages four times a week could worsen asthma

        The research suggests the 5.4million people in the UK who suffer

        much cured or processed meat.<br>
        <br>
        Scientists believe the nitrites used to process cured meat such

        </div>
        <br>
        One of the most basic things we are taught in school science
        classes is that water can exist in three different states,
        either as solid ice, liquid water, or vapour gas. But an
        international team of scientists have recently found signs that
        liquid water might actually come in two different states.<br>
        <br>
        Writing in an experimental paper, published in the International
        Journal of Nanotechnology, the researchers were surprised to
        find a number of physical properties of water change their
        behaviour between 50℃ and 60℃. This sign of a potential change
        to a second liquid state could spark a heated discussion in the
        scientific community. And, if confirmed, it could have
        implications for a range of fields, including nanotechnology and
        biology.<br>

        Abstract: This work reviews several properties of liquid water,
        including the dielectric constant and the proton-spin lattice
        relaxation, and draws attention to a bilinear behaviour defining
        a crossover in the temperature range 50 ± 10°C between two
        possible states in liquid water. The existence of these two
        states in liquid water plays an important role in nanometric and
        biological systems. For example, the optical properties of
        metallic (gold and silver) nanoparticles dispersed in water,
        used as nanoprobes, and the emission properties of CdTe quantum
        dots (QDs), used for fluorescence bioimaging and tumour
        targeting, show a singular behaviour in this temperature range.
        In addition, the structural changes in liquid water may be
        associated with the behaviour of biological macromolecules in
        aqueous solutions and in particular with protein denaturation.<br>

        Scientists, including several from the University of California,
        Riverside, have developed a transparent, self-healing, highly
        stretchable conductive material that can be electrically
        activated to power artificial muscles and could be used to
        improve batteries, electronic devices, and robots.<br>
        <br>
        The findings, which were published today in the journal Advanced
        Material, represent the first time scientists have created an
        ionic conductor, meaning materials that ions can flow through,
        that is transparent, mechanically stretchable, and
        self-healing...<br>

        A class of devices enabled by ionic conductors is highly
        stretchable, fully transparent to light of all colors,
        biocompatible or biodegradable, and capable of operation at
        frequencies beyond 10 kilohertz and voltages above 10 kilovolts.
        These devices enabled by ionic conductors can be used as large
        strain <br>
        actuators, full-range loudspeakers, as strain or pressure
        sensors and as stretchable interconnects. The electromechanical
        transduction is achieved without electrochemical reaction. When
        large stretchability and high optical transmittance are
        required, the ionic conductors have lower sheet resistance than
        all existing electronic conductors.<br>

        A method and system for preheating internal combustion engine
        fuel to an optimum temperature before introducing the fuel into
        the carburetion system. It has been found that an engine fuel
        such as gasoline will have an optimum temperature at the point
        of carburetion for maximum combustion efficiency. A heat <br>
        exchanger extracts heat from hot engine coolant to add heat to
        the fuel. A thermostatic switch and solenoid valve controls
        coolant flow to maintain the optimum temperature. Thermal
        insulation is provided around the fuel supply system and the
        heat exchanger to prevent engine heat from causing the fuel
        temperature to exceed the optimum temperature.<br>
        <br>
        As may be noted from the graph of FIG. 1, a sharp increase in
        miles per gallon was obtained between 115 DEG and 120 DEG F.
        with the optimum mileage of 25 miles to the gallon obtained at
        approximately 117 DEG F. The efficiency of the engine decreased
        rapidly above 120 DEG F. dropping to about 9 miles per gallon <br>
        at 140 DEG F. The fuel temperature was controlled during the
        test by means of the fuel preheat system of my invention to be
        described in more detail below. Without the system of the
        invention installed, this vehicle averages a fuel consumption of
        about 17 miles per gallon at 55 miles per hour under the <br>
        conditions of the above described tests.<br>

            see the past, present and future all at the same time’</b><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        ...According to reports, in 1895 Tesla made a shocking discovery
        suggesting that time and space could be influenced by magnetic
        fields. Allegedly, this idea –that one could alter time and
        space by magnetic fields — led to a number of experiments that
        allegedly gave birth to the infamous Philadelphia project –
        considered mostly a hoax.<br>
        <br>
        It is believed that Tesla worked on the idea of time travel,
        discovering amazing results along the way. <br>
        <br>
        Using magnetic fields, Tesla found that the space-time barrier
        could be ‘altered’ and accessed by creating a ‘trojan horse’
        which eventually led to a different time.<br>
        <br>
        However, it is still unclear whether or not Tesla actually
        achieved this as there are no documents whatsoever that prove –
        or for that case — disprove something like this occurred...<br>
        <br>
        In 1895, a witness found Tesla at a small coffee shop looking
        shaken and disturbed. His assistant claimed that Tesla was
        almost electrocuted by a machine as Tesla was trying to solve
        the time travel riddle.<br>
        <br>
        After nearly dying, Tesla claimed he had found himself in an
        entirely different time and space window, where he could see the
        past, present, and future at the same time while staying within
        the artificially created ‘magnetic field.’<br>
        <br>
        Regrettably, there are no documents –which we were able to find–
        to back up these claims. However, if Tesla tried to achieve time
        travel, he surely wasn’t the only scientist to try.<br>

            made for 2016 and the future</b><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        She is called the Nostradamus of the Balkans, and with good
        reason. Baba, Vanga, the blind Bulgarian clairvoyant, who died
        20 years ago, is believed to have predicted the rise of the
        ISIS, the fall of the twin towers, the 2004 Tsunami, and the
        global warming, among a host of other events...<br>
        <br>
        Here are 13 predictions that the Blind Baba made for 2016 and
        beyond:<br>
        <br>
        Barack Obama will be the last president of the US: Baba Vanga
        had predicted that the 44th US president would be an African
        American, but she had also added that he would be the last one.
        According to her, he would leave office at a time when the
        country would be in economic ruins, and there would be a huge
        divide between the northern and southern states – as was the
        case during the American Civil War.<br>
        <br>
        Europe will cease to exist: According to Baba Vanga, the
        continent will cease to exist by 2016, and all that would remain
        will be empty spaces and wasteland, nearly devoid of any form of
        life. She is reported to have said that chemical weapons would
        be used by extremists against Europe.<br>
        <br>
        Muslims will invade Europe: The blind mystic had also predicted
        that Muslims will invade Europe, and there will be widespread
        destruction by extremists, which will go on for many years,
        until the continent ceases to exist. She had also predicted that
        a Great Muslim War will begin in Syria. <br>
        <br>
        China will become the new super power: As per her predictions,
        China is set to become the new superpower in 2018, bringing an
        end to the United States and its economy. According to her, the
        exploiters (the developed nations) will become the exploited
        (the third world). In 2011, the International Monetary Fund had
        also predicted that China’s economy will overtake that of the US
        in 2016, emerging as the new superpower.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        Hunger eradication: Baba Vanga has predicted that hunger will
        get eradicated sometime between 2025 and 2028.<br>
        <br>
        On to Venus: Humans will travel to Venus, according to the Baba,
        in search of new energy sources. They might even set up a colony
        there.<br>
        <br>
        Rome as the capital of the Islamic caliphate: Islam will finish
        invading the whole of Europe by 2043, and Rome will be the
        capital of the new caliphate.<br>
        <br>
        Ice caps melting: According to the Baba, ice caps will melt by
        2045. The rate at which the ice caps are melting already due to
        global warming, does seem to suggest the same.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        Cloning of organs: As per Baba Vanga’s predictions, body organs
        will be cloned in 2046, and that would be the easiest method of
        treatment.<br>
        <br>
        US attacking Muslim dominated Europe: By 2066, the US will
        attack Muslim dominated Europe using climate change weapon, and
        will try to retake Rome and bring back Christianity.<br>
        <br>
        The return of Communism: By 2076, communism will return to
        Europe and the rest of the world. <br>
        <br>
        Underwater civilisations: By 2130, civilisations will learn how
        to live under water, with the help of aliens. <br>
        <br>
        The death of the Earth: By 3797, everything on Earth will cease
        to exist. However, humans will be advanced enough to move to a
        new star system.<br>
