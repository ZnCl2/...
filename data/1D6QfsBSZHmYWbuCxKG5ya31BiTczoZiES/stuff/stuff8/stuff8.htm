      <br>
      A revolution in cancer treatment could soon be underway following
      a breakthrough that may lead to a dramatic improvement in cancer
      survival rates.<br>
      <br>
      A new study at the University of Warwick, published today in the
      journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition, has developed a
      new drug that can manipulate the body’s natural signalling and
      energy systems, allowing the body to attack and shut down
      cancerous cells.<br>
      <br>
      Called ZL105, the drug is a compound based on the precious metal
      iridium. The study has found ZL105 could potentially replace
      currently used anticancer drugs, which become less effective over
      time, cause a wide-range of side-effects and damage healthy cells
      as well as cancerous.<br>
      <br>
      Commenting on the breakthrough, University of Warwick researcher
      and study co-author Dr Isolda Romero-Canelon said “The
      energy-producing machinery in cancer cells works to the limit as
      it attempts to keep up with quick proliferation and invasion. This
      makes cancer cells susceptible to minor changes in the cell
      ‘power-house’. Our drug pushes cancer cells over the limit causing
      them to slow and shut down, whilst normal cells can cope with its
      effects”.<br>
      <br>
      Preliminary data indicate that the novel drug may be ten times
      more effective in treating ovarian, colon, melanoma, renal, and
      some breast cancers, according to data obtained by the US National
      Cancer Institute. The researchers now aim to expand the study to
      cancers that are inherently resistant to existing drugs and to
      those which have developed resistance after a first round of
      chemotherapy treatments.<br>
      <br>
      Study co-author Professor Peter J. Sadler said “Existing cancer
      treatments often become less effective after the first course, as
      cancer cells learn how they are being attacked. The drug we have
      developed is a catalyst and is active at low doses. It can attack
      cancer cells in multiple ways at the same time, so the cancer is
      less able to adapt to the treatment. This means the new drugs
      could be much more effective than existing treatments.”<br>
      <br>
      “Platinum-based drugs are used in nearly 50% of all
      chemotherapeutic regimens, exert their activity by damaging DNA
      and cannot select between cancerous and non-cancerous cells,
      leading to a wide-range of side-effects from renal failure to
      neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, nausea and vomiting.<br>
      <br>
      “In contrast, the new iridium-based drug is specifically designed
      not to attack DNA, but to have a novel mechanism of action,
      meaning that it could not only dramatically slow down and halt
      cancer growth, but also significantly reduce the side effects
      suffered by patients” argues Professor Sadler.<br>
      <br>
      This research could also lead to substantial improvements in
      cancer survival rates. “Current statistics indicate that one in
      every three people will develop some kind of cancer during their
      life time, moreover approximately one woman dies of ovarian cancer
      every two hours in the UK according to Cancer Research UK .It is
      clear that a new generation of drugs is necessary to save more
      lives and our research points to a highly effective way of
      defeating cancerous cells” said Dr Romero-Canelon.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Platinum complexes are the most widely used anticancer drugs;
      however, new generations of agents are needed. The
      organoiridium(III) complex [(?5-Cpxbiph)Ir(phpy)(Cl)] (1-Cl),
      which contains p-bonded biphenyltetramethylcyclopentadienyl
      (Cpxbiph) and C^N-chelated phenylpyridine (phpy) ligands,
      undergoes rapid hydrolysis of the chlorido ligand. In contrast,
      the pyridine complex [(?5-Cpxbiph)Ir(phpy)(py)]+ (1-py) aquates
      slowly, and is more potent (in nanomolar amounts) than both 1-Cl
      and cisplatin towards a wide range of cancer cells. The pyridine
      ligand protects 1-py from rapid reaction with intracellular
      glutathione. The high potency of 1-py correlates with its ability
      to increase substantially the level of reactive oxygen species
      (ROS) in cancer cells. The unprecedented ability of these iridium
      complexes to generate H2O2 by catalytic hydride transfer from the
      coenzyme NADH to oxygen is demonstrated. Such organoiridium
      complexes are promising as a new generation of anticancer drugs
      for effective oxidant therapy.<br>

      <br>
      <b> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0002] A significant development of organometallic chemistry in
      recent years has been the increasing use of
      pentamethylcyclopentadienyl compounds. Not only are such compounds
      usually more soluble in organic solvents and more readily
      crystallized than their unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl analogs,
      but they are generally more stable as a result of the steric and
      electron-donation effects of the five methyl groups. This is
      particularly so for the
      ([eta]&lt;5&gt;-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)iridium complexes,
      where the [eta]&lt;5&gt;-C5Me5 acts as an excellent ligand toward
      Ir(III) since it is displaced only with considerable
      difficulty.&lt;1 &gt;<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Sheldrick's group in Germany has studied the biological
      activity of ([eta]&lt;5&gt;-pentamethyl cyclopentadienyl)iridium
      complexes with polypyridyl ligands. Their work focuses on the
      intercalative binding properties of polypyridyl (pp) ligands
      (pp=dpq, dppz and dppn) into DNA. Recently they have showed that
      [([eta]&lt;5&gt;-C5Me5)IrCl(dppz)](CF3SO3) and
      [([eta]&lt;5&gt;-C5Me5)Ir((NMe2)2CS)(dppn)](CF3SO3)2 possess in
      vitro cytotoxic activity towards MCF-7 and HT-29 cancer cell
      lines, while [([eta]&lt;5&gt;-C5Me5)Ir(phen)Cl](CF3SO3) and
      [([eta]&lt;5&gt;-C5Me5) Ir(en)Cl](CF3SO3) are inactive against
      MCF-7 (breast cancer).&lt;2 &gt;Furthermore they have studied the
      influence of polypyridyl ligands (pp=dpq, dppz and dppn) and
      monodentate ligands (L-Cl, (NH2)2CS, (NMe2)2CS) on DNA
      intercalation (see FIG. 1).&lt;3 &gt;They also found that the
      complexes [IrCl3(DMSO)(pp)] (pp=phen, dpq, dppz, dppn), (FIG. 1),
      are potent cytotoxic agents toward the human cell lines MCF-7 and
      HT-29 and their IC50 values are dependent on the size of the
      polypyridyl ligands.&lt;4 &gt;Their work on iridium and rhodium
      polypyridyl complexes of general formula [Me(hal)3(sol)(pp)], in
      which hal is a halogenide and sol is a solvent, is described in
      EP2072521.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] DNA binding of the type
      [([eta]&lt;5&gt;-C5Me5)Ir(Aa)(dppz)](CF3SO3)n containing
      S-coordinated amino acids has been studied and X-ray structure of
      [([eta]&lt;5&gt;-C5Me5)Ir(9-EtG)(phen)](CF3SO3)2 has been
      reported.&lt;5 &gt;<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The biological activity of three novel indium(III)
      complexes with 1,2-naphthoquinone-1-oximato ligand are also
      described.&lt;6 &gt;The complex [([eta]&lt;5&gt;-C5Me5)Ir
      (pyTz)Cl]&lt;+ &gt;containing the 2-(pyridine-2-yl)thiazole (pyTz)
      N,N-chelating ligand is reported to be inactive towards human
      ovarian cancer cell lines A2780 and A2780cisR
      (cisplatin-resistant).&lt;7 &gt;<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0006] The present invention is based on studies on for
      monofunctional Ir&lt;III &gt;complexes

      Researchers have discovered that a substance called Vacquinol-1
      makes cells from glioblastoma, the most aggressive type of brain
      tumor, literally explode. The established treatments that are
      available for glioblastoma include surgery, radiation and
      chemotherapy. But even if this treatment is given the average
      survival is just 15 months. It is therefore critical to find
      better treatments for malignant brain tumors.<br>

      Researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden have discovered
      that a substance called Vacquinol-1 makes cells from glioblastoma,
      the most aggressive type of brain tumour, literally explode. When
      mice were given the substance, which can be given in tablet form,
      tumour growth was reversed and survival was prolonged. The
      findings are published in the journal Cell.<br>
      <br>
      The established treatments that are available for glioblastoma
      include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. But even if this
      treatment is given the average survival is just 15 months. It is
      therefore critical to find better treatments for malignant brain
      tumours.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers at Karolinska Institutet and colleagues at Uppsala
      University have discovered an entirely new mechanism to kill
      tumour cells in glioblastoma. Researchers in an initial stage have
      exposed tumour cells to a wide range of molecules. If the cancer
      cells died, the molecule was considered of interest for further
      studies, which initially applied to over 200 kinds of molecules.
      Following extensive studies, a single molecule has been identified
      as being of particular interest. The researchers wanted to find
      out why it caused cancer cell death.<br>
      <br>
      It was found that the molecule gave the cancer cells an
      uncontrolled vacuolization, a process in which the cell carries
      substances from outside the cell into its interior. This carrying
      process is made via the vacuoles, which can roughly be described
      as blisters or bags consisting of cell membranes. The process is
      similar to what was behind last year's Nobel Prize in physiology
      or medicine, the discovery that describes how cellular vesicles
      move things from the interior of the cell to its surface.<br>
      <br>
      When cancer cells were filled with a large amount of vacuoles, the
      cell membranes (the outer wall of the cell) collapsed and the cell
      simply exploded and necrotized.<br>
      <br>
      "This is an entirely new mechanism for cancer treatment. A
      possible medicine based on this principle would therefore attack
      the glioblastoma in an entirely new way. This principle may also
      work for other cancer diseases, we have not really explored this
      yet," says Patrik Ernfors, professor of tissue biology at the
      Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics at Karolinska
      Institutet.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers made mice that had human glioblastoma cells
      transplanted ingest the substance for five days. The average
      survival was about 30 days for the control group that did not
      receive the substance. Of those who received the substance six of
      eight mice were still alive after 80 days. The study was then
      considered of such interest that the scientific journal wanted to
      publish the article immediately.<br>
      <br>
      "We now want to try to take this discovery in basic research
      through preclinical development and all the way to the clinic. The
      goal is to get into a phase 1 trial," says Patrik Ernfors.<br>
      <br>

      Council, the Swedish Cancer Society, the Swedish Foundation for
      Strategic Research, the Brain Foundation, Hållsten's Research

      Cancer cells -- and not normal cells -- can be killed by
      eliminating either the FAS receptor, also known as CD95, or its
      binding component, CD95 ligand, scientists have demonstrated. The
      discovery seems counterintuitive because CD95 has previously been
      defined as a tumor suppressor. To confirm the importance of CD95
      for the survival of cancer cells in vivo, the researchers removed
      it from tissues in animal models and found that cancer could not
      form.<br>
      <br>
      Northwestern Medicine scientists have demonstrated that cancer
      cells -- and not normal cells -- can be killed by eliminating
      either the FAS receptor, also known as CD95, or its binding
      component, CD95 ligand.<br>
      <br>
      "The discovery seems counterintuitive because CD95 has previously
      been defined as a tumor suppressor," said lead investigator Marcus
      Peter, professor in medicine-hematology/Oncology at Northwestern
      University Feinberg School of Medicine. "But when we removed it
      from cancer cells, rather than proliferate, they died."<br>
      <br>
      The findings were published March 20 in Cell Reports.<br>
      <br>
      The self-destruction of cells, known as apoptosis, is a necessary
      process that helps the body rid itself of unwanted and potentially
      harmful cells. Under normal circumstances, when CD95 is activated,
      the process of apoptosis is triggered. Seen as a keeper of
      homeostasis in the immune system, it's been long-considered vital
      for the prevention of uncontrolled, cancerous cell growth.<br>
      <br>
      "In order to conduct this line of work, we had to create something
      that I don't believe exists, a cancer cell completely devoid of
      CD95," said Peter, a member of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive
      Cancer Center of Northwestern University. "If CD95 was truly a
      tumor suppressor, its elimination would result in an enhanced
      growth and/or invasiveness of cancer cells."<br>
      <br>
      Peter and his team tested cancer cells from nine different tissue
      origins. Instead of proliferating, the cells increased their size
      and the production of harmful reactive oxygen species, resulting
      in DNA damage. In their first attempt to divide, they died.<br>
      <br>
      Peter determined that the "cell death induced by CD95 receptor or
      ligand elimination (DICE)," comprises multiple death pathways. A
      cancer cell would have to mutate components of each to defend
      against DICE, a highly unlikely scenario.<br>
      <br>
      "DICE killed every cancer cell we put it up against and we found
      nothing that could prevent its destruction," Peter said. "The fact
      that none of the more than 1,000 drugs, nor the knockdown of any
      single gene was found to counteract DICE, makes it a very
      promising new way to kill cancer cells."<br>
      <br>
      To confirm the importance of CD95 for the survival of cancer cells
      in vivo, Peter and colleagues removed it from tissues in animal
      models and found that cancer could not form.<br>
      <br>
      "We know CD95 is not essential for the survival of any tissue
      outside of the immune system because mice with a deletion of
      either CD95 or CD95 ligand complete an average lifecycle with no
      illness other than autoimmunity," he said.<br>
      <br>
      The findings suggest that dependence on CD95 and CD95 ligand for
      survival is a feature of cancer cells that distinguishes them from
      normal cells.<br>
      <br>
      "We didn't believe these findings at first, but after more than
      four years of detailed experiments, we have convinced ourselves
      and others that what we have shown reflects reality," Peter said.<br>
      <br>
      Peter is now working with Chad Mirkin, the George B. Rathmann
      Professor of Chemistry in the Weinberg College of Arts and
      Sciences and professor of medicine at Feinberg, to induce DICE in
      cancer cells using small interfering RNAs delivered by gold
      nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      "We're not going to reinvent the wheel," Peter said. "Alexander
      Stegh, assistant professor of neurology and of medicine at
      Feinberg, has already used the same nano-platform to target a gene
      in a mouse model for brain cancer. In developing nano-DICE, we can
      begin the process of finding new treatment options."<br>

      A breakthrough in the production of solar cells will make the next
      generation of solar panels cheaper and safer, and promises to
      accelerate the development of solar energy over the next decade,
      scientists said.<br>
      <br>
      A technical advance based on an edible salt used in the
      manufacture of tofu could revolutionise the production of future
      solar panels to make them less expensive, more flexible and easier
      to use than the current models seen on millions of roofs across
      Britain.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers believe they have found a way of overcoming one of the
      most serious limitations of the next generation of solar panels,
      which are based on toxic cadmium chloride, by simply adding
      magnesium chloride, an abundant salt found in seawater.<br>
      <br>
      A study has shown that the solar cells produced with magnesium
      chloride – which is also found in bath salts as well as used to
      coagulate soya milk into tofu – work just as efficiently as
      conventional cadmium cells but at a fraction of the cost and with
      much lower toxicity.<br>
      <br>
      “We certainly believe it’s going to make a big change to the costs
      of these devices. The cost of solar is going to match fossil fuels
      eventually but this is going to get us there quicker,” said Jon
      Major of the University of Liverpool, who led the research.<br>
      <br>
      “Magnesium chloride is incredibly low-cost and it’s simply
      recovered from seawater. It’s used to de-ice roads in winter and
      it’s completely harmless and non-toxic. We’ve managed to replace a
      highly expensive, toxic material with one that’s completely benign
      and low cost,” Dr Major said.<br>
      <br>
      About 90 per cent of the solar panels currently in use are made of
      photovoltaic cells composed of silicon semiconductors, which
      convert sunlight directly into electricity. However, silicon is
      not good at absorbing sunlight which is why the next generation of
      PV cells will be based on a thin coating of cadmium telluride,
      which absorbs sunlight so well that it only needs to be about one
      hundredth of the thickness of silicon. <br>
      <br>
      However, although cadmium telluride is seen as the future for
      solar energy, it is potentially dangerous after it is “activated”
      with cadmium chloride, a critical step in the manufacturing
      process that raises the efficiency of converting sunlight to
      electricity from about two per cent to 15 per cent or more.<br>
      <br>
      The Liverpool team attempted to find an alternative to cadmium
      chloride in the activation step and discovered that it could be
      done just as well with magnesium chloride, which they sprayed onto
      a test sample of cadmium telluride with a model aircraft spray gun
      they bought for £49.99, Dr Major said.<br>
      <br>
      In a study published in the journal Nature, the researchers
      demonstrated that the efficiency of the resulting photovoltaic
      cells made from cadmium telluride and magnesium chloride were on a
      par with commercial cadmium telluride cells that had been
      activated with toxic cadmium chloride.<br>
      <br>
      “We have to apply cadmium chloride in a fume cupboard in the lab,
      but we created solar cells using the new method on a bench with a
      spray gun bought from a model shop,” Dr Major said.<br>
      <br>
      “Cadmium chloride is toxic and expensive, and we no longer need to
      use it. Replacing it with a naturally occurring substance could
      save the industry a vast amount of money and reduce the overall
      cost for generating power from solar,” he said.<br>
      <br>
      It is not possible to estimate how much cheaper the new solar
      cells will be, Dr Major said, but magnesium chloride is about one
      per cent of the cost of cadmium chloride. In addition, waste
      disposal will be far easier and cheaper with a product based on a
      non-toxic salt, he said.<br>
      <br>
      Asked why the solar power industry had not thought of using
      magnesium chloride before, Dr Major said: “We genuinely don’t
      know. The only reason we can suggest is that cadmium chloride
      works well so it may be a case of ‘if it’s not broke, why is there
      a need to fix it?’”<br>
      <br>
      Jeremy Leggett, chairman of the renewable energy firm
      Solarcentury, said that the development is exciting because it
      promises to make an already competitive industry even more
      competitive with conventional sources of energy, such as fossil
      fuels.<br>
      <br>
      “Their costs are coming down so fast that they are already
      knocking the business models of utilities into what some analysts
      call a ‘death spiral’. Imagine, then, what will happen if
      developments such as the one described in the new research come to
      market,” Dr Leggett said.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract </b><b><br>
      </b>&nbsp;<br>
      A method for employing sinusoidal oscillations of electrical
      bombardment on the surface of one Kerr type singularity in close
      proximity to a second Kerr type singularity in such a method to
      take advantage of the Lense-Thirring effect, to simulate the
      effect of two point masses on nearly radial orbits in a 2+1
      dimensional anti-de Sitter space resulting in creation of circular
      timelike geodesics conforming to the van Stockum under the Van Den
      Broeck modification of the Alcubierre geometry (Van Den Broeck
      1999) permitting topology change from one spacelike boundary to
      the other in accordance with Geroch's theorem (Geroch 1967) which
      results in a method for the formation of Godel-type geodesically
      complete spacetime envelopes complete with closed timelike curves.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to the use of technical time
      displacement devices, which operate by the modification of
      gravitational fields. These drive systems do not depend on the
      emission of matter to create thrust to take advantage of time
      dilation, but rather create a change in the curvature of
      space-time, in accordance with general relativity. This allows
      travel across topologies by warping space-time, to produce a
      topology change from one spacelike boundary to the other in
      accordance with Geroch's theorem (Geroch 1967)<br>
      <br>
      <b>THEORETICAL BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The concept of gravity should be examined in the light of
      quantum gravity and in turn as a component of quantum physics
      itself. The fundamental minimal quantum of energy in quantum
      physics is Planck's constant; h. Thus in accordance with the
      energy equivalence formula E=mc&lt;2&gt; , the fundamental minimum
      quantity of mass (mq) can therefore be derived, from known
      constants by; mq=h/c&lt;2 &gt; (1). Taking this minimal mass, it
      is possible to show that the formation of all matter, the forces
      of nature and indeed space-time itself derive from this single
      quintessential quantity.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Thus if the number of quintessences in a system is;
      nq=m/mq: then the total Energy of the system is more logically
      given by, the energy of a single quintessence (h); directly
      multiplied by the number of quintessences (nq) in that system,
      thus<br>
      E=hnq=mc&lt;2&gt; (1 a).<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Furthermore, this minimal mass, termed quintessence, can
      form the basis of the existence of a quantum gravitational field
      in the form of a space-time lattice, from which quantum gravity
      may be derived from first principles. Furthermore, the
      conglomeration of these quintessences also accounts for the
      formation of the elementary particles and the forces acting
      between them, as in superstring theory. This concept explains the
      formation of matter and the forces of nature on a quantum
      mechanical basis and directly explains the existence of wave
      particle duality. Thus as nq=m/mq; the frequency of light and
      matter (f) is determined, directly, from the number of constituent
      quintessences. This leads automatically to the fundamental
      equation, derived from (1), f=nq=E/h, where nq is the number of
      quintessences, which leads directly to the frequency of both light
      and matter. This in turn leads directly to a Universal wave
      equation for matter and light [lambda]=c/[beta]nq=hc/[beta]E (2),
      where [beta] is the relative directional velocity, v/c. As the
      momentum, p=[beta]*E/c, then this equation also gives the standard
      de-Broglie wave equation, [lambda]=h/p in agreement with current
      theory and experiments&lt;1&gt; .<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Using the Universal wave equation, the standard equation
      for special relativity, m'=mo/(1-[beta]&lt;2&gt; )&lt;1/2&gt; ,
      derives from first principles. Also from these observations, a
      modified Dirac wave equation may be derived,
      E[psi]=(-j[beta].[Nabla]+[beta]m)[psi] (2a), the results of which
      have been recently verified by a paper in which the orbitals of
      electrons were experimentally directly visualised&lt;2&gt; .
      Moreover, a fundamental equation for general relativity can be
      formulated, where G is the gravitational constant and rq is the
      given radius of quintessence; G=9(rq)&lt;2&gt; c&lt;4&gt;
      /[lambda][beta]E (3), such that the Universal wave equation is in
      direct agreement with general relativity&lt;3&gt; . Thus special
      and general relativity and quantum mechanics can be unified.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] From here it is possible to proceed in a number of ways;
      the geometric structure of the electron and the forces of Nature
      may be derived from first principles and in turn the structure of
      the quarks, including the top and bottom, otherwise known as truth
      and beauty can be seen. Moreover, the presence of a space-time
      lattice results in an understanding of quantum EPR effects. By
      allowing a theoretical flow of energy through the space-time
      lattice it can be shown that:<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0007] Energy is not bound by space-time</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0008] Thus logically accounting for phenomena such as
      entanglement and quantum tunnelling. Quintessence can also be used
      to explain, logically, the inner physics of a black hole, the
      missing mass of the Galaxy, the continuing expansion of the
      Universe, Guth's inflationary theory and the Big Bang. Hence, it
      is now possible to understand the Universe, including space-time,
      matter and the forces of nature from the radius, mass and
      vibration of a single quantity, quintessence.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] With this understanding of space-time, matter and the
      forces of Nature, and in particular gravity, it is possible to
      demonstrate that the modification of gravitational fields, and in
      turn the warping of space-time, can be technically readily
      achieved.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Using standard equations for special relativity,
      m'=m0/(1-[beta]&lt;2&gt; )&lt;1/2&gt; , it can be demonstrated
      that by differentially increasing the velocity of electrons, by
      applying a differential current, their mass can be increased in a
      specific way. In turn by increasing the mass of electrons, by
      general relativity, the number of gravitons emitted from these
      electrons can be modulated. By multiplying this effect using an
      ultracentrifugational device the differential graviton emission
      can be manifestly amplified. This in turn, in accordance with
      general relativity, will cause a change in the curvature of
      space-time.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] This effective warping of space-time does not, of
      necessity, imply superluminal velocities, but does allow the
      creation of warp drive systems, which do not depend on the
      creation of thrust by the ejection of material as used in current
      space technologies.<br>

      </b><b>[0012] Quintessential Mass</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0013] The quantum physical, minimum component of energy is
      Planck's constant; h. To define the minimal component of mass,
      using the standard energy equivalence formula; E=mc&lt;2&gt; ,
      such a minimal mass (mq) would be required to have the value
      equivalent to; mq=h/c&lt;2 &gt; (1). The total mass of a system
      (m) would then be; m=nqmq, where (nq) is the number of these
      minimal units. Thence, the total energy of a system can be derived
      from the minimal energy; h, multiplied by the number of these
      energy units (nq). Thus as, E=mc&lt;2&gt; , then also E=mqnqc&lt;2
      &gt; and substituting mq=h/c&lt;2&gt; , the energy equivalence
      formula has the more logical formulation; E=hnq(1a). Thus the
      energy of a system is equivalent to the minimal energy unit; h,
      multiplied by the number of those minimal energy units (nq).<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Taking this minimal mass/energy, it is possible to show
      that all matter, the forces of nature and space time can be
      constructed from this single quintessential quantity. Moreover,
      using this quantity the laws of physics can be derived from first
      principles. Thus, a priori, all components of the physical
      universe, including space-time, can be constructed from this
      minimal mass component, termed quintessence...<br>

      </b><br>
      [0360] The present invention is A method for the generation of a
      pseudo 2+1 dimensional anti-de Sitter space (DeDeo &amp; Gott
      2002) using two Kerr type positively charged rotating dilation
      singularities where one singularity is maintained as a axis of
      rotation or "reference" singularity, and the other "target"
      singularity is subjected to a differential electron flow so as to
      simultaneously pass above the photosphere of said singularity in
      its direction of rotation-prograde orbit-and contrary to its
      direction of rotation-retrograde orbit-to release a directed flow
      of gravitons in a sinusoidal oscillation simulating a rotational
      effect of the "target" singularity around the axis of rotation
      provided by the "reference" singularity, resulting in the creation
      of timelike curves in a compact time-oriented manifold permitting
      topology change from one spacelike boundary to the other in
      accordance with Geroch's theorem (Geroch 1967) which results in a
      method for the formation of G odel-type geodesically complete
      spacetime envelopes complete with closed timelike curves.<br>

          damaged, old immune system</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Protection from chemotherapy immunosuppression indicates effect
      could be conserved in humans<br>
      <br>
      In the first evidence of a natural intervention triggering stem
      cell-based regeneration of an organ or system, a study in the June
      5 issue of the Cell Stem Cell shows that cycles of prolonged
      fasting not only protect against immune system damage — a major
      side effect of chemotherapy — but also induce immune system
      regeneration, shifting stem cells from a dormant state to a state
      of self-renewal.<br>
      <br>
      In both mice and a Phase 1 human clinical trial involving patients
      receiving chemotherapy, long periods of not eating significantly
      lowered white blood cell counts. In mice, fasting cycles then
      “flipped a regenerative switch,” changing the signaling pathways
      for hematopoietic stem cells, which are responsible for the
      generation of blood and immune systems, the research showed.<br>
      <br>
      The study has major implications for healthier aging, in which
      immune system decline contributes to increased susceptibility to
      disease as people age. By outlining how prolonged fasting cycles —
      periods of no food for two to four days at a time over the course
      of six months — kill older and damaged immune cells and generate
      new ones, the research also has implications for chemotherapy
      tolerance and for those with a wide range of immune system
      deficiencies, including autoimmunity disorders.<br>
      <br>
      “We could not predict that prolonged fasting would have such a
      remarkable effect in promoting stem cell-based regeneration of the
      hematopoietic system,” said corresponding author Valter Longo,
      Edna M. Jones Professor of Gerontology and the Biological Sciences
      at the USC Davis School of Gerontology and director of the USC
      Longevity Institute. Longo has a joint appointment at the USC
      Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.<br>
      <br>
      “When you starve, the system tries to save energy, and one of the
      things it can do to save energy is to recycle a lot of the immune
      cells that are not needed, especially those that may be damaged,”
      Longo said. “What we started noticing in both our human work and
      animal work is that the white blood cell count goes down with
      prolonged fasting. Then when you re-feed, the blood cells come
      back. So we started thinking, well, where does it come from?”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fasting cycles</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Prolonged fasting forces the body to use stores of glucose, fat
      and ketones, but it also breaks down a significant portion of
      white blood cells. Longo likens the effect to lightening a plane
      of excess cargo.<br>
      <br>
      During each cycle of fasting, this depletion of white blood cells
      induces changes that trigger stem cell-based regeneration of new
      immune system cells. In particular, prolonged fasting reduced the
      enzyme PKA, an effect previously discovered by the Longo team to
      extend longevity in simple organisms and which has been linked in
      other research to the regulation of stem cell self-renewal and
      pluripotency — that is, the potential for one cell to develop into
      many different cell types. Prolonged fasting also lowered levels
      of IGF-1, a growth-factor hormone that Longo and others have
      linked to aging, tumor progression and cancer risk.<br>
      <br>
      “PKA is the key gene that needs to shut down in order for these
      stem cells to switch into regenerative mode. It gives the OK for
      stem cells to go ahead and begin proliferating and rebuild the
      entire system,” explained Longo, noting the potential of clinical
      applications that mimic the effects of prolonged fasting to
      rejuvenate the immune system. “And the good news is that the body
      got rid of the parts of the system that might be damaged or old,
      the inefficient parts, during the fasting. Now, if you start with
      a system heavily damaged by chemotherapy or aging, fasting cycles
      can generate, literally, a new immune system.”<br>
      <br>
      Prolonged fasting also protected against toxicity in a pilot
      clinical trial in which a small group of patients fasted for a
      72-hour period prior to chemotherapy, extending Longo’s
      influential past research.<br>
      <br>
      “While chemotherapy saves lives, it causes significant collateral
      damage to the immune system. The results of this study suggest
      that fasting may mitigate some of the harmful effects of
      chemotherapy,” said co-author Tanya Dorff, assistant professor of
      clinical medicine at the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center
      and Hospital. “More clinical studies are needed, and any such
      dietary intervention should be undertaken only under the guidance
      of a physician.”<br>
      <br>
      “We are investigating the possibility that these effects are
      applicable to many different systems and organs, not just the
      immune system,” said Longo, whose lab is in the process of
      conducting further research on controlled dietary interventions
      and stem cell regeneration in both animal and clinical studies.<br>
      <br>
      The study was supported by the National Institute of Aging of the
      National Institutes of Health (grant numbers AG20642, AG025135,

      </b><b>Summary:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      New study finds that short fasting cycles can work as well as
      chemotherapy, and the two combined greatly improve survival.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Man may not live by bread alone, but cancer in animals appears
      less resilient, according to a study that found chemotherapy drugs
      work better when combined with cycles of short, severe fasting.<br>
      <br>
      Even fasting on its own effectively treated a majority of cancers
      tested in animals, including cancers from human cells.<br>
      <br>
      The study in Science Translational Medicine, part of the Science
      family of journals, found that five out of eight cancer types in
      mice responded to fasting alone: Just as with chemotherapy,
      fasting slowed the growth and spread of tumors.<br>
      <br>
      And without exception, "the combination of fasting cycles plus
      chemotherapy was either more or much more effective than chemo
      alone," said senior author Valter Longo, professor of gerontology
      and biological sciences at the University of Southern California.<br>
      <br>
      For example, multiple cycles of fasting combined with chemotherapy
      cured 20 percent of mice with a highly aggressive type of
      children's cancer that had spread throughout the organism and 40
      percent of mice with a more limited spread of the same cancer.<br>
      <br>
      No mice survived in either case if treated only with chemotherapy.<br>
      <br>
      Only a clinical trial lasting several years can demonstrate
      whether humans would benefit from the same treatment, Longo
      cautioned.<br>
      <br>
      Results from the first phase of a clinical trial with breast,
      urinary tract and ovarian cancer patients, conducted at the USC
      Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and led by oncologists Tanya
      Dorff and David Quinn, in collaboration with Longo, have been
      submitted for presentation at the annual meeting of the American
      Society of Cancer Oncologists.<br>
      <br>
      The first phase tests only the safety of a therapy, in this case
      whether patients can tolerate short-term fasts of two days before
      and one day after chemotherapy.<br>
      <br>
      "We don't know whether in humans it's effective," Longo said of
      fasting as a cancer therapy. "It should be off limits to patients,
      but a patient should be able to go to their oncologist and say,
      'What about fasting with chemotherapy or without if chemotherapy
      was not recommended or considered?"<br>
      <br>
      In a case report study with self-reported data published in the
      journal Aging in 2010, 10 cancer patients who tried fasting cycles
      perceived fewer side effects from chemotherapy.<br>
      <br>
      Longo stressed that fasting may not be safe for everyone. The
      clinical trial did not enroll patients who already had lost more
      than 10 percent of their normal weight or who had other risk
      factors, such as diabetes. Fasting also can cause a drop in blood
      pressure and headaches, which could make driving and other
      activities dangerous for some patients.<br>
      <br>
      In mice, the study found that fasting cycles without chemotherapy
      could slow the growth of breast cancer, melanoma, glioma and human
      neuroblastoma. In several cases, the fasting cycles were as
      effective as chemotherapy.<br>
      <br>
      Fasting also extended survival in mice bearing a human ovarian
      cancer. In the case of melanoma, the cancer cells became resistant
      to fasting alone after a single round, but the single cycle of
      fasting was as effective as chemotherapy in reducing the spread of
      cancer to other organs.<br>
      <br>
      For all cancers tested, fasting combined with chemotherapy
      improved survival, slowed tumor growth and/or limited the spread
      of tumors.<br>
      <br>
      As with any potential cancer treatment, fasting has its limits.
      The growth of large tumor masses was reduced by multiple fasting
      and chemotherapy cycles, but cancer-free survival could not be
      achieved. Longo speculated that cells inside a large tumor may be
      protected in some way or that the variety of mutations in a large
      mass may make it more adaptable.<br>
      <br>
      But he noted that in most patients, oncologists have at least one
      chance to attack the cancer before it grows too large.<br>
      <br>
      Longo and collaborators at the National Institute on Aging studied
      one type of breast cancer in detail to try to understand the
      effects of fasting.<br>
      <br>
      While normal cells deprived of nutrients enter a dormant state
      similar to hibernation, the researchers saw that the cancer cells
      tried to make new proteins and took other steps to keep growing
      and dividing.<br>
      <br>
      The result, Longo said, was a "cascade of events" that led to the
      creation of damaging free radical molecules, which broke down the
      cancer cells' own DNA and caused their destruction.<br>
      <br>
      "The cell is, in fact, committing cellular suicide. What we're
      seeing is that the cancer cell tries to compensate for the lack of
      all these things missing in the blood after fasting. It may be
      trying to replace them, but it can't," Longo said.<br>
      <br>
      The new study bookends research published in Proceedings of the
      National Academy of Sciences in 2008.<br>
      <br>
      In that study, Longo's team showed that fasting protected normal
      cells against chemotherapy, but did not address the effect on
      cancer cells. The study also focused only on a single cancer and
      chemotherapy drug.<br>
      <br>
      The new study on a range of cancers and common chemotherapy drugs
      extends the 2008 results by showing that fasting not only fails to
      protect cancer cells, but makes them more vulnerable.<br>
      <br>
      Longo called the effect "Differential Stress Sensitization" to
      reflect the change in vulnerability between normal and cancerous
      cells.<br>
      <br>
      Longo's interest in fasting and cancer grew from years of studies
      on the beneficial effects of fasting in yeast and other organisms.
      He showed 15 years ago that starved yeast cells enter a
      stress-resistant mode as they wait for better times.<br>
      <br>
      By contrast, he said, the mutations in cancer cells come at a
      cost, such as a loss in adaptability to diverse environments. For
      example, Longo found that yeast genetically modified to resemble
      cancer cells become much more sensitive to several toxins.<br>
      <br>
      "A way to beat cancer cells may not be to try to find drugs that
      kill them specifically but to confuse them by generating extreme
      environments, such as fasting that only normal cells can quickly
      respond to," Longo said...<br>

          negative side effects of chemotherapy</b><br>

      <br>
      Valter Longo and colleagues proposed that a treatment used to
      prolong life in some laboratory organisms could offer protection
      against the negative effects of chemotherapy.&nbsp; That treatment
      is fasting, a special type of dietary restriction. Dietary
      restriction provides adequate nutrition at lower-than-average
      calories, either through special daily meals or intermittent
      fasting.<br>
      <br>
      In some of the earlier studies of dietary restriction in animal
      models, researchers measured resistance to stress as a way of
      predicting potential impact on lifespan and health.&nbsp;
      Successful resistance to short-term stress caused by reduction in
      calories typically correlates with longer life and better health.
      Researchers have also found in some models that fasting for
      relatively short periods of time – or months of dietary
      restriction – actually enhanced normal cells’ resistance to
      stress, but did not have an effect on cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      Based on these observations, Longo and colleagues hypothesized
      that they could use this “differential stress resistance” induced
      by fasting to reduce chemotherapy-related stress on normal cells,
      without jeopardizing the treatment’s efficacy for killing
      cancerous cells. Initial results in mice were encouraging: the
      mice survived and the chemotherapy was still effective. A
      subsequent but still very preliminary clinical study showed that
      patients who fasted in conjunction with chemotherapy reported
      fewer side-effects without loss of efficacy. The clinical study
      has been expanded to an early phase clinical trial.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Scientists say nerves use sound, not
          electricity</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The common view that nerves transmit impulses through electricity
      is wrong and they really transmit sound,according to a team of
      Danish scientists.<br>
      <br>
      The Copenhagen University researchers argue that biology and
      medical textbooks that say nerves relay electrical impulses from
      the brain to the rest of the body are incorrect.<br>
      <br>
      "For us as physicists, this cannot be the explanation," said
      Thomas Heimburg, an associate professor at the university's Niels
      Bohr Institute. "The physical laws of thermodynamics tell us that
      electrical impulses must produce heat as they travel along the
      nerve, but experiments find that no such heat is produced."<br>
      <br>
      Heimburg, an expert in biophysics who received his PhD from the
      Max Planck Institute in Goettingen, Germany — where biologists and
      physicists often work together in a rare arrangement — developed
      the theory with Copenhagen University's Andrew Jackson, an expert
      in theoretical physics.<br>
      <br>
      According to the traditional explanation of molecular biology, an
      electrical pulse is sent from one end of the nerve to the other
      with the help of electrically charged salts that pass through ion
      channels and a membrane that sheathes the nerves. That membrane is
      made of lipids and proteins.<br>
      <br>
      Heimburg and Jackson theorize that sound propagation is a much
      more likely explanation. Although sound waves usually weaken as
      they spread out, a medium with the right physical properties could
      create a special kind of sound pulse or "soliton" that can
      propagate without spreading or losing strength.<br>
      <br>
      The physicists say because the nerve membrane is made of a
      material similar to olive oil that can change from liquid to solid
      through temperature variations, they can freeze and propagate the
      solitons.<br>
      <br>
      The scientists, whose work is in the Biophysical Society's
      Biophysical Journal,suggested that anesthetics change the melting
      point of the membrane and make it impossible for their theorized
      sound pulses to propagate.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers could not immediately be reached for comment.<br>
