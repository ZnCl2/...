              What if the searing problems of today are already hurtling
              towards a fore-ordained conclusion? What if that
              conclusion is not only 'good,' but incredibly positive and
              world-transforming? <br>
              <br>
              Is the DOD planning on giving us full disclosure...
              regardless of any in-process attempts to keep it partial?
              What was the Roswell Cube? Are this and other technologies
              still in use today? <br>
              <br>
              Was 'The Plan' to save planet Earth transmitted into the
              1950s with highly classified and super-advanced ET

              <br>
              Will we become a time-travel-capable society&nbsp; in the

              we know it? What is the nature of time and how do we

              Orientation patterns of more than 960 ancient pyramids,
              sites, and temples, randomly spread around the world,
              correlates with the temperature changes of the last series
              of glaciation cycles. Most ancient monuments are hundreds
              of thousands of years old. Renovations of ancient
              monuments were done on top of their much older
              foundations, leaving most of the original orientations
              intact. The orientation of ancient monuments is, beyond
              any doubt, a very potent mathematical data analysis tool,

                  Quantitative Analysis Reveals Abrupt Transition from
                  Neural Reorganization to Repair in Early Development</b><br>
                <b>Junyu Cao, et al.</b><br>
              </div>
              <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
              </b>Sleep serves disparate functions, most notably neural
              repair, metabolite clearance and circuit reorganization,
              yet the relative importance of these functions remains
              hotly debated. Here, we create a novel mechanistic
              framework for understanding and predicting how sleep
              changes during ontogeny (why babies sleep twice as long as
              adults) and across phylogeny (why mice sleep roughly five
              times that of whales). We use this theory to
              quantitatively distinguish between sleep used for neural
              reorganization versus repair. We conduct a comprehensive,
              quantitative analysis of human sleep using total sleep
              time, cerebral metabolic rate, brain size, synaptic
              density, and REM sleep (used here to also refer to Active
              Sleep in infants and children). Our findings reveal an
              abrupt transition, between 2 and 3 years of age in humans.
              Specifically, our results show that differences in sleep
              across phylogeny and during late ontogeny (after 2 or 3
              years in humans) are primarily due to sleep functioning
              for repair or clearance, while changes in sleep during
              early ontogeny (before 2 - 3 years in humans) primarily
              support neural reorganization and learning. Moreover, our
              analysis shows that neuroplastic reorganization occurs
              primarily in REM sleep but not in NREM. In accordance with
              the developmental role of neuroplasticity, the percent of
              time spent in REM sleep is independent of brain size
              across species but decreases dramatically as brain size
              grows through development. Furthermore, the ratio of NREM
              sleep time to awake time emerges as a new invariant across
              development. This developmental transition and fundamental
              shift across ontogeny and phylogeny suggests a complex
              interplay between developmental and evolutionary
              constraints on sleep.<br>

              </div>
              <b><br>
              </b>Michael Moore presents Planet of the Humans, a
              documentary that dares to say what no one else will&nbsp;
              — that we are losing the battle to stop climate change on
              planet earth because we are following leaders who have
              taken us down the wrong road — selling out the green
              movement to wealthy interests and corporate America. This
              film is the wake-up call to the reality we are afraid to
              face: that in the midst of a human-caused extinction
              event, the environmental movement’s answer is to push for
              techno-fixes and band-aids. It's too little, too late. <br>
              <br>
              Removed from the debate is the only thing that MIGHT save
              us: getting a grip on our out-of-control human presence
              and consumption. Why is this not THE issue? Because that
              would be bad for profits, bad for business. Have we
              environmentalists fallen for illusions, “green” illusions,
              that are anything but green, because we’re scared that
              this is the end—and we’ve pinned all our hopes on biomass,
              wind turbines, and electric cars? <br>
              <br>
              No amount of batteries are going to save us, warns
              director Jeff Gibbs (lifelong environmentalist and
              co-producer of “Fahrenheit 9/11” and “Bowling for
              Columbine"). This urgent, must-see movie, a full-frontal
              assault on our sacred cows, is guaranteed to generate
              anger, debate, and, hopefully, a willingness to see our
              survival in a new way—before it’s too late.<br>

                  Water-Repellent Material Inspired by Porcupinefish</b><br>
                <b>—Abrasion-Resistant and Flexible, It May Be Used to
                  Protect Various Structural Materials—</b><br>
                <br>
              </div>
              <b>Abstract</b><br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NIMS has developed a novel, highly
              water-repellent material inspired by porcupinefish skin.
              This material is superior to conventional water-repellent
              materials due to its significantly enhanced abrasion
              resistance and flexibility. It may therefore be useful in
              extending the durability of various structural materials.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Water repellency has been a major
              research focus as a means of keeping the surfaces of
              materials dry, thereby eliminating the effects of
              moisture, including the growth of frost, corrosion and
              mold and the buildup of grime. Highly water-repellent
              materials need to have uneven surfaces at the micro- to
              nano-scale. However, these structures make materials
              brittle when subjected to external forces, such as
              abrasion, twisting and scratching, immediately impairing
              their water repellency.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inspired by porcupinefish skin, the
              NIMS research team recently developed a water-repellent
              material with enhanced durability. This skin is composed
              of two types of materials with contrasting mechanical
              properties: hard, tetrapod-shaped spines and highly
              flexible skins. Using this composite structure as a model,
              the team succeeded in developing a highly water-repellent
              material by densely integrating tetrapod-shaped inorganic
              nanomaterials into a flexible silicone resin. This
              material is capable of continuously maintaining its
              microscopic uneven surface structure even when deformed or
              damaged by external forces.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This highly durable and water-repellent
              material can be easily produced by simply combining and
              kneading together the inorganic nanomaterial and a
              general-purpose resin. The material is therefore
              compatible with conventional resin casting and painting
              techniques. In future development efforts, we intend to
              put this material into practical use in various fields in
              which the use of water-repellent materials has been
              limited by inadequate durability (e.g., paints applied to
              the hulls of ships to reduce water resistance).<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project was carried out by a
              research team led by Yoshihiro Yamauchi (International
              Center for Young Scientists, NIMS) and Masanobu Naito
              (Leader of the Data-driven Polymer Design Group, Research
              and Services Division of Materials Data and Integrated
              System, NIMS)....<br>

              <div align="center"><b>Exposed: There’s a new federal
                  court to handle all the expected COVID vaccine-injury
                  claims</b><b>&nbsp; by Jon Rappoport&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

              </div>
              <br>
              The simple truth is: the US government is anticipating
              many people will be filing claims for compensation, when
              their family members are harmed or killed by a new COVID
              vaccine.<br>
              <br>
              Of course, the government isn’t coming right out and
              admitting that.<br>
              <br>
              The press will tout the usual excuses for injury and
              death. “He died from COVID, not the vaccine.” “Well, there
              was just one bad batch of vaccines.” “Because COVID is
              such a dire situation, and we’re rushing to save lives, a
              few mistakes are inevitable.”<br>
              <br>
              Anything but the truth: GUESS WHAT, THE VACCINE IS HIGHLY
              TOXIC.<br>
              <br>
              This new federal vaccine court for COVID will operate
              exactly like the present system for paying out claims for
              vaccine injury to children. Citizens have to jump through
              many absurd hoops and navigate all sorts of red tape, to
              try to squeeze money out of the federal government. The
              system is set up that way. It’s your basic bureaucratic
              nightmare.<br>
              <br>
              The language that establishes the new COVID vaccine court
              is found in the Federal Register, 3/17/20, buried in
              section 14 of a document titled: “Declaration Under the
              Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act for
              Medical Countermeasures Against COVID-19.”<br>
              <br>
              Here is the relevant passage in that document:<br>
              <br>
              “Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program…Section
              319F-4 of the PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. 247d-6e, authorizes the
              Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) to
              provide benefits to eligible individuals who sustain a
              serious physical injury or die as a direct result of the
              administration or use of a Covered [COVID] Countermeasure
              [e.g., a vaccine]. Compensation under the CICP for an
              injury directly caused by a Covered Countermeasure is
              based on the requirements set forth in this Declaration,
              the administrative rules for the Program, and the statute.
              To show direct causation between a Covered Countermeasure
              and a serious physical injury, the statute requires
              ‘compelling, reliable, valid, medical and scientific
              evidence.’ The administrative rules for the Program
              further explain the necessary requirements for eligibility
              under the CICP…”<br>

                  that allows bacteria to exhale electricity</b><br>
                <b>By Brandon Specktor</b><br>
              </div>
              <br>
              The soil bacteria breathe through 'giant snorkels' made of
              a special conductive protein, the researchers found.<br>
              <br>
              For mouthless, lungless bacteria, breathing is a bit more
              complicated than it is for humans. We inhale oxygen and
              exhale carbon dioxide; Geobacter — a ubiquitous,
              groundwater-dwelling genus of bacteria — swallow up
              organic waste and "exhale" electrons, generating a tiny
              electric current in the process.<br>
              <br>
              Those waste electrons always need somewhere to go (usually
              into a plentiful underground mineral like iron oxide), and
              Geobacter have an unconventional tool to make sure they
              get there.<br>
              <br>
              "Geobacter breathe through what is essentially a giant
              snorkel, hundreds of times their size," Nikhil Malvankar,
              an assistant professor at Yale University's Microbial
              Science Institute in Connecticut, told Live Science.<br>
              <br>
              That "snorkel" is called a nanowire. Though these tiny,
              conductive filaments are 100,000 times smaller than the
              width of a human hair, they are capable of shuttling
              electrons hundreds to thousands of times the length of an
              individual Geobacter microbe's body. Thanks to this
              adaptation, Geobacter are some of the most impressive
              respirators on Earth. ("You can't exhale 1,000 feet [300
              meters] in front of you, can you?" Malvankar said). <br>
              <br>
              At any given time, billions of the bacteria are buzzing
              with electricity beneath the seafloor. Now, in a new study
              published Aug. 17 in the journal Nature Chemical Biology,
              Malvankar and his colleagues have figured out how to
              combine that energy into a potent, microbial power grid.<br>
              <br>
              Using advanced microscopy techniques, the researchers have
              uncovered the "secret molecule" that allows Geobacter to
              breathe over tremendously long distances previously unseen
              in bacteria. The team also found that, by stimulating
              colonies of Geobacter with an electric field, the microbes
              conducted electricity 1,000 times more efficiently than
              they do in their natural environment. <br>
              <br>
              Understanding these innate, electrical adaptations could
              be a crucial step in transforming Geobacter colonies into
              living, breathing batteries, the researchers said.<br>

                  Tiny Antibody Component Completely Neutralizes the
                  SARS-CoV-2 Virus </b><br>

              John Mellors, M.D., chief of infectious diseases, UPMC and
              the University of Pittsburgh, discusses a scientific
              breakthrough that is a major step toward a potential drug
              to treat and prevent COVID-19.<br>
              <br>
              University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine scientists
              have isolated the smallest biological molecule to date
              that completely and specifically neutralizes the
              SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is the cause of COVID-19. This
              antibody component, which is 10 times smaller than a
              full-sized antibody, has been used to construct a drug —
              known as Ab8 — for potential use as a therapeutic and
              prophylactic against SARS-CoV-2.<br>
              <br>
              The researchers report today (September 14, 2020) in the
              journal Cell that Ab8 is highly effective in preventing
              and treating SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice and hamsters.
              Its tiny size not only increases its potential for
              diffusion in tissues to better neutralize the virus, but
              also makes it possible to administer the drug by
              alternative routes, including inhalation. Importantly, it
              does not bind to human cells — a good sign that it won’t
              have negative side-effects in people.<br>
              <br>
              Ab8 was evaluated in conjunction with scientists from the
              University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) and
              University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston, as
              well as the University of British Columbia and University
              of Saskatchewan.<br>
              <br>
              “Ab8 not only has potential as therapy for COVID-19, but
              it also could be used to keep people from getting
              SARS-CoV-2 infections,” said co-author John Mellors, M.D.,
              chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at UPMC and
              Pitt. “Antibodies of larger size have worked against other
              infectious diseases and have been well tolerated, giving
              us hope that it could be an effective treatment for
              patients with COVID-19 and for protection of those who
              have never had the infection and are not immune.”<br>
              <br>
              The tiny antibody component is the variable, heavy chain
              (VH) domain of an immunoglobulin, which is a type of
              antibody found in the blood. It was found by “fishing” in
              a pool of more than 100 billion potential candidates using
              the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as bait. Ab8 is created when
              the VH domain is fused to part of the immunoglobulin tail
              region, adding the immune functions of a full-size
              antibody without the bulk.<br>
              <br>
              Abound Bio, a newly formed UPMC-backed company, has
              licensed Ab8 for worldwide development...<br>

              HHS recently began distributing the first $30 billion of
              emergency funding designated for hospitals in the
              Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. Some
              of the states hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic will
              receive less funding than states touched relatively
              lightly, according to an analysis by Kaiser Health News. <br>
              <br>
              The first round of grants will be distributed based on
              historical share Medicare revenue, not based on COVID-19
              burden. Therefore, hard-hit states like New York will
              receive far less per COVID-19 case than most other
              states.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              HHS said it doled out the first slice of funding based on
              Medicare revenue to get support to hospitals as quickly as
              possible. The agency said the next round of grants "will
              focus on providers in areas particularly impacted by the
              COVID-19 outbreak," rural hospitals and other healthcare
              providers that receive much of their revenues from

                          manifestation of Free Energy through Tesla
                          Technology is entirely dependent upon a
                          particular type of Spiritual Paradigm Shift
                          that must take place first in the body of
                          Humanity. This Paradigm Shift was hinted at by
                          Tesla himself, but unfortunately, that
                          necessary shift in consciousness still has not
                          occurred at the level required to break the
                          stranglehold of our current corrupt, polluting
                          and unsustainable energy systems. In this
                          presentation, Mark Passio discusses what this
                          spiritual shift in consciousness entails, and

                          <br>
                          ​It is quick and easy to install, and requires
                          no energy or maintenance. All materials are

                          high-quality drinking water that meets WHO
                          standards, and can also provide water for

                          bulging and draining water outside the trough.<br>

              September 2, 2020<br>
              <br>
              The Houston Health Department is collaborating with the
              Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Rice
              University, and Baylor College of Medicine to conduct an
              antibody testing survey to understand how many people in
              the city were previously infected with the virus that
              causes COVID-19.<br>
              <br>
              The survey will identify people infected in the past with
              COVID-19 by the presence of antibodies, proteins the
              body’s immune system makes to fight infections. Antibody
              testing does not replace oral or nasal swab viral testing
              that looks for current infection.<br>
              <br>
              Teams consisting of Houston Health Department staff and
              Houston Fire Department paramedics will visit randomly
              selected homes across Houston, asking household members to
              answer survey questions and provide a blood sample. Phase
              one is set to take place Sept. 8-24, with phase two
              starting in the winter of 2021.<br>

              <b>Abstract</b><br>
              2D metal nanomaterials offer exciting prospects in terms
              of their properties and functions. However, the ambient
              aqueous synthesis of atomically‐thin, 2D metallic
              nanomaterials represents a significant challenge. Herein,
              freestanding and atomically‐thin gold nanosheets with a
              thickness of only 0.47 nm (two atomic layers thick) are
              synthesized via a one‐step aqueous approach at 20 °C,
              using methyl orange as a confining agent. Owing to the
              high surface‐area‐to‐volume ratio, abundance of
              unsaturated atoms exposed on the surface and large
              interfacial areas arising from their ultrathin 2D nature,
              the as‐prepared Au nanosheets demonstrate excellent
              catalysis performance in the model reaction of
              4‐nitrophenol reduction, and remarkable
              peroxidase‐mimicking activity, which enables a highly
              sensitive colorimetric sensing of H2O2 with a detection
              limit of 0.11 × 10−6 m. This work represents the first
              fabrication of freestanding 2D gold with a sub‐nanometer
              thickness, opens up an innovative pathway toward
              atomically‐thin metal nanomaterials that can serve as
              model systems for inspiring fundamental advances in
              materials science, and holds potential across a wide
              region of applications...<br>
              <br>
              For the synthesis of Au nanoseaweed, aqueous solutions of
              HAuCl4 and Na3C6H5O7 (sodium citrate, SC) were
              sequentially added into an aqueous solution of Methyl
              Orange (0.21 × 10−3 m) at 20 °C. The resultant solution
              was kept undisturbed at this temperature for 12 h (see
              Figure 1a and the Supporting Information). The reaction
              products were collected by centrifugation, and then washed
              several times with Milli‐Q water until the supernatant was
              colorless. The centrifuged pellet was readily re‐dispersed
              in Milli‐Q water for further characterization....<br>

              JB reports in:<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just got home from back surgery where
              I spent 4 days in the hospital to start the recovery
              process. I was able to have some really good conversations
              with the nurses that were caring for me.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First off, the hospital was empty (in
              Alaska).<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked one nurse if I could ask a few
              questions that I just needed answers for.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, ‘Do masks do anything to stop a
              virus?” She looked at me shocked, then said “no, they
              don’t do anything, the N95 does stop a percentage of a
              virus when you wear one, but overall they don’t do a
              thing”.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I asked why are there so many
              mandates then? We are we being bombarded with wearing a
              mask to save grandma?<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time another nurse said,<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Well, when this all started we were
              pressured to report everyone who was admitted into the
              hospital as a covid case. We were also told that we were
              to report every death as a covid death, and to do our best
              to get people on a ventilator, even though we knew that it
              seemed to actually make things worse for the patient.”<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bottom line, most of them refused, and
              several were fired.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked what they suggested was the
              best way to fight the virus, and was told, the same things
              you would do to fight the flu.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was pretty intense, and they were
              very upset when they started talking about it. Upset as in
              mad.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn’t wear a mask while I was there
              and was only asked one time if I would put one on when a
              certain nurse was coming to that section of the hospital
              to generally check on patients. So, I did, as it seemed
              important to the people I was working with. No sense in
              getting them in trouble. When that person left, I took it
              back off.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was more conversation, including
              their thoughts on schools requiring masks, kids committing
              suicide “in one month more than we’ve had in a year”.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had strong opinions on lockdowns
              when “the very thing we need to fight a virus is fresh air
              and the vitamin D we get from sunlight.”<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One fun thing, when I was being wheeled
              through the hospital, the nurse stopped a few times to
              introduce me to other nurses working there, and she would
              simply say, “Hey so and so, I want you to meet Joshua, he
              thinks like we do”.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there is a resistance in some of
              these hospitals!<br>

              <br>
              In Jewish-controlled, Communist Russia, many ethnic
              Russians, who were considered enemies of the Communist
              government, were sent to concentration camps in Siberia.
              Through starvation, disease, random executions,
              subfreezing temperatures, over two million Russian
              citizens lost their lives in Siberian concentration camps.
              "Kolyma" in existence for 40 years, was the worst of these
              camps.<br>
              <br>
              This award winning documentary is based on eye witness
              testimony including interviews with former prisoners who
              worked in the Kolyma River Region during the Stalinist
              era. Film includes archival records, surviving documentary

              </b><br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard approaches to evaluating
              epidemic policy responses, involving the Value of a
              Statistical Life, have conceptual problems and are biased
              towards the elderly and rich.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using a life-years criterion as an
              alternative shows that the lockdowns cost an order of
              magnitude more life-years than they saved.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the publicized cost-benefit
              analyses of COVID-19 lockdowns have used coarse measures
              like lives as units rather than life-years, which misleads
              politicians and the general public. COVID-19 deaths
              disproportionately impact the oldest members of the
              population, whereas the economic impacts of lockdowns
              disproportionately harm the youngest of the working
              population, who have far greater life expectancies at the
              time of impact.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using prior research on workforce
              entrants and recent graduates entering into a market
              marred by an economic recession, empirical estimates of
              life-years lost can be determined. Extensive research on
              job displacement can be used to estimate the economic
              impact in life-years of starkly increased unemployment for
              mid-to-late career workers.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Combining these analyses, we found that
              an estimated 18.7 million life-years will be lost in the
              United States due to the COVID-19 lockdowns. Comparative
              data analysis between nations shows that the lockdowns in
              the United States likely had a minimal effect in saving
              life-years. Using two different comparison groups, we
              estimate that the COVID-19 lockdowns in the U.S. saved
              between a quarter to three quarters of a million
              life-years.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every broad age category lost
              life-years from the lockdowns including those 55 and
              older.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The media and state and local
              governments contributed to the panic by selectively
              presenting evidence on COVID-19 and shutdowns of dubious
              benefit.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public health researchers and health
              economists gave poor policy advice and made selective use
              of the prior research literature. They will likely be
              rewarded, not punished, by academia for their failure
              because of academia’s biases.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public health in general is so biased
              and vulnerable to motivated cognition that it is not “not
              yet ready for policy analysis.”<br>

                  WHO-Backed Research Finds Cheap Steroids Reduce
                  COVID-19 Mortality By One-Third</b><br>
              </div>
              <br>
              For the last 2 months, we've been wondering: whatever
              happened to that British study purporting to show
              surprising efficacy of cheap steroid dexamethasone in
              treating COVID-19?<br>
              <br>
              While we suspected that drug companies working on vaccines
              and fancy new treatments (see Gilead's questionably
              effective remdesivir) might secretly be working to
              undermine this type of research for fear it might
              interfere with "innovation" their bottom lines, on
              Wednesday, a group of doctors brought together by the WHO
              published a report analyzing several studies on the
              effectiveness of steroids in treating late-stage COVID-19.<br>
              <br>
              The studies, which involved a total of 1,700 patients,
              apparently show that a number of cheap, plentiful
              corticosteroids (anti-inflammatory drugs that can damp the
              effects of an overactive immune system) helped lower
              COVID-19-related mortality by roughly one-third, compared
              with the 'control' group that didn't receive the
              medication.<br>
              <br>
              The paper published by JAMA featured a meta-analysis
              performed by the group of scientists and doctors
              encompassing seven studies done between February and June.
              All the studies evaluated the use of the commonly used
              steroid drugs dexamethasone, hydrocortisone and
              methylprednisolone. The study found relatively consistent
              benefits for using the drugs in severely ill patients: Of
              678 severely ill patients who received steroids, 32.7%
              died, compared with 41.5% of patients receiving either the
              usual care, or a placebo (depending on the study).<br>

                  Professor Thomas Borody says the combination of
                  Ivermectin, Doxycycline and Zinc has shown to be
                  almost 100 per cent effective as a treatment for
                  COVID-19 based on the findings of six publications. <br>
                  <br>
                  “The Ivermectin has two roles,” Mr Borody said. <br>
                  <br>
                  “It blocks the landing sights on the spike of the
                  receptors called AC2 receptor throughout the lungs and
                  the gut, and secondly, it inhibits replication within
                  the cell by using Zinc which it forces or helps to get
                  in the cells.<br>
                  <br>
                  “The Doxycycline helps in those two areas as well.<br>

                    G-quadruplex nucleic acid structures are of great
                    interest as their high thermodynamic stability under
                    near-physiological conditions suggests that they
                    could form in cells. Here we report the generation
                    and application of an engineered, structure-specific
                    antibody employed to quantitatively visualize DNA
                    G-quadruplex structures in human cells. We show
                    explicitly that G-quadruplex formation in DNA is
                    modulated during cell-cycle progression and that
                    endogenous G-quadruplex DNA structures can be
                    stabilized by a small-molecule ligand. Together
                    these findings provide substantive evidence for the
                    formation of G-quadruplex structures in the genome
                    of mammalian cells and corroborate the application
                    of stabilizing ligands in a cellular context to
                    target G-quadruplexes and intervene with their
                    function.</font></font><br>

          morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) to initiate bone formation
          after microfracture, but then stopped the process midway with

          &nbsp;As a favor to drug companies that are studying it as a
          potential “drug” treatment for the Wuhan coronavirus
          (COVID-19), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is
          going after N-acetylcysteine, a natural compound that the
          agency is suddenly claiming no longer qualifies as a legal
          dietary supplement.<br>
          <br>
          Reports indicate that the FDA has sent out a series of warning
          letters to supplement manufacturers warning them that NAC, as
          it is also called, does not meet the definition of a dietary
          supplement because it was supposedly first approved as a
          “drug” back in 1963.<br>
          <br>
          The FDA claims that NAC was never marketed as a food or
          supplement prior to the agency’s approval of it as a drug.
          This, according to the agency, means that the “rights” to sell
          it are under the jurisdiction of the FDA, which is steering it
          towards Big Pharma entities now trying to capitalize on it as
          a possible Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) remedy.<br>

          <br>
          In a 2017 study conducted by researchers from the Thomas
          Jefferson University, NAC succeeded in slowing down the growth
          of cancer cells in patients with breast cancer. The natural
          antioxidant reduced the aggressiveness of tumors by modulating
          the metabolism of cancer cells. NAC also depleted the cancer
          cells of nutrients, forcing them to starve and die. (Related:
          Yale researchers add “reduction of hearing loss” to the many
          benefits of NAC supplements.)<br>

              Face Masks Is “Very Dangerous”</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          “Having face masks and then think[ing] you can crowd your
          buses or your shopping malls — that’s definitely a mistake”.<br>
          Steve Watson<br>
          <br>
          Sweden’s top expert on the coronavirus has warned that
          encouraging people to wear face masks is “very dangerous”
          because it gives a false sense of security but does not
          effectively stem the spread of the virus.<br>
          <br>
          “It is very dangerous to believe face masks would change the
          game when it comes to COVID-19,” said Anders Tengell, who has
          overseen Sweden’s response to the pandemic while resisting any
          form of lockdown or mask mandate.<br>
          <br>
          “Face masks can be a complement to other things when other
          things are safely in place,” Tengell added.<br>
          <br>
          “But to start with having face masks and then think[ing] you
          can crowd your buses or your shopping malls — that’s
          definitely a mistake,” he further urged.<br>
          <br>
          Tegnell has consistently spoken out against the use of masks,
          last month declaring that “With numbers diminishing very
          quickly in Sweden, we see no point in wearing a face mask in
          Sweden, not even on public transport.”<br>
          <br>
          “The findings that have been produced through face masks are
          astonishingly weak, even though so many people around the
          world wear them,” Tengell has urged.<br>
          <br>
          “I’m surprised that we don’t have more or better studies
          showing what effect masks actually have. Countries such as
          Spain and Belgium have made their populations wear masks but
          their infection numbers have still risen,” the epidemiologist
          also declared.<br>
          <br>
          Sweden, which didn’t enforce any mandatory lockdown order, has
          seen its coronavirus cases and deaths slow to a trickle.<br>
          <br>
          “That Sweden has come down to these levels is very promising,”
          Tegnell has said, adding “The curves are going down and the
          curves for the seriously ill are beginning to approach zero.”<br>
          <br>
          As Newsweek acknowledged earlier this month, Sweden’s COVID-19
          death rate is lower than those of Spain, the UK and Italy,
          countries which all imposed lockdowns.<br>
          <br>
          Sweden’s GDP fall of 8.6 in Q2 2020 is also significantly less
          severe than the 12.1 average experienced in the Eurozone,
          leaving the Scandinavian country in “much better shape than
          the rest of Europe.”<br>
