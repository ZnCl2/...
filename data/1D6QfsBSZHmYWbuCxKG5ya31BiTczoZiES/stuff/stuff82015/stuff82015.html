      The narrative of the modern industrialized economy being a success
      is a lie of unimaginable proportion. Nature has historically
      produced 75% of all global GDP (gross domestic product) for free,
      no longer. If nature dies, we die. Modern society is now consuming
      itself to keep the facade of "progress" going until the last
      minute. As the last sand drains from the hourglass, global climate
      engineering is diminishing what chance there may yet be to salvage
      any part of Earth's life support systems. <br>
      <br>
      The false paradigm of perpetual expansion on a finite planet with
      finite resources is disintegrating by the day. Any chance we have
      left at this point rests on exposing and stopping the climate
      engineering insanity before there is nothing left to save. The
      article below is an excellent portrayal of what is unfolding
      (except for the omission of the geoengineering factor which many
      authors and publishers are still afraid to face or admit to). Make
      your voice heard in this battle today, tomorrow may be too late.<br>

      <b>Sea Levels Are Rising 10 Times Faster Than Predicted And Will
        Soon Reshape The Globe</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Catastrophic sea level rise is not an if, but a when. In reality,
      it is already well underway and getting worse rapidly. Even the
      newly released study that makes clear oceans are rising 10 times
      faster than previous estimates still likely falls far short of the
      true gravity of what is unfolding. Those that are still
      desperately clinging to their denial of global climate engineering
      will be forced to face their fears very soon, countless converging
      climate related cataclysms are closing in on us all. Governments
      around the globe have long since collaborated and fully deployed
      global climate engineering programs, they absolutely knew what was
      coming. The paradox is this, available data indicates climate
      engineering is actually making the overall warming far worse, not
      better (while at the same time irreparably contaminating the
      entire planet in the process). Recent studies prove solar
      radiation management can't work and will thus only exacerbate an
      already bad climate scenario. What will the US southern and
      eastern coasts look like as the seas overtake low lying lands, the
      map below is sobering and yet is only a tiny glimpse of the
      overall calamity of biosphere collapse now faced by the human
      race.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      When all the ice deposits around the globe melt (and this is the
      fast track that we are on) , the total sea level rise is in the
      vicinity of 80 meters. The power structure is trying desperately
      to hide what is unfolding from public for as long as possible for
      obvious reasons, it is up to each and every one of us to bring the
      critical climate engineering issue to the light of day. The
      article below is the most recent study update from the front
      lines. Though climate engineering is not mentioned in this latest
      study (as is the case with so many publications which are as of
      yet afraid to speak the whole truth), data presented is still
      relevant.<br>

            Issues Bombshell Sea Level Warning</b></big><br>

      <b> </b><br>
      In what may prove to be a turning point for political action on
      climate change, a breathtaking new study casts extreme doubt about
      the near-term stability of global sea levels.<br>
      <br>
      The study — written by James Hansen, NASA's former lead climate
      scientist, and 16 co-authors, many of whom are considered among
      the top in their fields — concludes that glaciers in Greenland and
      Antarctica will melt 10 times faster than previous consensus
      estimates, resulting in sea level rise of at least 10 feet in as
      little as 50 years. The study, which has not yet been
      peer-reviewed, brings new importance to a feedback loop in the
      ocean near Antarctica that results in cooler freshwater from
      melting glaciers forcing warmer, saltier water underneath the ice
      sheets, speeding up the melting rate. Hansen, who is known for
      being alarmist and also right, acknowledges that his study implies
      change far beyond previous consensus estimates. In a conference
      call with reporters, he said he hoped the new findings would be
      "substantially more persuasive than anything previously
      published." I certainly find them to be.<br>
      <br>
      To come to their findings, the authors used a mixture of
      paleoclimate records, computer models, and observations of current
      rates of sea level rise, but "the real world is moving somewhat
      faster than the model," Hansen says.<br>
      <br>
      Hansen's study does not attempt to predict the precise timing of
      the feedback loop, only that it is "likely" to occur this century.
      The implications are mindboggling: In the study's likely scenario,
      New York City—and every other coastal city on the planet—may only
      have a few more decades of habitability left. That dire
      prediction, in Hansen's view, requires "emergency cooperation
      among nations."<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We conclude that continued high emissions will
      make multi-meter sea level rise practically unavoidable and likely
      to occur this century. Social disruption and economic consequences
      of such large sea level rise could be devastating. It is not
      difficult to imagine that conflicts arising from forced migrations
      and economic collapse might make the planet ungovernable,
      threatening the fabric of civilization.<br>
      <br>
      The science of ice melt rates is advancing so fast, scientists
      have generally been reluctant to put a number to what is
      essentially an unpredictable, nonlinear response of ice sheets to
      a steadily warming ocean. With Hansen's new study, that changes in
      a dramatic way. One of the study's co-authors is Eric Rignot,
      whose own study last year found that glacial melt from West
      Antarctica now appears to be "unstoppable." Chris Mooney, writing
      for Mother Jones, called that study a "holy shit" moment for the
      climate.<br>
      <br>
      One necessary note of caution: Hansen's study comes via a
      nontraditional publishing decision by its authors. The study will
      be published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, an open-access
      "discussion" journal, and will not have formal peer review prior
      to its appearance online later this week. The complete discussion
      draft circulated to journalists was 66 pages long, and included
      more than 300 references. The peer review will take place in real
      time, with responses to the work by other scientists also
      published online. Hansen said this publishing timeline was
      necessary to make the work public as soon as possible before
      global negotiators meet in Paris later this year. Still, the lack
      of traditional peer review and the fact that this study's results
      go far beyond what's been previously published will likely bring
      increased scrutiny. On Twitter, Ruth Mottram, a climate scientist
      whose work focuses on Greenland and the Arctic, was skeptical of
      such enormous rates of near-term sea level rise, though she
      defended Hansen's decision to publish in a nontraditional way.<br>
      <br>
      In 2013, Hansen left his post at NASA to become a climate activist
      because, in his words, "as a government employee, you can't
      testify against the government." In a wide-ranging December 2013
      study, conducted to support Our Children's Trust, a group
      advancing legal challenges to lax greenhouse gas emissions
      policies on behalf of minors, Hansen called for a "human tipping
      point"—essentially, a social revolution—as one of the most
      effective ways of combating climate change, though he still favors
      a bilateral carbon tax agreed upon by the United States and China
      as the best near-term climate policy. In the new study, Hansen
      writes, "there is no morally defensible excuse to delay phase-out
      of fossil fuel emissions as rapidly as possible."<br>
      <br>
      Asked whether Hansen has plans to personally present the new
      research to world leaders, he said: "Yes, but I can't talk about
      that today." What's still uncertain is whether, like with so many
      previous dire warnings, world leaders will be willing to listen. <br>

      <b>Kaminski, cont'd :</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b>At the other end of ecological speculation are those
      who believe the opposite is happening to the world, that we might
      be on the verge of a "Little Ice Age." Earlier this month,
      astrophysicists in Britain reported:<br>
      <br>
      “Our planet is just 15 years from a new ‘mini ice age’ that could
      cause extremely cold winters characterized by the freezing of
      normally ice-free rivers as well as by year-round snow fields in
      areas that have never witnessed such climate conditions before, a
      group of astrophysicists claim.<br>
      <br>
      The scientists drew this conclusion based on a new model of the
      sun’s activity that reportedly enables the researchers to make
      “extremely accurate predictions” of changes in solar activity.”<br>
      <br>
      The study findings were presented at the National Astronomy
      Meeting on July 9 and published in the Royal Astronomical Society
      papers. Their new model based suggests we will see the conditions
      last experienced during what was called the Maunder minimum, 370
      years ago.<br>
      <br>
      The Maunder minimum is a name of a period between 1645 and 1715
      characterized by prolonged low solar activity as well as by
      extremely cold winters in Europe and North America at the heart of
      the climatic period between 1550 and 1850 called the ‘Little Ice
      Age.’<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Habibullo Abdussamatov who heads Russia’s prestigious Pulkovo
      Observatory in St. Petersburg warned in a 2013 paper [ <a
href="http://www.omicsgroup.org/journals/grand-minimum-of-the-total-solar-irradiance-leads-to-the-little-ice-age-2329-6755.1000113.pdf"

      ] that: “after the maximum of solar Cycle-24, from approximately
      2014, we can expect the start of the next bicentennial cycle of
      deep cooling with a Little Ice Age.” [<a
        href="http://icecap.us/index.php/go/joes-blog" ">
        <b>http://icecap.us/index.php/go/joes-blog</b></a> ]<br>
      <br>
      However, most environmentalists totally disagree with this
      assessment.<br>
      <br>
      “Even if you do go into Maunder minimum conditions it’s not going
      to combat global warming, the sun’s not going to save us,” said
      the lead author of a study that predicted the Sun's quiescence
      would have a only moderate effect on the overheating Earth. (The
      Maunder minimum is the name for the sun’s weak period during
      1645-1715, when the Thames froze solidly enough for eyewitnesses
      to report horse-driven carriages crossing it. &lt; <b><a

          ">http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/23/weak-sun-could-offset-some-global-warming-europe-us-study</a>
      </b>&gt;)<br>
      <br>
      Others frankly belittle predictions of future cooling.U.K.
      tabloids, conservative media, and others are (mis)reporting that
      the Earth will enter a “mini ice age” in the 2030s. In fact, not
      only is the story wrong, the reverse is actually true.<br>
      <br>
      The Earth is headed toward an imminent speed-up in global warming,
      as many recent studies have made clear, like this June study by
      NOAA. Indeed, a March study , entitled “Near-term acceleration in
      the rate of temperature change,” makes clear that a stunning
      acceleration in the rate of global warming is around the corner —
      with Arctic warming rising 1°F per decade by the 2020s!<br>
      <br>
      Also, right now, we appear to be in the midst of a long-awaited
      jump in global temperatures. Not only was 2014 the hottest year on
      record, but 2015 is in the process of blowing that record away .
      On top of that, models say a massive El Niño is growing, as USA
      Today reported last week . Since El Niños tend to set the record
      for the hottest years (since the regional warming adds to the
      underlying global warming trend), if 2015/2016 does see a super El
      Niño then next year may well crush the record this year sets.<br>

      <div align="center"><b> <big>New manufacturing process cuts
            lithium-ion battery cost in half </big></b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><br>
      Researchers at MIT and spinoff company 24M have developed an
      advanced manufacturing approach for rechargeable lithium-ion
      batteries. The researchers claim the new <br>
      <br>
      process could cut the manufacturing and materials cost in half
      compared to existing lithium-ion batteries, while also improving
      their performance, making them easier to recycle as well as
      flexible and resistant to damage.<br>
      <br>
      "We've reinvented the process," says Yet-Ming Chiang, the Kyocera
      Professor of Ceramics at MIT and a co-founder of 24M (and
      previously a co-founder of battery company A123). The existing
      process for manufacturing lithium-ion batteries, he says, has
      hardly changed in the two decades since the technology was
      invented, and is inefficient, with more steps and components than
      are really needed.<br>
      <br>
      By 2020, Chiang estimates, 24M will be able to produce batteries
      for less than $100 per kilowatt-hour of capacity - considered the
      threshold for mass adoption of electric vehicles, according to
      most analysts within the EV industry, Clean Technica notes, adding
      that the planned Tesla Gigafactory 1 also hopes to hit that figure
      by 2017.<br>
      <br>
      Today, the estimates of battery costs range wildly between $300
      per kilowatt-hour and $500 per kilowatt-hour, notes The Wall
      Street Journal. Because the battery is the most expensive part of
      an electric car, like the Tesla Model S or the forthcoming
      Chevrolet Bolt, lowering the cost of the battery significantly
      could have a big impact."<br>
      <br>
      <b> A "semisolid" battery</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The new process is a hybrid between a conventional solid battery
      and a "flow battery" design, in which the electrodes are actually
      suspensions of tiny particles carried by a liquid and pumped
      through various compartments of the battery. The flow battery was
      developed five years ago by Chiang and colleagues including W.
      Craig Carter, the MIT POSCO Professor of Materials Science and
      Engineering.<br>
      <br>
      In this new version, while the electrode material does not flow,
      it is composed of a similar semisolid, colloidal suspension of
      particles. Chiang and Carter refer to this as a "semisolid
      battery."<br>
      <br>
      This approach greatly simplifies manufacturing, and also makes
      batteries that are flexible and resistant to damage, says Chiang,
      who is senior author of a paper on the new battery design in the
      Journal of Power Sources. This analysis demonstrates that while a
      flow-battery system is appropriate for battery chemistries with a
      low energy density (those that can only store a limited amount of
      energy for a given weight), for high-energy-density devices such
      as lithium-ion batteries, the extra complexity and components of a
      flow system would add unnecessary extra cost.<br>
      <br>
      Almost immediately after publishing the earlier research on the
      flow battery, Chiang says, "We realized that a better way to make
      use of this flowable electrode technology was to reinvent the
      [lithium ion] manufacturing process."<br>
      <br>
      Instead of the standard method of applying liqquid coatings to a
      roll of backing material, and then having to wait for that
      material to dry before it can move to the next manufacturing step,
      the new process keeps the electrode material in a liquid state and
      requires no drying stage at all. Using fewer, thicker electrodes,
      the system reduces the conventional battery architecture's number
      of distinct layers, as well as the amount of nonfunctional
      material in the structure, by 80 percent.<br>
      <br>
      Having the electrode in the form of tiny suspended particles
      instead of consolidated slabs greatly reduces the path length for
      charged particles as they move through the material - a property
      known as "tortuosity." A less tortuous path makes it possible to
      use thicker electrodes, which, in turn, simplifies production and
      lowers cost.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Bendable and foldable</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The new design also produces a battery that is more flexible and
      resilient. Conventional lithium-ion batteries are composed of
      brittle electrodes that can crack under stress; the new design
      produces battery cells that can be bent, folded, or even
      penetrated by bullets without failing. This should improve both
      safety and durability, he says.<br>
      <br>
      The company has so far made about 10,000 batteries on its
      prototype assembly lines for testing. The process has received
      eight patents and has 75 additional patents under review; 24M has
      raised $50 million in financing from venture capital firms and a
      U.S. Department of Energy grant.<br>
      <br>
      The company is initially focusing on grid-scale installations,
      used to help smooth out power loads and provide backup for
      renewable energy sources that produce intermittent output, such as
      wind and solar power. But Chiang says the technology is also well
      suited to applications where weight and volume are limited, such
      as in electric vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      Another advantage of this approach, Chiang says, is that factories
      using the method can be scaled up by simply adding identical
      units. With traditional lithium-ion production, plants must be
      built at large scale from the beginning in order to keep down unit
      costs, so they require much larger initial capital expenditures.<br>
      <br>
      Venkat Viswanathan, an assistant professor of mechanical
      engineering at Carnegie Mellon University who was not involved in
      this work, says that 24M's new battery design "could do the same
      sort of disruption to [lithium ion] batteries manufacturing as
      what mini-mills did to the integrated steel mills."<br>
      <br>
      A University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign researcher was also
      involved in the study. The work was supported by the U.S.
      Department of Energy's Center for Energy Storage Research, based
      at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois.<br>

        <b>Chemtrails: Taking A Stand</b><br>
        <b>&nbsp;</b><br>
        <b>by </b><br>
        <b>Diane Harvey</b><br>
        <b>merak@sedona.net</b><br>

      <br>
      What is it that all of us involved in this pestiferous chemtrail
      issue have in common? It isn't just the wretched fact of being
      bombarded from above with sickening unknown substances, by unknown
      persons, for unknown reasons. We do seem to know something now,
      about what is being done to us and why. This is not comforting
      either, because chemtrails are just the tail of the technological
      dragon.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      What really brings us together is something much deeper even than
      this. And that is, that all of us see the disappearance, before
      our eyes, of all influence on our own future, and on the future of
      our children and grandchildren. On the surface, we are brought
      together by an investigation into what must be the most complex
      and expensive secret operation ever perpetrated on an unsuspecting
      population. So, beneath this outrageous monumental techno-crime,
      is the much larger specter of an absolutely out-of-control runaway
      government. "They", whoever they are, are dragging us, wherever
      they are going, by force. We aren't being asked for our
      cooperation, or for our votes. This means that the very word
      ''government" is now effectively meaningless. WHAT government?
      Where is it? Who is it? Can we say we know the first thing about
      who is in fact actually running our country? No. And this what
      lies at the very bottom of all of our very justifiable fears.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      On any practical and meaningful level, we are no longer citizens
      of a Republic at all. The sham of our supposed leaders, pretending
      to conduct a free and democratic society in our name, is a
      despicable insult to our intelligence. This is a very terrible
      fact we are looking in the eye here. And it leads us directly to
      the other important part of the eerie historical moment we are
      living in. Which is that, not only do we have no idea who is
      making the decisions for us now, we don't even have a population
      that cares.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      There is something frighteningly wrong with the American people
      right now. A mysterious fog has settled down over people's minds.
      Something beyond run-of-the-mill human apathy has overtaken this
      society. People have lost something so fundamental to human life
      that we can hardly believe it, even though we see its effects
      constantly. We can describe what we see, but we can barely grapple
      with the meaning of it. This is something new under the sun, and
      it is very strange. But it is real, and we know it. People are
      disconnected from basic reality at a level that actually seems
      impossible.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The fact that our government has gone off without us into dark
      secret places is a great crisis for our nation. But if our country
      were populated by alert, responsible and indignant citizens, this
      would not be happening.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      "It is not the function of our government to keep the citizen from
      falling into error; it is the function of the citizen to keep the
      government from falling into error." Justice Robert H. Jackson<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It has taken a long time to entirely sever so many human beings
      from their own consciences. It has taken decades of slow, careful,
      deliberate numbing on many fronts. To send most of a nation into a
      kind of life-long sleeping sickness of the mind has required
      methodical planning, and the enthusiastic cooperation of the
      people themselves. This peculiar condition of mass entrancement we
      are grappling with now was no accident.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      A hundred years ago it would not have been possible to radically
      alter the sky itself right under the noses of the public without
      them noticing. This basic point is extremely significant to our
      effort. We are trying to awaken people who, quite often and very
      decisively, do not want to know what is happening to them, or to
      their country. Most of our fellow citizens are literally in a
      self-induced trance state. They have actually unconsciously
      decided not to comprehend what they are seeing and hearing. They
      have renounced common sense, in order not to be disturbed. It
      takes a tremendous effort, intelligence, skillful timing and the
      right approach even to make a dent in this epidemic of willful
      ignorance.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      There have been hidden influences acting behind the scenes in this
      country for a very long time. What we are looking at in our
      generation is the result in the present of a very long history of
      corruption and secret influences. The roots of the present evil
      are old and deep. Even in his day, Henry David Thoreau looked
      around very carefully and said:<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      "How does it become a man to behave toward the American government
      today? I answer that he cannot without disgrace be associated with
      it."<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Far too soon after the glorious beginnings of our nation, the
      American people began to display a tendency to let things go on
      without their involvement, and in this we haven't been different
      from other people in other nations. Relatively few people have
      ever felt responsible for trying to fix what was wrong with the
      power structure of their time. In essence, relatively few have
      ever wanted to understand or to undertake the responsibilities for
      human freedom. Self-government by any people has had a very short
      shelf life in human history so far, for reasons that are sadly
      obvious to us today. Thomas Paine understood this, when he warned:<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      "Those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must undergo
      the fatigue of supporting it."<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      This history we are so habituated to, of a politically apathetic
      and disinterested population, has added up to a cost most people
      never foresaw. The price we have paid without noticing has become
      all too clear. Our country, as it lives in our imaginations, no
      longer has any existence in the real world. Unfortunately, the
      perennial themes of letting things go, generation after
      generation, has culminated in a government that has now entirely
      disappeared out from under us. Whatever and whoever it is, it is
      holed up somewhere out of sight. We are left holding the bag of
      misdirection: empty words, empty gestures, and empty appearances.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      We are here because we have eyes that can still see, and ears that
      can still hear. We have hearts that are still open and minds that
      still think. And above all else, we still hear and obey the
      dictates of conscience. Each of us knows that this is nothing
      special, but merely living as we were created to live. But it
      becomes a very special way to live when the majority of our fellow
      beings renounce all responsibility for their own lives at the most
      dangerous moment in history. When so many other people refuse to
      see and hear and understand, then the Accidental Activist is born.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      There isn't one of us who could ever have imagined spending so
      much time and energy this way. We are activists by default,
      because the majority of people have renounced their
      responsibilities as citizens. We become self-appointed voices of
      our national conscience because we have no other self-respecting
      choice. Each of us has accepted the single pertinent fact: If not
      me, then who? When Democracy actually exists, it is not necessary
      to have credentials or affiliates or titles other than that of
      concerned citizen. As Ralph Nadar pointed out:<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      "A couple of thousand years ago in Athens, a man could get up in
      the morning, wander around the city, and inquire into matters
      affecting his well-being and that of his fellow citizens. No one
      asked him 'Who are you with?'"<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Has the majority of our population always been unwilling to notice
      what is inconvenient to notice? Has the majority inevitably left
      it to the few to demand justice for all? We can see that it has,
      and in this way we are re-enacting an old pattern. But there are
      many worse aspects to our present predicament than those who lived
      before us had to contend with. What we are obliged to tackle,
      merely by being aware of it at all, is the lethal combination of
      concealed power, secret technology and an unprecedented level of
      materialism that powerfully induces mass sleeping sickness.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      We have a de facto clandestine government, practicing without a
      license. The long arm of the military is growing in the dark,
      reaching out to affect every living thing on earth without the
      slightest oversight or agreement from the profoundly affected.
      People have, on the whole, traded normal awareness for highly
      destructive substitutes, and the evidence of their senses for the
      short-lived comforts of being undisturbed by reality. What is
      there then to hope for, in looking at so many kinds of dark forces
      arrayed against us?<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      There are hopeful elements in this picture, despite appearances to
      the contrary. One great hope is in the fact that we have no
      leaders. Good government in our country has so far relied heavily
      on the existence of occasional great leaders. Since such people
      are always rare, in a very real sense this has been a serious
      weakness inherent in the practical working out of the democratic
      ideal. Great leaders have come and gone, but the citizenry, the
      supposed bedrock of a freedom-loving people, has not been
      sufficiently involved in national life. Yet things are so bad now
      that more and more people are being forced to realize that they
      have been tricked and abandoned by the wayside. We are not rare
      specimens, but part of a significant number of people who see
      things going disastrously off the rails in various ways. In every
      country human beings are looking around and wondering why they
      should put up with having no say at all in their own world. We
      might be surprised at how many of us there are, still divided by
      different issues, yet united in the basic understanding of what we
      are looking at.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      But the price of such dedication to the original principles of
      active citizenship is extraordinarily high these days. When so
      many are so afraid to exercise their basic rights and duties,
      those who choose to do so are forced to pay dearly for their
      efforts in behalf of all.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Simply by taking our own Constitution seriously, we make ourselves
      outcasts.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      "You need only reflect that one of the best ways to get yourself a
      reputation as a dangerous citizen these days is to go about
      repeating the very phrases which our founding fathers used in
      their struggle for independence." Charles A. Beard<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It is a hard business to endure being seen as a dangerous and
      tedious eccentric when you know you are merely awake. It is harder
      than we could have imagined, to spend so much time, energy and
      money trying to make up for what an entire nation ought to be
      doing along with us. And it is hardest of all to suffer, as many
      have, painful discord in relationships with family and friends.
      What is more agonizing than being obliged on occasion to choose
      between truth and justice for all, and a comforting personal
      relationship? We do not romanticize the difficulties of serving a
      great cause- we have experienced the hardships far too acutely for
      that. But we have in common that what we know has swept up our
      personal hopes, wishes, and dreams into another and far larger
      field of life. We are living now in a larger world of extreme
      human necessity. Our source of nourishment is the spirit of
      freedom itself. Because what is slowly but surely coming into
      being, through all our efforts, is the renewal of the original
      energy that created this country in the first place. The deepest
      truth in all of this is that we are serving the sacred purposes of
      life itself at a critical and momentous time in human history. And
      for this opportunity, despite all our difficulties, and despite
      the forces arrayed against us, we are profoundly grateful.<br>

            humans, study confirms</b></big><br>

      <br>
      The idea that DNA from genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is
      broken down in the digestive tract and rendered innocuous, a
      common industry claim, is patently false. A recent study published
      in the scientific journal PLOS ONE found that large, meal-derived
      DNA fragments from GMOs are fully capable of transferring their
      genes directly into the bloodstream, deconstructing the myth that
      transgenic foods act on the body in the same way as natural foods.<br>
      <br>
      A combined analysis of four other independent studies involving
      more than 1,000 human samples and a team of researchers from
      universities in Hungary, Denmark and the U.S. looked at the
      assimilation process for GMOs as they are currently consumed
      throughout the world. This includes derivatives of GM crops such
      as high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) from GM corn, for instance, and
      soy protein from GM soybeans, as well as meat derived from animals
      fed a GM-based diet.<br>
      <br>
      After looking at the data on how the human body processes these
      and other forms of GMOs, the team discovered that DNA from GMOs is
      not completely broken down by the body during the digestion
      process. What would normally be degraded into smaller constituents
      like amino acids and nucleic acids was found to remain whole. Not
      only this, but these larger DNA fragments were found to pass
      directly into the circulatory system, sometimes at a level higher
      than actual human DNA.<br>
      <br>
      “[B]ased on the analysis of over 1000 human samples from four
      independent studies, we report evidence that meal-derived DNA
      fragments which are large enough to carry complete genes can avoid
      degradation and through an unknown mechanism enter the human
      circulation system,” explained the authors in their study
      abstract.<br>
      Advertisement<br>
      <br>
      “In one of the blood samples the relative concentration of plant
      DNA is higher than the human DNA.”<br>
      Genes from GMOs transfer into small intestine, alter composition
      of beneficial bacteria<br>
      <br>
      This is an astounding discovery that proves false claims made by
      Monsanto and others that GMOs are no different from non-GMOs as
      far as the body is concerned. Monsanto even claims on its “Food
      Safety” page for GMOs that the DNA from GMOs is “extensively
      digested” and “present[s] no hazards,” both of which have now been
      shown to be lies.<br>
      <br>
      Based on this latest analysis of how food genes are transferred
      from the digestive tract into the bloodstream, it is now apparent
      that the genes of GMOs pass into the bloodstream whole. Their
      presence is also associated with major inflammatory conditions
      such as inflammatory bowel disease, adenoma and colorectal cancer.<br>
      <br>
      The presence of transgenic genes in the small intestine was also
      found to affect the composition of beneficial bacteria, which are
      responsible for protecting the gut against foreign invaders and
      helping the body absorb nutrients from food. Individuals with
      ileostomies, or perforations in their abdominal walls as a result
      of surgery, were found to literally be harboring full DNA
      sequences from GMOs in their intestinal tracts.<br>
      <br>
      None of this is really all that surprising, of course, as the
      biological activities behind how GMOs are processed by the human
      body have never been legitimately studied. Biotechnology companies
      have always just claimed that GMOs are the same as real food,
      without any evidence to back this up, and this has been enough for
      the government to keep them on the market for nearly 20 years.<br>
      <br>
      “One small mutation in a human being can determine so much, the
      point is when you move a gene, one gene, one tiny gene out of an
      organism into a different one you completely change its context,”
      said David Suzuki, co-founder of the David Suzuki Foundation.
      “There is no way to predict how it’s going to behave and what the
      outcome will be.”<br>

      The Chattanooga shooting inspired an influential former general [
      Bitch Wesley Clark ] to call forinternment camps for thought
      radicals. Pretty outrageous, I know. Imagine how sinister that
      agenda would be if the Chattanooga shooting is proven to be a
      scripted hoax?<br>
      <br>
      YouTube researchers MattyD 4 Truth and PROVE ME WRONG have
      uncovered records that appear to show at least one of the
      Chattanooga victims died years before the latest “mass shooter”
      media event.<br>

      The establishment media is running dramatic stories of Lance
      Corporal Skip Wells’ last words to his girlfriend, but perhaps
      those last words were spoken in 2004.<br>
      <br>
      A strikingly similar looking Marine Lance Corporal Larry L. Wells
      was reported to have been killed in Iraq in 2004, according to
      Washington Post’s Faces of the Fallen.&nbsp; Screenshot saved
      below in case they remove the page.<br>
      <br>
      Even creepier, the guy in the photo identified as Larry Wells in
      2004 and Skip Wells in 2015 also seems to be a guest with Bill
      O’Reilly to talk about the event! Maybe they’re just lookalikes?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Psyop</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The corporate media was immediately on script for the Chattanooga
      shooting event like many others that follow the exact same plot
      line. Stop me if you’ve heard this one:<br>
      <br>
      A lone wolf radicalized on the Internet, hopped up on SSRIs but
      still somehow an expert marksman not seen since Rambo (seriously
      there are never any survivors).<br>
      <br>
      Shooter has almost no social media trail except convenient
      manifestos that highlight all of the ideologies the controllers
      want to snuff out. And don’t forget the emotionless actors…<br>
      <br>
      Then the solution meme is always the same: “You’re in danger, give
      up your rights, give us more authority and resources to protect
      you, you need us, you really need us, more arms for authorities
      less for free people.”<br>
      <br>
      An official figure goes on national TV to provide the detailed
      agenda, like General Wesley Clark did by announcing the national
      policy solution that he hopes other nations will adopt too:<br>
      <br>
      "If these people are radicalized, and they don’t support the
      United States, and they’re disloyal to the United States, as a
      matter of principle, fine, that’s their right, but it’s our (the
      government’s) right and our obligation to segregate them from the
      normal community for the duration of the conflict."<br>
      <br>
      This phony shooting story has already resulted in orders to arm
      the National Guard in various states and more hysterical calls to
      crack down on online radicalization. Probably much more to come
      too.<br>
      <br>
      YouTuber MattyD also points to a 2009 Washington Post story
      featuring an image of the grave site sharing the same name of
      another alleged Chattanooga victim, Marine Sergeant Thomas J.
      Sullivan.<br>
      <br>
      The story refers to his family starting a D.C. area nonprofit
      called Sergeant Sullivan Center in his honor. But the ages and
      images of the 2009 Thomas Sullivan don’t match with the
      Chattanooga victim, and it’s quite a common name.<br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless, it’s becoming obvious to anyone who pays attention
      to the news that many of these hyped shooting events appear to
      have the same shady characteristics and the same results —
      politicians clamoring for more authority to act against thought
      criminals.<br>
      <br>
      More research is needed, but don’t be the last one to realize how
      badly you’ve been duped. <br>

        <br>
        <i>Electric fields affect wing movement, leading to agitation
          and changes in brain chemistry</i><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>A new piece of research led by the University of Southampton
      has found that the behaviour of fruit flies, which are commonly
      used in laboratory experiments, is altered by electric fields.<br>
      <br>
      The research indicates that the wings of the insects are disturbed
      by static electric fields, leading to changes in avoidance
      behaviour and the neurochemical balance of their brains.<br>
      <br>
      The paper, published in the Proceeding of the Royal Society B,
      suggests that the plastic housing laboratory fruit flies are
      commonly kept in (which hold their own static electric charge)
      could agitate the flies, changing their behaviour and
      neurochemical profile which has the potential to impact or
      confound other studies for which they are being used.<br>
      <br>
      "Fruit flies are often used as model organisms to understand
      fundamental problems in biology," say Professor Philip Newland,
      Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Southampton and
      lead author of the study. "75 per cent of the genes that cause
      disease in humans are shared by fruit flies, so by studying them
      we can learn a lot about basic mechanisms.<br>
      <br>
      "Plastic can retain a charge for a long period and, given the use
      of plastic in the rearing of these insects and other small insects
      such as mosquitos, long term exposure to these fields is
      inevitable."<br>
      <br>
      The researchers put fruit flies in a Y-shaped maze, with one arm
      of the maze exposed to an electric charge and the other receiving
      none. They found that the flies avoided the charged chamber and
      gathered in the non-charged arm. Interestingly flies with no wings
      didn't display this behaviour, and flies with smaller wings only
      avoided higher charges -- suggesting it is the wings of the fly
      that are involved in detection and are affected by the fields.<br>
      <br>
      This was borne out when subjecting stationary flies to electric
      fields. The researchers observed that the wings of the flies could
      be manipulated by a field of a similar strength to that which
      produced the avoidance behaviour.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Newland explains: "When a fly was placed underneath a
      negatively charged electrode, the static field forces caused
      elevation of the wings toward the electrode, as opposite charges
      were attracted.<br>
      <br>
      "Static electric fields are all around us but for a small insect
      like a fruit fly it appears these fields' electrical charges are
      significant enough to have an effect on their wing movement and
      this means they will avoid them if possible."<br>
      <br>
      The effect on the wings being moved seems to agitate the flies, as
      revealed by changes in their brain chemistry. Flies exposed to an
      electric field showed increased levels of octopamine (similar to
      noradrenaline in humans) which indicates stress and aggression.
      The flies also showed decreased levels of dopamine, meaning they
      would be more responsive to external stimuli.<br>
      <br>
      As well as having consequences for flies used in laboratories, the
      results also have implications for flies in their natural
      environment.<br>
      <br>
      "We are particularly interested in how electric fields could be
      used in pest control," says co-author Dr Christopher Jackson, also
      of Southampton. "Meshes that can generate static electric fields
      could be put across windows of houses or green houses to prevent
      insects like fruit flies or even mosquitos entering, yet allow air
      movement."<br>
      <br>
      "It also raises questions of how pollinating species like bees
      could be affected by power lines, which have stronger electric
      fields."<br>

      How to fake a parabola: Backyard solar catenary reflector (SCR)
      cooker built in 20 minutes using sheet steel and wood.<br>
      <br>
      You can divide most solar power research into two camps:
      increasing efficiency or reducing cost. A few years ago, when I
      decided to do some amateur solar research of my own, I chose the
      “cheap” route.<br>
      <br>
      I had the idea to use mirrors with a catenary curve to concentrate
      sunlight. The catenary, described by y = cosh x, is the curve that
      ropes or other flexible materials naturally fall into between two
      supports. This curve was mistaken for the parabola (y = x2) until
      the difference was cleared up by 17th-century mathematicians.<br>
      <br>
      Parabolas are often used for concentrators since they focus
      parallel rays into one point. I reasoned that if I could find
      parameters under which catenaries and parabolas are similar, I
      could make a solar catenary reflector (SCR) that would effectively
      concentrate sunlight.<br>
      <br>
      The advantage of the SCR is that it’s self-forming. Solid
      parabolic shapes don’t occur naturally, and you need to make them
      stiff and strong to maintain their shape against wind, snow, and
      other destructive outdoor forces.<br>
      <br>
      And the SCR is quick and inexpensive to build, requiring no
      special tools or knowledge. Just hang some flexible, reflective
      material and you have it. SCRs could ultimately be more durable
      than rigid parabolic reflectors because of their Zen-like ability
      to deflect with the wind, instead of fighting against it.<br>
      <br>
      To determine when a catenary will reflect like a parabola, I
      modeled the problem mathematically on a computer. As expected, I
      found an aspect ratio where a catenary reflector almost matches a
      parabolic mirror at concentrating light: 1 high to 4 wide, for a
      symmetrical reflector.<br>
      <br>
      In other words, let the material hang down ¼ the distance between
      the posts. Following this formula, a couple of teenagers built an
      effective SCR cooker using hand tools in 20 minutes, under my
      guidance.<br>
      <br>
      Surprisingly, it turns out that a properly proportioned asymmetric
      catenary reflector (ACR), where one support is higher than the
      other, will do a good job at concentrating light that’s not
      exactly perpendicular to the axis of the curve. This means that
      within certain limits, an ACR can concentrate the light as the sun
      travels across the sky.<br>
      <br>
      Large, inexpensive ACRs hold promise as a way of getting more out
      of smaller, more precious photovoltaic panels. I’m currently
      researching this pairing, and want to explore whether such designs
      are better than parabolas at focusing diffused light — the
      Achilles’ heel of the parabolic concentrators. To keep the program
      within my kitchen-science budget, I’m working with miniatures. In
      my early experiments, I doubled the output of my photovoltaic
      cell.<br>

            revolutionize meat industry</b><br>
        </big><br>
        <b>by</b><br>
        <br>

      <br>
      “Superchilling” may sound like what surfers do on a daily basis,
      but in fact it might be the new alternative way to preserve
      meat—without the use of preservatives.<br>
      <br>
      SINTEF, the largest independent Scandinavian research institution,
      is testing a method they developed a few years ago called
      superchilling. This involves cooling meat to about 27.5 degrees
      Fahrenheit (-2.5 Celsius)—the temperature at which the meat is
      about to freeze, but doesn’t completely.<br>
      <br>
      “At -2.5 degrees [Celsius] below zero, the fish is not completely
      frozen. It thus retains its quality of freshness, and will not be
      perceived or experienced as a thawed frozen foodstuff,” said
      SINTEF in a press release.<br>
      <br>
      Why would I want mostly not frozen meat?<br>
      <br>
      Should superchilling be adopted as common practice, it would have
      many effects across the board.<br>
      <br>
      The most obvious is that it is a chemical-free preserving method
      and works for up to month, a major boon for organic food vendors
      and consumers alike. This could also mean that less food is wasted
      globally. In America alone, up to 40% of food is wasted, according
      to a 2012 NRDC report. However, with a longer shelf life, meat is
      less likely to go to waste.<br>
      <br>
      Further, superchilled food costs less money and produces less CO2
      to transport, as fresh salmon must be transported in a box
      containing 30% ice. “This ice could be eliminated by superchilling
      the salmon, because in this state, the ice is inside the fish
      itself,” explained SINTEF.<br>
      <br>
      Superchilling could also help companies maintain their product
      sales all throughout the year. “This method will enable them to
      even out seasonal variations and supply their customers all the
      year round, since many of them do not produce continuously and
      therefore need to warehouse more stock, and for longer.”<br>
      <br>
      Lastly, if the amount of wasted meat decreases, the demand for
      meat likewise decreases. This would mean having to raise fewer
      animals—which decreases greenhouse gas emissions. And because they
      would prepare and transport fewer products, emissions are further
      decreased and less money is spent to get a product to a store. In
      theory, this would lower the cost of fresh meat.<br>
      <br>
      Sounds great! What’s stopping us?<br>
      <br>
      According to the press release, there are “a number of
      explanations for why superchilling has not yet been adopted by
      food retailers: unfortunately, their customers’ habit of throwing
      out food has certain advantages for them; it increases demand, and
      sales increase.”<br>
      <br>
      Also, transportation is inexpensive, making it affordable to ship
      large quantities of ice.<br>
      <br>
      And, most simply of all, vendors don’t want to do it: “the
      technology is not widely used by ‘conventional’ food producers,
      because supermarket chains tend to prioritize the cheapest and
      simplest methods of chilling,” explained SINTEF.<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>A new method keeps salmon fresh for a whole month, without the
      use of chemicals.<br>
      <br>
      The technology is called superchilling, and it lies somewhere
      between freezing the fish and cooling it down. Now it is about to
      provide useful help to organic food producers.<br>
      <br>
      This method of conserving food was developed in order to maintain
      fresh food quality over a long period of time, thus reducing the
      amount of food that ends up in the bin rather than in our
      stomachs.<br>
      <br>
      Now it is going to be tested on ecological salmon and meat, and
      the hope is that it will make a difference to the shopping habits
      of ‘purpose-driven food consumers’.<br>
      <br>
      The underlying thinking is that people who buy ecological food are
      more concerned about the environment and thus are more aware of
      emissions and resource utilisation than those who buy ‘ordinary’
      raw materials,” says project manager Michael Bantle of SINTEF.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, the technology is not widely used by ‘conventional’ food
      producers, because supermarket chains tend to prioritise the
      cheapest and simplest methods of chilling.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Joint research effort for small companies</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      SINTEF is going to test the method on Norwegian ecological raw
      materials among other products, as part of the European Union
      project SUS-Organic, which is aimed at helping smaller companies
      that produce organic food.<br>
      <br>
      “These small companies don’t have the resources to develop and
      demonstrate the potential of superchilling, so that superchilled
      food can start to be accepted by consumers. This makes it a rather
      idealistic project,” says the SINTEF scientist.<br>
      <br>
      For organic companies, it is particularly important that their
      products can be given a longer shelf life without the need for
      chemicals. This method will enable them to even out seasonal
      variations and supply their customers all the year round, since
      many of them do not produce continuously and therefore need to
      warehouse more stock, and for longer.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Tonnes of food go to waste</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In Norway, hundreds of tonnes of food a year are thrown out every
      year, a figure that includes organic foods. The situation is the
      same<br>
      all over Europe, and this has inspired the European Union to look
      for solutions to the problem. If we can prolong the time during
      which food is regarded as perfectly fresh, this will help to
      reduce the food waste ‘mountain’.<br>
      <br>
      “The initiative is very positive,” says Michael Bantle. “We
      already know that superchilling is an efficient method, and if we
      can demonstrate that if it can increase the shelf-life of organic
      produced foods as well as it does for conventional foodstuffs, we
      believe that there will be a market for superchilled products.<br>
      <br>
      “We hope and believe that consumers who buy organic foods are more
      concerned about conserving resources than the average consumer. If
      we can manage our food better, we can also produce less even as we
      supply more markets. Today, every single Norwegian throws out an
      average of a kilo of food a week.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Can be profitable – for shops too</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The scientist also believes that the method can be profitable for
      food stores as well. They can advertise superchilled organic food
      as a mark of quality and demonstrate that they are showing social
      responsibility for a better environment and a reduction in wasted
      food.<br>
      <br>
      “Is there anything to suggest that superchilling would not be
      suitable for organic salmon, for example? “<br>
      <br>
      “No, but we know that among other things, organic salmon contain a
      higher proportion of marine lipids, which protect the body from
      cardiovascular disease, among other illnesses. They have also been
      fed less antibiotics and medicines. This may have some influence
      on how they respond to superchilling,” says Bantle.<br>
      <br>
      “What we are hoping is that there will not be any difference. If
      that turns out to be the case, we can be fairly certain that
      superchilling will be adopted. In the long run, this could lead to
      more producers wishing to employ this technology, so that it can
      also be used to a greater extent on foodstuffs that have been
      conventionally produced. Longer shelf-life simply offers
      environmental benefits irrespective of whether or not the food is
      organic.<br>
      <br>
      “The supermarket chains ought to have invested more in cold-stores
      that are capable of keeping both fish and meat superchilled at
      quite stable temperatures. Unfortunately, this is not being done
      today because these chains prioritise the simplest and cheapest
      solutions. However, I hope that this method will contribute to the
      adoption of the technology,” says Bantle.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Superchilling is also climate-friendly</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Bantle has a number of explanations for why superchilling has not
      yet been adopted by food retailers: unfortunately, their
      customers’ habit of throwing out food has certain advantages for
      them; it increases demand, and sales increase.<br>
      <br>
      The EU’s regulations regarding what can be classified as fresh or
      frozen also need to be revised. Today, superchilled food is
      regarded as frozen rather than fresh, even if it is of identical
      quality to fresh food. This ought to be changed, believes the
      SINTEF scientist.<br>
      <br>
      Another reason is that transport is simply too cheap today, which
      means that producers can pay to freight large quantities of ice:<br>
      <br>
      Today, fresh salmon are transported in boxes that contain about 30
      per cent ice. They are then sent southwards to Europe, and by air
      to countries such as Japan. This ice could be eliminated by
      superchilling the salmon, because in this state, the ice is inside
      the fish itself. The weight reduction reduces fuel consumption,
      which in turn means lower CO2 emissions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Facts about superchilling:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Superchilling involves cooling the salmon to about -2.5 degrees
      Celsius, i.e. to just below the temperature at which it begins to
      freeze. At -2.5 degrees below zero, the fish is not completely
      frozen. It thus retains its quality of freshness, and will not be
      perceived or experienced as a thawed frozen foodstuff.<br>
      <br>
      • Fish keep their fresh quality for longer - as much as a month.<br>
      • This means lower CO2 emissions.<br>
      • Less food is discarded because the shelf life can be as long as
      30 days.<br>
      • One challenge concerns how to put an exact sell-by date on
      superchilled food, because this will depend on the ability of the
      ice to keep the temperature constant.<br>

      processing. Whole fish is brought to an under-cooled state in at
      least two steps by means of i) placing the fish in a
      salt-controlled solution and/or slurry ice having a salt
      concentration of 0,1 to 23,3% and a temperature of 8 to -21 DEG C
      and ii) transferring the fish in salt-controlled solution and/ or
      slurry ice having a salt concentration of 0-15% and a temperature
      of 5 to -10 DEG C. Therefter the fish is processed. The invention

      A current Centers for Disease Control (CDC) senior scientist has
      made an unprecedented admission: he and his colleagues–he says–
      committed scientific misconduct to cover up a meaningful link
      between vaccines and autism in black boys.<br>
      <br>
      Just as startling, the CDC scientist, Dr. William Thompson, says
      the study co-authors “scheduled a meeting to destroy documents
      related to the study. The remaining four co-authors all met and
      brought a big garbage can into the meeting room, and reviewed and
      went through all the hardcopy documents that we had thought we
      should discard, and put them into a huge garbage can.” ...<br>

      <br>
      The CSIRO, Australia’s peak science body, might have stumbled
      across the most sought of cures in human history — the hangover
      remedy.<br>
      <br>
      The scientists have been researching pears with Horticulture
      Innovation Australia to discover the hidden benefits of the humble
      fruit.<br>
      <br>
      Apparently pears can lower cholesterol, relieve constipation and
      have anti-inflammatory effects.<br>
      <br>
      But the big interest is that the pear appears to ward off
      hangovers and at the same time lowers blood alcohol levels.<br>
      <br>
      Lead researcher Manny Noakes says the pears, specifically the
      Korean variety, act on the key enzymes involved in alcohol
      metabolism, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase
      (ALDH).<br>
      <br>
      To get the effect you need to drink 220 ml of Korean pear juice,
      although consumption of whole pears could produce a similar
      effect.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Noakes says overall hangover severity, as measured by a
      14 item hangover symptom scale, was significantly reduced.<br>
      <br>
      But the downside is that you’ve got to take the pear juice before
      hitting the alcohol.<br>
      <br>
      “The effect was only demonstrated if pears were consumed before
      alcohol consumption,” says Professor Noakes says. “There is no
      evidence that you can consume pears after drinking and avoid a
      hangover.<br>
      <br>
      And remember, the very best way to not get a hangover is to not
      drink in the first place.”<br>
      <br>
      The study is only a preliminary scoping exercise with the results
      still to be finalised.<br>
      <br>
      However, Professor Noakes and her team hope to deliver a
      comprehensive review of the scientific literature on pears, pear
      components and relevant health measures. <br>

      </b>Whether or not you believe there is life beyond our planet,
      this is an intriguing story that includes a BBC war reporter, a
      Pulitzer Prize winning Harvard Psychiatrist and hundreds of others
      as well as ten plus hours of archival footage with those present
      both in 1994 and today. This is the definitive documentary on this
      event.<br>
      <br>
      On September 16th, 1994 at the Ariel primary school in rural
      Zimbabwe, 60+ school children described seeing a disc shaped craft
      land behind the school during the morning break time. Some of them
      reported seeing two strange beings approach the group. There were
      multiple sightings of unusual aerial phenomena by thousands of
      Zimbabweans during this same time period. <br>
      <br>
      The children were interviewed immediately thereafter by Tim Leach,
      BBC Bureau Chief for Zimbabwe, and then by several other news
      agencies. Noted Harvard psychiatrist Dr. John Mack traveled to
      Zimbabwe to interview the children in depth due to the unusual
      nature of this event. After exhaustive investigation Dr. Mack
      concluded that the children were not making up the story.<br>
      <br>
      Though this story was initially publicized worldwide, it quickly
      disappeared from the public eye but not from the hearts and minds
      of those who witnessed it. For twenty years many of these
      witnesses have felt that their voices have not been heard. Until
      now.<br>
      <br>
      Filmmaker Randall Nickerson was approached by the John Mack
      Institute and asked if he would be interested in making a
      documentary about the Ariel School event. What struck him about
      the original interviews was the sincerity and sense of truth
      demonstrated by the children about what they said they had
      witnessed. They had seen something that affected them profoundly.
      Nickerson traveled to the school and began to locate the now adult
      children, teachers and other previously unknown witnesses.<br>
      <br>
      As he began to interview the children, now in their late 20s and
      early 30s many with families of their own, it became clear that
      this story was not over for them. The event continues to have a
      deep impact on many of their lives. Their courage, conviction and
      consistency, both then and now, makes it difficult to dismiss this
      account as child’s imagination. <br>

      <i>“The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that
        it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a
        great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity,
        relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells
        like money. In fact, the history of the recent financial crisis,
        which doubles as a history of the rapid decline and fall of the
        suddenly swindled dry American empire, reads like a Who's Who of
        Goldman Sachs graduates.” (1) - Matt Taibbi, Rolling Stone</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      <i>“For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while
        some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced
        themselves through with many sorrows.”- King James Bible, 1
        Timothy 6:10</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      The sky's the limit and big banks are investing in energy sectors
      such as nuclear power instead of renewable energy at the expense
      of humankind, the biome and biota, and future generations of the
      Earth. Banks like Goldman Sachs have been investing in the uranium
      market which is one of the reasons the transition away from a
      dangerous, nuclear power system to a more viable and safer
      renewable energy system is taking so long to occur.<br>
      <br>
      Nuclear expert Arnie Gundersen of Fairewinds reminds us that Tokyo
      Electric Power Company (Tepco) and the Japanese government have
      consistently refused help from foreign engineering firms who have
      proposed solutions at “Dai-ichi,” Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant #1
      (FNPP#1) (2). But due to reasons of national security or cultural
      pride, they refuse help despite Fukushima having dumped 23,000
      truckloads of radioactively contaminated water into the Pacific
      Ocean.<br>
      <br>
      The ice wall meant to prevent leakage from the plant appears to be
      an engineering failure (as previously documented: 3; see also
      other technical hurdles: 4).<br>
      <br>
      Tepco blunders on, marauding the global commons like the deranged
      bandits who pillaged farmer's crops in Seven Samurai.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ring Of Fire</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Gundersen noted that Japanese banks are demanding the restart of
      the nuclear reactors, despite clear public reluctance or
      opposition to doing so. The banks loaned Tepco and other utilities
      money while the were shut down after the 311 disaster in order to
      carry on operations. But it is costly to keep a full staff on hand
      while no electricity is being produced.<br>
      <br>
      The banks, like Shylock in The Merchant of Venice, want their
      pound of flesh and don't care if Japan is contaminated by another
      nuclear disaster caused by earthquake, tsunami or volcano. It's
      just business.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Money Rules</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Look around the world these days. Money Rules. Power Rules.
      Usurious, Fractional Reserve Banking Ponzi Schemes &amp; Financial
      Scams Rule. Greece is now under the control of the central bankers
      who are grinding it into the dust of bones. The Parthenon may be
      sold off to Sheldon Adelsen and relocated in Las Vegas.<br>
      <br>
      Big banks like Goldman Sachs (GS), who the prolific author, Texe
      Marrs calls the “world's most evil and corrupt bank,” while its
      CEO, Lloyd Blankfein “arrogantly boasts 'I'm doing God's work' ”
      are busy bodies hard at work stealing other people's money (5).<br>
      <br>
      The excellent X-22 Report often notes that the “US central
      bankers” care nothing about the welfare or suffering of people
      whose lives are destroyed through anti-growth austerity policies,
      rather only about giving you more DEBT. The business of usurious
      banking is the art of selling debt as product. Modern society has
      adopted the mentality of “debt slave.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Take Over The World</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Dean Henderson of the Left Hook website offers a historical
      context from which the Vampire Squid Blood Suckers of Goldman
      Sachs emerged:<br>
      <br>
      “For over a century Goldman Sachs has joined the Houses of Morgan,
      Rockefeller, Rothschild, Warburg and Lazard in lording over the US
      industrial base, profiting from boom and depression alike. In July
      1929 Goldman launched the Shenandoah and Blue Ridge investment
      trusts, at a time when the burgeoning middle classes were eager to
      hop on the Wall Street easy money bandwagon. The Goldman Sachs
      Trading Corporation sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of
      shares to public. They peaked at $104. All the while Goldman
      insiders were selling. By the fall of 1934 the shares were worth
      $1.75/each....<br>
      <br>
      Insiders at Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Lehman and Merrill Lynch
      had also bailed out ahead of the Crash of 1929. Americans were
      outraged. A resurgent populism led to jail time for bankers such
      as Citibank President Charles Mitchell. It led to the passage of
      the Glass-Steagal Act, repealed by President Clinton in 1995,
      which stated that banks could be either commercial, investment or
      private banks- one of the three. And it led to Congressional
      inquiries into the Federal Reserve private banking monopoly. Many
      of these investigations were conducted by the House Banking
      Committee, chaired by Rep. Louis McFadden (D-NY). Speaking of the
      Great Depression, McFadden concluded, 'It was no accident. It was
      a carefully contrived occurrence…The international bankers sought
      to bring about a condition of despair here so they might emerge as
      rulers of all of us' ” (6).<br>
      <br>
      Mike King's new and authoritative history of the Rothschild family
      is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the
      central banking cartel which owns much of the world's money supply
      and controls the politicians who serve its interests (7).<br>
      <br>
      The context is relevant, after a century of struggle is was the
      Federal Reserve whose creation in 1913 was the final nail in the
      coffin of the American republic. A private banking cartel, the
      so-called “Federal Reserve” was finally able to monopolize US
      money supply. In the same year the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
      and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were created to
      force citizens to pay income tax to cover interest on the “loans”
      from the Fed to the US government (8). No nation needs “bankster
      gangsters” to print their nation's currency. The richest country
      in the world, blessed with resources and ingenuity, yet 20 percent
      of children are raised in poverty.<br>
      <br>
      Where did the money go? After the 2008 financial crash trillions
      of it went to Goldman Sachs. The Federal Reserve is the fount of
      insider info to their tribal brethren at the desks of Goldman
      Sachs where the rigging of markets occurs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Goldman Sachs In The Black, Jack</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A recent US Senate report notes that GS's “own regulator, the
      Federal Reserve, gave its blessing to this unprecedented and
      dangerous encroachment by banking interests into industrial
      commodity ownership and has effectively looked the other way as
      the banks moved into industrial commerce activities like owning
      pipelines and power plants. One would think that the mega banks’
      regulator, the Federal Reserve, would be the first line of defense
      against this type of dangerous sprawl by banks. According to the
      Levin Subcommittee report, the Federal Reserve was actually the
      facilitator of the sprawl by the banks” (9).<br>
      <br>
      GS also helps determine who will be the US President by donating
      to both political parties (10). Wealthy donors and corporations
      can now spend unlimited funds on political donations, essentially
      now owning the political process: lock, stock and barrel (11). In
      other words, GS gains favor with whoever wins in the largely
      rigged (Ala. electronic voting) and skewed US political electoral
      system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Nuclear Criminal Cover-Up</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      While President Barack Obama was originally cool on nuclear power
      in his early years of campaigning, he has adopted the policy that
      in order to fight “climate change” nuclear power is a viable
      option. GS have gotten their money's worth with Obama's 2013
      choice for US secretary of Energy, Ernest Moniz, who is a “booster
      of nuclear power” and hypocritically, “fracking” for hydrocarbon
      reserves (12).<br>
      <br>
      Ever since the Fukushima triple reactor nuclear meltdown in Japan
      in 2011, nuclear power has been strongly discredited as a viable
      energy source. That image of a mushroom cloud over reactor three
      as it blew sky high, propelling plutonium (the world's most
      dangerous substance) well up into the atmosphere and even further
      laterally alarmed the public about the supposed safety of nuclear
      power energy production. A mushroom cloud here, a mushroom cloud
      there, pretty soon you're talking about some real radiation.<br>
      <br>
      On average the US has nuclear meltdown “near misses” every 3 weeks
      (13) while radiation from Fukushima is still being dismissed by
      the nuclear establishment as having no detrimental health or
      environmental impact. What a lie.<br>
      <br>
      The funders of high profile studies claiming that low level
      radiation is practically safe are inevitably from the very same
      complex of monied interests. It is a glaring conflict of interest
      where the “experts” plead with the public to “trust us” (14). When
      these kinds of studies are published in mainstream newspapers
      there is no mention of potential bias in the funding of the study,
      it is just reported as “factual” news (15).<br>
      <br>
      In reality, the nuke industry is carrying out a war against
      renewable energy, despite the costs and risks there is no stopping
      the radioactive monster even though viable and safer renewable
      energy already exists (16; 17).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Uranium, Uranium Everywhere, But Not A Drop To Drink</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The context for major bank investments into commodities is a world
      plentiful in uranium and yet hard-to-sell-to-the-public nuclear
      power. According to the World Nuclear Organization (WNO):<br>
      <br>
      “Production from world uranium mines now supplies over 90% of the
      requirements of power utilities. Primary production from mines is
      supplemented by secondary supplies, principally by ex-military
      material and other inventories. World mine production has expanded
      significantly since about 2005” (18).<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the WNO boasts that:<br>
      <br>
      “Nuclear power capacity worldwide is increasing steadily, with
      over 60 reactors under construction in 15 countries. Most reactors
      on order or planned are in the Asian region, though there are
      major plans for new units in Russia. Significant further capacity
      is being created by plant upgrading. Plant life extension programs
      are maintaining capacity, in the USA particularly.<br>
      <br>
      Today there are some 437 nuclear power reactors operating in 31
      countries plus Taiwan, with a combined capacity of over 380 GWe.
      In 2014 these provided 2411 billion kWh, over 11% of the world's
      electricity.<br>
      <br>
      Over 60 power reactors are currently being constructed in 13
      countries plus Taiwan (see Table below), notably China, South
      Korea, UAE and Russia” (19).<br>
      <br>
      The IAEA reports that there are currently 67 nuclear reactors
      under construction mainly in the Far East, Asia, the Middle East
      and Eastern Europe (20).<br>
      <br>
      For example, “China claims to hold over 2 million tonnes of
      uranium deposits” and yet are “working on uranium-free nuclear
      plants in attempt to combat smog.... Beijing brings forward
      deadline for world's first thorium-fuelled facility in attempt to
      break reliance on fossil fuels.” Although thorium may not be all
      it is cracked up to be in terms of a safer and viable alternative
      to uranium (21; 22; 23).<br>
      <br>
      *(Incidentally, China's hunger for decorative ornaments is driving
      the world's most graceful and grand living creature, the African
      elephant, toward extinction due to the unsustainable ivory trade
      (24).)<br>
      <br>
      <b>There's Uranium In Them Thar' Hills: 'Nufcor,' Nuke-For or FU
        Taxpayers?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The Rolling Stone's indefatigable Matt Taibbi has exposed GS' bid
      to control the world's energy systems:<br>
      <br>
      “Today, banks like Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman
      Sachs own oil tankers, run airports and control huge quantities of
      coal, natural gas, heating oil, electric power and precious
      metals. They likewise can now be found exerting direct control
      over the supply of a whole galaxy of raw materials crucial to
      world industry and to society in general, including everything
      from food products to metals like zinc, copper, tin, nickel and,
      most infamously thanks to a recent high-profile scandal, aluminum.
      And they're doing it not just here but abroad as well: In Denmark,
      thousands took to the streets in protest in recent weeks,
      vampire-squid banners in hand, when news came out that Goldman
      Sachs was about to buy a 19 percent stake in Dong Energy, a
      national electric provider. The furor inspired mass resignations
      of ministers from the government's ruling coalition, as the Danish
      public wondered how an American investment bank could possibly
      hold so much influence over the state energy grid.<br>
      <br>
      Allowing one company to control the supply of crucial physical
      commodities, and also trade in the financial products that might
      be related to those markets, is an open invitation to commit mass
      manipulation....<br>
      <br>
      The situation has opened a Pandora's box of horrifying new
      corruption possibilities, but it's been hard for the public to
      notice, since regulators have struggled to put even the slightest
      dent in Wall Street's older, more familiar scams....In these new,
      even scarier kinds of manipulations, banks that own whole chains
      of physical business interests have been caught rigging prices in
      those industries. For instance, in just the past two years, fines
      in excess of $400 million have been levied against both JPMorgan
      Chase and Barclays for allegedly manipulating the delivery of
      electricity in several states, including California.” (25).<br>
      <br>
      Global Research confirms that<br>
      <br>
      “large banks have recently expanded their businesses into such
      fields as electric power production, oil refining and
      distribution, owning and operating of public assets such as ports
      and airports, and even uranium mining.<br>
      <br>
      Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Morgan Stanley are no longer just
      banks ­ they have effectively become oil companies, port and
      airport operators, commodities dealers, and electric utilities as
      well. This is causing unforeseen problems for the industrial
      sector of the economy. For example, Coca Cola has filed a
      complaint with the London Metal Exchange that Goldman Sachs was
      hoarding aluminum. JP Morgan is currently being probed by
      regulators for manipulating power prices in California, where the
      'bank' was marketing electricity from power plants it controlled.
      We don’t know what other price manipulation could be occurring due
      to potential informational advantages accruing to derivatives
      dealers who also market and sell commodities” (26).<br>
      <br>
      It was revealed that GS exploited workers who endured dangerous
      and environmentally threatening working conditions through their
      “ownership of a uranium trading company and two open pit coal
      mines in Colombia. When one of the mines was shut down last year
      due to labor unrest, Goldman’s Colombian subsidiary requested
      military and police assistance to end a human blockade — before
      paying the miners with $10,000 checks to end the protest.<br>
      <br>
      “Since 2008, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley
      have engaged in many billions of dollars of risky physical
      commodity activities, owning or controlling, not only vast
      inventories of physical commodities like crude oil, jet fuel,
      heating oil, natural gas, copper, aluminum, and uranium, but also
      related businesses, including power plants, coal mines, natural
      gas facilities, and oil and gas pipelines.”<br>

      “Federal regulators and the public currently lack key information
      about financial holding companies’ physical commodities activities
      to form an accurate understanding of the nature and extent of
      those activities and to protect the markets” (27)<br>

      Majia's Blog reports that<br>
      <br>
      “[i]n 2006 and 2007 hedge funds piled into Uranium. Goldman Sachs
      is noteworthy because of the scope of its involvement the leverage
      that involvement affords it over uranium pricing and, no doubt,
      demand. If you want to know why nuclear is pursued despite its
      obvious costs and risks, there is no better place to begin
      understanding than addressing who benefits from the global uranium
      trade” (28).<br>
      <br>
      According to an investigation by Michigan Senator Carl Levin,
      regarding GS commodity units:<br>
      <br>
      “The regulators should restore the true role of banks, which
      should not involve owning pipelines, oil and aluminum and engaging
      in these kind of activities...They've got to stop this activity
      because there is great risk to the economy - because if these
      large banks engage in these kinds of major deals and if natural
      disaster create a huge loss as a result of an oil spill, this can
      affect the whole economy and you get into the whole issue of
      bailouts by taxpayers because these banks are too-big-to-fail.”<br>
      <br>
      Major banks such as GS, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase profit
      from cornering the market in particular commodities such as
      uranium and by trading in derivatives. In other words, you trade
      more than you actually own and thereby make money selling things
      you claim to own, but don't really. Hmm. Although derivatives can
      be technically efficient within the trading system, scam artists
      like Bernie Madoff built his ponzi scheme empire using derivatives
      and stole 65 billion dollars from clients.<br>
      <br>
      The same is true with the big banks who are underinsured and
      typically don't have adequate capital to cover potential losses
      (assuming the taxpayers will bail them out again since they are
      too big to fail if there is a collapse). In 2010 the BP Gulf of
      Mexico Oil Disaster is a case in point where there were billions
      of dollars in damages were not insured by investors.<br>
      <br>
      “The two year investigation has already put pressure on the Fed to
      have the primary big banks in the business -- Goldman, Sachs &amp;
      Co. (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM) -
      wind down or divest what remains of their physical commodity
      businesses. And while some of the institutions have started to
      wind down these businesses others are seeking to get into
      commodities.” Despite this, “Levin fell short of saying that big
      banks should be required to divest their physical commodities
      units, which include ownership of coal mines, nuclear power plants
      and oil pipelines as well as various metals including uranium.”<br>
      <br>
      Financial reporter Ronald Orol explains Goldman Sachs unethical
      involvement in uranium trading:<br>
      <br>
      “Goldman acquired Nufcor International Ltd., a uranium trading
      company that stored and traded uranium in various stages of
      enrichment, in 2009. After the acquisition, Goldman significantly
      hiked the unit's uranium trading from 1.3 million pounds bought
      and sold annually to 13 million in by 2012, raising questions in
      the report about unfair competition and conflicts as well as a
      lack of capital and insurance to protect against a catastrophic
      event. The report also questioned whether this was a window
      dressing-type sale designed to create a shell corporation, noting
      that Nufcor's employees left when Goldman bought it and as a
      result it became operated by Goldman employees.<br>
      <br>
      According to the report, Goldman never took possession of the
      uranium but had title to it. It argues that any Goldman assertions
      that Nufcor is liable, not the mega-bank, for a catastrophic costs
      don't hold up. 'They had possession -- they owned it,' said one
      congressional staffer. 'There is no Nufcor, it's a shell. Goldman
      employees buy and sell uranium and arrange for the transport of
      it.'<br>
      <br>
      In a statement Goldman said it 'enhanced' its insurance program
      after acquiring Nufcor but added that the cost was low in light of
      'the remoteness of any potential risks.' It adds that Nufcor's
      activities have been limited to buying and selling 'unenriched'
      uranium, which they argue does not present concerns raised by
      Levin. It added that any suggestion that Goldman abuses client
      information related to Nufcor is 'utterly false.'<br>
      <br>
      Earlier this year, likely under pressure from Levin's
      investigation, Goldman sought to sell Nufcor but was unsuccessful
      and said it plans to wind down the business. Goldman said it plans
      to limit Nufcor's activities to meet 'current supply obligations,'
      which extend through 2018” (29).<br>
      <br>
      Of course, Wall Street Wizards don't give a rat's shiny tail about
      environmental pollution or worker's rights as long as there is a
      buck to be made. How ironic that Goldman Sachs' nuclear trading
      desk, Nufcor, has dealt in yellow cake uranium from Africa, the
      same material and location that Saddam Hussein was falsely accused
      of importing it for an illegal nuclear weapons program -- the
      fraudulent pretext used by the Zionist-Neocons in a war that
      killed and displaced millions of people in Iraq.<br>
      <br>
      It is possible that GS is involved in selling yellowcake to
      weapons makers (e.g. Israel has a secret nuclear weapons program).
      As of 2014:<br>
      <br>
      “Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank [were] quietly trying to get out
      of a business few people know they are even in: trading supplies
      of raw uranium known as yellowcake. In the last four years, the
      banks have amassed low-grade stockpiles of the nuclear fuel
      ingredient larger than those held by Iran, and enough to run
      China's nuclear plants for a year.<br>
      <br>
      Although GS is trying to sell their uranium business, but other
      banks are eager to take their place. The history of Wall Street in
      uranium markets illustrates just how far banks moved into physical
      commodities trading during the natural resources boom of the last
      ten years. Through its nuclear trading desk, known as NUFCOR
      International Limited, Goldman has a deal to market the vast
      majority of South Africa's uranium production from one of the
      country's largest miners.<br>
      <br>
      While people familiar with the business say Goldman has only sold
      uranium to nuclear power plants and other traders since buying
      NUFCOR four years ago, some have questioned whether banks should
      be dealing in such a politically sensitive commodity. Though the
      global trade in uranium is monitored by governments, intelligence
      agencies, and the International Atomic Energy Agency, no single
      authority can trace every deal....A number of specialist hedge
      funds started to buy and hold yellowcake in the middle of the last
      decade, in belief the world was on the cusp of a so-called
      'nuclear renaissance.' They thought demand for nuclear power would
      soar as countries tried to curb greenhouse emissions. In 2007, the
      price of uranium surged to nearly $140 a pound from under $20 a
      pound just five years earlier. Prices spiked again in 2010 from
      just over $40 a pound to near $65 a pound. Some uranium consumers
      blamed funds and banks for hoarding the fuel and helping to push
      up the price...” (30).<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, in two voluminous scholarly works by professor Gabrielle
      Hecht who directs the Program in Science, Technology, and Society
      at the University of Michigan, we learn that there is “widespread
      complicity in masking uranium’s origins by using a two-step export
      system, cleansing uranium of its provenance by sending it first to
      be processed in another country” (31). This is essentially an
      illegal practice yet many well meaning bureaucrats are unable to
      prevent it.<br>
      <br>
      <b>A New Dawn?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      But let's consider all the evidence, GS also appears to be
      investing heavily in renewable energy:<br>
      <br>
      “The latest initiative is part of Goldman's 2012 plan to channel
      investments totaling $40 billion into renewable energy projects
      over the next decade. The Japan Renewable Project Bond Trust
      product will provide a structure to give institutional investors
      the chance to invest in investment grade-rated securitized
      renewable energy bonds. It will initially focus on solar energy,
      and will be expanded to other types of renewable energy assets as
      projects arise. The initiative comes after a rush of investment
      into solar following the introduction of preferential tariffs
      mandated by the government in 2012 to promote the development of
      renewable energy after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami
      triggered the Fukushima nuclear power plant crisis” (32).<br>
      <br>
      Or, too good to be true? My colleague Yoichi Shimatsu explained
      GS' investment in Japanese renewable energy bonds as follows:<br>
      <br>
      “Renewable Energy (RE) bonds are issued for subscription (risk
      purchase) by investors (most likely institutional funds - pension,
      life insurance, trust, etc.) located in Europe. Renewable bonds
      can be palmed off to foreign investors, precisely because they are
      not the best informed people about RE (CleanTech) laws, finance,
      regulations in Japan. GS makes money regardless of whether the
      bonds earn a real return (after the first couple of years) or
      simply go bust. The tendency will be initially for the apparent
      bond value to rise, based on the early solar players' enthusiasm
      and marketing hype based on data based on nonsense estimates. But
      Japan has a limited land base (and expensive at that) for solar
      farms, and there are few if any subsidies (for feed-in regulations
      by provincial governments, feed-in into the regional grid, which
      is controlled by regional utilities invested in nuclear and coal).<br>
      <br>
      Now, the regional utilities can benefit from the bonds by the
      initial market push (because they are shareholders in RE projects
      in order to control and eventually trash them, and can profit from
      the short-term mania), and then will offload the bonds to banks in
      lieu of cash debt, and the bank will accept these (nearly
      worthless pieces of paper) to hawk to their major investors
      (Japanese pension funds, etc. who worship GS). This is a
      merry-go-round powered by financial delusion, and when it stops
      some fool is left holding the worthless bond, while GS walks away
      whistling to the next scam.<br>
      <br>
      So, look at the hierarchy of players in this game and realize it
      goes around in a circle back to GS, which will handle eventually
      the debt bonds of the big losers. It is criminal, it is sick, it
      is yet another sign of our times. GS makes money at every
      transaction step” (personal communication, July, 2015).<br>

      <b>The Bowels Of The Beast</b><b><br>

      Obama's US defense secretary, Ashton Carter, who has made a career
      out of militarism, “opted to pursue the profitable path of science
      and technology in the service of weapons and war, and the
      individuals and organizations that design strategies and
      technologies that require that America remain in a perpetual state
      of war of some kind.”<br>
      <br>
      Carter, like Iraq war architect Richard Perle, “served as a member
      of the Defense Policy Board, another influential Pentagon
      committee that advises on ‘issues central to strategic Department
      of Defense” (33).<br>
      <br>
      The Global Technology Partners company lists Carter along with
      many other pentagon power-brokers as working for their recently
      Rothschild International Investment Bank allied company in the
      military technology and war promotion area (34).<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, Japan shifts into re-militarization mode:<br>
      <br>
      “Mitsubishi Heavy has been making armored vehicles for Japan's
      military for around 80 years, beginning with the Imperial forces
      in the 1930s. It also builds fighter aircraft, naval vessels,
      submarines and missiles. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Japan to
      look at a prototype of an amphibious assault vehicle that could
      one day be a key pillar in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's push to
      sell weapons abroad. the maker of the wartime Zero fighter plane
      is eyeing overseas sales after Abe lifted a decades-old ban on
      arms exports in April last year as part of his more muscular
      security agenda, two Japanese defense industry sources said” (35).<br>
      <br>
      The changes in Japan's policy can be seen throughout the society,
      even as the country is mired in recession and the prospects for
      average people worsen daily.<br>
      <br>
      “The [Japan] Defense Ministry plans to subsidize university
      research in basic technologies for the first time ever. It is
      nevertheless aware that there is sensitivity in academia about
      getting involved in military-related work. The ministry’s
      Technical Research and Development Institute is soliciting
      applications for the annual subsidies of up to 30 million [yen,
      or, 300,000 dollars] each by mid-August. It will decide on the
      recipients in early November. Among examples of possible subject
      areas, the institute suggests work on laser systems and the
      development of high-efficiency power generators for aircraft
      engines. Each project that secures a subsidy is supposed to be
      completed within three years” (36).<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Nuclear Industrial Complex</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Anti-nuclear critic and scholar Majia Nadesan sees “nuclear as a
      complex with many constituent parts, including miners; refiners,
      scientists, utilities, nuclear organizations etc that all benefit
      from the complex” (personal communication, July, 2015).<br>
      <br>
      “The nuclear industry is tightly owned and controlled by a narrow
      range of industry players, hedge funds, and investment banks. As
      illustrated by Poneman's move to join Centrus, regulatory capture
      threatens government's capacity to act in the public interest.
      Poneman has been advocating for Japan to resume its pluthermal
      nuclear program and has supported the Rokkasho reprocessing site,
      which sits on” [an earthquake fault line] (37).<br>
      <br>
      The relationship between nuclear weapons and nuclear power is
      historically inherently intertwined where the creation of the
      A-bombs relied on building a reactor in order to generate the
      plutonium used to create nuclear explosions.<br>
      <br>
      As Nadesan shows in her published works, Eisenhower rationalized
      use of nuclear weapons in conjunction with the development of
      nuclear energy (38; 39).<br>
      <br>
      “ 'Nuclear power has from its beginnings been tied closely to
      nuclear weapons production.... despite engineering challenges,
      prohibitive costs, and public discomfort about radiation, the
      major industrial powers launched their nuclear energy programs.'
      US President Dwight D. Eisenhower's 'Atoms for Peace' speech in
      1953, was 'a masterpiece of inversion, transforming the horrors of
      nuclear weapons into the productive, peaceful promise of nuclear
      energy' and was the treacherous launch pad for the world's most
      deadly technology. Atoms for Peace lead to Japan's adoption of the
      'Atomic Energy Basic Law' two years later. At the same time the
      official promoters and apologists for nuclear energy, the
      International Atomic Energy Association (IAEA), was created in
      association with the the Food and Agricultural Organization, FAO,
      a part of the United Nations. How ironic that the IAEA's work has
      contaminated the world food supply with radiation spewed from the
      nuclear power operators. Nadesan writes that the 'IAEA endows
      research at institutes through grants, a practice that began in
      1960 and continues today.' The IAEA sees no problems with a
      nuclear accident here, a catastrophe there, and promotes the
      “peaceful uses of nuclear energy” without any shame” (40).<br>
      <br>
      As the book The Doomsday Machine amply demonstrates, the adoption
      of nuclear power today is often a pretext for third world
      countries to beef up their militaries and give themselves an edge
      over potentially hostile neighbors (41).<br>
      <br>
      As if more proof were needed, the title of this recent article
      says it all about how the US is addicted to militarism, war and
      nuclear technology:<br>
      <br>
      “The US Needs War Every 4 Years To Maintain Economic Growth” (42).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Shifts, Changes, Buzzes, Beeps</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is true that some high tech companies are aggressively moving
      into renewable energy (43). But “the digital economy uses a tenth
      of the world's electricity — and that share will only increase,
      with serious consequences for the economy and the environment”
      (44).<br>
      <br>
      While it is laudable that Big Tech is moving away from nuclear
      power, it is not an end-all solution in itself, as the astute
      environmental critic Jane Anne Morris points out:<br>
      <br>
      “At the scale necessary to power data centers, solar, wind, and
      even bicycle power involve considerable habitat loss....The idea
      that efficiency reduces consumption is at best debatable, and at
      worst a public relations scam. As Don Fitz wrote in 'Why Energy
      Efficiency Isn’t Reducing Consumption' (Synthesis/Regeneration,
      2009), over a century and a half of research on the relationship
      between efficiency and consumption of a resource has marshaled
      considerable evidence that the opposite is true. Since Stanley
      Jevons documented that coal consumption increased ten-fold after
      smelters tripled their efficiency (The Coal Question, 1865), the
      phenomenon has been called the Jevons Paradox. Historically, in
      capitalist systems, increased efficiency has led to more
      consumption, not less. Being efficient is good, but it does not
      mean sustainable, it does not mean green, and it does not reduce
      consumption. Data center efficiency is improving, and Google
      Inc.’s are reputed to be among the best. But when Gaia is
      diminished by the ripping out of coal, and the dumping of sludge,
      her suffering is in no way reduced if the resulting electricity is
      used 'efficiently.' Earth’s problem is not the inefficiency of
      resource use, but the quantity” (45).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Capitalocene Or Capital-Obscene?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Indeed, one wonders if moving in a direction of less technology,
      or at least wiser use of resources and technology is not the
      answer. Today some people have flat screen TVs in every room of
      their house to watch one of a thousand cable entertainment
      channels. If that gets boring you can spend hours on facebook and
      social networks diverted by infinite trivialities. But we have
      lost understanding of who and where we are in the universe.<br>
      <br>
      “Evolution is nature’s way of preserving itself, but nature is
      losing out for the first time ever as it becomes curiously
      unnatural, artificially induced to adapt to human existence. It is
      human-made evolution, through and through. The Anthropocene is the
      dawn of a new age when humans consciously and subconsciously shape
      nature, altering an evolutionary process as old as life itself and
      challenging the planet’s life forms. The consequence is that
      seventy-five percent (75%) of Earth’s surface has been modified by
      the human footprint” (46).<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Nuclear War Against Renewables</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      While capitalism struggles to find a sustainable path, not
      everyone is on board, including Bill “I'm A Billionaire Computer
      Dweeb” Gates who actually “hails [a] 'high tech' nuclear power
      firm as the answer to mankind's future energy needs” (47; 48).
      Gates may think nuclear power and vaccines will work best to cull
      the planet of useless eaters while he can make a few more bucks on
      the side.<br>
      <br>
      But not all hope is lost. In an important new study titled “Power
      Shift: The Deployment Of A 21st Century Electricity Sector And The
      Nuclear War To Stop It” we are treated to an amazing assemblage of
      data and arguments (Op. cit.). The nuclear industry (and Bill “The
      Geek” Gates) is in a “war” to prevent the development of a
      decentralized energy grid that could be run entirely on
      renewables.<br>
      <br>
      Mark Cooper, who has written the report for the Institute For
      Energy And The Environment is working in the independent-minded
      surroundings of Vermont where small “d” democracy has a long
      tradition in the form of Town Meetings. Vermont tradition
      represents the dwindling American ethos of decentralized, local,
      direct-democracy unshackled by Washington D.C.'s (District of
      Criminals) tyrannical control over the citizenry.<br>
      <br>
      Cooper makes the case for an unshackled, decentralized,
      democratically operated, electricity grid. The new grid would
      cater to renewable energy sources, the “sundown” industries of
      carbon based and nuclear energy would no longer be relevant or
      necessary.<br>
      <br>
      “Although distributed technologies have already put a great deal
      of economic pressure on the 20th century model, centering the
      electricity system on new technologies with new organizational
      principles requires a thorough transformation of the physical and
      institutional infrastructure of the sector. Dominant incumbent
      interests naturally resist such a transformation since their
      assets and skill sets do not fit well within the new model and
      would be significantly devalued if the alternative model were to
      become dominant. As UBS succinctly put it in a recent report, if
      the alternatives are allowed to expand and the electricity system
      is transformed to support their leading role, Large-scale power
      generation, however, will be the dinosaur of the future energy
      system: Too big, too inflexible, not even relevant for backup
      power in the long run.<br>
      <br>
      In response to the threat of the alternatives, the incumbent
      interests have launched a 'war against the future' on two primary
      fronts. The two most severely threatened incumbents are grounded
      in the largest and most inflexible sources of power generation in
      the 20th century electricity sector: coal and nuclear power. Each
      has taken a different tack in its resistance to the transformation
      of the sector.<br>
      <br>
      [U]tilities that are deeply invested in large central station
      generation see this potential development as a severe threat to
      their interest and they have responded by launching an all-out
      attack on the alternatives with two fronts.<br>
      <br>
      [T]he incumbent utilities [are attempting] to slow the
      alternatives at the federal and state levels, while they seek
      subsidies for their preferred resources. Following from the
      earlier analysis, [Cooper] shows that the challenge of
      reliability, far from being the liability that the advocates of
      the central station model claim it is, can be a major advantage
      for the decentralized approach because it saves on vital
      resources.<br>
      <br>
      [Cooper examines] the issue of subsidies, showing that nuclear has
      been the recipient of much larger subsidies, with little to show
      for it. In contrast, renewables have made much more progress, more
      quickly with much smaller subsidies, and there are good reasons to
      expect these trends to continue. Subsidizing mature aging reactors
      is shown to make even less sense than subsidizing new reactors.
      [Cooper] also shows that claims by nuclear advocates that nuclear
      is a job creator that is indispensable to meeting the carbon
      reduction goal do not withstand close scrutiny. The number of jobs
      created by building alternatives to replace nuclear exceeds the
      number of jobs 'lost' due to early retirement over the first half
      decade. Factoring in decommissioning jobs, there is no net 'loss'
      of jobs for well over a decade. Estimates of the potential for
      deployment of alternatives would exceed carbon reduction targets
      by a substantial margin, even if nuclear reactors are retired.”<br>

      of massive blasts, at least five, and they are so loud you can
      hear them “max” out the microphone on the Camera despite this
      happening hundreds of feet away in the other building and the
      sound being insulated by them being in a building...<br>
      <br>
      ...Since these important facts were brought to my attention
      several other startling things about this operation have become
      clear. These facts make the very nature of the entire operation
      completely clear.<br>
      <br>
      These are that the World Trade Centre attack began before the
      planes event had started. The first thing that happened, only
      seconds prior to the plane flying into the WTC North Tower was a
      massive explosion underneath the North tower that has been
      thoroughly documented and recorded and is supported by numerous
      eyewitnesses and recordings of the event.<br>
      <br>
      Workers inside the basement area of the WTC North tower were
      wounded in the attack,<br>
      <br>
      Here three are depicted lying in hospital. Each man describes an
      explosion prior to the Plane event...<br>
      <br>
      George Stephanopolous, well known US broadcast journalist
      described it thus. On ABC America on the day of the attack.<br>
      <br>
      “At the time I was actually in the subway, heading towards the
      World Trade Centre. right around Franklin Street, and after the
      first explosion the subway station started to fill with smoke, the
      subway, cars started to fill with smoke. and the subway actually
      stopped. ”<br>

      Harvesting condensed atmospheric vapour as dew water can be an
      alternative or complementary potable water resource in specific
      arid or insular areas. Such radiation-cooled condensing devices
      use already existing flat surfaces (roofs) or innovative
      structures with more complex shapes to enhance the dew yield. The
      Computational Fluid Dynamic - CFD - software PHOENICS has been
      programmed and applied to such radiation cooled condensers. For
      this purpose, the sky radiation is previously integrated and
      averaged for each structure. The radiative balance is then
      included in the CFD simulation tool to compare the efficiency of
      the different structures under various meteorological parameters,
      for complex or simple shapes and at various scales. It has been
      used to precise different structures before construction. (1) a
      7.32 m^2 funnel shape was studied; a 30 degree tilted angle (60
      degree cone half-angle) was computed to be the best compromise for
      funnel cooling. Compared to a 1 m^2 flat condenser, the cooling
      efficiency was expected to be improved by 40%. Seventeen months
      measurements in outdoor tests presented a 138 % increased dew
      yield as compared to the 1 m^2 flat condenser. (2) The simulation
      results for 5 various condenser shapes were also compared with
      experimental measurement on corresponding pilots systems: 0.16 m^2
      flat planar condenser, 1 m^2 and 30 degree tilted planar
      condenser, 30 m^2 and 30 degree tilted planar condenser, 255 m^2
      multi ridges, a preliminary construction of a large scale dew
      plant being implemented in the Kutch area (Gujarat, India). <br>

      The BBC announced enthusiastically Wednesday [
      http://www.bbc.com/news/business-33436021 ] that “what may be the
      world’s oldest fragments of the Koran have been found by the
      University of Birmingham.” This news is not only of interest to
      scholars and Muslim intellectuals; it appears to buttress the
      Islamic claim that the Qur’an’s text has remained unchanged for
      1,400 years – which is purported to be proof of its divine origin.<br>
      <br>
      There is only one problem with all this: the BBC article raises
      more questions than it answers, and reveals more about the wishful
      thinking of the academic and media establishments than it does
      about the Qur’an.<br>
      <br>
      The article is riddled with academic and journalistic sloppiness.
      We’re told that the radiocarbon dating shows, “with a probability
      of more than 95%, the parchment was from between 568 and 645.”
      Very well, but does the ink date to that time as well? We are not
      told. Parchment was often reused in the ancient world, with the
      earlier text erased and written over, and so if a parchment dates
      from 645, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the text does.<br>
      <br>
      However, it is impossible to discover any more details from this
      shoddy BBC presentation. The best photo of this manuscript that
      the BBC provides shows clear traces of another text underneath the
      main text. It is not clear from the photo whether that is the text
      from the other side bleeding through on the photograph, or even if
      there is any text on the other side; nor does the BBC tell us
      whether or not the parchment shows signs of having been a
      palimpsest — that is, a parchment that was used more than once for
      different texts. There is also some red ink in the top lines of
      the manuscript in the photo but not in the succeeding lines. Has
      the red ink faded from the other sections, or is it itself
      evidence of the ink fading? Or is it a later hand filling in areas
      that had faded away (and possibly altering the text)? The BBC
      doesn’t tell us, yet this is an extremely salient point. Another
      recently discovered and much-touted fragment of the Qur’an, now in
      Germany and dated from between 649 and 675, shows clear signs of
      alteration, raising the possibility that the Qur’anic text was
      altered over time (image available here). If this is a possibility
      also for the University of Birmingham manuscript, the BBC should
      tell us so. But it doesn’t.<br>
      <br>
      What’s more, if the text along with the parchment really dates
      from between 568 and 645, it may not be a fragment of the Qur’an
      at all. The Qur’an, according to Islamic tradition, was compiled
      in its definitive form in the year 653 by the caliph Uthman, who
      ordered all variant texts burned and the canonical version
      distributed to all the provinces within his domains. <br>
      <br>
      As I show in my book Did Muhammad Exist?, however, there are
      numerous reasons to doubt this story. The principal one is that if
      the entire Islamic world had copies of the Qur’an by the mid 650s,
      why is it that not until the latter part of the seventh and early
      part of the eighth century do mentions of the Qur’an begin to
      appear? The Dome of the Rock inscriptions date from 691; they are
      made up of many Qur’an verses, but out of their Qur’anic order and
      some with notable changes in wording. Who would have dared to
      change the words of Allah? And the first clear reference to the
      Qur’an as such occurred around the year 710—eighty years after the
      book was supposedly completed and sixty years after it was
      supposedly collected and distributed. During a debate with an Arab
      noble, a Christian monk of the monastery of Beth Hale (of which
      there were two, one in northern Iraq and the other in Arabia; it
      is not known in which one this monk lived) cited the Qur’an by
      name. The monk wrote, “I think that for you, too, not all your
      laws and commandments are in the Qur’an which Muhammad taught you;
      rather there are some which he taught you from the Qur’an, and
      some are in surat albaqrah and in gygy and in twrh.”<br>
      <br>
      By this point Arab armies had conquered a huge expanse of
      territory, stretching from North Africa, across the Levant, Syria,
      and Iraq, and into Persia, and yet those eight decades of conquest
      had produced scarcely a mention of the book that supposedly
      inspired them. And when the Qur’an finally was mentioned, it
      appears that the book was not even in the form we now know. Surat
      albaqrah (or al-Baqara) is “the chapter of the Cow,” which is the
      second, and longest, sura of the Qur’an. The eighth-century monk
      thus quite clearly knew of a Qur’an that didn’t contain this sura;
      he considered surat albaqrah to be a stand-alone book, along with
      gygy (the Injil, or Gospel) and twrh (the Torah). It is unlikely
      that the monk simply made an error: who ever mistakes a chapter of
      a book for a separate book?<br>
      <br>
      So if this is a fragment of the Qur’an as it now stands (and what
      portion of the Qur’an is it, anyway? Neither the BBC nor its
      quoted academics tell us), and yet it could date from as far back
      as 568, two years before Muhammad is supposed to have been born,
      it might not be a fragment of the Qur’an at all. It could instead
      be a portion of some source that later became part of the Qur’an,
      as did Surat al-Baqara.<br>
      <br>
      The BBC quotes Professor David Thomas, who also doesn’t tell us
      what exact portions of the Qur’an this manuscript contains, and
      who raises even more questions when he says: “These portions must
      have been in a form that is very close to the form of the Koran
      read today, supporting the view that the text has undergone little
      or no alteration and that it can be dated to a point very close to
      the time it was believed to be revealed.” <br>
      <br>
      This is a very strange statement. The BBC, and apparently the
      University of Birmingham, are advertising this as an ancient
      fragment of the Qur’an. Presumably when Thomas says that “these
      portions must have been in a form that is very close to the form
      of the Koran read today,” he means that the larger whole of which
      they once formed a part was “very close” to the Qur’an. But how
      close is “very close”? Mainstream Muslims maintain that the
      Qur’anic text has undergone no alteration at all since it was
      first “revealed.” <br>
      <br>
      So when Thomas says that his fragments were once part of something
      “very close to the form of the Koran read today, supporting the
      view that the text has undergone little or no alteration,” he is
      already departing from the standard story of Qur’anic origins that
      he is claiming to support. The text has undergone “little or no
      alteration”? Well, which is it? Little alteration, which no matter
      how little would explode the Islamic claim of its divine origin
      and perfect protection, or no alteration, which would support that
      claim?<br>
      <br>
      The Guardian illumines some of this in its own report when it
      says: “The significance of Birmingham’s leaves, which hold part of
      Suras (chapters) 18 to 20, was missed because they were bound
      together with another text, in a very similar hand but written
      almost 200 years later….The verses are incomplete, and believed to
      have been an aide memoire for an imam who already knew the Qur’an
      by heart, but the text is very close to the accepted authorised
      version.”<br>
      <br>
      Suras 18 and 20, with their long stories of Moses (very odd ones
      in 18, along with material about Dhul Qarnayn, who is usually
      assumed to be Alexander the Great, and the Christian story of the
      Seven Sleepers of Ephesus), and sura 19, with its extended
      retelling of the Virgin Birth of Jesus Christ, are some of the
      most obviously derivative sections of the entire Qur’an —
      reinforcing the impression that this could be a fragment of a
      source of the Qur’an, not the Qur’an itself. And indeed, it is not
      the Qur’an itself, we are finally told, for “the verses are
      incomplete, and believed to have been an aide memoire for an imam
      who already knew the Qur’an by heart, but the text is very close
      to the accepted authorised version.” Very close is how close? Any
      deviation could just as easily be not an aide memoire for an imam,
      but evidence of editing and change, as Islam was being developed
      in the latter part of the seventh century and the early part of
      the eighth.<br>
      <br>
      In sum, the more one looks at this curious story, the less there
      is to see. It seems indisputable that an ancient manuscript has
      been confirmed to be ancient. Has its text been altered? We aren’t
      told. Is it part of the Qur’an? We can’t be sure. Does it
      correspond to the modern standard Qur’anic text? We aren’t told.
      The only thing we can really be sure of about this story is the
      closing statement from Dr. Muhammad Isa Waley: this “is news to
      rejoice Muslim hearts.” As is so often the case with the
      mainstream media, that may be the primary objective all along.<br>

      <b>What is Blue Solar Water and what does it do?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;According to Dr. Ihaleakala Hew Len
      (Hawaiian Ho’oponopono master), in the book “Zero Limits”, Dr. Len
      states that “Drinking Blue Solar Water transmutes memories
      replaying problems in the subconscious mind and helps the body to
      Let Go and Let God”.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Benefits and Uses of Blue Solar Water:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blue Solar Water is a symbol of purity and
      life.&nbsp; It brings joy.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blue Solar Water can be used to help remove
      recurring problematic “memories” or programming that runs in your
      subconscious, freeing you from their effects. It may even help
      remove blocks that you’re not aware of since it works at a
      subconscious level.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the book Zero Limits by Joe Vitale, Dr. Hew
      Len says that the body loves lots of water.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fill your blue bottles with water and set them
      in the sun.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rinse off with it after showering…<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wash Fruits and vegetables in it…<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use it for anything you use water for such as
      cooking.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make Coffee with it!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make hot tea with it!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Water house plants with it: makes plants grow
      much better!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chemo: it’s important to drink a lot of water
      when taking chemotherapy, in addition to the benefits of blue
      water, having several bottles of water to work through helps to
      make sure you drink enough.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children love to have “blue water”, especially
      at bed time.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Making Blue Solar Water:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fill a blue bottle with water.&nbsp; Needs to
      be Glass and needs to be Cobalt Blue Glass not painted glass.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do Not use a cap or cover when placing in the
      sun.&nbsp; Varying temperature may compromise glass and break.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Place the bottle in direct sunlight or, if
      direct sunlight is not available, you can place under a bright
      incandescent lamp for one hour or more.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never put under a fluorescent light.<br>

      Information-carrier steel rod claimed to give huge savings in fuel
      consumption...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Facts</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The BE-Fuelsaver® is a metal stick, 2 and a half centimetres long,
      made out of the stainless steel. It’s placed in a car’s tank or,
      if needs be, the fuel line and reduces the fuel consumption by
      between 6 to over 20%, the waste gas emissions by up to 90% and
      improves the motor performance.<br>
      <br>
      The stick works as an information carrier and changes the
      molecular structure of the fuel. In doing so, it optimises the
      combustion process in all petrol, gas or diesel powered vehicles.
      The bioenergetic ‘BE-Fuelsaver’ interacts with the fuel in order
      to change the molecular structure of the hydrocarbons, which leads
      to a better combustion process. The metal operates as a vibration
      carrier that stimulates plasma production in the fuel; that means
      that the fuel gets energised in such a way that it gets broken
      down into ionised fuel chains upon entering the combustion
      chamber, thereby leading to a better combustion and the production
      of fewer toxic waste gases.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      Music scholar Maria Renold, in her book “Intervals, Scales, Tones
      and the Concert Pitch,” described how she tested the different
      effects on listeners created by 440 Hz and 432 Hz tuning. She
      asked thousands of people in various countries over the course of
      20 years to evaluate how they felt listening to each.<br>
      <br>
      She said 90 percent prefered the 432 Hz tuning. When asked to
      describe it, they used words such as “completed, correct,
      peaceful, [and] sunlike.” Conversely, they described 440 Hz tuning
      as sounding “uncomfortable, oppressive, [and] narrow-minded.”...<br>

        CMR Demos Its Printed Polarity Magnets<br>
        <br>
      </b>Correlated magnetics is a fundamental breakthrough in
      magnetics. By combining many magnetic fields, CMR’s patented
      Polymagnet technology transforms ordinary magnets into
      precision-tailored magnetic systems that produce complex functions
      not possible with conventional magnets. Magnetic functions are
      created with the world’s first magnetic printer, the CMR
      MagPrinter. The MagPrinter creates patterns of small magnetic
      regions called maxels on rare-earth, ferrite or flexible magnetic
      materials. Each Polymagnet pattern creates a unique function.<br>
      <b><br>
        Polymagnet means many magnets<br>
        <br>
      </b>Polymagnets contain many smaller magnetic elements that can
      produce superior attachment forces, safer magnets, precision
      alignment, shear and torque stiffness, and complex,
      multi-level/multi-force functions never before achieved with
      traditional bulk magnets.<br>
      <br>
      Polymagnet technology enables unprecedented control over magnet
      interaction by applying the principles of signal processing theory
      and correlation methods to a pattern of magnetic elements on the
      magnet surface. Each Polymagnet comprises a number of pixel-like
      elements called maxels. The arrangement or pattern of these maxels
      creates a unique magnetic circuit that defines the function of the
      Polymagnet device and its interaction with other magnets and
      ferrous metals.<br>
      <br>
      The basic principle behind the interaction of Polymagnets is
      correlation, in which magnetic fields add to or subtract from the
      aggregate forces depending on the orientation of the maxels.
      Patterns can vary according to the number, location, size, shape
      and amplitude of the maxels that constitute the Polymagnet... the
      possible combinations reach toward infinity...<br>
      <b><br>
      </b>Among the many advantages of Polymagnets are…<br>
      <br>
      Stronger forces : By concentrating magnetic flux at the surface of
      the magnet, more magnetic force is created ... can be tuned to
      thickness of metal... down to thousandths of an inch.<br>
      <br>
      Safer magnets : reduces stray magnetic fields that can
      accidentally attract nearby metal or other magnets. Concentrating
      the available magnetic flux into a prescribed near-surface region
      ... to achieve incredible attach force while reducing the risk of
      unintended attraction and acceleration of metal objects or other
      magnets... can even protect volatile magnetic storage devices from
      damaging stray fields.<br>
      <br>
      Precision alignment : By varying the number of magnetic elements,
      materials, and maxel pattern ... the positioning can be “assisted”
      by the magnetic field ... to attach at one position only, or at
      multiple positions, at prescribed rotation angles, lateral
      translation, or other spatial arrangement.<br>
      <br>
      Shear stiffness : Magnetic shear forces are traditionally weak
      relative to the attract and repel forces developed normal to a
      magnet surface... Polymagnets can ... significantly increase the
      shear forces... by improving the magnetic shear densities ... and
      the attach force between a magnet and a metal target surface. This
      Polymagnet advantage is even more pronounced as the magnet and/or
      metal surface thickness decreases. Better magnetic attach
      performance with less material, lower weight, smaller volume, and
      reduced costs.<br>
      <br>
      Torque transfer : Magnetic gears and couplings offer decided
      advantages over mechanical couplings because they eliminate wear
      and suppress vibration... Polymagnet technology provides superior
      torque density, and can be tuned for specific applications by
      varying the spatial frequency (transition from north polarity to
      south polarity) of the maxel regions.<br>
      <br>
      Multi-level magnetic systems : Polymagnet technology confers to
      the magnet designer precise control over magnetic fields in terms
      of reach, flux density, and three-dimensional shape of the field.
      In addition, the polarity mix for a given pattern can produce
      local attract or repel forces. These fields and forces can be
      combined to produce magnets that attract at a distance and repel
      in close proximity. Conversely, a multi-level design approach can
      produce a Polymagnet system where the components repel each other
      at a distance and attract each other in close proximity. The
      resulting behavior becomes a useful design functionality for
      attachment devices, motion actuators, and much more.<br>
      <br>
      Complex magnetic fields : Pixel-like magnetic elements (maxels)
      can be aggregated to form very intricate magnetic fields...
      enabling a nearly limitless set of unique magnetic field
      designs...<br>

      Heat measurements for continuously burning power plants showed
      that coal plants took just three months for warming caused by
      atmospheric carbon dioxide to surpass the heat released into the
      atmosphere by combustion of coal at the plants (Reuters)<br>
      <br>
      The warming from carbon dioxide released by burning a lump of coal
      exceeds the heat generated by the combustion in just 34 days.<br>
      <br>
      It takes 45 days for oil combustion and 59 days for natural gas to
      achieve comparable warming to that generated by burning the
      respective fuel.<br>
      <br>
      This shows that global warming does not take years and decades for
      its effects to be felt, shows a study by climate scientists at the
      Carnegie Institution for Science.<br>
      <br>
      "Ultimately, the warming induced by carbon dioxide over the many
      thousands of years it remains in the atmosphere would exceed the
      warming from combustion by a factor of 100,000 or more," Ken
      Caldeira said in a Carnegie news release.<br>
      <br>
      Caldeira and Xiaochun Zhang also extrapolated heat measurements
      for continuously burning power plants.<br>
      <br>
      Coal plants took just three months for warming caused by
      atmospheric carbon dioxide to surpass the heat released into the
      atmosphere by combustion.<br>
      <br>
      "If a power plant is burning continuously, within three to five
      months, depending on the type of power plant, the CO2 from the
      power plant is doing more to heat the Earth than the fires in its
      boiler," Caldeira said.<br>
      <br>
      The research, "Time scales and ratios of climate forcing due to
      thermal versus carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels," is
      published in Geophysical Research Letters, a journal of the
      American Geophysical Union.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Bonn talks</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Meanwhile, at the Bonn climate talks, a group of experts warned
      that the widely accepted target of limiting warming to 2C may not
      be enough and that radical decarbonisation of world energy systems
      must come even faster.<br>
      <br>
      The structured expert dialogue group recommended striving for a
      1.5C threshold which it said was technically feasible, but
      difficult.<br>
      <br>
      The International Energy Agency too came out recently to note that
      the world is no longer on track to meet even the goal of keeping
      warming below 2C.<br>
      <br>
      Research by Global Carbon Project too has shown that the means to
      a 2C limit are slipping away fast. This has been supported by
      teams at the University of California and the Scripps Institution
      of Oceanography.<br>
      <br>
      Global average concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
      entered the danger zone after crossing 400 parts per million this
      March.<br>
      <br>
      Climate experts are hoping that Paris can at least bend the
      emissions curve downward, with more actions to come later.<br>
      <br>
      The UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany began this week
      with French foreign minister and incoming COP 21 president Laurent
      Fabius calling for nations to address poverty and climate change.<br>
      <br>
      "We have the collective responsibility to define an international
      framework of action which reconciles the legitimate aspiration of
      all to prosperity with the natural limitations of our planet. We
      will not win the fight for development and poverty eradication
      without winning the climate fight," he said.<br>
      <br>
      While almost 98 nations target 75% of global emissions, even that
      has been found to be inadequate to stay with the 2C rise. In fact,
      trends point to a 4-5C rise before the end of the century.<br>
      <br>
      The combined total emissions by the world by 2030 is projected to
      exceed safe limits by at least 13 billion tonnes.<br>
      <br>
      A climate pact at Paris is hoped to replace the Kyoto Protocol
      after 2020. But differences between the rich and poor blocs have
      seen many hurdles in achieving a significant emission reductions
      agreement.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      'Walk through any supermarket and take a look at the labels on
      food products, and you'll see that many of them contain fructose,
      often in the form of sucrose (table sugar)' -- that's how Wilhelm
      Krek, professor for cell biology at ETH Zurich's Institute for
      Molecular Health Sciences, summarises the problem with today's
      nutrition. Prepared foods and soft drinks in particular, but even
      purportedly healthy fruit juices contain fructose as an artificial
      additive -- often in high quantities. In recent decades fructose
      spread throughout the food market, due to a reputation as being
      less harmful than glucose. In contrast to glucose, fructose barely
      increases blood glucose levels and insulin secretion. This avoids
      frequently recurring insulin spikes after any glucose consumption,
      which are judged harmful. In addition, fructose is sweeter to the
      taste.<br>
      <br>
      But there's a downside: the liver converts fructose very
      efficiently into fat. People who consume too much high-fructose
      food can in time become overweight and develop high blood
      pressure, dyslipidaemia with fatty liver and insulin resistance --
      symptoms that doctors group together under the name metabolic
      syndrome.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Unchecked growth of the heart muscle</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A new paper by Krek and his team member Peter Mirtschink describes
      a further, more troubling side effect of fructose. The researchers
      have discovered a previously unknown molecular mechanism that
      points to fructose as a key driver of uncontrolled growth of the
      heart muscle, a condition that can lead to fatal heart failure.
      Their study was recently published in Nature.<br>
      <br>
      When a person has high blood pressure, the heart has to grow as it
      is harder to pump the blood through the circulatory system. These
      growing heart muscle cells require a considerable amount of
      oxygen. However, since not enough oxygen is available to
      adequately supply the increased growth, the cells switch to an
      alternative energy supply. Instead of drawing energy from fatty
      acids, they rely more on an anaerobic process called glycolysis --
      literally, the 'splitting of sugars'. If the heart muscle cells
      can access fructose in addition to glucose, this can set off a
      fatal chain reaction.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Flipping the switch for fructose metabolism</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In the study, Krek's research group demonstrates that a lack of
      oxygen in the heart cells cues the appearance of the HIF molecule.
      This is a universal molecular switch that flips whenever a
      pathological growth process is under way, such as cardiac
      enlargement or cancer. HIF causes the heart muscle cells to
      produce ketohexokinase-C (KHK-C), the central enzyme in fructose
      metabolism. KHK-C has a high affinity for fructose and can
      therefore process it very efficiently. The production of KHK-C
      also has a reinforcing effect on glycolysis. Since fructose
      metabolism doesn't involve any negative feedback regulation, a
      vicious cycle starts that can lead to heart failure.<br>
      <br>
      To investigate this mechanism, the researchers used not only mouse
      models but also biological samples from patients with pathological
      heart enlargement accompanied by a narrowing of the aortic valve.
      Samples of heart muscle cells taken by surgeons during heart
      operations provided the ETH researchers with the means for proving
      that such cells really do have more HIF and KHK-C molecules. In
      mice that were suffering from chronic high blood pressure, the
      researchers turned off the KHK enzyme, which indeed inhibited
      enlargement of the heart.<br>
      <br>
      <b>One gene, two enzymes</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Another fact worthy of note is that the body also contains KHK-A,
      an enzyme very similar to KHK-C except that it has poor preference
      for fructose. Both these enzymes have the same genetic code; the
      difference between them comes from how a molecular cutting tool
      tailors their construction blueprint -- their messenger RNA, which
      is a transcript of the relevant gene. Depending on requirements,
      one of two blueprints can be generated from the same gene to
      produce either of two different enzymes. The expert term for this
      process is 'alternative splicing'. Krek explains, 'About 95
      percent of all human genes are alternatively spliced. It's a major
      way to create the extraordinary variety of proteins, enzymes and
      regulators in the human body.'<br>
      <br>
      Normally primarily liver cells produce the fructose-friendly KHK-C
      enzyme; other organs produce almost exclusively KHK-A. Now for the
      first time, the ETH researchers are showing that even an organ
      like the heart is capable of producing KHK-C, the more efficient
      of the two enzymes, if it is exposed to pathogenic stress factors.
      In the process, HIF activates the molecular cutting tool, or
      splicing factor, SF3B1. This molecule is often genetically altered
      in many types of cancer, which possibly indicates that even the
      growth of cancer can be affected by fructose.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Normal fruit consumption safe</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Large volumes of fructose are added to many foods, but especially
      to sweet beverages and soft drinks. This practice drove up per
      capita consumption of high fructose corn syrup in the USA between
      1970 and 1997, from 230 grams per year to over 28 kilograms.<br>
      <br>
      But Mirtschink provides reassurance that eating a normal amount of
      fruit daily is safe and healthy. 'Besides fructose, fruit contains
      plenty of important trace elements, vitamins and fibre,' he says.
      People should, however, avoid overly sweet soft drinks and fruit
      juices -- these often have sugar added -- as well as ready-made
      meals and other foods to which large amounts of fructose are added
      as a flavour carrier. 'Just this surplus of fructose can help
      trigger the mechanism we have described if one of the stress
      factors is present, such as cardiac valve disease or high blood
      pressure,' Mirtschink emphasises.<br>

            Formaldehyde</b></big></div>
      <br>
      A groundbreaking new study reveals that GMO soy accumulates the
      carcinogenic chemical formaldehyde, calling into question its
      safety and the notion that GMOs are substantially equivalent to
      their conventional counterparts. <br>
      <br>
      Systems Biology Group, International Center for Integrative
      Systems: GMO Soy Accumulates Formaldehyde &amp; Disrupts Plant
      Metabolism, Suggests Peer-Reviewed Study, Calling For 21st Century
      Safety Standards<br>
      <br>
      A new study published today in the peer-reviewed journal
      AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES reveals genetic engineering of soy disrupts
      the plant’s natural ability to control stress, and invalidates the
      FDA’s current regulatory framework of “substantial equivalence”
      used for approval of genetically engineered food (GMOs).<br>
      <br>
      The study, led by Dr. V.A. Shiva Ayyadurai, Ph.D., an MIT-trained
      systems biologist, utilizes his latest invention, CytoSolve, a
      21st century systems biology method to integrate 6,497 in vitro
      and in vivo laboratory experiments, from 184 scientific
      institutions, across 23 countries, to discover the accumulation of
      formaldehyde, a known carcinogen, and a dramatic depletion of
      glutathione, an anti-oxidant necessary for cellular
      detoxification, in GMO soy, indicating that formaldehyde and
      glutathione are likely critical criteria for distinguishing the
      GMO from its non-GMO counterpart.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Ayyadurai stated, “The results demand immediate testing along
      with rigorous scientific standards to assure such testing is
      objective and replicable. It’s unbelievable such standards for
      testing do not already exist. The safety of our food supply
      demands that science deliver such modern scientific standards for
      approval of GMOs.”...<br>

      <div align="center"><b>ProjectSeafood: The Traveling 3D Printing
          &amp; Recycling Lab Looks to Conquer Ocean Waste Within a
          Mini-van</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>by Whitney Hipolite</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Desktop 3D printers are capable of fabricating objects out of
      simple plastics — usually PLA or ABS — providing designers with
      the ability to take a concept, idea or model and turn it into a
      real tangible product in a matter of hours. Without a doubt, the
      technology has, and will continue to, revolutionize prototyping,
      product development and innovation in the future.<br>
      <br>
      For one couple, Jennifer Gadient and Fabian Wyss, they see 3D
      printing as not only a miraculous technology that spurs
      innovation, but also a means of cleaning up the planet, reducing
      litter on our beaches, and ultimately providing for the recycling
      of waste. The Swiss couple has taken to the road in a mini-van lab
      that they’ve created. This lab features an Ultimaker 3D printer, a
      plastic shredder, and a filament extruder; all the tools needed to
      turn plastic waste into useful products.<br>
      <br>
      “Ultimaker [the 3D printer manufacturer] gave us a printer, and in
      exchange we give them feedback on their machine and content,”
      explained Gadient to Wamda.com. “I think what interested them was
      that idea of recycling, and mobility. What does it mean if someone
      doesn’t have a factory, but travels with it?” added Wyss.<br>
      <br>
      During the journey, which has taken them to France, Spain and now
      Morocco, they have collected plastic waste in the form of water
      and soda bottle lids, shampoo bottles and other objects that
      happen to be made up of polyethylene and polypropylene. Then,
      using their plastic shredder, they shred these objects before
      putting it into their filament extruder, to create feedstock for
      their 3D printer. From there, they can print whatever designs they
      would like, which so far includes surf wax combs, charms,
      sunglasses and more.<br>
      <br>
      The project, which they call ProjectSeafood has provided for an
      interesting learning experience while also showing the potential
      that 3D printing has on the future of recycling.<br>
      <br>
      Finding the plastic doesn’t seem to be a problem for the couple,
      as apparently our planet’s beaches are littered full of the
      necessary feedstock for their 3D printer.<br>
      <br>
      “We quickly have a bag full of plastic bottle lids,” says Gadient.
      “And the more we go South, the more we find.” Some of these bottle
      lids were left by tourists, she explains, but much more were drawn
      by the sea current.”<br>
      <br>
      The Ultimaker 3D printer that they use, has slightly been modified
      so that it can be used from the convenience of the mini-van while
      also standing up to the potentially windy and cold weather that
      the couple frequently runs into, in addition to other
      environmental factors along the way. They’ve enclosed the printer
      with windows on the sides, moved the motors to the outside of the
      machine and even created their own custom flexible “textile
      rooftop” that follows the movements of the printhead.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="seafood2.png" height="328"
          width="439"> <img alt="" src="seafood6.jpeg" height="327"
          width="528"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Because of the various colors associated with recovered waste,
      there is no knowing what the end filament will look like. Much of
      it is rainbow-colored or grayish-brown due to the mixture of
      colors.<br>
      <br>
      “To transform the granules into filament, we use a Noztek filament
      extruder in combination with a lasers ensored winder. As the size,
      quality and meltpoint of recycled polyethylene-flakes varies,
      extruding a filament from multiple objects like bottlecaps in
      constant diameter is quite a challenge and some filament has to be
      re-recycled due to large diameter variations,” the couple
      explains.<br>
      <br>
      The printable material, which is referred to as HDPE (high-density
      polyethylene) is not quite as easily printed as more traditional
      PLA and ABS filaments. The biggest problem that the couple runs
      into is with the material’s first layer adhesion when extruded
      onto the printers build plate. HDPE has a tendency to warp and
      delaminate, even when a heated bed is used. To help combat this
      problem, they have discovered that using a cloth covered build
      platform works quite well.<br>
      <br>
      While this endeavor has not made the couple wealthy by any means,
      they are enjoying their time together, meeting a lot of
      interesting people along the way, and ultimately taking a step to
      clean up our planet. At the same time, they are proving that 3D
      printing can be a very useful tool in the recycling of certain
      types of plastics.<br>
      <br>
      “We never expected to make a lot of money,” says Wyss, “But there
      was this hope to find a way to make it sustainable. What we gained
      is human experiences, technical exchange, and meeting great
      people.”<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Ultrasound accelerates skin healing,
            especially for diabetics and the elderly</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Healing times for skin ulcers and bedsores can be reduced by a
      third with the use of low-intensity ultrasound, scientists from
      the University of Sheffield and University of Bristol have found.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers from the University of Sheffield's Department of
      Biomedical Science discovered the ultrasound transmits a vibration
      through the skin and wakes up cells in wounds helping to stimulate
      and accelerate the healing process.<br>
      <br>
      More than 200,000 patients in the UK suffer with chronic wounds
      every year at a cost of over £3.1 billion to the NHS.<br>
      <br>
      The ultrasound treatment, which also reduces the chance of wounds
      getting infected, is particularly effective when treating
      diabetics and the elderly.<br>
      <br>
      There are 11 million over-65s, three million diabetics, and 10
      million smokers in the UK -- all of whom are likely to suffer
      problems with healing wounds.<br>
      <br>
      A quarter of diabetics suffer from skin ulcers, particularly foot
      ulcers, due to the loss of sensation and circulation in the legs.<br>
      <br>
      Lead author of the study Dr Mark Bass, from the University's
      Centre for Membrane Interactions and Dynamics (CMIAD), said: "Skin
      ulcers are excruciatingly painful for patients and in many cases
      can only be resolved by amputation of the limb.<br>
      <br>
      "Using ultrasound wakes up the cells and stimulates a normal
      healing process. Because it is just speeding up the normal
      processes, the treatment doesn't carry the risk of side effects
      that are often associated with drug treatments."<br>
      <br>
      The pioneering study, which is published in the Journal of
      Investigative Dermatology, was carried out in collaboration with
      the School of Biochemistry at the University of Bristol, the Wound
      Biology Group at the Cardiff Institute of Tissue Engineering and
      Repair, and the orthopaedic company, Bioventus LLC.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Bass added: "Now that we have proven the effectiveness of
      ultrasound we need to explore the signal further. We have found
      that the ultrasound signal we currently use is effective, but it
      is possible that by refining the treatment we could improve the
      effects even further. "Because ultrasound is relatively risk free
      we could expect to see it in broad clinical use within three or
      four years."<br>

      <br>
      Due to an increase in requests for my 1985 booklet Back to Basics
      Reform Or...OBE *Skinnerian International Curriculum? (48 pages),
      which is now out-of-print, the author has decided to make the
      booklet<br>
      available free on this website. This will enable the reader to
      understand how the long-planned controversial restructuring of
      education from academics to workforce training, necessary for the
      planned global economy and United States participation in a
      socialist world government, was finalized between 1980 and the
      present time, and to take action to put a stop to education
      restructuring.<br>
      <br>
      Although the 150-year history of this unconstitutional agenda is
      documented in the deliberate dumbing down of america...A
      Chronological Paper Trail, 1999, Back to Basics Reform Or......
      lets the reader peek into the laboratory of the change agents at
      the U.S. Department of Education in the early eighties, when and
      where the author worked as a Senior Policy Advisor, with access to
      confidential planning. The author was fired for leaking a very
      important document to the press.<br>
      <br>
      However, since she knew she would get fired for doing so, she
      managed to remove all the incriminating documents from her office
      prior to leaking the one most important document. Much of the
      information gleaned from these purloined documents is found in
      "Back to Basics Reform Or...".<br>
      <br>
      The period about which the author writes was the period during
      which the Pavlovian/Skinnerian Outcomes Based Education was
      institutionalized for all students, not just the minorities who
      had been victimized by the federally-funded method since the
      mid-sixties. When the Skinnerian/Pavlovian method necessary for
      work force training...mastery learning/direct instruction, OBE...
      "worked" (dumbed down the minorities), obviously through no fault
      of their own, it was decided to use this "successful" method on
      all American children, which is what we see happening today
      through Goals 2000, The School to Work Opportunities Act, and most
      recently, The No Child Left Behind Act which mandates the use of
      scientific research based reading instruction which is based on
      the animal training methods of Pavlov and Skinner.<br>
      <br>
      Once all teachers have been retrained in this method to teach
      reading, it can be used for teaching/training in all subjects, but
      it is especially well-suited for work force training and
      computer-assisted-instruction. It is referred to by knowledgeable
      education researchers as " Limited Learning for Lifelong Labor"!<br>
      <br>
      Nationwide distribution of this little booklet could have resulted
      in the abolition of the unconstitutional U.S. Department of
      Education, something President Reagan had promised the American
      people during his<br>
      campaign for President. This would, of course, have stopped the
      controversial education restructuring we see today. However, that
      was not to be since the major conservative organizations in our
      country, now referred to as neoconservative, successfully
      boycotted the booklet, and, although 50,000 copies were sold at
      the grassroots level, it is unlikely that more than a few elected
      officials ever had the opportunity to read it and act upon its
      recommendations.<br>
      <br>
      Please use the two versions of this booklet as you wish, but
      especially get the booklet into the hands of your elected
      officials at the local, state, and federal level. They are the
      ones you should lobby for abolishing the unconstitutional
      Department of Education.<br>
      <br>
      If we want to bring traditional academic education back to the
      local level, in the hands of locally elected school boards,
      teachers, and parents, and to restore education to its legitimate
      role in the creation of upward mobility for our children, i.e.
      freedom to chose one's occupation, the U.S. Department of
      Education, which is in partnership with the U.S. Department of
      Labor and the United Nations, MUST be abolished. Abolishing the
      Department of Education would also deal an almost lethal blow to
      the change agents' plans to put us under the United Nations global
      economic system. The rats would have to jump off their sinking
      ship!<br>
      <br>
      There can be no better time than right now to contact your elected
      officials since all Americans, including public school teachers,
      administrators, state Governors, school board members, parents,
      Congressmen and Senators, etc. are up in arms over the Leave No
      Child Behind Act which mandates national testing which obviously
      calls for a national curriculum geared only to training our
      children as human resources for the global economy!<br>

      In the United States, at least 9 percent of school-aged children
      have been diagnosed with ADHD, and are taking pharmaceutical
      medications. In France, the percentage of kids diagnosed and
      medicated for ADHD is less than .5 percent. How has the epidemic
      of ADHD — firmly established in the U.S. — almost completely
      passed over children in France?<br>
      <br>
      Is ADHD a biological-neurological disorder? Surprisingly, the
      answer to this question depends on whether you live in France or
      in the U.S. In the United States, child psychiatrists consider
      ADHD to be a biological disorder with biological causes. The
      preferred treatment is also biological—psycho stimulant
      medications such as Ritalin and Adderall.<br>
      <br>
      French child psychiatrists, on the other hand, view ADHD as a
      medical condition that has psycho-social and situational causes.
      Instead of treating children’s focusing and behavioral problems
      with drugs, French doctors prefer to look for the underlying issue
      that is causing the child distress—not in the child’s brain but in
      the child’s social context.<br>
      <br>
      They then choose to treat the underlying social context problem
      with psychotherapy or family counseling. This is a very different
      way of seeing things from the American tendency to attribute all
      symptoms to a biological dysfunction such as a chemical imbalance
      in the child’s brain.....<br>

      Award-winning investigative journalist and conspiracy analyst Jim
      Marrs has just released a new book entitled Population Control -
      How Corporate Owners are Killing Us.<br>
      <br>
      The phenomenal new book explores how the G.O.D. syndicate -- the
      "global monopoly of Guns, Oil, and Drugs" -- is destroying
      America. I haven't yet read the book, but knowing that it comes
      from Jim Marrs is all I need to know. Marrs is one of the last
      remaining true investigative journalists in America today. He's
      fearless, thorough and highly intelligent. He brings to his
      writings a vast knowledge of history, true conspiracies,
      corruption and collusion throughout government and industry.<br>
      <br>
      Nobody on the planet can put together a book like Jim Marrs.
      That's why we're honored to run an excerpt from his book (below).<br>
      <br>
      The stories of four prominent doctors connected to the autism
      debate -- Brian Hooker, Andrew Wakefield, Thomas Verstraeten, and
      Poul Thorsen -- help to explain the powerful forces that suppress
      criticism of vaccinations.<br>
      <br>
      Brian Hooker holds a doctorate degree in biochemical engineering
      and has a teenage son with autism. Motivated by his son's
      condition and with the help of two congressmen, Hooker spent
      almost ten years submitting over one hundred Freedom of
      Information Acts requests to the CDC for data linking
      mercury-filled thimerosal in vaccines to various disorders. He
      received thousands of documents, but with many key components
      blacked out. These documents included five CDC studies on
      thimerosal and autism written prior to 2004 that rejected the
      connection between thimerosal and autism.<br>
      <br>
      Yet the heavily redacted documents Hooker received revealed the
      CDC had access to data linking thimerosal in vaccines to autism,
      nonorganic sleep disorders, and speech disorders but had concealed
      this from the public. Today, flu shots containing thimerosal still
      are administered to pregnant women and infants.<br>
      <br>
      According to Hooker, a 2009 study hid data regarding the only
      valid part of the study (i.e., prenatal thimerosal exposure),
      which showed that children exposed to just sixteen micrograms of
      mercury in thimerosal in utero were up to eight times more likely
      to receive a diagnosis of regressive autism.<br>
      <br>
      Hooker said his FOIA requests specifically sought information on
      five CDC studies on thimerosal and autism prior to 2004. These
      studies led to an Institute of Medicine (IOM) Immunization Safety
      Review Committee report, "Vaccines and Autism," released in May
      2004. Denying any link between thimerosal in the MMR vaccine and
      autism, this report effectively shut down government funding for
      any independent research. "Given the constant reference that the
      CDC and others make to the 2004 IOM report, most of the key
      components of the [CE1] FOIAed information have been completely
      redacted by the CDC," said Hooker, adding that much of the
      information sought in his FOIA requests has yet to be released by
      the CDC.<br>
      <br>
      "I would challenge anyone who would rely on the veracity of the
      CDC studies," said Hooker. "They've repeatedly, purposefully
      withheld data that clearly show a link between thimerosal and
      autism (among other NDDs [neurodevelopmental disorders]). They've
      obfuscated the main issue via obviously biased statistical
      manipulation. Clearly, the CDC's conflicted role of vaccine
      advocate and vaccine safety guardian has contributed to this whole
      problem."<br>
      <br>
      Hooker also noted that other countries that vaccinate less and
      have banned thimerosal have not experienced comparable autism
      rates to the United States. He added his belief that thimerosal
      has not been removed from U.S. vaccines because of "various issues
      in a concerted effort toward the globalization of vaccines."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Andrew Wakefield</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Andrew Wakefield, a British former surgeon and medical researcher,
      supported Hooker in his effort to find the truth. Wakefield is a
      controversial figure who has been castigated by the medical
      establishment and the mainstream media. His Wikipedia page states
      that the doctor is "known for his fraudulent 1998 research paper
      in support of the now-discredited claim that there is a link
      between the administration of the measles, mumps, and rubella
      (MMR) vaccine and autism and other ailments." And in 2010, a
      five-member tribunal of the British General Medical Council (GMC)
      found Wakefield guilty of dishonesty and twelve counts involving
      the abuse of developmentally challenged children. He was barred
      from practicing medicine and the British medical journal The
      Lancet retracted his 1998 paper.<br>
      <br>
      Yet Wakefield's claims are not nearly as outlandish as they have
      been made to seem by the media. In late 2011, the Strategic Autism
      Initiative (SAI), an autism research foundation, announced an
      investigation into Wakefield's claims headed by Dr. David Lewis,
      former senior-level research microbiologist for the U.S.
      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and a member of the National
      Whistleblowers Center (NWC) board of directors. The SAI rejected
      the assertion that Wakefield's claim was fraudulent. Further
      research has continued to support the doctor. More than twenty-six
      studies in the U.S., Canada, Venezuela, and Italy replicated
      Wakefield's 1998 findings but have not been widely publicized.<br>
      <br>
      As director of the MRC's Research Misconduct Project, Lewis
      explained that important areas of scientific research are
      increasingly being manipulated by government agencies, large
      corporations, and leading universities in order to promote and
      protect their own interests. Suppressing independent research that
      threatens their interests is critical to their interests. While
      most scientists are rarely targeted for retribution by government,
      industry, or academia, some have faced false allegations of
      research misconduct. "Scientists who are targeted in this manner
      suffer lifelong consequences, and the chilling effect it has on
      other scientists is profound. Few, if any, scientists are willing
      to step into the firing line of government or big industry and
      risk being martyred," explained Lewis.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Dr. Thomas Verstraeten</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The outside pressure the pharmaceutical industry brings to bear on
      anti-vaccine advocates explains why many doctors are wary of
      making any controversial statements about the effects of vaccines.
      Dr. Thomas Verstraeten is one such case. Verstraeten entered the
      vaccine fray when he authored a 2001 study whose initial phase
      seemed to indicate a potential link between thimerosal and autism.
      However, by 2003, Verstraeten said his study ultimately did not
      support such a link, and he became a supporter of the vaccines. He
      was accused of yielding to outside pressure to alter studies
      indicating a link between thimerosal and autism. One internal CDC
      document obtained after a FOIA request, showed Verstraeten sent an
      email that many have interpreted as referring to his difficulty in
      making the statistical association between thimerosal and autism
      disappear with the words, "It just won't go away."<br>
      <br>
      In June 2005, Rolling Stone published an article written by Robert
      F. Kennedy Jr. entitled "Deadly Immunity," which claimed that the
      federal government and the pharmaceutical industry colluded to
      withhold information concerning vaccine safety. Kennedy also
      accused Verstraeten of modifying his data to fit the CDC's claim
      that there is no link between thimerosal and autism, an accusation
      that Verstraeten has vehemently denied. Yet his personal career
      choices suggest something sinister: shortly after publishing his
      findings, Verstraeten left the CDC for a position with the
      pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline.<br>
      <br>
      Verstraeten's jump is just another illustration of the "revolving
      door" policy between government regulators and the corporate
      world. In 2009, for instance, CDC Director Julie Gerberding left
      the organization for a job as president of the $5 billion vaccine
      division of Merck.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Poul Thorsen</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Poul Thorsen is another pro-vaccine doctor whose legitimacy has
      been called into question. Thorson coauthored some of the most
      frequently cited CDC studies denying the link between
      thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. Much of the data cited
      in these studies remain unavailable to the public. Yet despite the
      lack of transparency, Thorsen's research has been hailed by the
      corporate mass media, public health establishment, and Big Pharm
      as "proof" that there is no connection between vaccines and
      autism.<br>
      <br>
      In 2014, Thorsen was indicted for fraud and stealing grant money
      while working for the CDC. The CDC had awarded him grant money for
      research in Denmark involving infant disabilities, autism, genetic
      disorders, and fetal alcohol syndrome. According to the U.S.
      Department of Health and Human Services' inspector general,
      Thorsen reportedly diverted more than $1 million of the CDC grant
      money to his own personal bank account and submitted fraudulent
      invoices on CDC letterhead to medical facilities assisting in the
      research for reimbursement of work allegedly covered by the
      grants.<br>
      <br>
      In order to find out who is in the right in the vaccine debate,
      one need only follow the money. Mass inoculations bring more than
      $25 billion in revenues to the giant pharmaceutical firms and
      their hirelings while physicians and researchers who question mass
      vaccinations make nothing. In fact, many of them risk loss of
      income and ostracism from the conventional medical establishment.
      Meanwhile, those who trumpet the benefits of vaccines and downplay
      their risks can profit enormously.<br>

      <br>
      America’s #1 conspiracy theorist and New York Times bestselling
      author Jim Marrs explores how the G.O.D. syndicate—a global
      monopoly of Guns, Oil, and Drugs—is consciously destroying
      American values and offers prescriptive solutions to fix our
      nation.<br>
      <br>
      According to the Declaration of Independence, “all men are endowed
      by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these
      are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” But America today
      has failed to live up to the Founding Fathers’ ideals.<br>
      <br>
      Today, there are three million homeless people in the U.S., and
      almost 20 million vacant homes. The most technologically advanced
      nation in the world has a life expectancy lower than that of Chile
      and Bahrain. And citizens of the wealthiest country on the planet
      continue to ingest toxic chemicals through their food, their
      vaccines, and even their water. America, Jim Marrs argues, has
      been seized by a culture of death. And who promulgates this
      culture? The globalist masters of the G.O.D. Syndicate—Guns, Oil,
      and Drugs. Pushed to the brink by this lethal triumvirate,
      Americans increasingly find themselves headed toward an inexorable
      decline ending in servitude and premature death.<br>
      <br>
      In Population Control, Marrs takes aim at our deteriorating nation
      and offers practical steps we can take to save it. As he exposes
      how daily living—from the food we eat to the water we drink to the
      drugs we ingest—pushes us closer to an early grave, he shows us
      how a return to true prosperity is possible, and explains what we
      need to do to fight back and save our lives and our nation’s soul.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Previous work assumed that ATP synthase, the smallest known rotary
      motor in nature, operates at 100% efficiency. Calculations which
      arrive to this result assume that the water viscosity inside
      mitochondria is constant and corresponds to that of bulk water. In
      our opinion this assumption is not satisfactory for two reasons:
      (1) There is evidence that the water in mitochondria prevails to
      100% as interfacial water. (2) Laboratory experiments which
      explore the properties of interfacial water suggest viscosities
      which exceed those of bulk water, specifically at hydrophilic
      interfaces. Here, we wish to suggest a physicochemical mechanism
      which assumes intramitochondrial water viscosity gradients and
      consistently explains two cellular responses: The decrease and
      increase in ATP synthesis in response to reactive oxygen species
      and non-destructive levels of near-infrared (NIR) laser light,
      respectively. The mechanism is derived from the results of a new
      experimental method, which combines the technique of
      nanoindentation with the modulation of interfacial water layers by
      laser irradiation. Results, including the elucidation of the
      principle of light-induced ATP production, are expected to have
      broad implications in all fields of medicine.<br>

          Negating The Side Effects Of Marijuana: European Scientists
          Isolate Tumor-Shrinking Component In THC</b><br>
        <br>

      <br>
      In the battle to unlock the full medical potential of marijuana,
      the greatest argument against the drug is that its main
      psychoactive components produce unwanted side effects in tandem
      with its health benefits. But now researchers from Europe have
      isolated the tumor-shrinking pathways within cannabis, and are
      putting them to the test.<br>
      <br>
      In a new study published in the journal PLOS Biology, researchers
      from the University of East Anglia, University of Barcelona,
      University of Pompeu Fabra, and several other European
      institutions are taking apart tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, and
      removing the common psychoactive ingredient that commonly produces
      the “high.” Past research conducted by these universities, along
      with many other studies, has found that THC can reduce tumor
      growth in patients suffering from cancer.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, a 2014 study found that THC, working with cannabidiol,
      can reduce the tumor growth of a particularly aggressive strain of
      brain cancer within mice. Researchers working under Dr. Wai Lui of
      the University of London discovered that small amounts of THC were
      able to shrink the brain tumor within the mice test subjects to a
      greater degree than prior radiation treatment. What’s more,
      because the necessary amounts of THC were so small, psychoactive
      ingredients we attribute to unwanted side effects were virtually
      gone.<br>
      <br>
      Now, researchers are learning how to eliminate these components
      within THC altogether so that future medications made with
      cannabis only contain its cancer-killing mechanisms. When
      examining the various pathways within THC, researchers found that
      the negative cognitive effects of the component were isolated to a
      single pathway separate from those that shrink tumors. This
      pathway was found to involve both a cannabinoid receptor and a
      serotonin receptor, and when the serotonin receptor was blocked,
      THC retained its medical properties, like pain relief, without
      causing memory or judgment impairment.<br>
      <br>
      Currently this study is also being tested on mice, but researchers
      remain hopeful that this new discovery will soon lead to
      cannabis-based therapies for human cancer patients.<br>
      <br>
      “THC, the major active component of marijuana has broad medical
      use — including for pain relief, nausea and anxiety,” says Dr.
      Peter McCormick of the University of East Anglia in a recent press
      release. “Our previous research has also found that it could
      reduce tumor size in cancer patients. However, it is also known to
      induce numerous undesirable side effects such as memory
      impairment, anxiety, and dependence. There has been a great deal
      of medical interest in understanding the molecular mechanisms at
      work in THC, so that the beneficial effects can be harnessed
      without the side effects.”<br>
      <br>
      And McCormick and his team are working hard to better understand
      those mechanisms, finding that when cannabinoid receptors are
      isolated from serotonin receptors, THC can shrink tumors without
      any hindering side effects. Researchers discovered that within
      mice, the absence of the serotonin receptor known as 5HT2AR within
      the brain reduced undesirable effects of THC, like memory loss.
      When researchers than employed a treatment to reduce 5HT2AR, THC
      was still able to reduce pain as well as tumor growth.<br>
      <br>
      “This research is important because it identifies a way to reduce
      some of what, in medical treatment, are usually thought of as
      THC’s unwanted side effects, while maintaining several important
      benefits, including pain reduction,” McCormick said.<br>
      <br>
      McCormick concluded by warning patients that though their study
      proves promising for the future of cannabis in medical settings,
      patients should refrain from self-medicating. He and his team are
      optimistic that a “safe synthetic equivalent” to current cannabis
      will be available for cancer patients in the near future.<br>

      Researchers at Tel Aviv University and Harvard Medical School have
      reportedly developed a new, non-invasive technique that will help
      make a person’s skin look younger by using pulsed electric fields
      to rejuvenate epidermal function and appearance.<br>
      <br>
      The technique, which is described in the latest edition of the
      journal Scientific Reports, it a non-invasive technique that can
      generate skin tissue growth by stimulating tissue using
      microsecond-pulsed, high-voltage, non-thermal electric fields.<br>
      <br>
      While they note that Americans spend more than $10 billion per
      year on anti-aging and beauty products, with little to no
      permanent success, the new technique would enable skin
      rejuvenation without scars or the side-effects of treatments such
      as Botulinum toxin. Furthermore, they claim that the technique
      could also improve the treatment of degenerative skin diseases.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Potential ‘gamechanger’ in non-invasive skin therapy</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      “Pulsed electrical field technology has many advantages, which
      have already proved effective – for example, in food preservation,
      tumor removal, and wound disinfection,” said Dr. Alexander Golberg
      of the TAU Porter School of Environmental Studies, lead
      investigator of the study.<br>
      <br>
      “Our new application may jumpstart the secretion of new collagen
      and capillaries in problematic skin areas,” he added. “Considering
      that, in the modern era of aging populations and climate change,
      degenerative skin diseases affect one in three adults over the age
      of 60, this has the potential to be an healthcare gamechanger.”<br>
      <br>
      Most current treatments used to rejuvenate the skin use a variety
      of different physical and chemical techniques to affect cells and
      the extracellular matrix, but as the researchers explain, many of
      these methods can cause scarring. The use of pulsed electric
      fields, however, impacts only the cell membrane, preserving the
      architecture of the extracellular matrix and releasing a series of
      growth factors what serve as the catalyst for new cell and tissue
      growth.<br>
      <br>
      The authors report that by using electrical fields, they can
      induce nanoscale defects on the cell membranes, thus causing a
      small number of cells in affected areas to die. The released
      growth factors increase the metabolism of the cells that remain,
      leading to the generation of new tissues. They are currently in
      the process of developing a new, inexpensive device that will be
      used in human clinical trials to ensure the safety and efficacy of
      the new technology.<br>
      <br>
      “Our results suggest that pulsed electric fields can improve skin
      function and potentially serve as a novel non-invasive skin
      therapy for multiple degenerative skin diseases,” Dr. Golberg
      said.<br>

      Americans spend over $10 billion a year on products and surgery in
      their quest to find a "fountain of youth," with little permanent
      success. Botulinum toxin — notably Botox — which smoothes lines
      and wrinkles to rejuvenate the aging face has been the number one
      nonsurgical procedure in the U.S. since 2000. But injections of
      this toxic bacterium are only a temporary solution and carry many
      risks, some neurological.<br>
      <br>
      A team of Tel Aviv University and Harvard Medical School
      researchers has now devised a non-invasive technique that
      harnesses pulsed electric fields to generate new skin tissue
      growth. According to their research, the novel non-invasive tissue
      stimulation technique, utilizing microsecond-pulsed, high-voltage,
      non-thermal electric fields, produces scarless skin rejuvenation
      and may revolutionize the treatment of degenerative skin diseases.<br>
      <br>
      The study, published recently in Scientific Reports, was led by
      Dr. Alexander Golberg of TAU's Porter School of Environmental
      Studies and the Center for Engineering in Medicine at
      Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and
      Shriners Burns Hospital in Boston, in collaboration with Dr.
      William J. Austen, Jr. from the Department of Plastic Surgery at
      Massachusetts General Hospital and Dr. Martin L. Yarmush at the
      Center for Engineering in Medicine at Massachusetts General
      Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and Shriners Burns Hospital in
      Boston, along with other prominent researchers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>An (effective) shock to the system</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      "Pulsed electrical field technology has many advantages, which
      have already proved effective — for example, in food preservation,
      tumor removal, and wound disinfection," said Dr. Golberg. "Our new
      application may jumpstart the secretion of new collagen and

      skin diseases affect one in three adults over the age of 60, this
      has the potential to be an healthcare gamechanger."<br>
      <br>
      Current therapies to rejuvenate skin use various physical and
      chemical methods to affect cells and the extracellular matrix, but
      they induce unsightly scarring. Pulsed electric fields, however,
      affect only the cell membrane itself, preserving the extracellular
      matrix architecture and releasing multiple growth factors to spark
      new cell and tissue growth. By inducing nanoscale defects on the
      cell membranes, electric fields cause the death of a small number
      of cells in affected areas. The released growth factors increase
      the metabolism of the remaining cells, generating new tissue.<br>
      <br>
      "We have identified in rats the specific pulsed electric field
      parameters that lead to prominent proliferation of the epidermis,
      formation of microvasculature, and secretion of new collagen at
      treated areas without scarring," said Dr. Golberg. "Our results
      suggest that pulsed electric fields can improve skin function and
      potentially serve as a novel non-invasive skin therapy for
      multiple degenerative skin diseases."<br>
      <br>
      The researchers are currently developing a low-cost device for use
      in clinical trials in order to test the safety and efficacy of the
      technology in humans.<br>

      Systems and methods for controlling a tissue of a subject using
      applied pulsed electric fields. The system for controlling a
      therapy provided to a tissue of a subject using applied pulsed
      electric fields. The system includes an electrode assembly
      configured to engage a skin tissue of a subject to deliver a
      series of electric field pulses to the skin tissue and a user
      input configured to receive an operational instruction for the
      series of electric field pulses. The operational instruction
      defines at least one of a pulse duration, a pulse frequency, a
      pulse number, and a pulse amplitude. The system also includes at
      least one processor configured to access the operational
      instruction received by the user input and, using the operational
      instruction, create an electric field profile to be generated by
      the electrode assembly about the skin tissue of the subject to
      control a fibroblast characteristic while preserving a vascular
      perfusion in at least a portion of the skin tissue. The processor
      is also caused to control the electrode assembly using the
      electric field profile to deliver the series of electric field
      pulses to control the fibroblast characteristic.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The present disclosure relates generally to systems and
      methods for delivering electric fields to tissue and, in
      particular, to systems and methods for controlling and
      regenerating skin.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Wound care costs the U.S. healthcare system more than $20
      billion each year. Among others, fire and burn injuries represent
      1 % of total injuries at a cost of $7.5 billion for total
      treatment and rehabilitation each year. In 2010 United States, a
      fire injury occurred every 30 minutes leading to 3,120 deaths and
      17,720 injuries. Despite efforts, scars remain a major clinical
      and economic problem in the rehabilitation of burned and other
      injured patients, leading to physical, aesthetic, functional,
      psychological, and social stresses. Various approaches have been
      attempted over the years to treat scars, such as surgical
      excision, intra-lesional steroid and interferon injection,
      cryotherapy, laser therapy, irradiation, mechanical compression
      dressing, silicone sheet applications, to name a few. However,
      most treatments for keloidal and hypertrophic scars have offered
      minimal likelihood of improvement, with a recent meta review
      showing no statistically significant difference among the
      treatment options.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Wound healing is a dynamic, chronic process that is often
      divided into 4 overlapping phases: hemostasis, inflammation,
      proliferation, and remodeling. During hemostasis, constriction of
      the damaged vessels and clot formation physically limit blood
      loss. In the inflammatory phase, leukocytes and then monocytes
      accumulate to combat infection in the wounded tissue. In this
      phase, multiple cytokines and growth factors are released to the
      wound area and contribute to the fibroblast migration,
      differentiation and activity. During the proliferative phase,
      fibroblasts deposit new extracellular matrix and collagen and
      differentiate into myofibroblasts. In the final remodeling phase,
      re-organization of the closed wound environment occurs until
      repair is completed. Fetal wounds typically heal rapidly, without
      formation of a scab and with reduced inflammatory and angiogenic
      responses, exhibiting major differences compared to adult wound
      profiles of extracellular matrix and signaling. Moreover, in
      adults, the formation of hypertrophic scars (HTS) depends on the
      depth of injury and individual response, while in children, HTS
      are formed even in superficial wounds, burns and donor areas.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] This complex dynamic process may be described using the
      concept of wound healing trajectory (FIG. 1A), which illustrates
      time-dependent cumulative effects of these multiple processes that
      occur from injury though healing. According to the healing
      trajectory curve, normally-healed tissues are characterized by
      complete restoration of function and structure. Chronic wounds,
      however, are characterized by incomplete restoration of structure
      and function. In proliferative scarring the healing process does
      not stop as it should and the tissue fails to reach a normal cell
      density and a balance between collagen deposition and degradation.
      Additionally, such processes may be further complicated by
      intrusion of infective biological pathogens or agents, interfering
      with repair processes and making clinical treatment more
      difficult.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Several systemic and genomic studies have identified
      potential cellular and extracellular factors that mediate the
      formation of proliferative scar. Current data show that
      alterations in coagulation, inflammation, angiogenesis,
      fibroplasia, contraction, remodeling, and mechanical tension
      correlate with the formation of HTS. However, the exact mechanisms
      associated with hypertrophic scarring have not yet been
      identified, leading to treatment procedures that have had limited
      clinical success. Thus, many conventional HSTs therapies do not
      take into account these complex interactions associated with would
      healing, and usually focus on a single target. For example,
      research on transforming growth factor ß (TGF- ß) revealed that
      TGF-ß? and TGF^2 appear to be implicated in cutaneous scarring,
      while TGF- ß3 reduces scarring. However, a TGF-based therapy
      proposed thereafter failed in Phase III trials.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Humoral mediators appear to play an important role in
      proliferative scarring by altering fibroblast metabolism. It has
      been shown that signaling, which affects fibroblast metabolism, is
      different for individuals who suffer from proliferative scarring
      compared to those who do not. The major role of fibroblasts in
      wound healing is to replace the fibrin-based provisional matrix
      established during the inflammatory phase of wound healing with
      collagen-rich granulation tissue. The behavior of fibroblasts in
      the wound is highly dynamic (FIG. 1 B) and varies at each healing
      phase. Fibroblasts reach the wound during the second or third day
      after the injury. Four days after the injury, fibroblasts are
      usually the major cell type in the developing granulation tissue.
      The wound fibroblast number increases initially through migration
      from nearby non-injured tissue and then through cell
      proliferation. Fibroblast density in the wound reaches its maximum
      between 7 and 14 days after injury. When the anatomic function of
      the tissue is mostly restored, the maturing granulation tissue
      undergoes remodeling leading to reduction of fibroblast density by
      apoptosis. Interestingly, clinical observations showed that in
      patients with proliferative scarring the apoptosis inhibitor -
      bcl-2 proto-oncogene is elevated while the apoptosis
      effector-interleukin-converting enzyme is decreased. These
      findings suggested that the apoptosis mechanisms are altered in
      patients with proliferative scarring.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Clinical control of cell density has been usually achieved
      by chemical factors, which affect the cell cycle, preventing or
      inducing proliferation. Such agents, however, cannot be precisely
      targeted and affect multiple cell types. For example, Tamoxifen, a
      synthetic non-steroidal anti-estrogen, has been shown to have
      multiple side effects. Those side effects include altered RNA
      transcription, decreased cellular proliferation, delay or arrest
      of the cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and interference
      with multiple growth factors such as TGF-b and insulin-like growth
      factor.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In addition to efforts for improving wound care, the desire
      for a rejuvenated appearance has led to over 2.1 million skin
      rejuvenation procedures and accounted for 1 .8 billion in spending
      in the US alone (2012) in the treatment of scars, striae,
      age-related rhytids, photodamage, acne, and trauma. In fact,
      minimally invasive aesthetic body shaping is the fastest growing
      sector of the rapidly expanding aesthetic market. From 1997 to
      2012, there was a 500 percent increase in the total number of
      minimally-invasive procedures including skin resurfacing and laser
      procedures. This growth is driven by an aging population and
      increased social acceptance of aesthetic procedures, as well as
      significant emotional and psychological sequelae as result in
      physical alterations. [0010] Overall, skin rejuvenation methods
      aim to remove damaged tissue and stimulate new growth of healthy
      collagen, skin cells, and elastin fibers. Currently the most
      popular therapies include percutaneous collagen induction (PCI)
      and laser therapies. PCI has a low side effect profile, but has
      very limited clinical data. Although laser treatments have good
      clinical data, they also have a poor side effect profile with many
      patients experiencing prolonged erythema, scaring, and
      dyspigmentation. The market needs a technology with fewer side
      effects, a better safety profile, lower cost, and one that is
      convenient enough to be sold over the counter.<br>
      <br>
      [001 1] Experimental data has shown that pulsed electric fields
      applied to cells may trigger multiple biochemical mechanisms,
      shown in FIG. 2, such as stimulating electric fields (SEF),
      reversible electroporation (RE), non-thermal irreversible
      electroporation (IRE), and thermal damages. These are known to
      affect cell and tissue metabolism by regenerative stimulation at
      the lower amplitudes, and, in addition, permeabilization at the
      higher ones. In the case of electroporation, the pulsed electric
      fields cause changes in cell membrane permeability, which may be
      reversible when the change in permeabilization is temporary, and
      cells survive. Applications of RE have involved gene delivery to
      cells and tissues, and cell fusion. In addition, RE has also been
      the basis for a new cancer treatment therapy, known as
      "electrochemotherapy," whereby cancer cell-specific cytotoxic
      drugs are introduced into cells through temporary membrane
      openings created by the pulsed electric fields.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Therefore, given the above, there is a need for systems and
      methods for controlling tissue and tissue regenerating processes
      using applied pulsed electric fields.<br>
      <br>
      SUMMARY<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The present invention overcomes the aforementioned
      drawbacks by providing systems and methods for delivering electric

      enhancement, and disinfection. In particular, systems and methods

      or tissue enhancement process by way of selectively targeting
      specific cells types, or structures associated with immune system
      activation of repair or renewal pathways, without deleterious
      effects to desired tissue components, properties or processes, or
      non-target agents. In addition, systems and methods are provided
      that make use of antiseptic qualities of pulsed electric fields,
      providing for control of biological pathogens present in injured
      tissues or other infected sites.<br>

      for controlling a therapy provided to a tissue of a subject using
      applied pulsed electric fields is provided. The system includes an
      electrode assembly configured to engage a skin tissue of a subject
      to deliver a series of electric field pulses to the skin tissue
      and a user input configured to receive an operational instruction
      for the series of electric field pulses, the operational
      instruction defining at least one of a pulse duration, a pulse
      frequency, a pulse number, and a pulse amplitude. The system also
      includes at least one processor configured to access the
      operational instruction received by the user input and using the
      operational instruction, create an electric field profile to be
      generated by the electrode assembly about the skin tissue of the
      subject to control a fibroblast characteristic while preserving at
      least one of a vascular perfusion, an epithelium and an
      extracellular matrix in at least a portion of the skin tissue. The
      at least one processor is further configured to control the
      electrode assembly using the electric field profile to deliver the
      series of electric field pulses to control the fibroblast
      characteristic.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In accordance with another aspect of the disclosure, a
      method is provided for controlling a therapy delivered to a tissue
      of a subject using applied pulsed electric fields. The method

      method also includes creating, using the operational instruction,
      an electric field profile to be generated by the electrode
      assembly about the skin tissue of the subject to control a

      at least a portion of the skin tissue. The method further includes
      controlling the electrode assembly using the electric field
      profile to deliver the series of electric field pulses to control
      the fibroblast characteristic and generating a report indicative
      of a spatiotemporal control of the fibroblast characteristic
      within the skin tissue of the subject. [0016] In accordance with
      one aspect of the disclosure, a system for controlling a therapy
      provided to tissue of a subject using applied pulsed electric
      fields is provided. The system includes an electrode assembly
      configured to engage a wounded skin tissue of a subject to deliver
      a series of electric field pulses to the wounded skin tissue and a
      user input configured to receive an operational instruction for
      the series of electric field pulses, the operational instruction
      defining at least one of a pulse duration, a pulse frequency, a
      pulse number, and a pulse amplitude. The system also includes at
      least one processor configured to access the operational
      instruction received by the user input and using the operational
      instruction, create an electric field profile to be generated by
      the electrode assembly about the wounded skin tissue of the
      subject to control a biological pathogen concentration while
      preserving at least one of a vascular perfusion, an epithelium and
      an extracellular matrix in at least a portion of the wounded skin
      tissue. The at least one processor is further configured to
      control the electrode assembly using the electric field profile to
      deliver the series of electric field pulses to control the
      biological pathogen concentration...<br>
