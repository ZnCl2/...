      </b>Abstract -- An electromagnetic engine and method capable of
      producing a high amount of mechanical power at a high efficiency.
      An electromagnet or piston operates within a cylinder having a
      stepped bore therein. The cylinder reciprocates while the piston
      only pivots. The power stroke occurs for a short duration midway
      between a top dead center position and a bottom dead center
      position. Axial magnetic forces are used to impart axial motion to
      the cylinder which causes rotation of the crankshaft. A plate is
      positioned within the cylinder up against the step. When the plate
      is in close proximity to the piston or electromagnet, and the
      centerline of the cylinder is at a right angle to the throw of the
      crankshaft, the electromagnet is energized. Sequential
      energization of each of a plurality of piston-cylinder
      combinations occurs during each crankshaft rotation.<br>

      <b>1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates in general to the field of magnetic
      energy-conversion devices, and in particular to apparatus for
      converting magnetic energy created by electricity into rotating
      mechanical energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The creation of magnetic energy by electricity is well known in
      the art. The most prevalent use of such energy is, of course, by
      electric motors. The direct use of such energy, however, is
      somewhat limited in industry to those applications where, for
      example, the magnetic attraction forces are used to lift objects
      or to separate magnetic particles from compounds containing both
      magnetic and nonmagnetic particles. A more prevalent direct use of
      magnetic energy is found wherever electrical solenoids are used.
      Such usage comprises making and breaking electrical contacts,
      opening and closing valves, and hot-melt glue guns or other such
      applications where a predetermined amount of a product is
      dispensed upon demand or at specific time intervals. More
      recently, the field created by magnetic energy has been used in
      particle acceleration devices such as cyclotrons and syncrotrons
      where electrons have been accelerated to within 99.999995% of the
      speed of light.<br>
      <br>
      The fascination associated with the potential uses of magnetic
      energy has led to a number of devices other than the above whereby
      electrical energy is converted into magnetic energy which is then
      converted into mechanical rotational motion. These devices are
      generally known as electromagnetic engines. They differ from the
      common electric motor in that they contain one or more pistons
      attached to a crankshaft which provides the mechanical output. <b>U.S.




        Pat. No. 1,018,30</b>9, issued in 1912, by H. J. Ford, is one
      such device. This invention discloses a plurality of solenoids
      coupled to crank portions of a crankshaft. The solenoids include a
      steel plate located at one end thereof to enhance the magnetic
      forces and which magnetically actuate the plunger-core of the
      solenoid. Each solenoid is sequentially energized to impart
      rotational motion to the crankshaft. <b>U.S. Pat. No. 1,436,245</b>,
      issued in 1922, is another such device comprising an improvement
      on the original above-described electromagnetic engine. Again,
      solenoid windings surround a cylinder within which a plunger-core
      reciprocates. Electrical contacts are placed in the upper portion
      of the cylinders which make and break electrical power to the
      solenoid when the plunger-core reaches its uppermost position.<br>
      <br>
      <b>U.S. Pat. No. 1,886,040</b>, issued in 1932, is yet another
      improved version of the basic electromagnetic motor, the
      improvement comprising adjustable means to alter the time interval
      during which the solenoids are energized in order to increase or
      decrease the speed of the engine.<br>
      <br>
      <b>U.S. Pat. No. 2,639,544</b>, issued in 1953, is a toy engine
      kit which uses a solenoid electromagnetic motor to simulate the
      operation of an internal combustion engine for educational
      purposes. The typical electromagnetic motor is disclosed in this
      teaching. In one arrangement of an imitated engine, the inventor
      discloses a radial electromagnetic engine having up to 12
      cylinders. The radial version again utilizes solenoid windings
      around a cylinder having a plunger-core slidingly actuated
      therein.<br>
      <br>
      The continuing quest to attain an electromagnetic engine having a
      high efficiency and the ability to produce a substantial output
      resulted in the teachings of <b>U.S. Pat. No. 3,328,656</b>,
      which was issued in 1967. The inventor again began with the now
      standard plunger-core solenoid engine having windings around the
      cylinder wall. In this art, however, the inventor discloses the
      use of a high-quality factor coil assembly to achieve a sizeable
      mechanical output. <b>U.S. Pat. No. 3,676,719</b>, issued in
      1972, is still another attempt to achieve a high output from an
      electromagnetic engine of the same type previously described.
      Here, the connecting rod of a plunger-core is eccentrically
      connected to a driving gear which meshes with a driven gear
      carried by a drive shaft to gain a mechanical advantage and cause
      rotation of the drive shaft.<br>
      <br>
      <b>U.S. Pat. No. 4,019,103</b>, issued in 1977, discloses yet
      another electromagnetic engine. In this teaching, a pair of
      solenoids each containing three separate but connected windings
      are wound on a cylinder. A piston-plunger reciprocates within the
      cylinder and is connected to a crankshaft. A commutator connected
      to the crankshaft selectively energizes the solenoids. The primary
      object of the arrangement is to recapture a portion of the
      electrical energy supplied to operate the motor in order to
      increase the efficiency of the motor.<br>
      <br>
      In <b>U.S. Pat. No. 4,093,880</b>, the inventor discloses yet
      another attempt to increase the efficiency of an electromagnetic
      motor. This is accomplished by a plurality of solenoid coil
      cylinders each having a plunger-core positioned therein, with the
      cylinders arranged in a single plane. At least one of the solenoid
      structures is provided with an air compressor to provide a
      combination device capable of producing a mechanical output in
      conjunction with high pressure air.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the attempts disclosed by the prior art, there
      is an obvious need to effectively increase the power output and
      the efficiency of electromagnetic motors before they can in fact
      be considered to be competitive with other engines and motors such
      as electric motors and internal combustion engines. And, based on
      the noncommercial use of the disclosed engines, the need for an
      electromagnetic engine having a high efficiency coupled with a
      high power output still exists today. Indeed, in this age of
      shrinking energy sources, the need for conservation of energy
      assumes an even more important place in our society.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, a primary object of the present invention is to
      provide an electromagnetic engine which is capable of producing a
      high mechanical output.<br>
      <br>
      Another primary object of the present invention is to provide an
      engine powered by electromagnets in a manner whereby electrical
      power is efficiently converted into mechanical power.<br>
      <br>
      A further object of the present invention is to provide an
      electromagnetic engine having one or more electromagnets, each of
      which operates over short distances in order to utilize the
      maximum available magnetic forces.<br>
      <br>
      A still further object of the present invention is to provide an
      electromagnetic engine having one or more electromagnets which
      when activated exert substantially axial magnetic forces.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The problems of the prior art are overcome by the present
      invention which provides an electromagnetic reciprocating type of
      engine having a number of new and unique features not previously
      known or used. In the illustrated embodiment, thirty-six
      piston-cylinders radially arranged are connected to a crankshaft.
      Each cylinder having a connecting rod integrally connected thereto
      is pivotally attached to the crankshaft. The cylinder is provided
      with a stepped internal cylindrical opening which is closed at the
      connecting rod end and open at the other end. A soft iron plate is
      positioned within the cylinder up against the step therewithin,
      the plate is spring loaded so as to maintain its position against
      the step. An electromagnet is fitted within the open end of the
      cylinder and is pivotally attached to a supporting structure
      surrounding the cylinders. In operation, each electromagnet is
      progressively activated for ten degrees of crankshaft rotation.
      Activation occurs when the free end of the electromagnet is in
      close proximity to the iron plate and when the connecting rod is
      at a right angle to the eccentric arm of the crankshaft. A unique
      override arrangement allows the cylinder to reciprocate while the
      piston remains stationary.<br>

        <br>
      </b><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Referring now to FIG. 1 of the drawings, there is depicted therein
      a thirty-six cylinder engine having a radial configuration. There
      are twelve banks of cylinders, three cylinders per bank. Each bank
      of cylinders is staggered or offset by ten degrees relative to the
      next bank of cylinders. Other engine configurations, such as one
      having four banks of nine cylinders each is equally suitable. The
      engine 10 is an electromagnetic engine in that it utilizes
      electrical energy to produce magnetic forces which forces are then
      uniquely converted into a mechanical output.<br>
      <br>
      Engine 10 as depicted utilizes a support structure the design of
      which is not critical to the operation of the invention. A
      substantially cylindrical shell 11 having end plates 12 and 13
      comprises such a support structure. Other shapes and designs of
      structures well known in the art may be alternatively used without
      departing from the intent and objectives of the present invention.
      For convenience, end plates 12 and 13 may be bolted to shell 11 at
      the adjoining flanges thereof. A journaled crankshaft 14 is
      supported within shell 11 at end plates 12 and 13 and extends
      therethrough. Collars 15 and 16 axially retain crankshaft 14 at
      end plates 12 and 13. A flywheel 17 is attached to crankshaft 14
      and is retained thereon in suitable fashion. Brackets or supports
      18 may be welded to shell 11 so that the engine 10 can be mounted
      on a base or to a vehicle frame.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, three electromagnet piston-cylinders
      20, 20', and 20" are shown attached to crankshaft 14.
      Piston-cylinder 20 includes an articulated or master connecting
      rod 21, the circular portion 19 of which is pivotally connected to
      the throw 34 of crankshaft 14. Connecting rods 21' and 21" are
      pivotally connected to circular portion 19 of master connecting
      rod 21. Brackets 22 attached to shell 11 provide for pivotally
      attaching the pistons 27 to the engine support structure.<br>
      <br>
      The details of piston-cylinders 20, 20', and 20" are more clearly
      shown in FIG. 2. Piston-cylinder 20 is at a position representing
      the beginning of a power stroke; piston-cylinder 20' is at a
      substantially top dead center position; while, piston-cylinder 20"
      is slightly before a bottom dead center position. Each
      piston-cylinder assembly comprises a cylinder 23, a piston or
      electromagnet 24, a circular plate 25, and a spring 26. Cylinder
      23 consists of a cylindrical body portion 27 and a bottom portion
      28 which are bolted together. Air vent holes 29 and 30 are
      provided in bottom portion 28 and in body portion 27,
      respectively. A stepped concentric opening is bored in cylinder
      23. Bore diameter 31 is slightly smaller than bore diameter 32,
      the junction of which results in a step or ledge 33. The length of
      bores 31 and 32 are consistent with the length of electromagnet 24
      and the stroke of the engine 10 as determined by the rotational
      diameter of throw 34 and master rod 21. Bore 31 is always in
      contact with some portion of the outer diameter of piston 24
      throughout the engine stroke.<br>
      <br>
      A low friction sliding fit exists between piston 24 and bore 31 of
      cylinder 23. Circular plate 25 is made from close-grained soft
      white iron or other like material which does not retain magnetism.
      A low friction sliding fit also exists between plate 25 and bore
      32. The normal position of plate 25 is up against step 33 and is
      maintained in this position by spring 26. Spring 26 is a
      relatively light coil spring which needs only to exert sufficient
      force to lift the weight of plate 25.<br>
      <br>
      A typical electromagnet or piston 24 is shown in cross section in
      FIG. 3. Piston 24 is provided with an arm 40 extending axially
      from casing 41 to support bracket 22. An appropriate pin 42 is
      used to pivotally connect arm 40 to bracket 22. Casing 41 has an
      annular groove 43 provided therein and within which groove 43
      suitable electrical windings 44 are provided. An opening 45 in the
      top end of casing 41 allows for ingress and egress of electrical
      conductors 46 and 47 which are connected to each end of electrical
      windings 44 for the purpose of supplying electrical power to
      windings 44. FIG. 3 also depicts one way to attach arm 40 to
      casing 41. The method shown is a simple shouldered threaded
      connection 48. Other suitable methods of connection well known in
      the art may be alternatively used. Casing 41, like plate 25, is
      made from close-grained soft white iron or other like material
      which does not retain magnetism.<br>
      <br>
      Conductor 47 of windings 44 of electromagnet 24 is connected by a
      screw 50 to shell 11 which provides a common ground for the
      windings 44 of all thirty-six electromagnets 24 in the engine 10.
      The other conductor 46 of winding 44 of electromagnet 24 is routed
      through an opening 51 in shell 11 to a distributor 52 which is
      schematically depicted in FIG. 4. Distributor 52 is connected to a
      battery 53 or other like power source which is adapted to provide
      a flow of current at the proper voltage through windings 44.sub.1
      -44.sub.36 to cause sequential operation of the electromagnets 24.<br>
      <br>
      In FIGS. 1 and 2, a circular plate 54 is shown connected to shell
      11 at each piston-cylinder 20 location. Plate 54 allows for access
      to the piston-cylinders 20 and the associated components for
      purposes of assembly and maintenance.<br>
      <br>
      The operation of the inventive engine 10 will now be described. It
      is first to be noted that the pull of an electromagnet varies as a
      function of the area of the holding surface multiplied by the
      square of the flux density divided by a constant. Also, that the
      flux density increases as the distance to the holding surface
      decreases. Hence, changes in the flux density is the greatest
      contributor to the pulling force of an electromagnet. Experiments
      conducted by the inventor have shown that an electromagnet powered
      by two "D" cell batteries can produce a holding force of 500
      pounds and that the magnetic attraction force varies with the
      distance between the surface of the electromagnet and the item to
      be lifted. It was found, that at a distance of one-eighth of an
      inch, the force is approximately 7.8 pounds; at a distance of
      approximately one-twelfth of an inch the force is 31 pounds; at a
      distance of approximately one/twenty-fourth of an inch the force
      is 125 pounds; and, as stated, at contact, the force is 500
      pounds. Thus, a usable force begins when the distance is
      one-eighth of an inch and increases rapidly thereafter.<br>
      <br>
      The inventive apparatus illustrated and described herein utilizes
      a piston stroke of one-eighth of an inch--corresponding to a
      crankshaft rotation of ten degrees. Hence, each of the thirty-six
      piston-cylinders 20 fires or produces a power stroke during each
      rotation of crankshaft 14. FIG. 2 shows the piston-cylinder 20 at
      a position where electromagnet 24 is spaced approximately
      one-eighth of an inch away from plate 25 with the latter being
      firmly held against ledge 33 by spring 26. When the angle between
      the centerline of throw 34 and the centerline of rod 21 is
      approximately 85.degree., electromagnet 24 is energized. At this
      point in the sequence of operation, no other electromagnet is
      energized. Hence, the pull by electromagnet 24 is substantially
      normal to the centerline of piston-cylinder 20. Furthermore, the
      pulling force is at a substantially right angle to the throw 34 of
      crankshaft 14. In this manner, maximum torque is being exerted
      upon crankshaft 14. Electromagnet 24 pulls plate 25 up towards the
      face 60 of electromagnet 24. In so doing, cylinder 23 and
      connecting rod 21 are also pulled upwards which in turn rotates
      crankshaft 14. The pulling force continues for a crankshaft angle
      of ten degrees at which time the face 60 of electromagnet 24 is in
      contact with the face of plate 25. Distributor 52 then cuts off
      the electricity to electromagnet 24 and energizes the next
      electromagnet-cylinder combination which is substantially at a
      right angle to its crankshaft throw arm. The procedure repeats
      itself for each of the thirty-six electromagnet-cylinder
      combinations for each crankshaft rotation.<br>
      <br>
      A unique aspect of the present invention is the override feature
      of the piston-cylinders 20. This is accomplished by allowing
      electromagnet 24 to pivot but otherwise be restrained. The
      cylinder 23 moves up and down relative to a pivoting but otherwise
      stationary piston (electromagnet 24). This may be seen by
      referring to FIG. 2. As previously stated, the position of
      piston-cylinder 20 is at the initiation of the power stroke. The
      faces of plate 25 and electromagnet 24 are separated by
      approximately one-eighth of an inch which corresponds to the
      beginning of the high end of the attractive force produced by
      electromagnet 24. At the end of ten degrees of crankshaft rotation
      (clockwise), the faces of plate 25 and electromagnet 24 are in
      contact with each other. Continued crankshaft rotation for
      approximately 90.degree. causes cylinder 23 and electromagnet 24
      to move axially inward relative to each other (actually only
      cylinder 23 moves axially, electromagnet 24 pivots on bracket 22).
      Even though no electric power is being supplied to the
      electromagnet 24, circular plate 25 is still in contact with
      electromagnet 24 and begins to move downward relative to cylinder
      23 toward bottom portion 28. Spring 26 is compressed to a maximum
      at this point. This is partially shown by referring to
      piston-cylinder 20" in FIG. 2. After approximately 270.degree. of
      crankshaft rotation, piston-cylinder 20 will achieve a top dead
      center position. That is, when piston 24 and cylinder 23 are fully
      extended away from each other. This may be approximately
      visualized by referring to the position of piston-cylinder 20' in
      FIG. 2. After another 90.degree. of crankshaft rotation,
      piston-cylinder 20 is again at the beginning of another power
      stroke. It is again to be noted that during the above-described
      360.degree. of rotation of crankshaft 14, each of the thirty-six
      piston-cylinders will have undergone a power stroke corresponding
      to 10.degree. of crankshaft rotation. In this manner, an
      electromagnetic engine producing an amount of power never before
      achieved results.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 illustrates an alternative to the use of spring 26. In this
      embodiment, a latch 65 is used to hold plate 25 up against ledge
      33 of cylinder 23. Piston 23 is slightly magnetic while plate 25
      is a weak permanent magnet or, vice versa, in this embodiment.
      Latch 65 is pivotally connected to a boss 66 attached to cylinder
      23. Spring 67 maintains the position of latch 65 as it is shown in
      FIG. 5, with plate 25 being retained against ledge 33 by plate
      retainer portion 70. A cutout 68 in the wall of cylinder 23
      provides room for the pivoting action of latch 65. When the piston
      or electromagnet 24 moves downward relative to cylinder 23, the
      lower edge of piston 24 contacts the trip portion 69 of latch 65
      causing the same to be pivoted away from cylinder 23 thereby
      releasing plate 25 and allows the initiation of a power stroke.
      The magnetic properties of plate 25 and piston 24 cause the plate
      25 to remain attached to piston 24 after the completion of the
      power stroke. Plate 25 is still so attached until 180.degree. of
      crankshaft rotation is achieved, at which point plate 25 contacts
      ledge 33 causing separation of plate 25 from piston 24. When
      piston 24 clears trip portion 69, the plate retainer portion 70
      rotates back under plate 25 again retaining the same up against
      ledge 33. As an alternative, to retain plate 25 against piston 24,
      plate 25 is made from a magnetic material and electromagnet 24 is
      energized by a low voltage during the override portion of the
      stroke.<br>
      <br>
      In a still further embodiment of the present invention, the spring
      26 of FIG. 2 and the latch 65 of FIG. 5 may be both dispensed
      with. In this embodiment either plate 25 or ledge 33 comprise a
      permanent magnet with the other being made from a magnetic
      material. Face 60 of piston 24 must also be either magnetized or
      made from a magnetic material. In this manner plate 25 will either
      be retained against ledge 33 or attached to face 60 of piston 24
      depending upon the relative positions of plate 25, cylinder 23 and
      piston 24.<br>

            using air as fuel</b></big><b><br>
        </b></div>
      <br>
      Inventor from the town of Nikolaev, Ukraine Vitaly Frolov
      developed the engine using air as fuel. <br>
      <br>
      The inventor says this engine can ruin some powerful corporations.
      For 15 years the inventor offered to manufacturers this engine
      based on compressed air.&nbsp; But the Scientific Council of the
      USSR rejected the project because manufacturing this engine could
      result in closure of<br>
      dozens of research institutes working on power-saving
      technologies. <br>
      <br>
      The machine by Ferdinand Porsche became prototype for this engine,
      but the inventor used compressed air instead of fuel. Under the
      air pressure engine pistons move and start the machine, ICTV
      reports. <br>
      <br>
      According to Vladimir Frolov, there will be no need of
      transmission for the vehicle or reversing gear, the vehicle will
      have only two rods - forward and backwards. Exhausts in such a
      vehicle are more environment-friendly. <br>
      <br>
      The engine by Vitaly Frolov was granted the award by Soviet
      Exhibition of National Economy Achievements, in 1986 the inventor
      received 600 roubles of Gorbachev"s ward for winning the contest
      for designing environment friendly vehicle. The new engine was
      going to be used in Antonov planes, and 300 engines for
      experimental planes were produced. However, Soviet leaders
      rejected this engine.<br>
      <br>
      Ukrainian industrialists are expressing interest to Frolov"s
      engine. Vladimir Timoshenko, the engineer of Yuzhmash branch said,
      "There are no analogies to the engine in the world, and these
      machines have the highest efficiency - they consume less electric
      power, are compact in size and have little weight. One can receive
      maximum profit with minimum expenses".<br>

      <br>
      In the September 4th edition of South Africa’s Mining Weekly, in a
      report entitled&nbsp; “SA mulls cost and benefits of mega solar
      project,” South Africa’s Eskom power utility is about to build a
      100 MW solar thermal electric generating plant, using the “power
      tower” design (see our post “Solar Thermal Power” which describes
      design options). <br>
      <br>
      In the report, Eskom’s resources and strategy division
      renewable-energy corporate specialist Dr Louis van Heerden
      explained that “central-receiver technology … concentrates the
      sun’s energy through multiple large mirrors, using the
      concentrated thermal energy to produce steam to drive a
      conventional steam turbine for electricity generation.<br>
      <br>
      The energy concentration is achieved by a field of large
      sun-tracking mirrors (called heliostats), which reflect the
      sunlight to a receiver, mounted on a central tower in the middle
      of the mirror field.<br>
      <br>
      A heat-transfer medium (molten salt) is pumped through the
      receiver, absorbing the highly-concentrated radiation reflected by
      the heliostats. The heated fluid is then circulated through a heat
      exchanger, where the thermal energy is used to generate steam and
      power a turbine.”<br>
      <br>
      South African solar doesn’t end there.&nbsp; Back on February 11th
      in “Photovoltaics are the Wild Card” we referenced a report from
      South Africa on breakthrough photovoltaics.&nbsp; In this earlier
      story ”SA solar research eclipses rest of the world” by Willem
      Steenkamp, they report “In a scientific breakthrough that has
      stunned the world, a team of South African scientists, led by
      Professor Vivian Alberts, has developed a revolutionary new,
      highly efficient solar power technology” and “The South African
      solar panels consist of a thin layer of a unique metal alloy that
      converts light into energy.”<br>
      <br>
      The photo-responsive alloy can operate on virtually all flexible
      surfaces. The new panels are approximately five microns thick (a
      human hair is 20 microns thick) while the older silicon panels are
      350 microns thick.&nbsp; Alberts claims the cost of the South
      African technology is a fraction of the cost for less effective
      silicon solar panels.”<br>
      <br>
      This claim is corroborated in today’s story in the South Africa
      Mining Weekly, where alongside the report about Eskom’s solar
      thermal project there is this:&nbsp; “The University of
      Johannesburg’s Professor Vivian Alberts, from the department of
      physics, has developed solar panels that may just take this
      technology further into the main-stream, owing to the cost
      reductions he has achieved.<br>
      <br>
      Alberts’ invention is five micro-metres thick, combining several
      semiconductor materials which are as effective, if not more so,
      than silicon.&nbsp; As it uses no silicon, costs are dramatically
      lower. It makes use of normal window glass as a substrate, with
      molybdenum applied as back contact, followed by the core
      component, being a compound semiconductor comprising five elements
      - copper, indium, gallium, selenium and sulphide, replacing the
      silicon - with cadmium sulphide as a buffer layer, followed by an
      intrinsic zinc oxide layer and, finally, a conductive zinc-oxide
      layer.&nbsp; The most expensive part of the panel is the glass,”
      said Alberts.<br>
      <br>
      The pilot plant has shown the production cost per watt to be less
      than one South African Rand (which is about US $0.15), verified
      for a 25-MW production facility, assuming a 10% efficiency and
      average production yield of 85%,” Alberts claimed in the Mining
      Weekly Report.&nbsp; Alberts went on to say he predicted retail
      costs for this locally manufactured photovoltaic panel would be
      one-fifth the current cost of imported panels.<br>
      <br>
      These are very huge claims.&nbsp; So who will be first to market
      with volumes of inexpensive photovoltaics?&nbsp; A South African
      consortium, or Silicon Valley’s own Nanosolar, or someone
      else?&nbsp; Like electric cars, the technology of photovoltaic
      panels is advancing rapidly.&nbsp; They are both transformative
      technologies and they are becoming increasingly economically
      viable.<br>

      When set to music, colon cancer sounds kind of eerie. That's the
      finding of Gil Alterovitz, a research fellow at Harvard Medical
      School who is developing a computer program that translates
      protein and gene expression into music. In his acoustic
      translation, harmony represents good health, and discord indicates
      disease.<br>
      <br>
      At any given time in each of our cells, thousands of genes are
      churning out their molecular products while thousands more lie
      senescent. The profile of which genes are on versus off is
      constantly changing--with specific diseases such as cancer, for
      example.<br>
      <br>
      Searching for a more simplified way to represent the complex
      library of information inherent in gene expression, Alterovitz
      decided to represent those changes with music. He hopes that
      doctors will one day be able to use his music to detect
      health-related changes in gene expression early via a musical slip
      into discord, potentially improving a patient's outcome.<br>
      <br>
      The first step in the gene-to-sound conversion was to pare down
      multiple measurements to a few fundamental signals, each of which
      could be represented by a different note. Together, the notes
      would form a harmonic chord in normal, healthy states and become
      increasingly out of tune as key physiological signs go awry,
      signaling disease.<br>
      <br>
      Alterovitz employed mathematical modeling to determine
      relationships between physiological signals. Much like the various
      systems in an automobile, many physiological signs work in
      synchrony to keep a body healthy. "These signals [are] not
      isolated parts," says Alterovitz. "Like in a car, one gear is
      working with other gears to control, for example, power steering.
      Similarly, there are lots of correlations between physiological
      variables. If heart rate is higher, other variables will move
      together in response, and you can simplify that redundancy and
      information."<br>
      <br>
      Using data collected from a study of protein expression in colon
      cancer, Alterovitz analyzed more than three thousand related
      proteins involved in the disease. He whittled down the thousands
      of proteins to four key networks, using various genetic databases
      that catalog relationships between genes and proteins. He then
      assigned a note to each network, and together, these notes formed
      a harmonic chord. He compared the "music" of normal, healthy human
      data sets to that of the colon-cancer samples and found that,
      according to his model, colon cancer sounded "inharmonious."<br>
      <br>
      Researchers may be able to translate other diseases into music by
      "tuning" the system that Alterovitz has developed. For example,
      researchers can identify protein networks related to the disorder
      of interest and then assign notes that, in combination, form
      inharmonious chords, compared with their healthy counterparts.<br>
      <br>
      He adds that the technique may have applications outside medicine,
      such as for simplifying information for air-traffic controllers,
      and in any other industry that requires analysis of large data
      sets. There is also an opportunity to use protein music purely for
      music's sake: a DJ in the Boston area has expressed interest in
      playing Alterovitz's "music" in local bars--a potential revenue
      stream for musician and mathematician alike.<br>

      DC electrostatic motors, with a measured efficiency of over 99%,
      were built at MIT by Professor John Trump.,and described in the
      Jan. 1947 meeting of the American Institute of Electrical
      Engineers.<br>
      <br>
      Dr.Trump was the main gov't official, that went over Tesla's
      secret papers , after his death in 1943.<br>
      <br>
      At the time, the well known electrical engineer, was serving as a
      technical aide to the Nat'l Defense Research Committee of the
      Office of Scientific Research &amp; Development.<br>
      <br>
      He was askd to participate in the examination of Tesla's papers at
      the Manhattan Warehouse &amp; Storage Co.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Trump reported afterwards, that no examination had been made
      of the vast amount of Tesla's property, that had been in the
      basement of the New Yorker Hotel, ten years prior to Tesla's
      death, or of any of his papers, except those in his immediate
      posession at the time of his death.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Trump concluded in his report, that there was nothing that
      would constitute a hazard in unfriendly hands.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. John G. Trump, evidently used Tesla's ideas and incorporated
      them into his motors, after WW11, as Tesla's knowledge of
      radioactivity and his views were well known since the days of
      radium, and Madam Curie<br>
      <br>
      The motors resemble the variable capacitors used in tuning a radio
      set, except the rotors can spin around continuously, instead of
      intermeshing with a stationary plate, to tune in a station. In the
      simplest version, a radioactive isotope coated plate emits beta
      rays (electrons) in a vacuum, between two ordinary plates of metal
      on a shaft.<br>
      <br>
      The electrons fly out at high speeds and strike the surrounding
      metal plates, thus endowing them with a negative charge.<br>
      <br>
      The charge builds up until the uncoated plates reach a voltage
      corresponding to the kinetic energy of the electrons. If the
      electrons are ejected from the isotope with a speed corresponding
      to a million volts, they would be able to fly to the opposite
      plate in the face of a field of a million volts.<br>
      <br>
      In the simplest fashion an electric load is connected to the
      coated and uncoated plates to run some kind of DC motor.<br>
      <br>
      (Visualize the Tesla Turbine, as an analogy, invented in the early
      1900's as an analogy, modernized )<br>
      <br>
      The atomic electricity motors are built into a vacuum enclosed
      container, and operate at extremely high voltages. There are no
      magnetic fields, and no heavy currents that cause the ordinary
      kind of loses encountered in electric motors of conventional
      design.<br>
      <br>
      This is a DC, brushless motor.<br>
      <br>
      One motor of this kind can be driven by a beta-ray generator, and
      the whole apparatus can be enclosed into one vacuum cannister and
      run from a radioactive isotope that would be immediately converted
      into mechanical energy.<br>
      <br>
      This mechanical system can be used to drive machinery, or operate
      a type of electrical generator more suitable to present systems of
      power distribution<br>
      <br>
      This means that the direct conversion of nuclear power into
      electronic power, using the electrons from the nucleus, rather
      than those of from it's outer orbits, which has been the immediate
      source of all our electric power up to the present time.<br>

      </div>
      A West Australian inventor believes he has developed a way to
      generate electricity for homes using wind power.<br>
      <br>
      Graeme Attey of Fremantle designed the concept which uses a
      modular wind turbine that is small enough to sit on a the roof of
      house.<br>
      <br>
      Mr Attey says his modular wind turbine is about a metre in length
      and half a metre in height, and creates power using blades which
      are rotated by the wind.<br>
      <br>
      He says the system can also be used in conjunction with solar
      panels.<br>
      <br>
      "Between solar and wind it's very easy actually to drive a whole
      house."<br>
      <br>
      Mr Attey believes a home could generate extra power to then feed
      back to the electricity grid.<br>
      <br>
      The West Australian Government is helping Mr Attey fund his trials
      and says it will consider offering householders a rebate to
      install the system when it's released onto the market some time
      next year. <br>

        <b>A New Technique for Viewing the Aura</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Back in the&nbsp; mid 70's, I was asked to design equipment to be
      used in locating the Lost Hall of Records associated with the Giza
      Complex of the Great Pyramids.<br>
      <br>
      An amateur archeologist in Omaha where I lived at the time had
      translated some ancient Eqyptian documents. One of the documents
      told of how the&nbsp; Hall would&nbsp; be&nbsp; found in the
      future. It said the records, which detailed many of the&nbsp;
      ]lost secrets of the hows and why's of pyramid construction, would
      be found by a type of energy they radiated.<br>
      <br>
      From my experience with the research of Wilhelm Reich, I instantly
      recognized the type of energy radiation described&nbsp; in those
      ancient texts. It was a perfect description of Orgone Energy, the
      life force or Bio-Energy surrounding all living things.<br>
      <br>
      Only this was&nbsp; a&nbsp; more&nbsp; concentrated&nbsp; form of
      the energy.&nbsp; It even described aspects of Orgone that had not
      been previously described. For example, it described light as
      waves upon the&nbsp; water, but this energy was like water
      currents BENEATH the surface.<br>
      <br>
      It even went on to say how this energy was CONCENTRATED in
      DISK-SHAPED fields around planets and accounted for the rings
      around planets (and this was thousands of years before the
      discovery of planetary rings!)<br>
      <br>
      Anyway, I successfully constructed a number of devices to detect
      the orgone. Unlike Reich, I&nbsp; had&nbsp; the&nbsp; advantage of
      being able to work with more advanced&nbsp; technologies,
      like&nbsp; Field&nbsp; Effect&nbsp; Transistors (FET's) instead of
      vacuum tubes.<br>
      <br>
      After several months, my job was done. I had created several small
      detectors capable of detecting orgone or life energy at a distance
      of 10 meters. From the description of the Hall of Records
      energies, the energies put out by the Hall would be MUCH STRONGER
      and easier to detect. Unfortunately, the group&nbsp;
      intending&nbsp; to go to Egypt did not get the financing needed
      for their trip.<br>
      <br>
      The weird thing is that no one seemed to care about the life
      energy detection devices I had made. They became a toy to amuse
      myself and my friends and not much more, until a few years ago.<br>
      <br>
      Again a technological&nbsp; breakthrough enabled me to use the
      techniques I had already used to take the process one step
      further.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks to computer imaging processes, new types of CCD's (charge
      coupled detectors that can image different types of&nbsp;
      electromagnetic fields), and high frequency, high voltage
      induction devices (nothing new - they were pioneered nearly a
      century ago by Tesla), I was able to get STUNNING images of the
      AURA.<br>
      <br>
      At first, the images were quite crude, but in time they got
      better. Now I can image the aura and the CHAKRA'S (spinning&nbsp;
      vortices of energy located from the tip of the spine to the top of
      the head, they are 7 in number and control different types of
      energy within the body). These Chakra's show up&nbsp; in&nbsp;
      FULL COLOR with exposures of less than 15 seconds.<br>
      <br>
      I have also imaged other odd things including what one might&nbsp;
      call ghosts, and points and spheres of light that so far I have
      not figured out.<br>
      <br>
      I am sharing some of these images here on CompuServe, perhaps
      someone knows where the project should be taken from this point.<br>
      <br>
      In one of the images, the woman is trying to astral project,
      you'll notice her aura&nbsp; shifted&nbsp; from&nbsp; it's normal
      position around her body and afterwards she described being&nbsp;
      outside&nbsp; herself - but not very&nbsp; far.<br>
      <br>
      What should I do now? I am currently successfully working on
      another aspect of this work to enhance the aura. I have included a
      before and after picture of my friend Leon before and after this
      enhancement process.<br>
      <br>
      Leon is a Reiki Master and told of a tremendous&nbsp;
      increase&nbsp; in his healing powers for several days after the
      enhancement. &nbsp;<br>

      CHUCK SHRAMEK,<br>
      HOUSTON, TEXAS<br>
      71227.201@compuserve.com<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Vangard Notes....</b><br>
      <br>
      On Wednesday, July 1st, I had the&nbsp; distinct&nbsp; pleasure of
      speaking with Chuck Shramek. Chuck works as a newscaster&nbsp; for
      a Houston radio station and is an active Ham and shortwave radio
      operator. He has been experimenting with&nbsp; electronics for
      over 20 years and has 5 computers, several radio systems, scopes
      and numerous other lab equipment.<br>
      <br>
      Chuck tells me that he began experimenting with Orgone Detectors
      about 20 years ago while studying the research notes of Wilhelm
      Reich. Reich was thrown in prison for what many believe to be a
      conspiracy promoted by the AMA as punishment for his&nbsp;
      successful "cures" of cancer and other diseases using his Orgone
      Box. It it is odd that our government would take further steps
      which included the BURNING OF REICH'S BOOKS to prevent
      dissemination of his research work. This took place in the 1950's,
      what should have been an enlightened time.<br>
      <br>
      At any rate, Chuck got the idea of building a two dimensional
      scanning system which involved&nbsp; the&nbsp; movement&nbsp; of a
      single Orgone detector in an X,Y grid. At each point, the
      intensity of the field was recorded which yielded a tediously
      derived image of the Aura of the body. Chuck said that process
      took at least an hour with the subject lying prone and still on a
      table. The images so derived were of very low resolution.<br>
      <br>
      We discussed the technique and the multiple applications to which
      this infant technology could be applied. In&nbsp; the&nbsp;
      process, I offered my&nbsp; ideas on JUST HOW the images were
      produced since we understood it to have been through the use of a
      video camera.<br>
      <br>
      Those ideas included his mention of an enhancement process which
      stimulated the body. From that, I had assumed from Reich's work
      that the subject sat inside an orgone box which charged his system
      with a high concentration of orgone energy. The subject then stood
      on an electrical plate which allowed the orgone to so modulate the
      corona as to generate the aura image.<br>
      <br>
      Chuck says close but not exactly correct. The process in fact USES
      NO ORGONE detectors. Instead, the subject stands on a metal plate
      that is driven from a Tesla coil.<br>
      <br>
      This coil is fed with a "swept" range of low level microwave
      frequencies that in turn stimulate the body field. The image is
      picked up using a special CCD that is sensitive and tuneable to a
      wide range of frequencies ranging from microwaves to low IR.<br>
      <br>
      Chuck further specified that the images that you see with BOTH the
      visible picture of the subject AND the field are NOT TRUE IMAGES!<br>
      <br>
      This is because&nbsp; the&nbsp; CCD&nbsp; that picks up and
      translates the microwave stimulated fields will NOT PICK up the
      VISIBLE IMAGE ofthe subject. So what you actually see is the image
      of the Aura without a body and the Charkras suspended in space.<br>
      <br>
      To make the true image, the subject is simultaneously videotaped
      with a standard video camera. That visible image is then
      super-imposed on top of the actual aura field to yield the
      composite images that we see.<br>
      <br>
      Chuck says these images are very low resolution (320 X 200) and
      that he has since expanded to VGA standards.<br>
      <br>
      Currently, Chuck is trying to figure out what the glowing spheres
      are that periodically appear in the exposures. Note the exposures
      take about 15 seconds each, so there is great room for improvement
      towards a movie type system.<br>
      <br>
      Also in regard to Reich, in his papers regarding work with BIONS,
      Reich reports that they emit some kind of UV&nbsp; radiation&nbsp;
      that resulted in burning of the eyes and in fact would tan tissue
      that was exposed&nbsp; to&nbsp; the BION emanations. This is quite
      possibly due to a very high concentration of Orgone energy which
      leads one to the conclusion that a human body could be so charged
      that it would emit a high degree of such UV radiation and so be
      detectable by solid state imaging techniques.<br>
      <br>
      Yet another related detector is the Sergeyev life field detector
      as mentioned in the book, Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron
      Curtain. These detectors could sense the presence of living
      tissues (human) for a distance of up to 100 feet and through
      walls. A physicist friend&nbsp; of ours from Washington says that
      several years ago, the Nielsen company (does TV ratings) made a
      public announcement of a new method of getting the overall
      response of a crowd to a new TV show.<br>
      <br>
      This friend said that a detector (or array of such) was placed in
      another room and directed to monitor the audience response to a
      new show or program. It was far superior to the old rating system
      that required a checksheet, because it directly monitored the
      emotional state of the crowd in a composite fashion.<br>
      <br>
      We also know of many people who believe that a reliable and
      reproducible method of detecting the aura would lead to advanced
      medical diagnostic techniques. Since it is believed that the body
      is controlled and fed by an energy meridian system, then there
      would be areas of greater or lesser energy that would result in an
      imbalance. Such an imbalance would&nbsp; alter&nbsp; the function
      of the organ under its influence, leading to illness or
      dysfunction. Such a system would allow instant targeting of such
      an area and show in a direct way, what effect acupuncture or such
      energy flow modification techniques produce.<br>
      <br>
      Ron even&nbsp; suggested&nbsp; the imaging of someone at the point
      of death to try to capture whatever leaves the&nbsp; body. This
      would really shake up religions worldwide and open many doors into
      research into communicating&nbsp; with discarnate entities. And of
      course, one could capture images of paranormal events that
      currently&nbsp; are quite difficult if not impossible to achieve.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, much more verification of this work needs to be done.<br>

      <br>
      All you need to do is figure out where the little buggers are
      coming in at, and sprinkle a baby powder firewall. Ants that are
      already in your house will lose their scent trail, get lost, and
      eventually die; ants that are trying to come into your house won't
      be able to crest the mountain of white.<br>
      <br>
      Just as an aside, I've also made this work with lemon-scented
      cleaner; apparently ants hate that lemony fresh smell. What are

      I've heard of using laundry detergent powder, Comet cleanser,
      cinnamon and/or cinnamon sticks, peppermint oil, bay leaves,
      chalk, black pepper &amp; cayenne pepper, ammonia, vinegar, a
      50/50 combination of Windex &amp; Ivory soap spray, mint or
      cinnamon chewing gum.... But my favorite is Cream of Wheat: after
      the ants eat it, it expands, causing their stomachs to "explode."<br>

      BadgerKyle says:<br>
      I use the Windex method . . . just spray a little right near the
      wall that they are walking up (or coming from), and they die. The
      windex kills them (maybe it drowns them?) and the smell keeps them
      from finding their way back to their home! Plus, you get the added
      bonus of a clean floor (Windex does clean them a bit).<br>

      I can tell you that listerine does not in fact work. The ants stop
      as they try to walk through it, but if you are lazy and don't pick
      them up, they just spring back to life like a frat boy on a late
      sunday afternoon. Also everybody thinks you really like creme de
      menthe, and it really doesn't stop the ants.<br>

      RLH says:<br>
      Okay, so this isn't "natural" but you should run (not walk) to the
      store and buy some Terro. It's essentially sugar water with Borax
      so the ants eat up, take the excess back to the nest, and share
      the food, whereby they all eventually die. You just put a few
      drops on small pieces of (supplied) cardboard and set it where the
      ants are wandering. The great advantage here is that you don't
      need to isolate the entry point, just let them come. The one
      downside is that once the ants spread the word about limitless
      puddles of sugar water to their friends, the infestation actually
      increases for about a day (you can't refill the puddles fast
      enough) but then they stop coming. Occasionally you have to repeat
      in 5-7 days--I guess it's the next generation of ants that have
      hatched--but after that they are gone for good. (Note: this only
      works on the very small so-called "sugar ants".)<br>

      I make a "firewall" with hair gel and use it to plug the hole.

      Mix some mustard with some powdered bleach, and put some on the
      ground (on a napkin or something). They eat it because of the
      mustard, but they die because of the bleach. It's ingenious.<br>

      Most "Ant Powder" is the same diatomaceous earth (or "D.E.",
      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomaceous_earth) that's used for
      pool filtration. It works by dehydrating the little buggers, and
      can also be used to clean up spills (though care should be taken
      when handling, i.e. gloves and dust mask. It can do a number on
      your lungs.)<br>

      Borax works great for fleas as well...just sprinkle on the carpet,
      work it in by rubbing with your hand or something more convenient,
      let it sit for a week, then vaccuum. The only downside is that the
      fleas go nuts for the first day or so as they try to find a way to
      escape from it.<br>

      Any kind of cleaner with bleach (like 409) works pretty well. It
      kills and repels at the same time, but I'm might try some of these
      other tactics as well.<br>

      DE - diatomaceous earth, doesn't dehydrate the ants, on a
      microscopic level it's basically like millions of tiny razor
      blades that stick to ants' (or fleas', or spiders') bodies and
      tear them to shreds (pretty grusome, huh?). Great for spreading
      around outside if you can find the anthill, but I wouldn't use it
      in the house with pets or small kids around.<br>
      Windex works because it desolves the waxy coating on the ants'
      bodies and causes them to be unable to retain moisture. They
      basically die of thirst. It also wipes out the trails they leave
      and use to guide other ants to whatever food or water source
      they've found. Vinegar works the same way. So will Lysol.<br>
      <br>
      I've tried the piles of cinnamon, pepper and other organic and
      mostly harmless compounds and they only work if the ants don't
      find an alternate route into the house.<br>

      I've had good success with a 1:1 mix of powdered (icing) sugar and
      powdered borax. Ants are also allergic to cucumber peel, and black
      pepper sprinkled at their entry points discourages them as well.<br>

      This will kill all bugs period, and it will do it fast! You
      probably don't have to be brand specific but I've never tried any
      others as I have had complete success with this:<br>
      CITRUS MAGIC (CM)!! It's an air freshener made from concentrated
      citrus oils (oranges, lemons, grapefruits, etc...). It clings to
      the insect and permeates any exoskeleton, membrane or wax it is
      using for defense. It kills bugs (any kind of bug, and never
      leaves survivors) far faster than Raid (which often seems like
      just a nuissance to bugs) and I had much experience with Raid when
      I lived in Texas - i've seen roaches lay there and wriggle for a
      good half hour before dying and some run away and you're never
      sure if they did die. CM has none of that! Best of all it is not
      harmful to us mammals (as long as you keep it out of your eyes and
      mucous membranes) and leaves a great scent in the air!<br>

      Good tip, but an even less messy tip is a spray bottle filled
      50/50 with water/rubbing alcohol. This will kill them fairly
      quickly and leave no residue, stronger mixes seem to kill quicker.
      Granted it may not be as good a deterrent as the baby powder.<br>

      Pour a packet or two in the corner or by a nest. Moisten a little
      for fire ants, put in a few drops of apple juice for those little
      kitchen ants.<br>

      Too many comments to read them all, but I've tried the
      malt-o-meal, flour, etc. It doesn't work with Texas Fire Ants.
      I've had "piss ants", carpenter ants, and fire ants for more than
      15 years and I cannot find anything that works. (However, the area
      of my yard is four acres.) After four-ish years in college and
      getting my degree in wildlife and fisheries from a univerity that
      has extensive research in fire ants, I''ve found that the best
      defense is a product called "over and out". (mostly for fire ants,
      after you get rid of them you don't care about the others.) If you
      live in an area that will support lavender plants, plant them
      around; it's a natural insect repellant. Fire ants like air
      conditioners, as I came to expensively realize.... I did some
      research with fire ants in college, it's hard to shut them down.
      I've found between the Orkin man, over and out, and lavender I've
      been pretty lucky. If you're lucky enough to not have fire ants, I
      would recommend diotomacious(sp?) earth. If you line your flower
      beds with that you're good. It's absolutely natural and the way it
      works is that it has microscopic animals called diatoms, which
      have sharp points on their carcasses, which cut up the insect's
      exoskeletons and they cannot breathe/live/play reindeer games.
      Your dog can eat a handful and he'll only have an upset stomach,
      (assuming your dog is as big as mine - 70lbs. smaller dogs, I
      assume not so much.) But it works. If you want to get rid if
      ants/wasps/bees (all the same family, hymenoptera) I recommend
      that you get in contact with an entomologist. You will then forget
      all of these "wive's tales" and find out what exactly you need,
      (depending where you live and in what conditions.) I've found that
      if you contact an entomology professor anywhwere they will talk
      your ear off. Ymmv. But as you well know being a "consumerist"
      commenter, you're going to find the info on the web to back you
      up. I'll give you this to start: www.fireant.tamu.edu<br>
      If any of this info is in error, I will find you the appropriate
      info, just let me know.<br>

      <br>
      A former Chrysler Canada worker has designed and patented what he
      says is the "perfect solution" to the gasoline crisis -- an
      electromagnetic piston motor that will eliminate our dependence on
      oil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.<br>
      <br>
      Michael Axford, who holds a Mexican patent on the invention and is
      in the process of acquiring another in Canada, said his invention
      eliminates gas tanks, fuel lines and a vehicle's exhaust system,
      while retaining all the remaining service parts.<br>
      <br>
      "You just turn the key and away you go," said Axford. "A centre
      spool in the cylinder head is wrapped with copper coils. When a
      driver turns the key, the battery sends voltage to the coil --
      which then becomes an electromagnet -- instead of to the spark
      plugs and the magnet drives the pistons."<br>
      <br>
      Michael Axford is developing an electromagnetic engine and is
      close to finishing a prototype.View Larger Image View <br>
      <br>
      Axford acknowledges there are similar products in various stages
      of development, but says only his uses magnets of identical
      polarity so that the pistons are driven down into the cylinders
      with a pulse of magnetic energy. The pistons travel just 31/2
      inches and Axford said the electromotive force is sufficient to
      drive them all the way through the cylinder.<br>
      <br>
      "And mine just uses a repelling motion to drive the pistons rather
      than a combination of repelling and attraction," which often
      causes problems in the delivery of power, said Axford.<br>
      <br>
      "Electromagnets are strong enough to pull trains, so there's no
      issue with them being strong enough to drive the pistons," said
      Axford, who has been working on his project since he took a buyout
      from Chrysler 15 months ago.<br>
      <br>
      But the idea has its skeptics.<br>
      <br>
      A professional engineer, who declined to have his name published,
      said "I don't really see how this can work because you can't get
      more energy out of something than you put into it, otherwise
      you're dealing with a perpetual motion machine. I also don't think
      there's enough charge in these batteries to drive the magnets. But
      Mike's best chance is to get one built and prove that it can work,
      I guess."<br>
      <br>
      But Axford said "it should perform identically to existing
      engines. It will idle at 500 r.p.m. so once the gear is engaged,
      you'll have immediate roll. It won't react with a delay and a
      jerky motion like a golf cart.<br>
      <br>
      "All the blocks used in this engine will be aluminum so they're
      not magnetic and the cylinder head and the electromagnets will
      have a protective cover so they don't affect the vehicle's
      electronic systems," said Axford.<br>
      <br>
      "And because the system pulses just like a sparkplug, there's no
      constant drain on the battery."<br>
      <br>
      Axford, who doesn't have an engineering degree but is a
      self-profess car buff&nbsp; recently completed a patent process in
      Mexico, using a law firm based in Merida. And now that paperwork
      is complete he intends to use it to apply for a patent in Canada.<br>
      <br>
      "I had it done in Mexico because it's far less expensive and so
      far, this effort has all been self-funded," said Axford.<br>
      <br>
      Axford now plans to retro-fit a motor from a Saturn once he takes
      delivery of some magnetic discs from a manufacturer in China. When
      the retrofitted prototype is complete, Axford said he'll be in a
      position to stage demonstrations and plans to drive the vehicle
      across Canada to prove its reliability.<br>
      <br>
      In the meantime, he's pursuing government grants to help fund the
      demonstration, to build another non-retrofitted prototype and find
      somewhere to begin limited production.<br>
      <br>
      Axford said he plans to seek licencing and royalty agreements with
      the Big 3 domestic automakers once the engine has been
      field-tested and validated.<br>
