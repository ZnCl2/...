            ...The very same banks that created the last economic crisis
            have now created a 278 TRILLION dollar derivatives nuclear
            time bomb that could tear down the American economy in
            single and unannounced moment.<br>
            <br>
            Much of this article deals with the blatant corruption of
            Wells Fargo, however, they are just the tip of the icebeg.<br>
            <br>
            Interestingly and tragically, Wells Fargo appears to be a

            Compared to the rest of them, Wells Fargo looks extremely
            prudent and rational.”<br>
            <br>
            In the case of&nbsp; The County of Ramsey and the County of
            Hennepin, v. MERCORP Holdings, Inc., Mortgage Electronic
            Registration Systems., et al.,&nbsp; the two counties, on
            behalf of eighty-seven Minnesota counties, filed a
            class-action suit alleging that the Lenders’ use of&nbsp;
            MERS System deprived the Counties of recording fees for
            mortgage assignments by allowing parties to bypass
            recordation with the Counties causing the loss of statutory
            recording fees and creating gaps in chains of title. <br>
            The counties assert that they are being denied revenue from
            the failure to file each and every home mortgage following a
            sale. <br>
            More importantly, this practice leaves homeowners, who may
            be current on their mortgage payments or may have totally
            paid off their home mortgage, to being vulnerable to having
            their home seized because they might be paying the “wrong”
            mortgage company.&nbsp; <br>
            In other words, America, when you write out your mortgage
            check, you cannot be sure that the company that you are
            writing the check to really holds the note to your home.<br>
            <br>
            Ray Charles could see that this practice is wholly illegal
            and fraudulent. EVERY SINGLE HOMEOWNER IN AMERICA IS NOW
            VULNERABLE TO THIS HEINOUS PRACTICE!<br>
            <br>
            The Eighth Circuit also declined to certify a question to
            the Minnesota Supreme Court as requested by the Counties of
            Minnesota. The Circuit Court erroneously ruled that, “ …
            because we believe Minnesota case law establishes that
            Minnesota law imposes no duty to record a mortgage or a
            mortgage assignment with the county recorder…”<br>
            <br>
            This is where the ruling gets interesting and casts the
            court in the light of being a criminal accomplice after the
            fact. The Circuit Court amazingly cited a number of
            Minnesota Court cases interpreting the Recording Act that
            find that recording is permissive. (See e.g., Jackson v.
            MERS). The Court proclaimed that the district court held
            that the wording “shall be recorded” in the Recording Act
            does not require recordation of land transfers, but instead
            informs parties where they should record their instrument if
            they desire the benefits of recording the security
            instrument, namely providing notice of the lien and its
            priority. In other words, it is now legal to steal and to
            commit conspiracy in hiding the fact that the bank/title
            company is engaged in theft.<br>
            <br>
            To add insult to injury, the Eighth Circuit held that a
            county did not and cannot state a claim for unjust
            enrichment or public nuisance against MERS “when there is no
            duty under state law to record mortgages or subsequent
            assignments.” In other words, it is legal for MERS and their
            related criminal enterprise organization are permitted to
            reap benefits from this criminal racketeering system.<br>
            <br>
            Understandably MERS was thrilled with the ruling; “We did
            not believe the claims behind this case had merit,” said
            MERSCORP Holdings Vice President for Corporate
            Communications, Janis Smith. “The appellate court’s ruling,
            once again, confirms the legality of MERS and its
            business.”&nbsp; Legal to steal? Thank you Ms. Smith, you
            are setting a fine example for your friends and children
            with your twisted view of ethics, morality and justice.<br>

          7. Loop Wheel<br>
        </b>Bike riders will know that riding on bumpy roads with
        potholes or going up a curb will cause some discomfort -- Same
        goes for wheelchair owners and folding bike aficionados. But
        that may change with Loop wheels, an innovative, shock-absorbing
        wheel that has a looping suspension springs integrated within
        the wheel itself. The result: a smoother ride with less
        vibration, with less road noise.<br>
        <b><br>
          6. Omni Crawler<br>
          <br>
        </b>At Innovation Japan 2011, a research group from Osaka
        University presented Omni-Crawler, a crawler that can be driven
        in all directions. The group also presented the Omni-Ball, a
        ball-shaped, omni-directional wheel the principals of which are
        implemented in the crawler.<br>
        <b><br>
          5. Liddiard Wheels<br>
          <br>
        </b>Canadian inventor William Liddiard has designed
        revolutionary new omni-directional wheels that allow a car to
        move in all directions and even turn on the spot. They are not
        commercially available yet, but it probably won’t be long before
        they are.<br>
        <br>
        While omni-directional wheels have been around for a while, such
        as the Mecanum wheel, Liddiard says these are the first that
        don’t require the body of an auto or forklift to be built around
        them, but rather can be bolted on to a vehicle.<br>
        <b><br>
          4. Honda U<br>
          <br>
        </b>The Honda U3-X uses Honda’s proprietary balance control
        technology and the world’s first omni-directional driving wheel
        system (Honda Omni Traction Drive System),<br>
        which makes possible the same freedom to move forward, backward,
        laterally and diagonally that people enjoy when walking.<br>
        <b><br>
          3. Geo-Orbital Wheel<br>
        </b><br>
        The only part that is attached separately from the wheel is a
        simple thumb activated throttle, which is easily clipped onto
        your handlebar.<br>
        <br>
        The Panasonic 36V removable Lithium-Ion battery (with a built in
        USB outlet for charging your electronics) provides a pedal
        assisted range of up to 50 miles per-battery (up to a 30 mile
        range for the 26 inch wheel). With little to no pedaling you
        will go up to 20 miles on a single battery (up to 12 miles for
        the 26 inch wheel). The more you choose to pedal the more range
        you can expect, and you can always take a spare battery with you

          2. Mecanum Wheels<br>
          <br>
        </b>The Mecanum wheel is a design for a wheel which can move a
        vehicle in any direction. It is sometimes called the Ilon wheel
        after its Swedish inventor, Bengt Ilon, who came up with the
        idea in 1973[1] when he was an engineer with the Swedish company
        Mecanum AB.<br>
        <br>
        It is a conventional wheel with a series of rollers attached to
        its circumference. These rollers typically each have an axis of
        rotation at 45° to the plane of the wheel and at 45° to a line
        through the centre of the roller parallel to the axis of
        rotation of the wheel.<b><br>
          <br>
          1. Shark Wheel<br>
          <br>
        </b>The small contact patch and low friction of the Shark Wheel
        allows slides to initiate easily. Also, the Shark Wheel has
        multiple edges grabbing instead of a traditional wheel’s one
        edge for added control.<br>
        <br>
        The Shark Wheel has about 30% less friction than traditional
        wheels and get up to speed very quickly. The Shark Wheel shape
        enables you to maintain grip with its wide footprint.<br>
        <br>
        Traditional wheels have one center point, while the Shark Wheel
        has multiple center points, allowing the Shark Wheel to take
        longer to wear off center. The Shark Wheel wears very evenly
        over time<b><br>

          Sabre Engine<br>
        </b><br>
        The makers of the Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine (SABRE)
        have secured the necessary funding to fire up their hardware by
        2020.<br>
        <br>
        The SABRE engine is designed to use jet propulsion to power an
        aircraft from standing to five times the speed of sound in the
        atmosphere. The engine then switches to rocket mode, which could
        push it to speeds of Mach 25 – nearly 20,000 miles per hour –
        easily enough to get into orbit.<br>

          Free Piston Engine<br>
        </b><br>
        Free-piston engine is a linear, 'crankless' internal combustion
        engine, in which the piston motion is not controlled by a
        crankshaft but determined by the interaction of forces from the
        combustion chamber gases, a rebound device and a load device.<br>
        <br>
        The purpose of all such piston engines is to generate power. In
        the free-piston engine, this power is not delivered to a
        crankshaft but is instead extracted through either exhaust gas,
        pressure driving a turbine, through driving a linear load such
        as an air compressor for pneumatic power, or by incorporating a
        linear alternator directly into the pistons to produce
        electrical power.<b><br>
          <br>
          5 Stroke Engine<br>
        </b><br>
        The engine concept, which was invented by Gerhard Schmitz, has
        been developed. Two overhead camshafts operate the conventional
        coil spring valve gear with the HP camshaft running at 0.5 x
        crank speed and the LP camshaft running at 1 x crank speed. The
        engine is also turbocharged to increase the engine rating.<br>
        <b><br>
          Duke Engine<br>
        </b><br>
        The Duke engine is an axial design, meaning that it's five
        cylinders encircle the drive shaft and run parallel with it. The
        pistons drive a star-shaped reciprocator, which nu-tates around
        the drive shaft, kind of like a spinning coin coming to rest on
        a table.The Duke engine is an Advanced Internal Combustion
        Engine<b> </b>delivering high Thermodynamic Efficiency,
        complete Fuel Flexibility, (runs on any suitable spark ignition
        fuel), Neglible 1st and 2nd order Vibration with huge Weight and
        Size savings.<br>
        <b><br>
          Nissan DIG-T R<br>
          <br>
        </b>The ultralight DIG-T R 1.5 liter, three-cylinder petrol
        engine is small enough to fit in carry-on luggage and boasts a
        power-to-weight ratio better than the engine of a Formula 1
        racer.<br>
        <br>
        As part of the design strategy, both the petrol and electric
        parts of the powerplant go through the same five-speed gearbox.<br>
        The DIG-T R’s base engine is 500 mm tall x 400 mm long x 200 mm
        wide, but it puts out power like a fire hose at 400 hp! Ya thats
        right this tiny 3 cylinder engines is putting out up to 400hp!<b><br>
          <br>
          Huttlin Kugelmotor<br>
          <br>
        </b>The Hüttlin is designed to supplement the electrical power
        of a hybrid car. The prototype Hüttlin that's been making the
        rounds produces about 104 horsepower, but unlike a traditional
        gasoline engine, Dr. Hüttlin claims the design is easy to scale
        to suit almost any power need. It's built from just a fraction
        of the parts of a traditional engine. which helps achieve the
        goals of efficiency and economy, since there are fewer parts to
        produce and assemble. That means, in part, that the Hüttlin
        achieves more than 30 percent efficiency. Traditional engines,
        by comparison, achieve only about 20 percent efficiency. Think
        about that next time you fuel up.<br>
        <b><br>
          Freevalve Engine<br>
          <br>
        </b>The FreeValve concept, also known as fully variable valve
        actuation, offers the unique ability to have independent control
        of the intake and exhaust valves. For any engine load criteria,
        the timing of intake and exhaust can be independently
        programmed. The system can then “decide” based on driving
        conditions which one to use to maximize performance or minimize
        fuel consumption and emissions. This allows a greater degree of
        control over the engine which in turn provides significant
        performance benefits. <br>

        <b>Abstract<br>
          <br>
        </b>DNA generates a longitudinal wave that propagates in the
        direction of the magnetic field vector. Computed frequencies
        from the structure of DNA agree with those of the predicted
        biophoton radiation. The optimization of efficiency by
        minimizing the conduction losses leads to the double-helix
        structure of DNA. The vortex model of the magnetic scalar wave
        not only covers many observed structures within the nucleus
        perfectly, but also explains the hyperboloid channels in the
        matrix when two cells communicate with each other. Potential
        vortexes are an essential component of a scalar waves, as
        discovered in 1990. The basic approach for an extended field
        theory was confirmed in 2009 with the discovery of magnetic
        monopoles. For the first time, this provides the opportunity to
        explain the physical basis of life not only from the biological
        discipline. Nature covers the whole spectrum of known scientific
        fields of research, and interdisciplinary understanding is
        required to explain its complex relationships. The
        characteristics of the potential vortex are significant. With
        its concentration effect, it provides for miniaturization down
        to a few nanometers, which allows enormously high information
        density in the nucleus. With this first introduction of the
        magnetic scalar wave, it becomes clear that such a wave is
        suitable to use genetic code chemically stored in the base pairs
        of the genes and electrically modulate them, so as to
        "piggyback" information from the cell nucleus to another cell.
        At the receiving end, the reverse process takes place and the
        transported information is converted back into a chemical
        structure. The necessary energy required to power the chemical
        process is provided by the magnetic scalar wave itself.<b><br>

        <b><br>
        </b>Scientists have long pondered why we sleep. Despite being
        nearly ubiquitous across the animal kingdom, the exact role of
        slumber remains an open question. While multiple studies suggest
        that, in both rodents and humans, it helps consolidate
        previously learned memories, the question of whether new
        information can be learned while snoozing has yet to be
        answered. A study published today (August 8) in Nature
        Communications reports that the sleeping brain can learn new
        information, but only during rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep, the
        stage when dreams typically occur.<br>
        <br>
        "One of the most interesting results of the current study is
        that the encoding of sensory memory is specific to certain sleep
        stages," Thomas Schreiner, a postdoctoral researcher at Radboud
        University in the Netherlands who did not take part in the work,
        writes in an email to The Scientist. "While the authors made
        first steps in characterizing the neural circumstances of
        learning during sleep, clearly more research is needed to
        clarify the neural underpinnings of those processes."<br>
        <br>
        To assess people's ability to learn during sleep, researchers
        played various acoustic patterns embedded in white noise to
        participants while they slept. "We decided to use [white noise]
        because it was a good example of something very complex . . .
        and we were interested in seeing whether such complex automatic
        learning could be performed during sleep," says study coauthor
        Thomas Andrillon, who conducted this work as a doctoral student
        in Sid Kouider's lab at the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Paris.<br>

        Andrillon and colleagues monitored 20 healthy human subjects
        during sleep using electroencephalography (EEG),
        electrooculography (EOG), and electromyography (EMG). Throughout
        the night, the researchers introduced a number of novel sound
        sequences during wakefulness, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep,
        and non-REM sleep. The next morning, the team tested the
        participants' ability to identify the acoustic patterns they had
        heard during various sleep stages.<br>
        <br>
        "We saw increased performance . . . for sounds that were
        presented exclusively in REM sleep compared to new ones,"
        Andrillon says. "But where it becomes very exciting is. . . we
        saw that participants were worse at detecting the repetitions in
        the sound that they heard during non-REM sleep, compared to
        novel items."<br>
        <br>
        Upon further analysis of the participants' EEG signals during
        sleep, the team found brain waves characteristic of learning
        during the lighter stages of non-REM sleep, which were absent
        during the deeper phases of non-REM sleep-suggesting that
        learning suppression was specific to this stage.<br>
        <br>
        Andrillon says that the results could help resolve two different
        theories of sleep's role in memory.<br>
        <br>
        On one hand, some scientists believe that sleep helps actively
        strengthen memories. This theory is based on the observation
        from multiple studies, mostly in rodents, showing that the
        sleeping brain fortifies memories by reactivating the network of
        neurons that were involved in learning the task the previous
        day.<br>
        <br>
        Others, however, have posited that sleep helps maintain
        homeostasis by freeing up the brain's limited resources. These
        researchers hypothesize that snoozing helps the brain forget by
        diminishing synaptic connections, causing weak links to
        disappear, and allowing only the strongest associations to
        remain.<br>
        <br>
        "These two views are largely opposing, and the novel
        contribution of this study is that it basically says it's
        neither downscaling nor strengthening, but it's both,
        [depending] on the brain state," says Christoph Nissen, a
        professor at the University Clinic of Psychiatry and
        Psychotherapy at the University Psychiatric Services Bern in
        Switzerland, who was not involved in the study.<br>
        <br>
        Jan Born, a neuroscientist at the University of Tübingen in
        Germany who also did not take part in this research, points out
        that while this study provides convincing evidence that people
        can learn new information during REM sleep, presenting acoustic
        stimuli to someone while they sleep might alter their sleep
        states, meaning that "you can't be sure that it's really
        [during] REM sleep that the brain is learning, or if it's a kind
        of local wake-state that the brain goes into."<br>
        <br>
        While this study provides evidence that novel information can be
        learned during sleep, Andrillon points out that this does not
        mean we can learn more complex stimuli while catching our Z's.<br>
        <br>
        "So far, we cannot tell whether this can be applied to other
        types of memories that may be more interesting, such as learning
        a new language," he says. While other studies have found that
        humans can be conditioned to associate tones with odors during
        sleep, most studies to date find that the slumbering brain is
        unable to learn more complex memories, such as facts and events.<br>
        <br>
        "[This study] could have broader implications, especially in
        this new endeavor to manipulate sleep," Andrillon says,
        referencing the recent surge in devices companies have developed
        to record, and in some cases, alter, sleeping habits. However,
        he adds, "I think it's very important to first understand the
        complexity of it."<br>

          Abstract<br>
          <br>
        </b>Sleep and memory are deeply related, but the nature of the
        neuroplastic processes induced by sleep remains unclear. Here,
        we report that memory traces can be both formed or suppressed
        during sleep, depending on sleep phase. We played samples of
        acoustic noise to sleeping human listeners. Repeated exposure to
        a novel noise during Rapid Eye Movements (REM) or light non-REM
        (NREM) sleep leads to improvements in behavioral performance
        upon awakening. Strikingly, the same exposure during deep NREM
        sleep leads to impaired performance upon awakening.
        Electroencephalographic markers of learning extracted during
        sleep confirm a dissociation between sleep facilitating memory
        formation (light NREM and REM sleep) and sleep suppressing
        learning (deep NREM sleep). We can trace these neural changes
        back to transient sleep events, such as spindles for memory
        facilitation and slow waves for suppression. Thus, highly
        selective memory processes are active during human sleep, with
        intertwined episodes of facilitative and suppressive
        plasticity...<br>

        </b>...We should not be surprised that google is opposed to free

        the NSA and CIA to expand unconstitutional spying on everyone
        everywhere and to suppress independent and dissenting thought
        and expression.<br>
        <br>
        For example, on July 31, the World Socialist Web Site reported
        that “Between April and June, Google completed a major revision
        of its search engine that sharply curtails public access to
        Internet web sites that operate independently of the corporate
        and state-controlled media. Since the implementation of the
        changes, many left wing, anti-war and progressive web sites have
        experienced a sharp fall in traffic generated by Google
        searches. The World Socialist Web Site has seen, within just one
        month, a 70 percent drop in traffic from Google.” [
        https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2017/07/31/goog-j31.html ]<br>
        <br>
        Writing in Global Research, Graham Vanbergen lists 13 websites
        arbitrarily branded by Google as fake news or conspiracy sites
        whose readership Google has managed to reduce between 19 and 67
        percent:<br>
        <br>
        * wsws.org fell by 67 percent<br>
        * alternet.org fell by 63 percent<br>
        * globalresearch.ca fell by 62 percent<br>
        * consortiumnews.com fell by 47 percent<br>
        * socialistworker.org fell by 47 percent<br>
        * mediamatters.org fell by 42 percent<br>
        * commondreams.org fell by 37 percent<br>
        * internationalviewpoint.org fell by 36 percent<br>

        * wikileaks.org fell by 30 percent<br>
        * truth-out.org fell by 25 percent<br>
        * counterpunch.org fell by 21 percent<br>
        * theintercept.com fell by 19 percent<br>
        <br>
        It is completely obvious that none of these sites are fake news
        or conspiracy sites. These sites are under Google censorship
        because they question the official lies that are used to control
        the explanations given to the people. With the print and TV
        media and NPR under its control, the ruling oligarchy is now
        moving to shut down all Internet explanation that differs from
        the official lies that are used to keep people firmly locked in
        The Matrix.<br>
        <br>
        Google is a monopoly. Before monopolists turned US anti-trust
        legislation such as the Sherman Act into dead-letter laws,
        Google would have been broken up. Today Google is protected not
        only by the demise of anti-trust laws, but also by its
        usefulness to the US Police State. Without Google’s active
        cooperation, it would not be possible for the NSA to complete
        its total spy network, a network that serves not national
        defense but suppression of dissent from the agendas of the
        ruling oligarchy.<br>
        <br>
        Google abuses its power in many ways. For example, Wikileaks
        reports that among the Podesta email leaks, there is one from
        Google’s Eric Schmidt to Cheryl Mills offering Google’s ability
        to spy on Americans to help the Democrats win the presidential
        election.

        <br>
        Apparently, Google has chosen to be a monster committed to
        upholding lies and ideologies in the place of truth. Unless
        another country with the courage to stand up to Washington
        creates a rival search engine, truth will disappear from the
        face of the earth.<b><br>

        </b>The big New York banks no longer perform the banking
        function of lending to consumers and businesses. <br>
        <br>
        Thanks to government policies that foster increased financial
        concentration, banking incentives have changed fundamentally.
        The big banks today are focused on higher risk-return
        speculation and on trading and fee-based income.<br>
        <br>
        Banks don’t lend not because, as banks and their lobbys claim,
        of new capital requirement rules, but because their ability to
        lend is foreclosed by the fact that the big banks pay out all or
        more than all of their net income in dividends and buy-backs of
        their own stocks in order to drive up executives’ bonuses. The
        extraordinary payouts of earnings leave the banks’ capital
        position too weak to support more lending.<br>

        </b>...McCain.&nbsp; McCain is the epitome of the reason that
        term limits should be placed upon representatives.&nbsp; McCain
        is the prime example of why a Special Investigative Unit is
        needed.&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; Champion McCain, just coming off of
        the deck from brain surgery in the 13th round, to score a
        knockout against the American people?&nbsp; Who lined his
        pockets?&nbsp; Who?&nbsp; Was it the insurance companies, or was
        it Soros?&nbsp; Where do we find the individuals who will not be
        bought to investigate this matter?<br>
        <br>
        We will never be allowed to have such special personnel to
        investigate a matter such as McCain’s “vote”: this is because
        the people are not in charge.&nbsp; We are ruled, not governed.<br>
        <br>
        McCain was the one who orchestrated the ousting of the duly
        elected President of Ukraine, Yanukoyvich, who was elected under
        Ukrainian Constitutional law.&nbsp; Is that in itself not a
        violation of the Logan Act?&nbsp; Oh, but since McCain and
        company were acting on behalf of the American people as their
        elected officials, it’s all well and good, then.<br>
        <br>
        McCain is part of the bigger picture, and look at the titanic
        struggle that has already transpired for clarification: the
        struggle between the establishment to impose an individual
        mandate, and the public to resist it.&nbsp; The vote?&nbsp; It
        is scripted at this point.<br>
        <br>
        McConnell and Ryan all “ooh’s” and “aah’s” with the Don
        Adams/Agent 86 line: “Missed it by that much!”<br>
        <br>
        Wrong.&nbsp; They didn’t miss a beat.&nbsp; All of the Congress
        (in this latest vote…the word “vote,” what a joke) with a final
        tally of 49-51…making it appear to be a close one.&nbsp; They
        only did it that way to not unseat half of Congress (Republican
        or not), and the Republicans who voted to repeal could point at
        it, “They voted to repeal”…when the failed vote was a done deal
        long before it came to the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp; McCain did his job
        for the Establishment, and he’ll be on his way out of the Senate
        to retire soon enough…. andvoila!&nbsp; The individual mandate
        remains.<br>
        <br>
        The individual mandate is the prize they have fought for more
        than 100 years.&nbsp; They will not relinquish that stranglehold
        from the throat of the American people.&nbsp; The steppingstone
        to a single-payer system, the individual mandate assures that
        you will be accountable to the State whether you are a housewife
        or a homeless beggar.<br>
        <br>
        Of course, Congress, the Administration, the Courts, and the
        rest of the Politburo are exempt from the individual mandate,
        now, aren’t they?<b><br>

        <b><br>
        </b>A 19th century American novelist’s work is attracting more
        notice in 2017 than it did in his day because of striking
        similarities to current events.<br>
        <br>
        Ingersoll Lockwood, an attorney and political writer, wrote
        several books, including children’s stories featuring the name
        “Baron Trump.”<br>
        <br>
        baron-trumps-marvelous-underground-journey-600Trump, an
        aristocratically wealthy young man living in Castle Trump, is
        the protagonist of Lockwood’s first two fictional novels, “The
        Travels and Adventures of Little Baron Trump” and “His Wonderful
        Dog Bulgar and Baron Trump’s Marvelous Underground Journey.” The
        little boy, who has an unending imagination and “a very active
        brain,” is bored with his luxurious lifestyle, so he visits
        Russia to embark on an extraordinary adventure with “the master
        of all masters,” a man named Don. President Donald Trump’s
        youngest son’s name is “Barron.”<br>
        <br>
        Before leaving for Russia, Baron Trump is told his family’s
        motto is: “The pathway to glory is strewn with pitfalls and
        dangers.” In Russia, he is in search of the entrance to a
        pathway into alternative dimensions.<br>
        <br>
        Ironically, Lockwood’s final novel arrived in 1896, titled “The
        Last President.”...<b><br>

              Oliver Stone slams ‘dumb’ US sanctions against Russia</b></font><br>
          <b>Fred Thornhill / Reuters</b><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        US film director Oliver Stone has written a scathing Facebook
        post over Washington's passage of the Russia sanctions bill. He
        suggested that US intelligence agencies aren't doing their job
        and are misleading the public in the "false-flag war" against
        Moscow.<br>
        <br>
        The post, which Stone titled 'Mid-Summer Anger,' begins by
        slamming Congress for passing the bill.<br>
        <br>
        "I guess 'American Exceptionalism' includes the vast stupidity
        inherent in having two giant oceans to distance us from the rest
        of humanity," he wrote.<br>
        <br>
        "With all the Apples and Microsofts and computer geniuses we
        have in our country, can we not even accept the possibility that
        perhaps our intelligence agencies are not doing their job, and
        maybe, just maybe, are deliberately misleading us to continue
        their false-flag war against Russia?<br>
        <br>
        "Or for that matter, that Russia itself may not be that invested
        in screwing up our vaunted democracy with such sloppy malware as
        claimed?"<br>
        <br>
        He pointed to a "strong statement" put out by the Veteran
        Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS), a group of former
        US intelligence officers are challenging the assessment that
        Russia hacked the Democrats during the 2016 presidential
        election. <br>
        <br>
        Why would he fake it?': Oliver Stone responds to allegations
        Putin showed him 'wrong' Syria video<br>
        <br>
        Referring to a report issued by VIPS, Stone said that "with this
        report alone...much less the overt lying and leaking that’s been
        going on, both James Clapper (‘We don’t do surveillance on our
        own citizens’) and John Brennan (‘Drones and torture? None of
        our business) should be investigated as thoroughly as Michael
        Flynn, Jared Kushner, Trump’s son, etc." <br>
        <br>
        Stone also slammed the 'Brennan-Clapper Report' which was given
        to former President Barack Obama in January, during his final
        days in office.<br>
        <br>
        The report claimed that US spies cited intercepted
        communications between Russian officials who called Trump’s
        victory a geopolitical success for Russia, as evidence of
        Russian interference. It also said that US intelligence
        identified the ‘go-betweens’ who allegedly handed over stolen
        Democratic Party emails to WikiLeaks. <br>
        <br>
        He went on to accuse those in Washington of not thinking
        independently, and instead blindly relying on mainstream media.<br>
        <br>
        "Somebody out there in DC, please explain to me this omission of
        common sense. Are the Washington Post and the New York Times so
        powerful that no one bothers to read or think beyond them? It
        seems the TV stations in this country take their copy from
        them."<br>
        <br>
        Stone said he hopes Europe can "independently judge and discard"
        the sanctions against Russia, which "are as dumb as giving out
        medals to Generals who keep losing wars."<br>
        <br>
        The renowned film director went on to accuse Congress, the
        media, and the military-industrial complex of "literally dying"
        for a war.<br>
        <br>
        "I now fully realize how World War I started. People in power
        never really thought it would happen, and when it did, thought
        it’d be over in weeks. You should know the rest of that history.
        It doesn’t end well," Stone concluded.<br>

        forces is clear long overdue and yet also politically
        impossible. Right now the US armed forces are the bizarre result
        of the Cold War, the “war on the cheap” years and of failed
        military interventions. In theory, the US should begin by
        deciding on a new national security strategy, then develop a
        military strategy in support of this national security strategy,
        followed by the development of a military doctrine which itself
        would then produce a force modernization plan which would affect
        all aspects of military reform from training to force planning
        to deployment. It took the Russians over a decade to do this,
        including a lot of false starts and mistakes, and it will take
        the Americans at least as long, or even more...<br>

        <b><br>
        </b>The trouble, of course, is that even after the Deep State
        (a.k.a. “The Swamp”) succeeds in quicksanding President Trump,
        America will be left with itself — adrift among the cypress
        stumps, drained of purpose, spirit, hope, credibility, and,
        worst of all, a collective grasp on reality, lost in the fog of
        collapse.<br>
        <br>
        Here’s what you need to know about what’s going on and where
        we’re headed...<br>
        <br>
        The underlying issue is the scale of human activity in our time.
        It has exceeded its limits and we have to tune back a lot of
        what we do. Anything organized at the giant scale is headed for
        failure, so it comes down to a choice between outright collapse
        or severe re-scaling, which you might think of as managed
        contraction. That goes for government programs, military
        adventures, corporate enterprise, education, transportation,
        health care, agriculture, urban design, basically everything.
        There is an unfortunate human inclination to not reform, revise,
        or re-scale familiar activities. We’ll use every kind of duct
        tape and baling wire we can find to keep the current systems
        operating, and we have, but we’re close to the point where that
        sort of cob-job maintenance won’t work anymore, especially where
        money is concerned.<br>
        <br>
        Why this is so has been attributed to intrinsic human brain
        programming that supposedly evolved optimally for short-term
        planning. But obviously many people and institutions dedicate
        themselves to long-term thinking. So there must be a big
        emotional over-ride represented by the fear of letting go of
        what used to work that tends to disable long-term thinking. It’s
        hard to accept that our set-up is about to stop working —
        especially something as marvelous as techno-industrial society.<br>
        <br>
        But that’s exactly what’s happening. If you want a chance at
        keeping on keeping on, you’ll have to get with reality’s
        program. Start by choosing a place to live that has some
        prospect of remaining civilized. This probably doesn’t include
        our big cities. But there are plenty of small cities and small
        towns out in America that are scaled for the resource realities
        of the future, waiting to be reinhabited and reactivated. A lot
        of these lie along the country’s inland waterways — the Ohio,
        Mississippi, Missouri river system, the Great Lakes, the Hudson
        and St. Lawrence corridors — and they also exist in regions of
        the country were food can be grown.<br>
        <br>
        You’ll have to shift your energies into a trade or vocation that
        makes you useful to other people. This probably precludes jobs
        like developing phone apps, day-trading, and teaching gender
        studies. Think: carpentry, blacksmithing, basic medicine,
        mule-breeding, simplified small retail, and especially farming,
        along with the value-added activities entailed in farm
        production. The entire digital economy is going to fade away
        like a drug-induced hallucination, so beware the current
        narcissistic blandishments of computer technology. Keep in mind
        that being in this world actually entitles you to nothing. One
        way or another, you’ll have to earn everything worth having,
        including self-respect and your next meal.<br>

        <div align="center"><b>By Justin Gardner</b><br>

        <b><br>
        </b>In January 2016 we reported on a scientific analysis finding
        that by 2050, there will be more plastic in the oceans than
        fish. Right now, one garbage truck of plastic is being dumped
        into the ocean every minute.<br>
        <br>
        This disturbing reality is underscored by the recent discovery
        of another giant patch of plastic—bigger than Mexico—floating in
        the South Pacific Sea. It was discovered by Captain Charles
        Moore, who found the North Pacific Garbage Patch in 1997.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A team of scientists has confirmed the
        existence of another ocean garbage patch, this time in a remote
        area of the South Pacific. Unlike the famous patch in the
        northern Pacific Ocean, which has long been one of the world’s
        most recognizable symbols of pollution, the new patch is in an
        area that had previously been largely unstudied.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The high degree of plastic pollution was
        uncovered by captain Charles Moore and his team of volunteer
        researchers on a six-month voyage: ‘We discovered tremendous
        quantities of plastic. My initial impression is that our samples
        compared to what we were seeing in the North Pacific in 2007, so
        it’s about ten years behind,’ said Moore, who has worked to
        raise awareness about plastic pollution since he stumbled across
        the North Pacific patch while captaining a racing yacht in the
        1990s. Moore says the southern patch could be as big as a
        million square kilometers, 1.5 times the size of Texas.<br>
        <br>
        The size is estimated by collecting samples along transects
        crossing the study area. This is only the second time plastic
        pollution has been studied in this remote area, with the first
        sampling done in 2011. Not much plastic was found in the single
        transect sampled in 2011, but the latest, more comprehensive
        study—involving many transects over multiple months—reveals that
        the South Pacific Gyre has quickly become yet another symbol of
        the plastic problem.<br>
        <br>
        The South Pacific plastic patch is comprised mostly of

          Abstract<br>
          <br>
        </b>The occurrence of microplastics (MPs) in saltwater bodies is
        relatively well studied, but nothing is known about their
        presence in most of the commercial salts that are widely
        consumed by humans across the globe. Here, we extracted MP-like
        particles larger than 149?µm from 17 salt brands originating
        from 8 different countries followed by the identification of
        their polymer composition using micro-Raman spectroscopy.
        Microplastics were absent in one brand while others contained
        between 1 to 10?MPs/Kg of salt. Out of the 72 extracted
        particles, 41.6% were plastic polymers, 23.6% were pigments,
        5.50% were amorphous carbon, and 29.1% remained unidentified.
        The particle size (mean?±?SD) was 515?±?171?µm. The most common
        plastic polymers were polypropylene (40.0%) and polyethylene
        (33.3%). Fragments were the primary form of MPs (63.8%) followed
        by filaments (25.6%) and films (10.6%). According to our
        results, the low level of anthropogenic particles intake from
        the salts (maximum 37 particles per individual per annum)
        warrants negligible health impacts. However, to better
        understand the health risks associated with salt consumption,
        further development in extraction protocols are needed to
        isolate anthropogenic particles smaller than 149?µm.<br>

              long-lasting energy </b></font><br>
        </div>
        <b><br>
        </b>Scientists have discovered a way to convert nuclear waste
        into radioactive black diamond batteries which last more than
        5,000 years.<br>
        <br>
        Researchers at the University of Bristol have found a means of
        creating a battery capable of generating clean electricity for
        five millennia, or as long as human civilization has existed.<br>
        <br>
        Scientists found that by heating graphite blocks – used to house
        uranium rods in nuclear reactors – much of the radioactive
        carbon is given off as a gas.<br>
        <br>
        This can then be gathered and turned into radioactive diamonds
        using a high-temperature chemical reaction, in which carbon
        atoms are left on the surface in small, dark-colored diamond
        crystals.<br>
        <br>
        These man-made diamonds produce a small electrical charge when
        placed near a radioactive source.<br>
        <br>
        The radioactive diamonds are then encased safely within a layer
        of non-radioactive diamond. The surface of a complete diamond
        emits less radiation than a banana.<br>
        <br>
        The Bristol scientists have already created a working diamond
        battery from nickel-63, a radioactive isotope more stable than
        carbon-14, which is prevalent in nuclear waste.<br>
        <br>
        They will create their first carbon-14 batteries in the New
        Year.<br>
        <br>
        “There are no moving parts involved, no emissions generated and
        no maintenance required, just direct electricity generation,”
        said Tom Scott, Professor in Materials at the University of
        Bristol Interface Analysis Centre.<br>
        <br>
        “By encapsulating radioactive material inside diamonds, we turn
        a long-term problem of nuclear waste into a nuclear-powered
        battery and a long-term supply of clean energy.”<br>
        <br>
        A diamond battery containing 20g of carbon-14 would deliver a
        small electrical charge of 300 joules per day. By contrast, an
        AA battery outputs 14,000 joules per day.<br>
        <br>
        Scientists at NASA are reportedly interested in using the
        technology in space flight, while tech firms could incorporate
        the batteries into smaller, internet-enabled devices.<b><br>

          will show only those earthquakes greater than magnitude 6.5,
          the smallest earthquake size known to make a tsunami. Finally
          it will only show those earthquakes with magnitudes of
          magnitude 8.0 or larger, the “great” earthquakes most likely
          to pose a tsunami threat when they occur under the ocean or
          near a coastline and when they are shallow within the earth
          (less than 100 km or 60 mi. deep).<br>
          <br>
          This time period includes some remarkable events. Several
          large earthquakes caused devastating tsunamis, including 9.1
          magnitude in Sumatra (26 December 2004), 8.1 magnitude in
          Samoa (29 September 2009), 8.8 magnitude in Chile (27 February
          2010), and 9.0 magnitude off of Japan (11 March 2011). Like
          most earthquakes these events occurred at plate boundaries,
          and truly large events like these tend to occur at subduction
          zones where tectonic plates collide. Other, much smaller
          earthquakes also occur away from plate boundaries such as
          those related to volcanic activity in Hawaii or those related
          to wastewater injection wells in Oklahoma.<br>

        <b><br>
        </b>Documents released in US cancer litigation show Monsanto’s
        desperate attempts to suppress a study that showed adverse
        effects of Roundup herbicide – and that the editor of the
        journal that retracted the study had a contractual relationship
        with the company. Claire Robinson reports<br>
        <br>
        Internal Monsanto documents released by attorneys leading US
        cancer litigation show that the company launched a concerted
        campaign to force the retraction of a study that revealed toxic
        effects of Roundup. The documents also show that the editor of
        the journal that first published the study entered into a
        contract with Monsanto in the period shortly before the
        retraction campaign began.<br>
        <br>
        The study, led by Prof GE Séralini, showed that very low doses
        of Monsanto’s Roundup herbicide had toxic effects on rats over a
        long-term period, including serious liver and kidney damage.
        Additional observations of increased tumour rates in treated
        rats would need to be confirmed in a larger-scale
        carcinogenicity study.<br>
        <br>
        The newly released documents show that throughout the retraction
        campaign, Monsanto tried to cover its tracks to hide its
        involvement. Instead Monsanto scientist David Saltmiras admitted
        to orchestrating a “third party expert” campaign in which
        scientists who were apparently independent of Monsanto would
        bombard the editor-in-chief of the journal Food and Chemical
        Toxicology (FCT), A. Wallace Hayes, with letters demanding that
        he retract the study...<b><br>

          Abstract<br>
          Background<br>
          <br>
        </b>The health effects of a Roundup-tolerant NK603 genetically
        modified (GM) maize(from 11% in the diet), cultivated with or
        without Roundup application and Roundup alone (from 0.1 ppb of
        the full pesticide containing glyphosate and adjuvants) in
        drinking water, were evaluated for 2 years in rats. This study
        constitutes afollow-up investigation of a 90-day feeding study
        conducted by Monsanto in order to obtain commercial release of
        this GMO, employing the same rat strain and analyzing
        biochemical parameters on the same number of animals per group
        as our investigation. Our research represents the first chronic
        study on these substances, in which all observations including
        tumors are reported chronologically. Thus, it was not designed
        as a carcinogenicity study. We report the major findings with 34
        organs observed and 56 parameters analyzed at 11 time points for
        most organs.<br>
        <b><br>
          Results<br>
          <br>
        </b>Biochemical analyses confirmed very significant chronic
        kidney deficiencies, for all treatments and both sexes; 76% of
        the altered parameters were kidney-related.In treated males,
        liver congestions and necrosis were 2.5 to 5.5 times
        higher.Marked and severe nephropathies were also generally 1.3
        to 2.3 times greater. In females, all treatment groups showed a
        two- to threefold increase in mortality,and deaths were earlier.
        This difference was also evident in three male groups fedwith GM
        maize. All results were hormone- and sex-dependent, and the
        pathological profiles were comparable. Females developed large
        mammary tumors more frequently and before controls; the
        pituitary was the second most disabled organ; the sex hormonal
        balance was modified by consumption of GM maize and Roundup
        treatments.Males presented up to four times more large palpable
        tumors starting 600 days earlier than in the control group, in
        which only one tumor was noted. These results may be explained
        by not only the non-linear endocrine-disrupting effects of
        Roundup but also by the overexpression of the EPSPS transgene or
        other mutational effects in the GM maize and their metabolic
        consequences.<br>
        <b><br>
          Conclusion<br>
          <br>
        </b>Our findings imply that long-term (2 year) feeding trials
        need to be conducted to thoroughly evaluate the safety of GM
        foods and pesticides in their full commercial formulations.<br>

        There is considerable scientific interest in understanding how
        cell assemblies—the long-presumed computational motif—are
        organized so that the brain can generate intelligent cognition
        and flexible behavior. The Theory of Connectivity proposes that
        the origin of intelligence is rooted in a power-of-two-based
        permutation logic (N = 2i–1), producing specific-to-general
        cell-assembly architecture capable of generating specific
        perceptions and memories, as well as generalized knowledge and
        flexible actions. We show that this power-of-two-based
        permutation logic is widely used in cortical and subcortical
        circuits across animal species and is conserved for the
        processing of a variety of cognitive modalities including
        appetitive, emotional and social information. However,
        modulatory neurons, such as dopaminergic (DA) neurons, use a
        simpler logic despite their distinct subtypes. Interestingly,
        this specific-to-general permutation logic remained largely
        intact although NMDA receptors—the synaptic switch for learning
        and memory—were deleted throughout adulthood, suggesting that
        the logic is developmentally pre-configured. Moreover, this
        computational logic is implemented in the cortex via combining a
        random-connectivity strategy in superficial layers 2/3 with
        nonrandom organizations in deep layers 5/6. This randomness of
        layers 2/3 cliques—which preferentially encode specific and
        low-combinatorial features and project inter-cortically—is ideal
        for maximizing cross-modality novel pattern-extraction,
        pattern-discrimination and pattern-categorization using sparse
        code, consequently explaining why it requires hippocampal
        offline-consolidation. In contrast, the nonrandomness in layers
        5/6—which consists of few specific cliques but a higher portion
        of more general cliques projecting mostly to subcortical
        systems—is ideal for feedback-control of motivation, emotion,
        consciousness and behaviors. These observations suggest that the
        brain’s basic computational algorithm is indeed organized by the
        power-of-two-based permutation logic. This simple mathematical
        logic can account for brain computation across the entire
        evolutionary spectrum, ranging from the simplest neural networks
        to the most complex.<br>

            </b></font></div>
        <br>
        Advances in modern electronics has demanded the requisite
        hardware, transistors, to be smaller in each new iteration.
        Recent progress in nanotechnology has reduced the size of
        silicon transistors down to the order of 10 nanometers. However,
        for such small transistors, other physical effects set in, which
        limit their functionality. For example, the power consumption
        and heat production in these devices is creating significant
        problems for device design. Therefore, novel quantum materials
        and device concepts are required to develop a new generation of
        energy-saving information technology. The recent discoveries of
        topological materials -- a new class of relativistic quantum
        materials -- hold great promise for use in energy saving
        electronics.<br>
        <br>
        Researchers in the Louisiana Consortium for Neutron Scattering,
        or LaCNS, led by LSU Department of Physics &amp; Astronomy Chair
        and Professor John F. DiTusa and Tulane University Professor
        Zhiqiang Mao, with collaborators at Oak Ridge National Lab, the
        National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Florida State
        University, and the University of New Orleans, recently reported
        the first observation of this topological behavior in a magnet,
        Sr1-yMn1-zSb2 (y, z &lt; 0.1). These results were published this
        week in Nature Materials (doi:10.1038/nmat4953).<br>
        <br>
        "This first observation is a significant milestone in the
        advancement of novel quantum materials and this discovery opens
        the opportunity to explore its consequences. The nearly massless
        behavior of the charge carriers offers possibilities for novel
        device concepts taking advantage of the extremely low power
        dissipation," DiTusa said.<br>
        <br>
        The phrase "topological materials" refers to materials where the
        current carrying electrons act as if they have no mass similar
        to the properties of photons, the particles that make up light.
        Amazingly, these electronic states are robust and immune to
        defects and disorder because they are protected from scattering
        by symmetry. This symmetry protection results in exceedingly
        high charge carrier mobility, creating little to no resistance
        to current flow. The result is expected to be a substantial
        reduction in heat production and energy saving efficiencies in
        electronic devices.<br>
        <br>
        This new magnet displays electronic charge carriers that have
        almost no mass. The magnetism brings with it an important
        symmetry breaking property - time reversal symmetry, or TRS,
        breaking where the ability to run time backward would no longer
        return the system back to its starting conditions. The
        combination of relativistic electron behavior, which is the
        cause of much reduced charge carrier mass, and TRS breaking has
        been predicted to cause even more unusual behavior, the much
        sought after magnetic Weyl semimetal phase. The material
        discovered by this collaboration is thought to be an excellent
        one to investigate for evidence of the Weyl phase and to uncover
        its consequences.<br>

        <br>
        Week-long or longer monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate,
        coupled to time-structure analyses, can help detect disease-risk
        elevations, as a warning of the need for a preventive
        prehabilitation. Within the normal range of physiologic
        variation, computer methods quantify time structures, or
        chronomes, that can serve as reference values. The major applied
        purpose for mapping chronomes is the detection of disease-risk
        syndromes such as blood pressure "overswinging" and heart rate
        "underswinging."...<br>

        <br>
        We complement an “Extended Consensus” [1], focused on the
        individual’s health, by documenting associations between the
        human heart and circulation and the environment near and far at
        the level of local and global populations in both space and time
        [2, 3]. Life in the atmosphere of the sun [4] mimics its
        inanimate surroundings; its rhythmic components nearly match in
        length the cycles of the cosmos [5-15]. Longitudinal records of
        the human blood circulation reveal heretofore unrecognized
        aspects of its variability. The view from a very few long and
        relatively dense series, covering mostly around-the-clock (up
        to) decades on individuals, reveals variability that cannot
        readily or necessarily be found in hundreds of thousands of
        individuals’ around-the-clock 24-hour spotchecks and certainly
        not in single samples, unless the individuals’ cycles are
        synchronized and assessed on a population basis. <br>
        <br>
        Periods, t, longer than 28 hours, that is infradian variations,
        like the circadians (with tentatively between 20 and 28 hours),
        have entered the genome and their characteristics await mapping.
        For those cycles that are already mapped, we consider further
        the extent to which the parameters and nonparametric endpoints
        of healthy infradian and circadian variability and their
        anomalies can become everyday measures of Sir William Osler’s
        wear and tear, i.e., of Hans Selye’s and Paul Rosch’s stress and
        strain to the point of becoming gauges of distress (again
        complementing or replacing single samples or the mean values of
        dense sampling during single days). Criteria for recognizing and
        quantifying the alteration indicating when a load changes from
        benetensive to maletensive have yet to be identified, perhaps by
        monitoring blood pressure and heart rate in everyday life,
        replacing spotchecks in the clinic. <br>
        <br>
        The probable role of cosmos-induced loads in pathogenesis,
        assessed, among others, as an effect of a magnetic storm in
        laboratory animals [16-18] and in humans [19], awaits study by
        using superposed epochs and a subtraction and addition approach
        [2, 3].<br>

        </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Our environment includes many natural and artificial agents
        affecting any person on the Earth in one way or other. This work
        is focused on two of them - weather and space weather, which are
        permanently effective. Their cumulative effect is proved by
        means of the modeling. It is shown that combination of
        geomagnetic and solar indices and weather strength parameter
        (which includes six main meteorological parameters) correlates
        with health state significantly better (up to R=0.7), than
        separate environmental parameters do. The typical shape of any
        health characteristics' time-series during human body reaction
        to any negative impact represents a curve, well-known in
        medicine as a General Adaptation Syndrome curve by Hans Selye.
        We demonstrate this on the base of blood pressure time-series
        and acupunctural experiment data, averaged by group. The first
        stage of adaptive stress-reaction (resistance to stress) is
        sometimes observed 1-2 days before geomagnetic storm onset. The
        effect of "outstripping reaction to magnetic storm", named
        Tchizhevsky- Velkhover effect, had been known for many years,
        but its explanation was obtained recently due to the
        consideration of the near-Earth space plasma processes. It was
        shown that lowfrequency variations of the solar wind density on
        a background of the density growth can stimulate the development
        of the geomagnetic filed (GMF) variations of the wide frequency
        range. These variations seem to have "bioeffective frequencies",
        resonant with own frequencies of body organs and systems. The
        mechanism of human body reaction is supposed to be a
        parametrical resonance in low-frequency range (which is
        determined by the resonance in large-scale organs and systems)
        and a simple forced resonance in GHz-range of variations (the
        resonance of micro-objects in the organism such as DNA, cell
        membranes, blood ions etc.) Given examples of mass-reaction of
        the objects to ULF-range GMF variations during quiet space
        weather time prove this hypothesis. <br>

        There is an invariable first rule of propaganda: know exactly
        what your agenda is, and then design every statement to forward
        that agenda.<br>
        <br>
        The World Health Organization is now touting a measles epidemic
        in Europe. And of course, they’re explaining it with
        propaganda—it’s the fault of people who refuse to allow their
        children to take the measles vaccination.<br>
        <br>
        The focus is on Italy, where, “coincidently,” protesters are
        outraged at a new law mandating vaccination for children.
        Perfect. “You see? Don’t take the shot and this is what you get.
        A massive outbreak.”<br>
        <br>
        Well, here is an official report. In Italy, there are 3300 case
        of measles and two deaths.<br>
        <br>
        That’s the classic and traditional and age-old picture of
        measles. 3298 children have survived. Kids get measles, they
        recover, and thereafter they’re immune.<br>
        <br>
        As for the two children who died, you would have to do a very
        careful independent investigation, to determine what health
        problems they may have had before they contracted measles. And
        “health problems” would include prior toxic medical treatment.
        The actual cause of death isn’t always what health authorities
        say it is.<br>
        <br>
        In addition to the above, here are two revealing quotes to
        consider:<br>
        <br>
        “…the window of vulnerability of an infant may be even greater
        in vaccinated women than in with women with natural measles
        infection.” (Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg., 79(5), 2008, pp. 787–792).<br>
        <br>
        Translation: Measles occurring in infants—which is unusual and
        dangerous—is more likely to occur when the mother has been
        vaccinated against measles. Why? Because, as a result of her
        being vaccinated, she no longer passes down, to her child, the
        natural components of immunity to measles from her having had
        the disease. And the vaccination she received didn’t confer
        immunity to her baby.<br>
        <br>
        “Administration of KMV (killed measles vaccine) apparently set
        in motion an aberrant immunologic response that not only failed
        to protect children against natural measles, but resulted in
        heightened susceptibility.” JAMA Aug. 22, 1980, vol. 244, p.
        804, Vincent Fulginiti and Ray Helfer. The authors indicate that
        such children can come down with “an often severe, atypical form
        of measles. Atypical measles is characterized by fever,
        headache… and a diverse rash (which)… may consist of a mixture
        of macules, papules, vesicles, and pustules… ”<br>
        <br>
        In other words, the measles vaccine can create a worse form of
        measles. This is not the normal form of the illness, from which
        children routinely recover with the bonus of lifetime immunity.
        No, this is a severe, atypical, dangerous, synthetic,
        vaccine-induced disease.<br>
        <br>
        Does all this mean the health authorities in Europe aren’t
        telling the whole story, are twisting the truth?<br>
        <br>
        I’m shocked, I tell you. Shocked.<br>
        <br>
        To cite just one parallel in the US among many, the Centers for
        Disease Control (CDC) buys and dispenses several billion
        dollars’ worth of vaccines every year. At the same time, the CDC
        is in charge of doing key studies to test the safety and
        efficacy of those vaccines. This unconscionable conflict of
        interest is an ongoing crime—because there are NO circumstances
        under which the CDC would ever say that vaccines are dangerous
        and ineffective, since they, the CDC, are a leading commercial
        customer and purveyor of those medical products. They would be
        cutting their own throats.<br>
        <br>
        Do public health authorities lie?<br>
        <br>
        Is the Pope Catholic?<br>

        The quasicrystal likely formed 300 million years ago while still
        in space.<br>
        <br>
        Quasicrystals, which violate the mathematical constraints on how
        crystals are structured, were long thought to occur only when
        synthetically produced in a lab. Paul J. Steinhardt, a physicist
        at Princeton University, has been searching for naturally
        occurring quasicrystals for nearly two decades. Previous finds
        had already been created in lab conditions, but his latest
        discovery reveals a quasicrystal that’s entirely new. It was
        found in a meteorite fragment recovered from a remote site in
        Russia. We speak with Steinhardt about the story behind what he
        and his colleagues have discovered... <br>

        Eisenhower’s warning was 56 years ago. With the President of the
        United States concerned about the military/industrial complex 56
        years ago, try to imagine how much more this power is entrenched
        after the decades of the Cold War and “Soviet Threat.” The power
        of the military/security complex is the premier power in
        Washington.<br>
        <br>
        Eisenhower’s speech is the best speech any American President
        has ever delivered. It is only 14 minutes and 4 seconds long;
        yet it covers everything. There is awareness that we can be
        victims of our own success. Whatever their public position,
        neoconservatives have no alternative but to hate President
        Eisenhower with a passion, because he compared the threat to
        America from the military/industrial complex to the threat from
        the Soviet Union...<br>

              Researchers Create Protein 'Out of Thin Air'</b></font><br>

        <br>
        In a bid to solve the international famine problem, scientists
        in Finland have managed to produce protein using unorthodox
        methods. The first batch of protein produced using electricity
        and carbon dioxide is expected to become a forerunner for future
        hunger relief solutions.<br>
        <br>
        The new revolutionary method, which is a collaboration between
        the Lappeenranta University of Technology and the Technical
        Research Centre of Finland (VTT) makes it possible to generate
        the nutrient virtually anywhere energy is available, which is
        projected to become a sustainable solution to famine and the
        earth's environmental problems. Additionally, the
        electricity-generated protein could also be used as animal feed,
        which would help release cropland for forestry, Finnish national
        broadcaster Yle reported.<br>
        <br>
        "All the ingredients are practically taken from the air.
        Therefore, this technology can in the future be used in, say,
        deserts or other areas where there is a food shortage. Another
        alternative could be a kind of household appliance that allows
        consumers to produce protein for their own needs," leading VTT
        researcher Juha-Pekka Pitkänen told the Finnish daily
        Hufvudstadsbladet.<br>
        <br>
        Furthermore, the research team estimated that energy from the
        sun can be used up to 10 times more efficiently than it is at
        present. Today's protein-producing processes rely primarily on
        photosynthesis in plants, such as soybeans. According to
        Pitkänen, the Finnish method is a more direct path to the sun's
        power compared with photosynthesis. As a rule, single-cell
        organisms are predominantly protein and 20 percent
        carbohydrates.<br>
        <br>
        According to Lappeenranta Technology University professor Jero
        Ahola, the new production method does not require specific
        conditions with an exact temperature, humidity or soil type.
        Additionally, it could potentially become completely
        automatized.<br>
        <br>
        "It requires no pest-control substance, and it allows us to
        avoid environmental footprint, such as leaks into water systems
        or the formation of powerful greenhouse gases," Jero Ahola said.<br>
        <br>
        At present, the main obstacle is the relatively slow production
        rate, which has to be sped up for the product to become more
        competitive. Today, the production of 1 gram of protein takes
        around two weeks.<br>
        <br>
        According to Pitkänen, the ultimate goal is to establish a
        container-sized facility than can produce up to five kilos of
        single-celled protein a day. It will take be another two to
        three years before the new unit is up and running, Pitkänen
        argued. Then, the plan is to scale up by constructing more
        containers and increasing the size of the reactors. Hopefully,
        the project will reach its full commercial potential in 10
        years.<br>
        <br>
        The joint Food from Electricity study is part of the
        wide-ranging Neo-Carbon Energy research project in Finland that
        seeks to develop a completely renewable and emission-free energy
        system. The study is funded by the Academy of Finland and will
        run for four years.<br>

        “Astounding” new evidence suggests ‘party drug’ Ketamine can
        cure/end depression in the elderly.<br>
        <br>
        Australian researchers at the Black Dog Institute completed the
        world’s first randomized control trial (RCT), assessing the
        efficacy and safety of ketamine as a treatment for depression in
        elderly patients.<br>
        <br>
        World-first trial of #ketamine for geriatric #depression by
        Black Dog Institute and @UNSW shows promising results: <br>

        <a href="https://t.co/EGDWnLeZB1"><b>https://t.co/EGDWnLeZB1 </b><b><br>
          </b></a><br>
        A total of 16 patients over the age of 60, many of whom had
        suffered from depression for years and found other treatments
        ineffective, were given low doses of the drug.<br>
        <br>
        Increasing doses of ketamine were given over a period of five
        weeks, with doses tailored for each individual participant.<br>
        <br>
        The results, published in the latest American Journal of
        Geriatric Psychiatry, provide preliminary evidence that ketamine
        is effective as an antidepressant – when delivered in repeated
        intravenous doses.<br>
        <br>
        "What we noticed was that ketamine worked incredibly quickly and
        incredibly effectively," Professor Colleen Loo, who led the
        pilot program told ABC News. “By incredibly effective, we mean
        going rapidly from severely depressed to being completely well
        in one day.”.<br>

        </b><b>Summary:</b><br>
        <br>
        A researcher has discovered a way to convert dirty aluminium
        foil into a biofuel catalyst, which could help to solve global
        waste and energy problems. <br>
        Share:<br>
        <br>
        A researcher at Queen's University Belfast has discovered a way
        to convert dirty aluminium foil into a biofuel catalyst, which
        could help to solve global waste and energy problems.<br>
        <br>
        In the UK, around 20,000 tonnes of aluminium foil packaging is
        wasted each year -- enough to stretch to the moon and back. Most
        of this is landfilled or incinerated as it's usually
        contaminated by grease and oils, which can damage recycling
        equipment.<br>
        <br>
        However, Ahmed Osman, an Early Career Researcher from Queen's
        University's School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, has
        worked with engineers at the university to create an innovative
        crystallisation method, which obtains 100% pure single crystals
        of aluminium salts from the contaminated foil. This is the
        starting material for the preparation of alumina catalyst.<br>
        <br>
        Usually, to produce this type of alumina it would have to come
        from bauxite ore, which is mined in countries such as West
        Africa, the West Indies and Australia, causing huge
        environmental damage.<br>
        <br>
        Osman, who took on the project under the University's
        Sustainable Energy, Pioneering Research Programme, has created a
        solution which is much more environmentally-friendly, effective
        and cheaper than the commercial catalyst which is currently
        available on the market for the production of dimethyl ether --
        a biofuel which is regarded as the most promising of the 21st
        century. Osman says making the catalyst from aluminium foil cost
        about £120/kg while the commercial alumina catalyst comes in at
        around £305/kg.<br>
        <br>
        Its unique thermal, chemical and mechanical stability means it
        can also be used as an absorbent, in electronic device
        fabrication, as a cutting tool material or as an alternative for
        surgical material for implants.<br>
        <br>
        The ground-breaking research has been published in Nature
        Scientific Reports.<br>
        <br>
        Osman commented: "I have always been inspired by Chemistry and I
        believe that catalysis especially can make the world a better
        place. One day I took a walk through our laboratories at Queen's
        and found lots of Aluminium foil waste so I did a little digging
        and after speaking to my colleagues, I ran my experiment and was
        astonished by the ultrapure single crystals -- I didn't expect
        it to be 100% pure.<br>
        <br>
        "At Queen's, our scientists and engineers often work hand in
        hand on common challenging problems for the society. By using
        our joint expertise, we have been able to tackle the issue of
        sustainable development and come up with a research solution
        which lies in an area between chemistry and chemical
        engineering.<br>
        <br>
        "This breakthrough is significant as not only is the alumina
        more pure than its commercial counterpart, it could also reduce
        the amount of aluminium foil going to landfill while also
        sidestepping the environmental damage associated with mining
        bauxite."<br>
        <br>
        Osman is hoping to continue his research into how these
        catalysts can be further improved and explore the opportunities
        for commercialisation of biofuel production or use the modified
        alumina catalyst in the catalytic converters in natural gas
        vehicles.<br>

        <b>Abstract</b><br>
        <br>
        A novel green preparation route to prepare nano-mesoporous
        ?-Al2O3 from AlCl3.6H2O derived from aluminum foil waste and
        designated as ACFL550 is demonstrated, which showed higher
        surface area, larger pore volume, stronger acidity and higher
        surface area compared to ?-Al2O3 that is produced from the
        commercial AlCl3 precursor, AC550. The produced crystalline
        AlCl3.6H2O and Al(NO3)3.9H2O in the first stage of the
        preparation method were characterized by single-crystal XRD,
        giving two crystal structures, a trigonal (R-3c) and monoclinic
        (P21/c) structure, respectively. EDX analysis showed that
        ACFL550 had half the chlorine content (Cl%) relative to AC550,
        which makes ACFL550 a promising catalyst in acid-catalysed
        reactions. Pure and modified ACFL550 and AC550 were applied in
        acid-catalysed reactions, the dehydration of methanol to
        dimethyl ether and the total methane oxidation reactions,
        respectively. It was found that ACFL550 showed higher catalytic
        activity than AC550. This work opens doors for the preparation
        of highly active and well-structured nano-mesoporous alumina
        catalysts/supports from aluminum foil waste and demonstrates its
        application in acid-catalysed reactions.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Introduction</b><br>
        <br>
        Aluminum (Al) manufacture and expenditure are considered to be
        two sides of a coin and both are increasing. Aluminum is mainly
        produced from bauxite mines worldwide, reaching 270 million
        metric tonnes (Mt) in 2015 compared to 183 Mt in 20061.
        Conversely, the Al consumption approximately tripled from 2006
        to 2015 by 45 to 120 Mt, respectively, with a growth rate of 4%
        per year. To meet the dramatic increase in the Al consumption, a
        large amount of bauxite production is needed, which generates
        significant levels of waste such as tailings, red mud, emissions
        of perfluorocarbon and CO2 gases during the production process.
        Recycling this Al waste is crucial for the environment; in fact,
        recycling 1 kg of Al saves 8 kg of bauxite, 4?kg of chemical
        products and 14?kW of electricity2. Al waste can be recycled to
        produce various useful products. Li et al.3 successfully
        prepared ?-Al2O3 from oil shale ash waste which consists of
        10.66 wt% Al2O3; however, they used a high calcination
        temperature at 700–800?°C to remove residual organic compounds
        and expensive chemicals such as Eu(NO3)3, urea and surfactant.
        Chotisuwan et al.4 managed to prepare ?-Al2O3 at low calcination
        temperature (500?°C) from Al cans, however, they used a costly
        preparation method by using isopropanol and mercury iodide. Al
        foil is one of the biggest Al waste sources which is difficult
        to recycle; thus the end-of-life options are either landfilling
        or incineration5. The global Al foil market had a size of 3.4 Mt
        in 2010. In the UK alone in 2001, 160,000 t of Al waste were
        sent to landfill6. Converting the Al foil into useful products
        is an environmental issue; few efforts were performed in
        previous publications7. Recently, Al foil was used in H2
        production by converting it into active Al powder that reacts
        with water producing H27 or by using Ca(OH)2 to remove the
        surface oxide layer and initiate the hydration reaction of Al
        foil8. Furthermore, a-Al2O3 was prepared at a low calcination
        temperature (1100?°C) for the industrial applications such as
        refractory materials, however, aqua regia was used during the
        preparation procedures, consequently, the release of NOx
        emissions is possible during the preparation, which is harmful
        to the environment9. Qin et al.10 demonstrated a facile and a
        robust method to prepare ordered anodic aluminum oxides with
        continuously tunable inter-pore distances. Ye et al.11 studied
        the catalytic decomposition of formaldehyde using Flexible Mg-Al
        layered double hydroxide supported Pt on Al foil. No research
        has been performed on the potential preparation of ultra-pure
        single-crystalline AlCl3.6H2O and Al(NO3)3.9H2O subsequently
        highly active ?-Al2O3 from Al foil and its applications in
        acid-catalysed reactions as a catalyst/support. Converting Al
        foil into a very fine alumina catalyst/support is of importance
        for both academia and industry application (e.g. polymerization,
        reforming, dehydration and hydrogenation12). Aluminum oxide,
        alumina (Al2O3), is one of the most attractive ceramic materials
        for its various applications due to its thermal, chemical and
        mechanical stability13, 14...<br>
        <br>
        <b>Conclusion</b><br>
        <br>
        Herein, we propose a novel eco-friendly preparation route
        firstly to obtain two crystalline aluminum single crystals from
        aluminum foil waste using a simple preparation method. The
        produced AlCl3.6H2O and Al(NO3)3.9H2O were characterized by
        single crystal XRD and showed two different crystal structure, a
        trigonal (R-3c) and a monoclinic (P21/c), respectively. A green
        synthetic route was followed to prepare nano-mesoporous ?-Al2O3
        from AlCl3.6H2O designated as ACFL550, which showed higher
        surface area, larger pore volume, stronger acidity and surface
        structure compared with the ?-Al2O3 that produced from the
        commercial AlCl3 precursor, AC550. EDX analysis showed that
        ACFL550 had half the chlorine content (Cl %) relative to AC550,
        which makes ACFL550 a promising catalyst in acid catalysed
        reactions. Pure and modified ACFL550 and AC550 were applied in
        acid catalysed reactions, the dehydration of methanol to
        dimethyl ether and the total methane oxidation reactions,
        respectively. It was found that ACFL550 showed higher catalytic
        activity than AC550 due to its superior surface structure and
        acidity. The modified ACFL550 showed higher activity in the TMO
        reaction with T50% at 303 ºC. These results open doors for the
        preparation of highly active and well-structured nano-mesoporous
        alumina catalyst/support from aluminum foil waste and its
        application in acid-catalysed reactions.<br>

              control aging</b></font><br>
        </div>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Scientists have found that stem cells in the brain's
        hypothalamus govern how fast aging occurs in the body. The
        finding, made in mice, could lead to new strategies for warding
        off age-related diseases and extending lifespan. <br>
        <br>
        Scientists at Albert Einstein College of Medicine have found
        that stem cells in the brain's hypothalamus govern how fast
        aging occurs in the body. The finding, made in mice, could lead
        to new strategies for warding off age-related diseases and
        extending lifespan. The paper was published online today in
        Nature.<br>
        <br>
        The hypothalamus was known to regulate important processes
        including growth, development, reproduction and metabolism. In a
        2013 Nature paper, Einstein researchers made the surprising
        finding that the hypothalamus also regulates aging throughout
        the body. Now, the scientists have pinpointed the cells in the
        hypothalamus that control aging: a tiny population of adult
        neural stem cells, which were known to be responsible for
        forming new brain neurons.<br>
        <br>
        "Our research shows that the number of hypothalamic neural stem
        cells naturally declines over the life of the animal, and this
        decline accelerates aging," says senior author Dongsheng Cai,
        M.D., Ph.D., (professor of molecular pharmacology at Einstein.
        "But we also found that the effects of this loss are not
        irreversible. By replenishing these stem cells or the molecules
        they produce, it's possible to slow and even reverse various
        aspects of aging throughout the body."...<br>

              Americans for Opposition to Israel</b></font><br>
          <br>
          <b>By Sartre</b><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        Seldom does an agent for a foreign country dare to push
        legislation that in effect would prohibit constitutional
        protections to exercise lawful defiance. Before undertaking a
        scrutiny of this tragic abuse of legislation, one needs to
        understand the malevolent nature of AIPAC. Examine the article,
        AIPAC Zionists - the Archenemy of the American Nation for a
        detailed analysis of the fifth column that operates with
        impunity on our very shores. If you are concerned about
        collusion into our elections by a foreign power, look no further
        than the strings pulled on Congressional representatives, who
        are toadies for the state of Israel. <br>
        <br>
        Glenn Greenwald from The Intercept provides a compelling case
        that U.S. Lawmakers Seek to Criminally Outlaw Support for
        Boycott Campaign Against Israel. This is a most important essay
        because it provides irrefutable evidence of the methods that
        AIPAC uses to shape the "PC" orthodox culture and control
        Congressional legislation for the sole purpose of protecting the
        Zionist regime.<br>
        <br>
        Greenwald writes on this treasonous legislation. "The proposed
        measure, called the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S. 720), was
        introduced by Cardin on March 23. The Jewish Telegraphic Agency
        reports that the bill “was drafted with the assistance of the
        American Israel Public Affairs Committee.” Indeed, AIPAC, in its
        2017 lobbying agenda, identified passage of this bill as one of
        its top lobbying priorities for the year:"<br>
        <br>
        Criminalizing the expression of protected free speech and the
        righteous dissent of political expression against a foreign
        government, which is a permanent constitutional Bill of Rights
        safeguard, because extreme Jewish Zionists maintain their
        loyalty to Israel above the natural rights of all Americans; is
        obscenely offensive.<br>
        <br>
        When the ACLU objects to this proposed statute being pushed by
        Israel-First zealots, the normally reliable pro Zionists
        signifies that the assault on civil liberties must be so
        egregious that resistance to the Reign of Terror from AIPAC must
        be recognized. Read the ACLU letter to the 45 senators support
        bill that makes boycotting Israel a crime, urging them to Oppose
        S. 720 – Israel Anti-Boycott Act. <br>
        <br>
        The essential aspects that have alarming consequence from this
        S. 720 legislation follow as cited in The Intercept essay. <br>
        <br>
        Greenwald reveals just how sneaky the AIPAC lobbying operates to
        deceive the bootlick Senators who would never dare to defy the
        Israel Lobby. Read carefully the sources used to create a
        perverted linkage of previous laws in their disgusting attempt
        to circumvent the constitution in order to criminalize behavior
        that opposes the Khazars rogue apartheid state of
        Israel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        "But as the ACLU put it, “Violations would be subject to a
        minimum civil penalty of $250,000 and a maximum criminal penalty
        of $1 million and 20 years in prison.” <br>
        <br>
        That’s because, as Josh Ruebner expertly detailed when the bill
        was first unveiled, “the bill seeks to amend two laws — the
        Export Administration Act of 1979 and the Export-Import Bank Act
        of 1945,” and “the potential penalties for violating this bill
        are steep: a minimum $250,000 civil penalty and a maximum
        criminal penalty of $1 million and 20 years imprisonment, as
        stipulated in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.”
        <br>
        <br>
        Indeed, to see how serious the penalties are, and how clear it
        is that those penalties are imposed by this bill, one can just
        compare the bill’s text in Section 8(a), which provides that
        violators will be “fined in accordance with Section 206 of the
        International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1705),”
        to the penalty provisions of that law, which state:" <br>
        <br>
        Both the ACLU and The Intercept have a reputation of being left
        leaning. There is no such proclivity from the Daily
        Stormer.&nbsp; Drunk on Their Own Kool Aid, Jews Protest
        Themselves at AIPAC, cites a report in the Jerusalem Post,
        "Protesters bore a banner saying: “Jews won’t be free until
        Palestinians are, reject AIPAC, reject occupation.” <br>
        <br>
        Azzmador, the author of the Daily Stormer article contends. <br>
        <br>
        "Jews are just crotchety people with no sense of humor
        whatsoever, that’s why they’re always protesting something, and
        if the gentiles have not done something worthy of marching and
        shrieking about on any given day (excluding Shabbos, of course)
        they will march against themselves. <br>
        <br>
        You see, the Jews are the most hated group of people in history
        for a reason, and no one knows this better than other Jews,
        thus, they hate themselves. They hate themselves so much that
        they even have Knesset members (the Israeli version of a
        congressman) come to America to protest their own country,
        whatever sense that makes." <br>
        <br>
        Wow, contention in the ranks of Israelis? Guess they may need
        AIPAC to set up their own versions in Tel Aviv. Watch the video,
        AIPAC 101 for U.S. appeal used to convince naive Americans that
        supporting Israel is in the best interests of our own country.
        As the factual evidence proves, formulating American foreign
        policy to advance Israel has demonstrated that a state of
        permanent war is a direct result from allowing Zionists to write
        or vote on our legislation.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        Bipartisan consensus in Congress always bows to Jewish demands.<br>

        <font size="+1"><b>...Allah's origin</b><b><br>
          </b></font><br>
        Allah has got about one hundred "beautiful names".<br>
        <br>
        A poem from the 12th century B.C. grants to the Babylonian God
        Marduk about 50 names, coming from the defeated and assimilated
        deities. Most of these will qualify Allah.<br>
        <br>
        The word Allah comes from the Sumerian divinity Lilitu, evolving
        in Lilith (the Mother-Goddess of the Hebrew), and then in
        Al-ilat (that of the Arabs), but also in El, God, in akkadian.
        One finds also in Arabic Ala, 'to be terrified'.<br>
        <br>
        The name Allah has certainly been the masculine form that the
        original name Al-ilat has taken...<br>
        <br>
        <font size="+1"><b>Allah's fall</b></font><br>
        <br>
        Never spiritual discussions are to be found in the Koran or
        Mohammed's life, except boring slogans. <br>
        <br>
        Never mystical preoccupations are present, which would enable
        one to accord himself with a superior moral code. Never
        renunciation to illusions and passions is hinted at. Never the
        ultimatum aim of humanity is the object of questioning.<br>
        <br>
        Forgiving is granted according to Allah's whims; the absolution
        of sins does not come from an inner transmutation, but from a
        mechanical profession of faith, all the more claimed and shown
        that it is not put into practice by good actions in life.<br>
        <br>
        One finds only the crazy frailty of an anxious Allah, because
        his subjects could start venerating a secondary divinity, whom
        still He has created.<br>
        <br>
        In the text one can only find the proclamation of the tragic
        despair of a unique God, killing his own creatures after sending
        Satan to them to have them doubt; obliged to slaughter people to
        force survivors to prostrate before Himself.<br>
        <br>
        One sees in this book only Allah's vertiginous fall into
        absolute nothingness, at war against its own creation, having
        for satisfaction only servile people, robots devoid of
        consciousness and without freedom. One reads only devilish
        pleasures, threats and revenges.<br>
        <br>
        The rights of the human creatures are threaded upon, betrayal is
        sanctified; deceit is recommended; cruelty, baseness,
        possessiveness, cupidity are encouraged; lie and dissimulation
        are favored.<br>
        <br>
        Psalmody is there in lieu of piety. Recitations take the place
        of reflection, litanies that of elevation. <br>
        <br>
        And all that is chanted until entrancement, to forget, if only
        for one hour, the tragic condemnation for the sin, not Adam's
        one, but still worse, for the sin of living, because the very
        life of a human being is unbearable to Allah, indeed jealous not
        to exist himself.<br>
        <br>
        A human being will not be allowed the temptation to show love,
        on the contrary, he will have to reject his own family:<br>
        <br>
        "Don't take for friends your fathers or your brothers, if they
        prefer incredulity to faith."(9, 23)<br>
        <br>
        "It is not befitting to the prophet or the believers to implore
        God's forgiving for polytheists, be they their near and dear,
        while they know that these people will be inmates of the
        Furnace."(9, 113)<br>
        <br>
        "You will not find people believing in God and in the Last Day,
        and showing love to those who oppose God and his prophet, be
        they their fathers, their sons, their brothers, or members of
        their clan."(83, 22)<br>
        <br>
        And woe to music, dance and joy! Woe to love and long life to
        death!<br>
        <br>
        That is the war cry of those sects which court death.<br>
        <br>
        Those verses are only a remake of the Deuteronomy :<br>
        <br>
        "If your brother, nephew, niece, your wife who rests on your
        chest, or the friend who is as yourself, incite you to serve
        other gods and not me, you must kill him; let your hand be the
        first to put him to death.<br>
        <br>
        Lapidate him, let him die... If iniquitous people serve other
        gods than Me, you will exterminate their town and you will
        slaughter all its inhabitants by your sword."(Dt, 13)<br>
        <br>
        Forced into a destiny "attached to its neck" whose aim he
        ignores, the human being is now under surveillance to accomplish
        rituals which are empty of meaning, to cry out of rage and
        bitterness before this scorn of divine creation and this
        ontological incomprehension of the world.<br>
        <br>
        Let it be submissive, this bunch of scoundrels ever ready to
        rebel against Allah so that he "may send a messenger to warn
        them" and feel the pleasure to destroy them:<br>
        <br>
        "There is no city that we will not destroy and torment with the
        strongest torture before the Day of Resurrection. That was fixed
        in the Scriptures."<br>
        (Co 17, 58)<br>
        <br>
        The human being believed to be free: he is only an alien on this
        earth, a prostrated slave. But in his curse, he will have also
        to be wary of his best friend, who may be inhabited by a djinn;
        or of his son who will judge him not believer enough and who
        will send him to hell.<br>
        <br>
        He will have to see his mother and sister humiliated and struck,
        this sister which is soft, beautiful, loving, consoling, the
        only one which in fact deserves Allah's beautiful names.<br>
        <br>
        How difficult it is, the koranic demand which teaches to despise
        woman; to transform the mother, deity of our childhood, into an
        inferior creature, just waiting to people the hell...<br>
        <br>
        And to crown all that, the very foundation of spirituality -
        compassion - is absent from Koran. Mercy, love, the thrust of
        the heart towards the one who suffers, the care towards the soul
        who is searching, are substituted by sinister vociferations.<br>
        <br>
        Ceaselessly, Allah is called merciful; but he never demonstrates
        mercy. In the description of ignorant redactors, he has become a
        conceited and cruel being. The most he can do is to accept
        servility as a proof of submissiveness; and his forgiving is
        only for doubts about his existence, since acts are secondary.<br>
        <br>
        At last, intoxicated with Himself, Allah falls in the supreme
        sin of pride, without any feeling for His own tragic destiny of
        a burning king. Thus blinded by his own glory, Allah takes the
        place of Lucifer.<br>
        <br>
        He went beyond is likes, such as Odon, Kali, Shiva, Nergal,
        Yahve, Satan, and ends up alone in the world.<br>
        <br>
        Under the pretense of absolute submission, the Koran represents
        eventually God's murder, by rejecting Him outside humanity.<br>
        <br>
        So, these legend-makers who wrote it have been the root cause of
        innumerable crimes against the true Allah. That is why the Koran
        is received by the technique of overfeeding and stuffing memory;
        faith is not necessary because faith is a choice, whereas there,
        only submission is expected. <br>
        <br>
        We can notice that the end of the theological debate in Islam,
        in the 14th century, triggered a long lasting regression of this
        culture which had been able, by translating Greek and Persian
        authors, to reach the summits of civilization...<br>

        "Religion is what keeps the poor from murdering the rich." --
        Napoleon Bonaparte<br>
        <br>
        God wants spiritual fruit, not religious nuts. -- unknown<br>
        <br>
        "Of all the systems of religion that ever were invented, there
        is none more derogatory to the Almighty, more unedifying to man,
        more repugnant to reason, and more contradictory in itself than
        this thing called Christianity. Too absurd for belief, too
        impossible to convince, and too inconsistent for practice, it
        renders the heart torpid or produces only atheists or fanatics.
        As an engine of power, it serves the purpose of despotism, and
        as a means of wealth, the avarice of priests, but so far as
        respects the good of man in general it leads to nothing here or
        hereafter." Thomas Paine<br>
        <br>
        Man has asked for truth and the Church has given him miracles.
        He has asked for knowledge, and the Church has given him
        theology. He has asked for facts, and the Church has given him
        the Bible. This foolishness should stop. The Church has nothing
        to give man that has not been in cold storage for two thousand
        years. Anything would become stale in that time." Marilla M.
        Ricker<br>
        <br>
        "I have recently been examining all the known superstitions of
        the world, and do not find in our particular superstition
        [Christianity] one redeeming feature. They are all alike,
        founded upon fables and mythologies." -- Thomas Jefferson<br>
        <br>
        "The man who is always worrying about whether or not his soul
        would be damned generally has a soul that isn't worth a damn."
        -- Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.<br>
