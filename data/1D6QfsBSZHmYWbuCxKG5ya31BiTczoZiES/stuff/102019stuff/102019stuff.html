                Documentary by Oliver Stone Original English version</b><br>
            </div>
            <b><br>
            </b>Ukraine, the 'borderlands' between Russia and
            'civilized' Europe is on fire. For centuries, it has been at
            the center of a tug-of-war between powers seeking to control
            its rich lands and Russia's access to the Mediterranean. The
            Maidan Massacre in early 2014 triggered a bloody uprising
            that ousted president Viktor Yanukovych, spurred Crimeans to
            secede and join Russia, and sparked a civil war in Eastern
            Ukraine. Russia was portrayed by Western media as the
            perpetrator, and has been sanctioned and widely condemned as
            such. But was Russia responsible for what happened? Ukraine
            on Fire provides a historical perspective for the deep
            divisions in the region which led to the 2004 Orange
            Revolution, the 2014 uprisings, and the violent overthrow of
            democratically-elected Yanukovych. Covered by Western media
            as a 'popular revolution', it was, in fact, a coup d'état
            scripted and staged by ultra-nationalist groups and the US
            State Department. Investigative journalist Robert Parry
            reveals how US-funded political NGOs and media companies
            have emerged since the 1980s, replacing the CIA in promoting
            America's geopolitical agenda abroad. Executive producer
            Oliver Stone gained unprecedented access to the inside story
            through his on-camera interviews with former President
            Viktor Yanukovych and Minister of Internal Affairs Vitaliy
            Zakharchenko, who explain how the US Ambassador and factions
            in Washington actively plotted for regime change. And, in
            his first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin,
            Stone solicits Putin's take on the significance of Crimea,
            NATO and the US's history of interference in elections and
            regime change in the region.<br>

            </b>They removed him from the embassy and blended his brain
            for 3 years so badly he turned into a poop smearing invalid
            and then finished him off in prison. HERE IS PROOF:<br>
            <br>
            The following was posted by a close friend of Assange. Here.
            We. Go.<br>
            Whistleblower: Assange tortured so badly he may soon die<br>
            Everybody in that court yesterday saw that one of the
            greatest journalists and most important dissidents of our
            times is being tortured to death by the state, before our
            eyes. To see my friend, the most articulate man, the fastest
            thinker, I have ever known, reduced to that shambling and
            incoherent wreck, was unbearable.<br>
            <br>
            craig 6 hours ago<br>
            <br>
            I was deeply shaken while witnessing yesterday's events in
            Westminster Magistrates Court. Every decision was railroaded
            through over the scarcely heard arguments and objections of
            Assange's legal team, by a magistrate who barely pretended
            to be listening.<br>
            <br>
            Before I get on to the blatant lack of fair process, the
            first thing I must note was Julian's condition. I was badly
            shocked by just how much weight my friend has lost, by the
            speed his hair has receded and by the appearance of
            premature and vastly accelerated ageing. He has a pronounced
            limp I have never seen before. Since his arrest he has lost
            over 15 kg in weight.<br>
            <br>
            But his physical appearance was not as shocking as his
            mental deterioration. When asked to give his name and date
            of birth, he struggled visibly over several seconds to
            recall both. I will come to the important content of his
            statement at the end of proceedings in due course, but his
            difficulty in making it was very evident; it was a real
            struggle for him to articulate the words and focus his train
            of thought.<br>
            <br>
            Until yesterday I had always been quietly skeptical of those
            who claimed that Julian's treatment amounted to torture -
            even of Nils Melzer, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture -
            and skeptical of those who suggested he may be subject to
            debilitating drug treatments. But having attended the trials
            in Uzbekistan of several victims of extreme torture, and
            having worked with survivors from Sierra Leon and elsewhere,
            I can tell you that yesterday changed my mind entirely and
            Julian exhibited exactly the symptoms of a torture victim
            brought blinking into the light, particularly in terms of
            disorientation, confusion, and the real struggle to assert
            free will through the fog of learned helplessness.<br>
            <br>
            I had been even more skeptical of those who claimed, as a
            senior member of his legal team did to me on Sunday night,
            that they were worried that Julian might not live to the end
            of the extradition process. I now find myself not only
            believing it, but haunted by the thought. Everybody in that
            court yesterday saw that one of the greatest journalists and
            most important dissidents of our times is being tortured to
            death by the state, before our eyes. To see my friend, the
            most articulate man, the fastest thinker, I have ever known,
            reduced to that shambling and incoherent wreck, was
            unbearable. Yet the agents of the state, particularly the
            callous magistrate Vanessa Baraitser, were not just prepared
            but eager to be a part of this bloodsport. She actually told
            him that if he were incapable of following proceedings, then
            his lawyers could explain what had happened to him later.
            The question of why a man who, by the very charges against
            him, was acknowledged to be highly intelligent and
            competent, had been reduced by the state to somebody
            incapable of following court proceedings, gave her not a
            millisecond of concern...<br>

                TREATY ORATION 1854</b><br>
              <b>by Roberta Frye Watt</b><br>
            </div>
            <b>Binsford &amp; Mort, Portland Ore., 1934.<br>
              Source: "Four Wagons West,"<br>
              Originally published in the Seattle Sunday Star, Oct. 29
              1887<br>
            </b><br>
            The text was produced by one "Dr." Smith, an early settler
            in Seattle, who took notes as Seattle spoke in the Suquamish
            dialect of central Puget sound Salish (Lushootseed), and
            created this text in English from those notes.<br>
            <br>
            Smith insisted that his version "contained none of the grace
            and elegance of the original".<br>
            <br>
            The last two sentences of the text here given have been
            considered for many years to have been part of the original,
            but are now known to have been added by an early 20th
            century historian and ethnographic writer, A.C. Ballard.<br>
            <br>
            There are many versions and excerpts from this text,
            including a wholly fraudulent version mentioning buffalo and
            the interconnectedness of all life which was written by a
            Hollywood screenwriter in the late 70's and which has gained
            wide currency.<br>
            <b><br>
              The "Alternate Statement" of Chief Seattle...<br>
            </b><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yonder sky that has wept tears of
            compassion upon my people for centuries untold, and which to
            us appears changeless and eternal, may change. Today is
            fair. Tomorrow it may be overcast with clouds.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My words are like the stars that never
            change. Whatever Seattle says, the great chief at Washington
            can rely upon with as much certainty as he can upon the
            return of the sun or the seasons.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The white chief says that Big Chief at
            Washington sends us greetings of friendship and goodwill.
            This is kind of him for we know he has little need of our
            friendship in return.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His people are many. They are like the
            grass that covers vast prairies.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My people are few. They resemble the
            scattering trees of a storm-swept plain. The great, and I
            presume - good, White Chief sends us word that he wishes to
            buy our land but is willing to allow us enough to live
            comfortably.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This indeed appears just, even generous,
            for the Red Man no longer has rights that he need respect,
            and the offer may be wise, also, as we are no longer in need
            of an extensive country.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a time when our people covered
            the land as the waves of a wind-ruffled sea cover its
            shell-paved floor, but that time long since passed away with
            the greatness of tribes that are now but a mournful memory.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not dwell on, nor mourn over, our
            untimely decay, nor reproach my paleface brothers with
            hastening it, as we too may have been somewhat to blame.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Youth is impulsive. When our young men
            grow angry at some real or imaginary wrong, and disfigure
            their faces with black paint, it denotes that their hearts
            are black, and that they are often cruel and relentless, and
            our old men and old women are unable to restrain them.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it has ever been. Thus it was when
            the white man began to push our forefathers ever westward.
            But let us hope that the hostilities between us may never
            return. We would have everything to lose and nothing to
            gain.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Revenge by young men is considered gain,
            even at the cost of their own lives, but old men who stay at
            home in times of war, and mothers who have sons to lose,
            know better.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our good father in Washington - for I
            presume he is now our father as well as yours, since King
            George has moved his boundaries further north - our great
            and good father, I say, sends us word that if we do as he
            desires he will protect us.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His brave warriors will be to us a
            bristling wall of strength, and his wonderful ships of war
            will fill our harbors, so that our ancient enemies far to
            the northward - the Haidas and Tsimshians, will cease to
            frighten our women, children, and old men. He in reality he
            will be our father and we his children.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But can that ever be? Your God is not our
            God...! Your God loves your people and hates mine!<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He folds his strong protecting arms
            lovingly about the paleface and leads him by the hand as a
            father leads an infant son. But, he has forsaken his Red
            children, if they really are his.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our God, the Great Spirit, seems also to
            have forsaken us. Your God makes your people wax stronger
            every day. Soon they will fill all the land.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our people are ebbing away like a rapidly
            receding tide that will never return. The white man's God
            cannot love our people or He would protect them. They seem
            to be orphans who can look nowhere for help.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How then can we be brothers? How can your
            God become our God and renew our prosperity and awaken in us
            dreams of returning greatness?<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we have a common Heavenly Father he
            must be partial, for he came to his paleface children.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We never saw him. He gave you laws but
            had no word for his red children whose teeming multitudes
            once filled this vast continent as stars fill the firmament.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No; we are two distinct races with
            separate origins and separate destinies. There is little in
            common between us.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To us the ashes of our ancestors are
            sacred and their resting place is hallowed ground. You
            wander far from the graves of your ancestors and seemingly
            without regret. Your religion was written upon tablets of
            stone by the iron finger of your God so that you could not
            forget.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Red Man could never comprehend or
            remember it. Our religion is the traditions of our ancestors
            - the dreams of our old men, given them in solemn hours of
            the night by the Great Spirit; and the visions of our
            sachems, and is written in the hearts of our people.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your dead cease to love you and the land
            of their nativity as soon as they pass the portals of the
            tomb and wander away beyond the stars. They are soon
            forgotten and never return.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our dead never forget this beautiful
            world that gave them being.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They still love its verdant valleys, its
            murmuring rivers, its magnificent mountains, sequestered
            vales and verdant lined lakes and bays, and ever yearn in
            tender fond affection over the lonely hearted living, and
            often return from the happy hunting ground to visit, guide,
            console, and comfort them.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Day and night cannot dwell together. The
            Red Man has ever fled the approach of the White Man, as the
            morning mist flees before the morning sun.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, your proposition seems fair and
            I think that my people will accept it and will retire to the
            reservation you offer them.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then we will dwell apart in peace, for
            the words of the Great White Chief seem to be the words of
            nature speaking to my people out of dense darkness.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It matters little where we pass the
            remnant of our days. They will not be many. The Indian's
            night promises to be dark. Not a single star of hope hovers
            above his horizon. Sad-voiced winds moan in the distance.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grim fate seems to be on the Red Man's
            trail, and wherever he will hear the approaching footsteps
            of his fell destroyer and prepare stolidly to meet his doom,
            as does the wounded doe that hears the approaching footsteps
            of the hunter.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few more moons, a few more winters, and
            not one of the descendants of the mighty hosts that once
            moved over this broad land or lived in happy homes,
            protected by the Great Spirit, will remain to mourn over the
            graves of a people once more powerful and hopeful than
            yours.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But why should I mourn at the untimely
            fate of my people?<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tribe follows tribe, and nation follows
            nation, like the waves of the sea. It is the order of
            nature, and regret is useless. Your time of decay may be
            distant, but it will surely come, for even the White Man
            whose God walked and talked with him as friend to friend,
            cannot be exempt from the common destiny.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may be brothers after all. We will
            see...<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will ponder your proposition and when
            we decide we will let you know. But should we accept it, I
            here and now make this condition that we will not be denied
            the privilege without molestation of visiting at any time
            the tombs of our ancestors, friends, and children.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every part of this soil is sacred in the
            estimation of my people. Every hillside, every valley, every
            plain and grove, has been hallowed by some sad or happy
            event in days long vanished.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the rocks, which seem to be dumb and
            dead as the swelter in the sun along the silent shore,
            thrill with memories of stirring events connected with the
            lives of my people, and the very dust upon which you now
            stand responds more lovingly to their footsteps than yours,
            because it is rich with the blood of our ancestors, and our
            bare feet are conscious of the sympathetic touch.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our departed braves, fond mothers, glad,
            happy hearted maidens, and even the little children who
            lived here and rejoiced here for a brief season, will love
            these somber solitudes and at eventide they greet shadowy
            returning spirits.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when the last Red Man shall have
            perished, and the memory of my tribe shall have become a
            myth among the White Men, these shores will swarm with the
            invisible dead of my tribe, and when your children's
            children think themselves alone in the field, the store, the
            shop, upon the highway, or in the silence of the pathless
            woods, they will not be alone. In all the earth there is no
            place dedicated to solitude.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At night when the streets of your cities
            and villages are silent and you think them deserted, they
            will throng with the returning hosts that once filled them
            and still love this beautiful land.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The White Man will never be alone.<br>
            <br>

            </b>The single most important fact about 5G that nobody is
            talking about is called phased array. It will totally
            change the way cell towers and cell phones are constructed
            and will transform the blanket of radiation which has
            enveloped our world for two decades into a million powerful
            beams whizzing by us at all times. Blake Levitt, author of
            Electromagnetic Fields: A Consumers Guide to the Issues and
            How to Protect Ourselves (Harcourt Brace, 1995), brought
            this to my attention. A mutual friend, with whom I was
            speaking during the campaign to defeat S.B. 649 in
            California, passed on a message from Blake: 5G antennas
            will be phased arrays; Arthur will know what that means.

            Individual nutrients such as vitamin C, green tea, N-Acetyl
            Cysteine, and selenium are known to have antiviral
            properties. We investigated these nutrients in combination
            with lysine, proline, arginine and others to evaluate their
            efficacy against the infectivity of human influenza H1N1
            virus. The results showed that this nutrient mixture was
            effective against the key mechanisms of viral infection. For
            example, it:<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;Reduced the multiplication of viruses in the cells by
            82%;<br>
            &nbsp;Reduced the ability of the virus to infect other cells
            by 70%, through inhibiting the same mechanism which is
            targeted by the antiviral drug, Tamiflu®;<br>
            &nbsp;Stabilized and reinforced the connective tissue
            barrier in order to curtail the spread of viruses in the
            tissue.<br>
            <br>
            We compared the efficacy of this nutrient combination to
            that of a single component, vitamin C. The nutrient mixture
            was more effective than vitamin C used alone. It reduced
            viral activity by 87%, compared to 20% achieved with vitamin
            C alone.<br>
            <br>
            Moreover, the micronutrient combination was effective in all
            stages of viral infection, including before, during, and
            even after exposure to a flu virus, thus suggesting its
            enormous potential in natural control of the flu.<br>

            A method and system of amplifying output power produced by a
            solar panel having a shadow cast upon a portion of a surface
            thereof are presented. The system and method utilize
            refractive-reflective sheets such as lenticular sheet,
            and/or diffraction grating sheets to diffuse sunlight to
            illuminate the shadow and thus amplify the output power of
            the solar panel. Alternatively, when no shadow is cast upon
            the panel, the sheets reflect additional sunlight onto the
            panel increasing its output power. The sheets may be used to
            refract, reflect, or both refract and reflect sunlight onto
            the panel. The sheets may be used in combination with bright
            or reflective panels to reflect additional sunlight onto
            said panels to further amplify the output. The system and
            method are applicable to various types of solar panels such
            as thin film, microcrystalline and polycrystalline solar
            panels as well as solar roof tiles or other solar radiation

            A new concept for in-space propulsion is proposed in which
            propellant is not ejected from the engine, but instead is
            captured to create a nearly infinite specific impulse. The
            engine accelerates ions confined in a loop to moderate
            relativistic speeds, and then varies their velocity to make
            slight changes to their mass. The engine then moves ions
            back and forth along the direction of travel to produce
            thrust. This in-space engine could be used for long-term
            satellite station-keeping without refueling. It could also
            propel spacecraft across interstellar distances, reaching
            close to the speed of light. The engine has no moving parts
            other than ions traveling in a vacuum line, trapped inside
            electric and magnetic fields. <br>

            </b>The presence of fetal cells has been associated with
            both positive and negative effects on maternal health. These
            paradoxical effects may be due to the fact that maternal and
            offspring fitness interests are aligned in certain domains
            and conflicting in others, which may have led to the
            evolution of fetal microchimeric phenotypes that can
            manipulate maternal tissues. We use cooperation and conflict
            theory to generate testable predictions about domains in
            which fetal microchimerism may enhance maternal health and
            those in which it may be detrimental. This framework
            suggests that fetal cells may function both to contribute to
            maternal somatic maintenance (e.g. wound healing) and to
            manipulate maternal physiology to enhance resource
            transmission to offspring (e.g. enhancing milk production).
            In this review, we use an evolutionary framework to make
            testable predictions about the role of fetal microchimerism
            in lactation, thyroid function, autoimmune disease, cancer
            and maternal emotional, and psychological health...<br>
            <b><br>
              Conclusions and outlook<br>
              <br>
            </b>Microchimerism is common in humans and has been found
            across eutherian mammals of all placental types. Fetal cells
            have many parallels with the placenta and can perhaps be
            considered a far&#8208;reaching extension of the placenta beyond
            the womb, into maternal tissues during pregnancy and
            lasting long after parturition. The cooperation and conflict
            framework that we propose here can help to organize and
            explain some of the contradictory findings in the literature
            regarding the effects of fetal cells on maternal health.
            However, many important questions remain. A casual role of
            fetal cells (and maternal immune response to fetal cells) in
            maternal health or disease has not yet been definitely
            shown. Improved methods for distinguishing maternal and
            fetal alleles and detecting low levels of microchimerism in
            the blood and maternal tissues will help to advance our
            understanding of the role of fetal microchimerism in
            maternal health and disease. Our framework makes many
            predictions (Fig. 2 and Table 3) that can be tested in
            future work, with potentially important implications for our
            understanding of health and disease pathology, including
            lactation science, thyroid diseases, autoimmune diseases,
            cancer and even maternal emotional, and psychological health
            postpartum. <br>

            <b><br>
            </b>These are the same politicians who lie to you, let Wall
            Street steal your pensions, let Bankers steal trillions of
            your tax dollars and get your friends and relatives to die
            in foreign wars America never needed.<br>
            <br>
            The following is information gleaned from the video by Dr
            John Bergman: The Flu Shot , The government Control of Your
            Immune System<br>
            <br>
            40% of all vaccines are for the flu. 60% of all vaccine
            injuries are for the flu shot. They start giving you that
            flu shot as soon as you are 6 months old and will do so for
            as long as you are alive. There are no long term studies of
            flu shots on your health.<br>
            <br>
            Hint: Senator Sanders, if you want me to nationalize
            healthcare please show your good intentions by first getting
            Big Pharma out of the Health Industrial Complex.<br>
            <br>
            Vaccines are not tested for their overall affects on our
            health, only for a specific disease. Long term studies from
            a pro-vaccine doctor found that decades after receiving DPT
            and Polio shots that there was a five fold increase in
            fatalities in the vaccinated over the unvaccinated.<br>
            <br>
            Look at Vioxx: Out of those patients who took Vioxx, the
            arthritis drug may have caused approximately 140,000 heart
            attacks resulting in an estimated 60,000 deaths, FDA
            investigator Graham. Graham concluded that fundamental
            problems within the FDA led to those deaths.<br>
            <br>
            Another question is race: Hispanics and blacks have a 400%
            increased risk for side effects from certain vaccines.<br>
            <br>
            The federal government has a task force to eliminate egg
            based vaccines for ones to be grown in a single vat from
            monkey kidneys, chicken eggs, dog kidneys, caterpillar eggs
            and aborted human fetus cells. The CDC calls these cell
            based vaccines.<br>
            <br>
            Americans have the highest risk for dementia on planet
            earth. Could that be related to all those vaccines
            containing aluminum? The SIV-40 virus in the polio shot
            increased our risk for lung and brain cancers as adults. SIV
            40 earned its name because it was the 40th virus found in
            polio vaccines that were developed from monkeys.<br>
            <br>
            Researchers discovered that babies up to 6 months of age
            receive 14.7 to 49 times the amount of aluminum as the FDA
            says is safe. The problem is that vaccines need adjuvants to
            trick the immune system into responding. Adjuvants are
            toxic. Aluminum is one. MRC-5 is another. The latter is made
            from aborted fetuses and presents to the body as foreign DNA
            and can lead to auto-immune diseases.<br>
            <br>
            Dr Hugh Fudenburg found that your chances of getting
            Alzheimers increased 1,000% if you had 5 annual flu shots
            as opposed to 1, 2 or none.&nbsp; Dr Fudenburg has 850 peer
            reviewed journal publications.<br>
            <br>
            Flu vaccine studies do not include people over 65 even
            though they make up 75% of all flu related deaths. Despite
            raising flu vaccine coverage from 15% to 65% since 1980
            there has been no reduction in flu related deaths.<br>
            <br>
            Studies paid for by independent sources did not show the
            same pro vaccine conclusions as those paid for by Big
            Pharma.<br>
            <br>
            In the year 2000 flu shots were only given to people over
            50. In 2002 they added healthy babies from 6 to 23 months.
            In 2006 it was all healthy children up tp 5 years and
            pregnant women in any trimester.&nbsp; In 2008 CDC added all
            healthy children up to age 18. In 2009 Homeland Security
            took over after the swine flu scare and said all healthy
            people.<br>

            Dr Julie Gerberding was Director of the CDC from 2002 to
            2009. From 2009 to the present she is President of Mercks
            vaccine division. She was the one who ordered all those flu
            shots.<br>
            <br>
            A Lancet study revealed that if 10 million received the flu
            shot we could expect:<br>
            <br>
            21.5 cases of Guillain Barre syndrome.<br>
            <br>
            86.3 cases of optic neuritis within 6 weeks.<br>
            <br>
            3,970 pregnant women would have a spontaneous abortion
            within one day of vaccination.<br>

            Flu vaccines have zero benefit for infants and for adults
            above age 65.<br>

            Military leaders have said that 7 in 10 young Americans from
            age 17 to 24 are unfit for service. We have the sickest
            population on the planet. 60% of Americans will develop a
            chronic illness from which there is no expectation of
            recovery. 40% will develop two or more chronic incurable
            diseases.<br>

            Canada suspended the flu shot in 2011 because vaccinated
            people were twice as likely to get the disease.<br>
            <br>
            Sugar and a lack of Vitamin D 3 reduces your immune
            response. Vitamin K-2 must be taken with D-3. K-2 has the

            Tylenol dilutes Glutathione&nbsp; and reduces your ability

            million Americans contracted viruses in hospital stays in
            one year. 100,000 died including 18,600 from the super bug
            MRSA. By comparison only 17,000 died from Aids.<br>

            suddenly deciding to shoot themselves twice in the back of
            the head. Police and Coroners in Arkansas, notably Fahmy

            </div>
            <br>
            There is an epidemic of cancer in the world, and this
            epidemic is not under control. With the signing of the
            National Cancer Act of 1971 by then US President Richard
            Nixon, the war against cancer was officially declared. Some
            40 years later, we have spent hundreds of billions of
            dollars on cancer research and the return on this investment
            has been negligible. Cancer remains a major killer for more
            than 500,000 US citizens every year and nothing on the
            horizon looks promising to change this scenario.<br>
            <br>
            Part of the reason for this is that cancer treatment has
            become more of a business manipulated by Big Pharma than a
            service that cures cancer. The bottom line is about return
            on investment, not about service or helping people.<br>
            <br>
            There are a wide range of natural products that cannot be
            patented that have potential to treat cancer. You would
            think that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) would
            sponsor research on these chemicals because it is supported
            by public funds and should therefore be responsive to public
            need. It may surprise you that complementary and alternative
            medicine (CAM) research represents less than 1% of the
            research dollars spent by the NIH. Who, then, is committed
            to doing the research of the people that Big Pharma will not
            support because it has no return on investment? Also
            consider that Big Pharma spends twice as much ($92 billion
            per year) as NIH.<br>
            <br>
            One of these natural products is wormwood extract, or
            artemisinin. This herb had been used by the Chinese for
            thousands of years for treating malaria before it was lost.
            It was rediscovered in 1970 and has slowly returned to
            clinical use, especially for drug resistant falciparum
            malaria, but also for treatment of most cancers.<br>
            <br>
            Artemisinin contains two oxygen atoms hooked together that
            break down in the presence of iron, by creating very
            reactive free radicals that kill malaria parasites and
            cancer cells. Both cancer cells and malaria parasites
            sequester iron, accumulating as much as 1000 times what
            normal cells store. Giving artemisinin to people with
            malaria or cancer results in destruction of these abnormal
            cells and leaves normal cells unaffected. Artemisinin is a
            cancer bomb!<br>
            <br>
            Generally, chemotherapy is toxic to both cancer cells and
            normal cells. In the case of artemisinin this is not true;
            only the cancer cells are damaged. In more than 4000 case
            studies, no significant toxicity from artemisinin has been
            found, which makes it far different than conventional
            chemotherapy.<br>
            <br>
            Results from clinical trials are conspicuously absent.
            However, there a numerous individual case reports suggesting
            that artemisinin works in vitro (in test tubes) and in both
            animals and human beings with far advanced cancer. I would
            suggest reviewing the work of Christina L. White's two part
            series on Cancer Smart Bomb at
            http://www.mwt.net/~drbrewer/canart....<br>
            <br>
            There are three forms of artemisinin: artemisinin,
            artesunate, and artemether. All are absorbed well after oral
            intake and cross the blood brain barrier. They are best
            absorbed on an empty stomach. The intestine builds up
            resistance to absorbing, so it is wise to only take the drug
            for a few days and then stopping for a few days as this
            resistance is reversible.<br>
            <br>
            Artemisinin and its derivatives offer the possibility of
            using a non-toxic form of chemotherapy that is inexpensive
            and readily available. Because of its excellent safety
            profile, it should be a consideration for cancer treatment
            when conventional treatments have failed or when people
            refuse conventional therapies <br>

                lifespan and causes brain neurodegeneration in
                Drosophila</b><br>

              Abstract</b><br>
            Light is necessary for life, but prolonged exposure to
            artificial light is a matter of increasing health concern.
            Humans are exposed to increased amounts of light in the blue
            spectrum produced by light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which can
            interfere with normal sleep cycles. The LED technologies are
            relatively new; therefore, the long-term effects of exposure
            to blue light across the lifespan are not understood. We
            investigated the effects of light in the model organism,
            Drosophila melanogaster, and determined that flies
            maintained in daily cycles of 12-h blue LED and 12-h
            darkness had significantly reduced longevity compared with
            flies maintained in constant darkness or in white light with
            blue wavelengths blocked. Exposure of adult flies to 12&#8201;h of
            blue light per day accelerated aging phenotypes causing
            damage to retinal cells, brain neurodegeneration, and
            impaired locomotion. We report that brain damage and
            locomotor impairments do not depend on the degeneration in
            the retina, as these phenotypes were evident under blue
            light in flies with genetically ablated eyes. Blue light
            induces expression of stress-responsive genes in old flies
            but not in young, suggesting that cumulative light exposure
            acts as a stressor during aging. We also determined that
            several known blue-light-sensitive proteins are not acting
            in pathways mediating detrimental light effects. Our study
            reveals the unexpected effects of blue light on fly brain
            and establishes Drosophila as a model in which to
            investigate long-term effects of blue light at the cellular
            and organismal level.<br>

            nanoparticles that could lead to better fuel cells, among

                Large Sunspot Group and Great Auroral Storms around the
                Carrington Event in 1859</b><br>
              <b>Hisashi Hayakawa, et al.</b><br>
            </div>
            <b>Abstract<br>
            </b>The Carrington event is considered to be one of the most
            extreme space weather events in observational history within
            a series of magnetic storms caused by extreme interplanetary
            coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) from a large and complex
            active region (AR) emerged on the solar disk. In this
            article, we study the temporal and spatial evolutions of the
            source sunspot active region and visual aurorae, and compare
            this storm with other extreme space weather events on the
            basis of their spatial evolution. Sunspot drawings by
            Schwabe, Secchi, and Carrington describe the position and
            morphology of the source AR at that time. Visual auroral
            reports from the Russian Empire, Iberia, Ireland, Oceania,
            and Japan fill the spatial gap of auroral visibility and
            revise the time series of auroral visibility in mid to low
            magnetic latitudes (MLATs). The reconstructed time series is
            compared with magnetic measurements and shows the
            correspondence between low to mid latitude aurorae and the
            phase of magnetic storms. The spatial evolution of the
            auroral oval is compared with those of other extreme space
            weather events in 1872, 1909, 1921, and 1989 as well as
            their storm intensity, and contextualizes the Carrington
            event, as one of the most extreme space weather events, but
            likely not unique.<br>

            </b>... The U.S. Navy has filed a potentially revolutionary
            patent application for a radical new compact fusion reactor
            that claims to improve upon the shortcomings of the Skunk
            Works CFR, and judging from the identity of the reactors
            inventor, it's sure to raise eyebrows in the scientific
            community...<br>

                Myth  Opponents Want to Silence it at Film Festivals</b><br>
              <b>by Brian Shilhavy</b><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            A new film exposing the corruption behind much of the Shaken
            Baby Syndrome diagnosis used to remove children from the
            custody of their parents, and in some cases put parents
            behind bars, is currently making its way through the film
            festival circuit. The Syndrome is a film produced and
            directed by Meryl Goldsmith, a Los Angeles-based filmmaker
            who teamed up with her cousin and investigative reporter
            Susan Goldsmith as the co-producer and editor. It is Meryl
            Goldsmiths feature directorial debut, according to the
            films website. Included in the cast are doctors and law
            professors.<br>
            <br>
            Lauren Kirchner, writing for the Pacific Standard Magazine,
            recently interviewed Susan Goldsmith and discussed the
            opposition the film has received from the medical community:<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the films subjects have
            dedicated their professional lives to gaining attention to
            updated research on child injuries, and to defending accused
            abusers in court. For this, they have faced a huge backlash
            from the doctors and prosecutors who disagree. The
            filmmakers knew theyd get swept up in that, too. Many film
            festivals that considered including the film were threatened
            with litigation, and accused of promoting child abuse, the
            filmmakers said in a recent interview.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a theme in our filmhow the
            proponents of shaken baby syndrome and abusive head trauma
            have tried to silence their critics, Susan Goldsmith says.
            And that theme is extending to here and now, to our
            documentary. I was expecting it. We thought we were helping
            by uncovering these other medical conditions that can look
            like abuse, but are not [abuse]. It actually threatens the
            entire shaken baby syndrome working group and industrial
            complex.<br>
            <br>
            Kirchner writes that those who support Shaken Baby Syndrome
            in the medical field are part of a powerful and influential
            group, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the
            National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome. Before the films
            first screening, they tried to get the Kansas International
            Film Festival to block the film, calling it dangerous even
            though they had not viewed it...<br>

            <div align="center"><b>Study: In 96% of Shaken Baby Syndrome
                Cases Analyzed Infants Had Metabolic Bone Disorders</b><br>
              <b>by Brian Shilhavy</b><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            A new study just published in the Journal of Pediatric
            Endocrinology and Metabolism reveals that over 96% of the
            cases analyzed where child abuse was claimed to be the cause
            of multiple unexplained fractures in young children, the
            children had an underlying metabolic bone disease that would
            explain the multiple fractures.<br>
            <br>
            The study was conducted by three medical doctors: Marvin
            Miller, MD, Dayton Childrens Hospital, Department of
            Medical Genetics; Adrienne Stolfi, Department of Pediatrics,
            Wright State University Boonshoft School of Medicine; and
            David Ayoub, Clinical Radiologists, SC.<br>
            <br>
            The title of the study is: Findings of metabolic bone
            disease in infants with unexplained fractures in contested
            child abuse investigations: a case series of 75 infants.<br>
            <br>
            The study is significant because it suggests that many
            parents and caregivers have been wrongly accused of child
            abuse based only on x-rays of broken bones interpreted by
            Child Abuse Pediatricians as being caused by child abuse.
            The false accusations frequently result in the parents being
            tried as criminals, and losing their children.<br>
            <br>
            Radiologist Dr. David Ayoub, one of the authors of the
            study, has previously stated that he believes there are
            tens of thousands of innocent parents incarcerated today
            due to false child abuse charges.<br>
            <br>
            And given the fact that Child Protective Service agencies
            all across the U.S. frequently remove children from their
            homes with no formal charges ever filed against the parents,
            the number of children medically kidnapped from their
            parents, usually by the testimony of a Child Abuse
            pediatrician, could easily be in the hundreds of thousands.<br>
            <br>
            This is a national crisis.<br>
            <br>
            There are over 400,000 children in the formal U.S. foster
            care system, and according to law professor Josh
            Gupta-Kagan, at least that many in the hidden foster care
            system.<br>
            <br>
            The evidence today is overwhelming that the vast majority of
            these children, close to one million children, never should
            have been removed from their families in the first place.<br>
            Causes of Brittle Bone Disorders<br>
            <br>
            The authors of this study state that when infants show
            multiple unexplained fractures (MUFs), medical reasons
            other than child abuse need to be explored. From the study:<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When cases of infants with MUF are
            critically evaluated for explanations other than child
            abuse, predisposing factors for metabolic bone disease,
            mostly fetal in origin, are often noted. These factors are
            consistent with the contemporary model of bone physiology,
            the Utah Paradigm as shown in Figure 1, and include the
            following 7 risk factors:<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) in
            pregnancy<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Decreased fetal bone loading<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Prematurity<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Maternal use of acid lowering drugs
            during pregnancy that can decrease calcium absorption<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Maternal use of phosphate binding
            drugs during pregnancy that can decrease phosphate
            absorption<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Gestational diabetes<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome/joint
            hypermobility in parents and/or infant<br>
            <br>
            Child Abuse Pediatricians: A Medical Profession Dependent on
            Finding Child Abuse<br>
            <br>
            As we have reported numerous times over the years, the
            relatively new pediatric specialty of Child Abuse
            Specialist has resulted in an increase in medical
            kidnappings. These doctors usually make accusations of child
            abuse simply on the basis of radiology tests, and often
            never examine the child, nor interview the parents or the
            family pediatrician who cares for the family.<br>
            <br>
            Their job is dependent on finding child abuse and putting
            children into the lucrative multi-billion dollar child
            trafficking business known today as foster care.<br>
            <br>
            All across the country today, judges and courts are
            overturning convictions of child abuse against parents who
            were convicted solely based on the testimony of a Child
            Abuse doctor. If other testimony exploring medical reasons
            for why a child may exhibit signs such as multiple
            unexplained fractures was not presented during the trial,
            the case is almost always overturned today.<br>
            <br>
            The problem is so widespread, that laws schools across the
            country, as well as the American Bar Association, are
            providing training to attorneys on how to fight against
            charges of Shaken Baby Syndrome, or Child Abuse, in cases
            where the testimony of a Child Abuse Specialist is used to
            take children away from their parents and accuse the parents
            of child abuse.<b><br>

            </b>Snowden said this week: "I wouldn't use WiFi at home,
            because global maps of every wireless access point's unique
            IDincluding yoursare free and constantly updated. I would
            use ethernet; yes, ethernet on a phone." Using ethernet on
            your phone? I explain why you shouldn't turn your wifi
            router on, and why you shouldn't turn your phone into a
            hotspot. It's shocking how unsafe it makes your location. <b><br>

            <b><br>
            </b>...Another trait possessed by the tardigrade is an
            ability to withstand levels of radiation that would be
            dangerous to the DNA of regular beings. In a 2016 study,
            scientists uncovered a reason for this finding that
            tardigrades, and only tardigrades, possess a unique protein
            called a Dsup (damage suppressor), which greatly improves
            the resistance of their DNA to ionizing radiation that could
            otherwise cause mutations. Adding Dsup to human cells in
            culture bestowed them with a similar resistance...<br>
            <br>
            Now scientists at the University of California (UC) San
            Diego have probed the mechanics behind this a little
            further. Using a range of advanced biochemical techniques,
            the team was able to tease out some interesting insights
            about how tardigrades enter survival mode.<br>
            <br>
            The Dsup protein was found to bind to a mish-mash of protein
            and DNA material inside the cells called chromatin. Once
            mated to the chromatin, the two combine to generate a
            protective cloud that repels what are known as hydroxyl
            radicals. These particles are produced when ionizing
            radiation, such as an X-ray, encounters water molecules, and
            generally speaking cause damage to DNA inside cells. But not
            if they cant get to it, they dont.<br>
            <br>
            We now have a molecular explanation for how Dsup protects
            cells from X-ray irradiation, says Kadonaga, a
            distinguished professor and the Amylin Endowed Chair in
            Lifesciences Education and Research. We see that it has two
            parts, one piece that binds to chromatin and the rest of it
            forming a kind of cloud that protects the DNA from hydroxyl
            radicals....<br>

            <br>
            Contrary to popular belief, cartilage in human joints can
            repair itself through a process similar to that used by
            creatures such as salamanders and zebrafish to regenerate
            limbs, researchers at Duke Health found.<br>
            <br>
            Publishing online Oct. 9 in the journal Science Advances,
            the researchers identified a mechanism for cartilage repair
            that appears to be more robust in ankle joints and less so
            in hips. The finding could potentially lead to treatments
            for osteoarthritis, the most common joint disorder in the
            world.<br>
            <br>
            "We believe that an understanding of this 'salamander-like'
            regenerative capacity in humans, and the critically missing
            components of this regulatory circuit, could provide the
            foundation for new approaches to repair joint tissues and
            possibly whole human limbs," said senior author Virginia
            Byers Kraus, M.D., Ph.D., a professor in the departments of

            </b>Climate alarmists Michael Mann and Katharine Hayhoe have
            been caught using dubious, revisionist temperature data in
            their attempt, as one Climategate email author put it,&nbsp;
            to deal a mortal blow to the extensively documented
            Medieval Warm Period.<br>
            <br>
            Before climate change became a political issue, it was
            scientifically well-established that a significant global
            warming event occurred between approximately 900 AD and 1200
            AD. For example, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel
            on Climate Change (IPCC) First Assessment Report presented a
            temperature history and visual graph documenting that the
            Medieval Warm Period existed and that it brought
            temperatures at least as warm as today (at pg. 7). Multiple
            peer-reviewed studies provided additional confirmation of
            the Medieval Warm Period...<br>

            </b>The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
            Change (UN IPCC) is misleading humanity about climate change
            and sea levels, a leading expert on sea-level who served on
            the UN IPCC told The New American. In fact, it is more
            likely that sea-levels will decline, not rise, explained Dr.
            Nils-Axel Mörner, the retired head of the paleogeophysics
            and geodynamics at Stockholm University. A new solar-driven
            cooling period is not far off, he said. But when Mörner
            tried to warn the UN IPCC that it was publishing false
            information that would inevitably be discredited, they
            simply ignored him. And so, dismayed, he resigned in disgust
            and decided to blow the whistle. Asked if coastal cities
            such as Miami would be flooding due to sea-level rise caused
            by alleged man-made global warming, Mörner was unequivocal:
            Absolutely not. There is no rapid sea-level rise going on
            today, and there will not be, he said, citing the
            observable data. On the contrary, if anything happens, the
            sea will go down a little. The widely respected scientist,
            who has been tracking sea levels in various parts of the
            globe for some 50 years, blasted those who use incorrect
            correction factors in their data to try to make it appear
            that the seas are rising worldwide. That is just wrong, he
            said...<br>

            </b>Were in a carbon drought. That is according to
            Professor William Happer of Princeton University. The
            renowned physicist says when it comes to carbon dioxide,
            theres more good than bad. He goes on to say most of carbon
            dioxides effect has already happened. He points to the
            logarithmic dependence of temperature on carbon dioxide
            levels. Happer says the unique properties of carbon dioxide
            mean that current levels would need to double for another
            one-degree increase in temperature and theyd have to double
            again for another one degree rise.<br>

            </b>What we are seeing here are people (industrial clients)
            from birth on being transitioned to private property. This
            stuff is astonishing as to how people are being privatized
            as property. See the irony: Feminists screaming and
            hollering for the right to have abortions and for the state
            to stay out of their bodies. They have no clue they
            themselves are private property. This is about the inventory
            of people on massive data bases  humanoids along with their
            complete history since birth, all their assets (insurance
            and health records including all vaccinations) and all
            personal records used in analytics. This is probably being
            built out for social credit systems being incrementally
            introduced into the population who are now all permanently
            transfixed to their smart phones.<br>

            In the 1970s Irving Kristol declared Republicans to be the
            stupid party.&nbsp; How correct he has proven to be.&nbsp;
            Russiagate and now this latest coup attempt to overthrow the
            elected president of the United States are acts of
            sedition.&nbsp; There is no evidence whatsoever for the
            charges with which the Democrats and US media, parroted all
            over the world by other news agencies, are libeling
            Trump.&nbsp; Indeed, we have many known felonies committed
            by Obama regime officials who orchestrated the Steele
            Dossier and Russiagate. We have overpowering evidence that
            the Obama FBI covered up Hillary Clintons felonies.&nbsp;
            We have overpowering evidence that Obama CIA director John
            Brennan orchestrated, or set in motion with his false
            allegations, Russiagate.<br>
            <br>
            That the Democrats and their handlers have an ongoing coup
            against the President of the United States is
            undeniable.&nbsp; High treason is written all over it. The
            few educated and aware Americans who still exist can see it
            clearly. We are watching to see if the insouciant American
            people succumb to propaganda that is terminating the United
            States.&nbsp; Something will still be here, but it wont be
            America.&nbsp; What remains will be a Tower of Babel, the
            disunity of which makes it easily controllable by the Deep
            State. Or, if insouciant white Americans ever realize that
            they are on the genocide list, civil war could erupt between
            ethnic Americans and the nonwhite immigrants flooded into
            the country by the Democrats hoping to use their votes to
            keep governmental power in Democrat hands...<br>

            <br>
            On this point, William Branham, a prophecy preacher who at
            one time was Americas most well-known evangelist, gave very
            specific prophecies that were published in 1933 concerning
            events that would transpire in the years leading to
            Antichrist. His predictions turned out to be surprisingly
            accurate. He foresaw Mussolini invading Ethiopia, America
            being drawn into a world war against Germany when it would
            be led by a man named Adolf Hitler, the growth of communism
            under Russia, egg-shaped cars driving themselves in a
            technological future age, and so on. But in his sixth and
            seventh visions, he beheld a woman in the United States
            clothed in splendor, and great power was given to herthere
            was a hardness about her that defied description. she was
            yet cruel, wicked and cunning. She dominated the land with
            her authority, and she had complete power over the people.<br>
            <br>
            Following this came his seventh vision, in which he says a
            voice bade him to look once more. As he turned and beheld,
            a great explosion rent the entire land, and left the land of
            America a smoldering, chaotic ruin. As far as the eye could
            see there was nothing but craters, smoking piles of debris,
            and no humanity in sight. The vision then faded
            away.[xviii]<br>
            <br>
            Such an explosion can only describe an atomic bomb, which
            was not even tested until 1945, twelve years later.<br>
            <br>
            If Branham foresaw this future scenario accurately, the rise
            of Hilarion in 2020 could quickly lead to the consummation
            of the deep occultism of the deep state...<br>

            I had a couple friends over at my place. While I was out
            smoking a cigarette I thought I heard some knocking but
            wasnt expecting anyone so didnt think much of it. The
            knocking turned into a couple bangs, I look out the peep
            hole and saw a guy with a mask and his lil friend behind
            him. I locked the door thinking theyll hear it know
            someones there and leave but they didnt. So I went and
            grabbed my rifle. Extremely thankful I got to the door when
            I did. VERY glad I had it. Never get to comfortable thinking
            nothing can happen, stay safe out here how ever you see fit.
            I did not pull the trigger at all Im guessing those noises
            are the door hitting the wall or the camera switching modes.<br>

                  used to extend the lifespan of fruit flies by 48% in a
                  new study led by UCL and the Max Planck Institute for
                  Biology of Ageing.</b><br>
              </div>
              <br>
              The three drugs are all already in use as medical
              treatments: lithium as a mood stabiliser, trametinib as a
              cancer treatment and rapamycin as an immune system
              regulator.<br>
              <br>
              The findings, published in Proceedings of the National
              Academy of Sciences (PNAS), suggest that a combination
              drug treatment may one day be helpful at preventing
              age-related diseases in people.<br>
              <br>
              "As life expectancies increase, we are also seeing an
              increase of age-related diseases so there is an urgent
              need to find ways to improve health in old age," said the
              study's co-lead author, Dr Jorge Castillo-Quan, who began
              the research at the UCL Institute of Healthy Ageing before
              moving to Joslin Diabetes Center, Harvard Medical School.<br>
              <br>
              "Here, by studying fruit flies which age much more rapidly
              than people, we have found that a combination drug
              treatment targeting different cellular processes may be an
              effective way to slow down the ageing process."<br>
              <br>
              The researchers were building on previous studies finding
              that lithium, trametinib and rapamycin can each extend
              lifespan in fruit flies (Drosophila), which is supported
              by other preliminary evidence in mice, worms, and cells,
              and observational findings in people.<br>
              <br>
              The three drugs all act on different cellular signalling
              pathways that together form the nutrient sensing network,
              which is conserved across evolution from worms and flies
              all the way to humans. This network adjusts what the body
              is doing in response to changes in nutrient levels. The
              three drugs in question act on different proteins of this
              network to slow the ageing process and delay the onset of
              age-related death.<br>
              <br>
              For the latest study, the researchers gave fruit flies
              doses of lithium, trametinib and rapamycin, separately and
              in combination. Each drug individually extended lifespan
              by an average of 11%, while pairing two drugs extended
              lifespan by roughly 30%. When the three drugs were
              combined, the fruit flies lived 48% longer than flies in a
              control group that were not given the treatment...<br>

                Abstract</b><br>
              Increasing life expectancy is causing the prevalence of
              age-related diseases to rise, and there is an urgent need
              for new strategies to improve health at older ages.
              Reduced activity of insulin/insulin-like growth factor
              signaling (IIS) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)
              nutrient-sensing signaling network can extend lifespan and
              improve health during aging in diverse organisms. However,
              the extensive feedback in this network and adverse side
              effects of inhibition imply that simultaneous targeting of
              specific effectors in the network may most effectively
              combat the effects of aging. We show that the
              mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor
              trametinib, the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibitor
              rapamycin, and the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)
              inhibitor lithium act additively to increase longevity in
              Drosophila. Remarkably, the triple drug combination
              increased lifespan by 48%. Furthermore, the combination of
              lithium with rapamycin cancelled the latters effects on
              lipid metabolism. In conclusion, a polypharmacology
              approach of combining established, prolongevity drug
              inhibitors of specific nodes may be the most effective way
              to target the nutrient-sensing network to improve
              late-life health.<br>

              <b>Summary</b><b><br>
              </b>Studies show that glyphosate and Roundup negatively
              affect friendly gut bacteria and favour the growth of
              harmful bacteria. This raises the question as to whether
              glyphosate and Roundups negative impacts on gut bacteria
              could contribute to findings of other toxic effects seen
              in animal and human epidemiological studies on these
              substances. In humans, disturbed gut bacteria is found in
              people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), diarrhea, and
              malnutrition, as well as in a subset of autistic people.
              It may play a role in multisystem organ failure and colon
              cancer.<br>
              <br>
              An in vitro study carried out to investigate the rise in
              botulism disease in cattle in the past 1015 years found
              that glyphosate and Roundup were toxic to beneficial gut
              bacteria that inhibit the growth of the botulism-causing
              bacterium Clostridium botulinum, but non-toxic to the
              botulism-causing bacteria themselves. In short, glyphosate
              and Roundup favoured the growth of botulism-causing
