      <b> </b><b>Lasers can help damaged teeth grow back, researchers
        say</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      <b> </b><b>By Jacob Kastrenakes</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      When you damage a tooth, your dentist usually uses a filling or a
      crown to patch it up. But eventually, researchers say that your
      dentist might just point a laser at it, encouraging the tooth to
      regrow on its own. While it's no surprise that light causes
      reactions in the human body, some researchers have been trying to
      determine whether specific wavelengths of light might be able to
      trigger specific healing properties when focused on a certain area
      of the body. In this case, the researchers pointed an infrared
      laser at a hole drilled into a rat's tooth and found that it
      encouraged dentin — the material that makes up a tooth's core — to
      grow back more than it otherwise would have.<br>
      <br>
      ""It would be a substantial advance in the field.""The research
      was led from Harvard's Wyss Institute and is being published today
      in Science Translational Medicine. "Lasers are routinely used in
      medicine and dentistry, so the barriers to clinical translation
      are low," David Mooney, the research team's leader, says in a
      statement. "It would be a substantial advance in the field if we
      can regenerate teeth rather than replace them."<br>
      <br>
      Though the laser light was able to make stem cells turn into new
      dentin, it wasn't a direct change. Instead, the laser set off a
      chain reaction, triggering one molecule, which triggered another,
      which finally set the stem cells in motion. That the researchers
      have been able to track that reaction all the way back, they say,
      is critical, because it allows them to actually prove the infrared
      laser's efficacy, rather than adding further anecdotal evidence to
      the heap of literature on laser therapies for a clinical study.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers believe that this method, known as low-level light
      therapy, has the potential to trigger cells elsewhere in the body
      to similar reparative results. They won't be trying that next,
      however: instead, they plan to move on to human trials, and
      they're currently working with one of the National Institutes of
      Health to set up safety regulations.<br>

      Rapid advancements in the field of stem cell biology have led to
      many current efforts to exploit stem cells as therapeutic agents
      in regenerative medicine. However, current ex vivo cell
      manipulations common to most regenerative approaches create a
      variety of technical and regulatory hurdles to their clinical
      translation, and even simpler approaches that use exogenous
      factors to differentiate tissue-resident stem cells carry
      significant off-target side effects. We show that non-ionizing,
      low-power laser (LPL) treatment can instead be used as a minimally
      invasive tool to activate an endogenous latent growth factor
      complex, transforming growth factor–ß1 (TGF-ß1), that subsequently
      differentiates host stem cells to promote tissue regeneration. LPL
      treatment induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a
      dose-dependent manner, which, in turn, activated latent TGF-ß1
      (LTGF-ß1) via a specific methionine residue (at position 253 on
      LAP). Laser-activated TGF-ß1 was capable of differentiating human
      dental stem cells in vitro. Further, an in vivo pulp capping model
      in rat teeth demonstrated significant increase in dentin
      regeneration after LPL treatment. These in vivo effects were
      abrogated in TGF-ß receptor II (TGF-ßRII) conditional knockout
      (DSPPCreTGF-ßRIIfl/fl) mice or when wild-type mice were given a
      TGF-ßRI inhibitor. These findings indicate a pivotal role for
      TGF-ß in mediating LPL-induced dental tissue regeneration. More
      broadly, this work outlines a mechanistic basis for harnessing
      resident stem cells with a light-activated endogenous cue for
      clinical regenerative applications.<br>

      <b>Abstract </b><br>
      <br>
      Embodiments herein comprise the dental treatment system, dental
      laser system and applicators, and methods for their use in dental
      pulp capping, wound healing, bone healing, and the induction of
      differentiation of stem cells.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      [0003] Embodiments of the invention relates to dental pulp
      capping, odontogenesis, stem cell differentiation, tissue healing
      and tissue regeneration.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      [0004] Laser systems have many useful applications to the
      treatment of surfaces, in the industrial field as well as in the
      medical and dental field. Lasers have become valuable medical
      instruments, particularly in the field of dentistry. For example,
      dentists use lasers for a variety of purposes: (1) detection and
      treatment of tooth decay; (2) detection and treatment of gum
      disease, e.g. reshape the gum and crown lengthening; (3) for
      obtaining biopsy and removal; (4) for teeth whitening; (5)
      reduction of tooth sensitivity; (6) promoting nerve regeneration;
      (7) treatment of temporomandibular joint disease; and (8)
      treatment of sleep apnea.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Numerous laser devices and methods of use thereof are
      available for medical and dental applications, see e.g., U.S.
      Patent Nos. 4,461,294; 5,336,217; 5,388,987; 5,456, 603;
      5,964,749; 6,120,497; 6,273,885; 7,665,467; 7,867,223; US Patent
      Publication No:2011/0027744. Although the current devices and
      methods may work well for their intended purposes, they pose some
      drawbacks. With today's demand and wide variety of different
      applications, there is a strong desire to develop more versatile
      devices that can be applied with fewer drawbacks. SUMMARY OF THE
      INVENTION<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Embodiments of the present invention are based on the
      observations that low power laser (LPL) irradiations can induce
      stem cells to differentiate. The inventors demonstrated that an
      infrared (810 nm) low power laser can direct odontgenic
      differentiation of human dental stem cells; the differentiation
      was verified by activation of intracellular signaling,
      extracellular matrix production and calcium deposition.
      Furthermore, the inventors observed that the LPL induces multiple
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) that, in turn, is capable of
      activating the latent transforming growth factor [beta]
      (LTGF-[beta]) complex as a key signaling mediator, e.g., in oral
      wound healing. These observations indicate the utility of LPL as
      an alternative, non-invasive clinical tool in dental applications,
      e.g., dental pulp capping, and also for stem cell differentiation
      and related applications, e.g., in oral wound healing, general
      wound healing, healing of bone fractures or bone fusions.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] It is the objective of this invention to provide a dental
      treatment system and a dental laser system for inducing,
      stimulating and/or promoting dentinogenesis, for inducing,
      stimulating and/or promoting stem cell differentiation, and for
      inducing, stimulating and/or promoting tissue repair or
      regeneration.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] It is also the objective of this invention to provide a
      method of stimulating dentinogenesis in a subject.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In addition, it is the objective of this invention to
      provide a method of dental pulp capping in a subject.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Furthermore, it is the objective of this invention to
      provide a method for inducing, stimulating and/or promoting stem
      cell differentiation, and a method for inducing, stimulating
      and/or promoting tissue repair or regeneration.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Accordingly, in one embodiment, provided herein is a dental
      treatment system for inducing dentinogenesis, the system
      comprising: a source of irradiation, the source being adapted to
      produce irradiation having a wavelength in the range of 780 nm to
      840 nm and a power output in the range of 5 mW to 300 mW; a
      control element controlling the source of irradiation to turn the
      source of laser irradiation on and to turn the source of laser
      irradiation off; and a timer operatively connected to the control
      element to activate the source of irradiation to produce
      irradiation for a pre-determined time period and then deactivate
      the source of irradiation from producing radiation, resulting in
      the application of a pre-determined dose of irradiation to a
      target.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In one embodiment, the dental treatment system further
      comprising a collimator coupled to the source of irradiation and
      collimating the irradiation produced by the source of irradiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In one embodiment, the laser treatment system further
      comprises a switch element operatively connected to and
      controlling the timer.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In one embodiment, the switch element is a foot operated
      switch. The foot switch provides a "hands-free" approach for the
      operator using the laser treatment system, e.g., the operator is a
      dentist.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In one embodiment, the timer controls the source of
      irradiation to apply a dosage of between 1 - 10 J/cm of
      irradiation to a target location. In one preferred embodiment, the
      dosage is 3 J/cm .<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In one embodiment, the source of irradiation produces laser
      irradiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] In one embodiment, the source of irradiation includes a
      diode laser.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] In one embodiment, the source of irradiation includes a
      laser selected from the group including but is not limited to gas
      lasers, dye lasers, semiconductor lasers and solid state lasers.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] In another embodiment, provided herein is a dental laser
      system for inducing dentinogenesis in a target, the system
      comprising: a source of laser irradiation, the source being
      adapted to produce laser irradiation having a wavelength of 810
      nm; a control element controlling operation of the source of
      irradiation to turn the source of laser irradiation on and to turn
      the source of laser irradiation off; and a timer operatively
      connected to the control element to turn the source of laser
      irradiation on for a pre-determined time period and then turn the
      source of laser irradiation off and wherein the pre-determined
      time period is determined to apply a dose of 3 J/cm on the target.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] In one embodiment, the target is a living organism. In one
      embodiment, the target is a location on or in the organism. In
      another embodiment, the target comprises living tissues that can
      respond to the irradiation of the dental treatment or laser
      system. In another embodiment, the target comprises living tissues
      that comprises a population of stem cells. In one embodiment, the
      stem cells can respond to the irradiation of the dental treatment
      or laser system, e.g., differentiate to a cell that is further
      along the lineage of that original stem cell. For example, the
      target is an exposed dental pulp having a population of dental
      stem cells within. Upon the irradiation of the dental treatment or
      laser system described, the dental stem cells differentiate to
      odontoblasts.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In another embodiment, provided herein is a method of
      stimulating<br>
      dentinogenesis in a subject, the method comprising exposing a
      tissue comprising a population of dental pulp stem cells to a
      laser output from the dental treatment system or dental laser
      system described herein, whereby the dental pulp stem cells is
      induced to differentiate to odontoblasts.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In another embodiment, provided herein is a method of
      dental pulp capping in a subject, the method comprising exposing a
      tissue comprising an exposed dental pulp to a laser output from
      the dental treatment system or dental laser system described
      herein, whereby increased dentin matrix is secreted. The induced
      increase in secretion of dentin matrix is from inside of the tooth
      and the direction of secretion is outwards of the tooth. This
      "inside out" approach function to fill in space of the hole where
      the dental pulp is exposed to the exterior and eventually enclose
      the pulp. This "inside out" approach is advantageous over the
      current "outside in" approach because it precludes any bacteria
      from being trapped within the pulp after capping is completed.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In one embodiment, provided herein is a method for inducing
      and/or promoting stem cell differentiation, the method comprising:
      (a) contacting a tissue comprising a population of stem cells with
      an effective amount of a metal ion; and (b) exposing the tissue
      comprising the population of stem cells in step (a) to one or more
      irradiation, wherein the one or more irradiation are sufficient,
      individually or collectively, to induce differentiation of stem
      cells, wherein each dose of irradiation is of a pre-determined
      period of time resulting in the application of a pre-determined
      dose of irradiation to the tissue, whereby the irradiation induces
      the population of stem cells to differentiate.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] In one embodiment, provided herein is a method of inducing
      differentiation of stem cells, the method comprising exposing a
      population of stem cells or a tissue comprising a population of
      stem cells to a dose of irradiation for a period of time, wherein
      the irradiation has a wavelength in the range of 780 nm to 840 nm
      ranges, and provides an irradiation dosage ranging 2<br>
      from 1 to 10 joule per cm within a period of time of between 2 - 8
      minutes, whereby the irradiation induces the population of stem
      cells to differentiate.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In another embodiment, provided herein is a method of
      inducing dentinogenesis in a subject, the method comprising
      exposing a tissue comprising a population of dental pulp stem
      cells to a dose of irradiation for a period of time, wherein the
      irradiation has a wavelength in the range of 780 nm to 840 nm
      ranges, and provides an irradiation dosage ranging from 1 to 10
      joule per cm within a period of time of between 2 - 8 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] In one embodiment, provided herein is a method of dental
      pulp capping in a subject, the method comprising exposing a tissue
      comprising an exposed dentine pulp to a dose of irradiation for a
      period of time, wherein the irradiation has a wavelength in the
      range of 780 nm to 840 nm ranges, and provides an irradiation
      dosage ranging from 1 to 10 joule per cm for a period of time of
      between 2 - 8 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In one embodiment of any of these methods described, the
      tissues are exposed to more than one irradiation dose.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In one embodiment of any of these methods described, the
      irradiation is laser irradiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In one preferred embodiment of any of these methods
      described, the dosage of laser irradiation is 3 joule per cm .<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In one preferred embodiment of any of these methods
      described, the period of time is about 5 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In one preferred embodiment of any of these methods
      described, the laser irradiation has a wavelength is 810 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In one embodiment of any of these methods described herein
      further comprising contacting the population of stem cells, the
      exposed dentine pulp of a tooth, or the population of odontoblasts
      with metal ions prior to exposure to the laser irradiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In one embodiment of any of these methods described, the
      metal ion is a divalent metal ion. [0034] In one embodiment of any
      of these methods described, the divalent metal is selected from a
      group consisting of lithium, barium, magnesium, copper, iron,
      manganese, and zinc.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In one embodiment of any of these methods described herein
      further comprising contacting the population of stem cells, the
      exposed dentine pulp of a tooth, or the population of odontoblasts
      with at least one agent that activates or up-regulates the Wnt
      pathway. In one embodiment, the contacting is prior to exposure to
      the laser irradiation. In another embodiment, the contacting is
      after exposure to the laser irradiation. In the embodiments where
      multiple irradiation doses are to be applied, the contacting can
      take place in between the several irradiation doses.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] In one embodiment, the "inside-out" induction of dentine
      formation in a tooth by the laser-based methods and/or treatment
      systems described herein served to reduce the sensitivity of the
      tooth. Accordingly, the treatment systems and methods described

      ROME -- According to Vatican Cardinal Carlo Speranza, speaking
      before a special emergency conclave of Catholic clerics convening
      in Rome this week, the Savior Jesus Christ ( Emmanuel Nazarene )
      has been cloned from blood cells contained in the legendary
      alleged burial Shroud of Turin, which is imprinted with the
      ghostly image of a man. The dna was compared with several other
      holy artifacts claimed to be the Blood of Christ, and it was found
      to be exactly identical with all but one. The other samples were
      pooled to proved a complete genetic template. The resulting clone
      reportedly is extremely handsome, with dark hair, dark eyes, dark
      skin, and amorphous genitalia.<br>
      <br>
      "Insofar as we can determine, however, he is developing into a
      mature male -- and the process seems to be accelerating", said
      Cardinal Speranza.<br>
      <br>
      But it is the clone's spiritual message that is getting equal or
      even more attention. It has come as a shock to most people to
      learn that the Clone of Christ is a "Mormon", or "Latter Day
      Saint", as it were ! <br>

      "This new material is better than the traditional material,

      Anderson Chair professor of physics at UH and the lead author of a
      paper describing the discovery, published online by Nano Energy.<br>
      <br>
      University of Houston physicists have discovered a new
      thermoelectric material offering high performance at temperatures
      ranging from room temperature up to 300 degrees Celsius, or about
      573 degrees Fahrenheit.<br>
      <br>
      "This new material is better than the traditional material,
      Bismuth telluride, and can be used for waste heat conversion into
      electricity much more efficiently," said Zhifeng Ren, M.D.
      Anderson Chair professor of physics at UH and the lead author of a
      paper describing the discovery, published online by Nano Energy.<br>
      <br>
      Ren, who is also principal investigator at the Texas Center for
      Superconductivity at UH, said the work could be important for
      clean energy research and commercialization at temperatures of
      about 300 degrees Celsius.<br>
      <br>
      Bismuth telluride has been the standard thermoelectric material
      since the 1950s and is used primarily for cooling, although it can
      also be used at temperatures up to 250 C, or 482 F, for power
      generation, with limited efficiency. <br>
      <br>
      For this discovery, Ren and other members of his lab used a
      combination of magnesium, silver and antimony to generate
      electricity from heat using the thermoelectric principle. They
      added a small amount of nickel, after which Ren said the compound
      worked even better.<br>
      <br>
      The work was done in collaboration with researchers from the UH
      Department of Chemistry and the Massachusetts Institute of
      Technology. Huaizhou Zhao and Jiehe Sui, a member of Ren's lab
      whose home institute is the Harbin Institute of Technology in
      China, were primary contributors; Zhao is now a research scientist
      at the Institute of Physics with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.<br>
      <br>
      The material works well up to 300 C, Ren said; work to improve its
      efficiency is ongoing.<br>
      <br>
      The potential for capturing heat - from power plants, industrial
      smokestacks and even vehicle tailpipes - and converting it into
      electricity is huge, allowing heat that is currently wasted to be
      used to generate power. Ren said temperatures there can range from
      200 C to 1,000 C, and until now, there hasn't been a
      thermoelectric material capable of working once conditions get
      beyond the lower levels of heat. Much of the demand ranges from
      250 C to 300 C, he said.<br>
      <br>
      Ren long has worked in thermoelectrics, among other scientific
      fields. His research group published an article in the journal
      Science in 2008 establishing that the efficiency - the technical
      term is the "figure of merit" - of Bismuth telluride could be
      increased as much as 20 percent by changing how it is processed.
      At the time, Ren was at Boston College.<br>
      <br>
      And his lab last summer published a paper in the Proceedings of
      the National Academy of Sciences establishing tin telluride with
      the addition of the chemical element indium as a material capable
      of converting waste heat to electricity. But tin telluride works
      best at temperatures higher than about 300 C, or about 573 F,
      making it important to continue looking for another material that
      works at lower temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      Ren's group isn't the first to study the new material, which has
      not been named but is referred to in the Nano Energy paper as
      simply MgAgSb-based materials, using the chemical names for the
      elements used to create it. The paper cites work done in 2012 by
      M.J. Kirkham, et al; that work used magnesium, silver and antimony
      in equal parts, Ren said, but resulted in impurities and poor
      conducting properties.<br>
      <br>
      He said his lab found that using slightly less silver and
      antimony, and mixing the elements separately - putting magnesium
      and silver first in the ball milling process, adding the antimony
      after several hours - eliminated the impurities and significantly
      improved the thermoelectric properties.<br>
      <br>
      "We had much different qualities," he said. "Better, with no
      impurities, and smaller grain size, along with much better
      thermoelectric properties."<br>

      Stanford discovers way of beaming power to microimplants deep
      inside your body<br>
      <br>
      Stanford electrical engineer and biological implant mastermind,
      Ada Poon, has discovered a way of wirelessly transmitting power to
      tiny, rice-grain-sized implants that are deep within the human
      body. This could well be the breakthrough that finally allows for
      the creation of smaller pacemakers, body-wide sensor networks, and
      a new class of “electroceutical” devices that sit deep in the
      human brain and stimulate neurons directly, providing an
      alternative for drug-based therapies for depression, Alzheimer’s,
      and other neurological ailments. There will of course be the
      potential for elective, transhumanist applications as well.<br>
      <br>
      The key to this discovery is a new method of wirelessly
      transmitting power, dubbed “mid-field powering.” As the name
      implies, mid-field power transfer uses radio waves that sit
      between near-field (tens of gigahertz) and far-field (tens of
      megahertz). Near-field radiation can penetrate human flesh, but
      can only effectively transfer power over a short distance
      (millimeters). Far-field waves can transfer power over longer
      distances, but are unfortunately scattered or absorbed by human
      skin. To create mid-field waves, Poon created a patterned antenna
      (pictured below) that generates special near-field waves. When
      these special waves hit the skin, they turn into mid-field waves
      that can then penetrate a few more centimeters of flesh. (For more
      on how wireless power transfer actually works, read our
      explainer.)<br>
      <br>
      Currently, as there’s no good way of (safely) wirelessly
      transmitting power through human flesh, implants generally need to
      contain a large battery, which in turn makes the implant way too
      large to embed deep within the body. As a result, most implants so
      far have been either large-battery pacemakers that sit just under
      the skin (with long electrodes that reach into the heart), or
      cochlear (ear) implants that are near enough to the skin that
      near-field power transfer is feasible. With the advent of
      mid-field power transfer, Poon and her friends at Stanford have
      created rice-grain size implants that can be embedded directly
      into the heart to function as a pacemaker, or attached to a nerve
      bundle.<br>
      <br>
      Poon has tested the technology in pigs and rabbits, and humans are
      next. Stanford says that independent testing has shown the
      radiation produced by mid-field power transfer is well within
      safety limits for human exposure. In short, the prognosis for
      human testing of these microimplants is good. [DOI:

            Vitamin C</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Cardiologist, Thomas Levy, MD JD, a frequent Vitamin C lecturer
      and the author of two books on the subject theorizes in his book,
      Curing the Incurable, that it is likely the human body was not
      intended to get all its ascorbate (Vitamin C) from dietary
      sources. He presents eight evidences for this theory:<br>
      <br>
      The need for ascorbate (Vitamin C) in the human body for basic
      maintenance of basic structure and function is essential and
      fluctuates greatly based on health status and environmental
      conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Even in IV doses exceeding 200 grams per day, no toxicity for
      ascorbate has ever been documented.<br>
      <br>
      Human livers have all the ingredients necessary to synthesize
      ascorbate except one — the enzyme L-Gulonolactone oxidase (GLO).<br>
      <br>
      Humans have the gene required to produce GLO but it is defective
      in the vast majority of the population.<br>
      <br>
      Some humans apparently synthesize ascorbate as not all individuals
      deprived of dietary ascorbate develop scurvy.<br>
      <br>
      Most mammals, reptiles, and amphibians do synthesize ascorbate.
      Some of the larger mammals produce upwards of 100 grams daily.<br>
      <br>
      Intravenous doses of ascorbate have shown powerful antioxidant,
      anti-toxin and anti-pathogenic properties in humans. (Dr. Levy
      cites many cases of this including Fred Klenner’s use of ascorbate
      to cure 60 out of 60 cases of polio in the late 1940s.)<br>
      <br>
      The uptake of ascorbate by the intestines is very inefficient. <br>
      <br>
      <i>electron microscopy showing LET Liposomes</i><br>
      <br>
      Since Liposomal Encapsulation Technology can deliver virtually
      100% of a nutrient directly to the<br>
      bloodstream, it promises to eliminate the huge loss of
      bioavailability when dose sizes of actively<br>
      transported nutrients are increased. This bio-availability chart
      was developed from a study done<br>
      by J.L. Groff, S.S. Gropper, and S.M. Hunt which was published in
      the book Advanced Nutrition and Human Metabolism, West Publishing
      Co., 1995, pages 222-237.<br>
      <br>
      Concerning the inefficiency of the body’s uptake of Vitamin C,
      studies show that the body has an increasing resistance to
      traditional forms of oral Vitamin C — tablets, powders, capsules —
      as dose size increases.<br>
      <br>
      J.L. Groff (1995 - see chart at left) demonstrated that less than
      2 grams of a 12 gram oral dose of Vitamin C actually gets to the
      bloodstream. Based on that study, 2 grams of liposomal
      encapsulated Vitamin C has the bio-availability equal to 24-500 mg
      tablets of the nutrient.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Victor I. Klimov - "Energy From The
            Vacuum" - Verification </b><br>
        </big><br>
        <i><b>Self-Powered Laser Pistol Revolutionizes Warfare</b></i><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      "Five years ago, Dr. Victor Klimov at Los Alamos National
      Laboratory produced a permanent solution to the world’s energy
      crisis. This work is printed in leading physics journals of the
      world and was validated by two US National Labs: LANL and NREL. It
      is scientific fact so look it up before you disrespect in the
      comments below.<br>
      <br>
      Nanocrystalline power is what we’re talking about here folks. The
      solution to the world’s energy crisis lies in tiny
      nanoycrystalline solar cells which can absorb the light of a
      specific wave length in such a way that one photon input to a
      solar cell can energize more than one output electron. When the
      output electron absorbs a photon, it disappears for a short amount
      of time into the quantum field. Once in the virtual state, the
      electron can borrow energy from the vacuum and then appears in our
      reality. After this the highly excited electron (with all its
      excess energy taken freely from the active virtual state vacuum)
      can energize up to 7 output electrons.<br>
      <br>
      This leads to a theoretical coefficient of performance (COP) of up
      to 700%. A COP = 200% can be easily achieved and it has been, as
      have been higher values. The experiment has also been replicated
      successfully and validated by the National Renewable Energy
      Laboratory in Golden Colorado. [Herb Brody, "Solar Power -
      Seriously Souped Up." New Scientist, May 27, 2006, p 45].<br>
      <br>
      Note that at about COP = 3.0, one could conceivably add clamped
      positive feedback of one of those output electrons back to the
      “dive back into the seething virtual state vacuum” input,
      replacing the original electron input, and the unit would be
      “self-powering” (powered by energy from the vacuum) while putting
      out the other two electrons as output.<br>
      <br>
      Or by using some of the output current in a standard photon
      radiation-producing process, one could have the positive feedback
      input changed to a radiation photon, to replace the initial solar
      input entirely.<br>
      <br>
      In this fashion, once “jump started” by some source of solar
      radiation, the resulting “solar panel” system would become totally
      self-powering, taking all its input and output energy directly
      from the seething active virtual state vacuum itself.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, if many of these tiny nano-crystals are packed together,
      their output furnishes their own input photons and thus the
      assemblage becomes “self-powering”. An assemblage about the size
      of your thumb is sufficient to power a large electric automobile.<br>
      <br>
      It appears that Klimov’s team and its work is being used presently
      to develop super-powerful but exceptionally small ultra laser
      weapons that will revolutionize modern warfare. E.g., a powerful,
      self-powered Klimov laser weapon the size of a bazooka and carried
      by one infantryman can in principle be developed that can destroy
      large buildings, destroy hostile tanks and vehicles easily,
      destroy ships and boats and trains, shoot down hostile aircraft,
      and — with a small sensor apparatus added — detect and shoot down
      incoming hostile field artillery rounds.<br>
      <br>
      Such a weapon is self-powering, and so it “never runs out of
      bullets”. No ammunition resupply is needed.<br>
      <br>
      It appears that the long-desired super-powerful laser pistol is
      also being developed for U.S. Internal Security civilian guard
      forces, also as an application of Klimov’s work. Such a pistol
      will be able to disable or even kill a targeted human or a group
      of them at a mile and a half. And it will be self-powering."<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Sutures are traumatic to soft connective tissues, such as liver or
      lungs. Polymer tissue adhesives require complex in vivo control of
      polymerization or cross-linking reactions and currently suffer
      from being toxic, weak, or inefficient within the wet conditions
      of the body. Herein, we demonstrate using Stöber silica or iron
      oxide nanoparticles that nanobridging, that is, adhesion by
      aqueous nanoparticle solutions, can be used in vivo in rats to
      achieve rapid and strong closure and healing of deep wounds in
      skin and liver. Nanoparticles were also used to fix polymer
      membranes to tissues even in the presence of blood flow, such as
      occurring after liver resection, yielding permanent hemostasis
      within a minute. Furthermore, medical devices and tissue
      engineering constructs were fixed to organs such as a beating
      heart. The simplicity, rapidity, and robustness of nanobridging
      bode well for clinical applications, surgery, and regenerative
      medicine.<br>
      <br>
      Stopping bleeding (hemostasis), preventing body fluid leakages,
      wound closing, and organ repair are everyday challenges in medical
      and surgical practice.1 Sutures and staples are standard and
      efficient tools. Still, suturing can be demanding in inaccessible
      body regions or within minimally invasive surgery. Moreover,
      sutures are traumatic to tissues especially soft tissues such as
      liver,2 spleen,3 kidney,4 or lung.5 During last decades, synthetic
      or biological tissue adhesives that rely on in situ polymerization
      or cross-linking reactions have emerged as a complementary
      technique.1c,?6 However, tissue adhesives currently available in
      clinical practice present significant inherent limitations such as
      toxicity, insufficient strength, and/or excessive
      swelling.1c,?6c,?7 Biomimetic approaches and new chemistries that
      yield polymer materials with adaptable adhesion strength are under
      development.6b,e,?8 In practice, gluing or sealing with polymers
      remains a complex process: it requires both stringent storage and
      preparation conditions before in vivo glue application or in vivo
      initiation and control of chemical polymerization or cross-linking
      reactions.<br>
      <br>
      Recently, a novel approach to adhesion of hydrogels has been
      proposed.9 It relies on the use of aqueous nanoparticle solutions
      in place of polymer adhesives. The method does not require a
      chemical reaction: a droplet of nanoparticle solution is spread on
      a gel surface and gel pieces are brought into contact.
      Nanoparticles that are adsorbed to gel surfaces act as connectors
      between the pieces and assure adhesion. The adhesion strength is
      brought by macromolecules of the gel that adsorb onto the
      nanoparticles. Under constraint, adsorbed layers are able to
      reorganize, dissipate energy, and prevent interfacial fracture
      propagation. The approach is not limited to synthetic hydrogels,
      and the adhesion was shown ex vivo for two slices of calf liver
      using a silica nanoparticle solution.<br>
      <br>
      It is natural to extend the principle of adhesion by particle
      nanobridging to in vivo wound closure (Scheme 1). Nevertheless,
      decades of research on polymer tissue adhesives has shown how
      challenging it is to achieve an adequate adhesion in the presence
      of blood, and in particular within a short time compatible with
      clinical practice. Moreover, adhesive joints have to withstand
      after-closure constraints of in vivo conditions, such as tissue
      motion or body-fluid flow. Herein, we demonstrate the
      applicability of silica nanoparticle aqueous solutions to repair
      injuries in two types of tissues, namely skin and liver, in a rat
      model. We also show that strong and rapid wound closure and repair
      can be achieved with iron oxide nanoparticles. Iron oxide
      nanoparticles are metabolizable and, as an additional boon, they
      could provide a contrast in magnetic resonance imaging enabling
      clinical in situ observations.10<br>
      <br>
      The concept of nanobridging for wound closure. Left: A droplet of
      nanoparticle solution is spread with a micropipette or a brush at
      the wound surface of a tissue. Right: The wound edges are brought
      into contact by gentle manual pressure (blue arrows).
      Nanoparticles adsorbed onto tissue components at the site of
      injury form numerous connectors that link wound edges together
      (inset).<br>
      <br>
      Wound closure is not the only area of applications that could
      benefit from adhesion brought by nanoparticles. For example,
      hepatic resection has been increasing in frequency in the
      management of metastatic or primary neoplasms of the liver.
      Although mortality for this procedure has steadily decreased, the
      morbidity mainly associated with operative time and blood loss
      remains high, especially in cirrhotic patients. During hepatic
      resection, control of bleeding is a crucial problem faced by
      surgeons.2,?5a,?7c,?11 We show herein that particle nanobridging
      can provide a means for rapid and permanent hemostasis after rat
      liver resection. To this end a polymer synthetic film was coated
      by nanoparticles by adsorbing nanoparticles onto its surface and
      spread to cover the intensely bleeding liver section. Strong
      adhesion and permanent hemostasis were achieved within a minute.<br>
      <br>
      To illustrate possibilities of nanobridging to attach medical and
      tissue engineering devices to organs, we permanently fastened a 3D
      tissue-engineering scaffold to a beating rat heart.<br>
      <br>
      To optimize adsorption onto tissue surface it is advantageous to
      avoid using nanoparticles that are stabilized by polymer layers.
      Indeed, grafted or adsorbed polymers can be effectively repelled
      by intercellular (macro)molecules and thus prevent adsorption of
      particles onto tissue surface. Thus nanoparticles that have been
      optimized to circulate in the body are to be avoided. Two types of
      nanoparticles were thus used in this study. Silica nanoparticles
      (SiO2NP) with radius of about 50 nm (Supporting Information,
      Figure S3) were synthesized by the Stöber method and applied as a
      solution in deionized water at concentration of 30 wt?% (pH 8.5)
      or, when indicated, as a powder. Iron oxide Fe2O3 nanoparticles
      (Fe2O3NP) were purchased from Alfa Aeser, stabilized by citric
      acid, peptized, and used in aqueous solution in milli-Q water at
      42 g?L-1 (Supporting Information, Figure S4).<br>
      <br>
      All procedures and animal treatment were in accordance with the
      Principles of Laboratory Animal Care issued by the National
      Society for Medical Research (authorization no. 006235 from French
      ministry of agriculture). For cutaneous wounds, the selection of
      the closure device depends essentially on the depth of the wound.
      For superficial lacerations, use of suture, adhesive tapes, and
      cyanoacrylate adhesives such as 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate,
      N-butul-2-cyanoacrylate-methacryloxysulfolane,
      N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate) are the current methods of choice in
      humans.1c For deep wounds, closure suturing is the clinical gold
      standard (Figure 1).1a,b,?12 Indeed, cyanoacrylate adhesives
      provoke local tissue reaction (toxicity and/or inflammation) and
      form layers that prevent tissue direct contact (Figure 1).<br>
      <br>
      In vivo comparison of repair by SiO2NP nanobridging, by suturing,
      and by cyanoacrylate glue of full-thickness dorsal skin injury in
      a Wistar rat model. A drop of SiO2NP solution was put onto a wound
      edge with a brush and the two wound edges were gently pressed into
      contact for about a minute. The other wounds were closed with a
      non-resorbable suture (Ethicon 4/0) and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate
      (Dermabond). At day 3 post-surgery, no wound leakages, infection,
      or inflammatory reactions were observed after nanobridging with
      SiO2NP. The rat skin closure achieved with nanoparticles and the
      suture were comparable. For the cyanoacrylate glue, the wound
      edges were not bonded correctly. Histological sections were
      stained with Hematoxylin-Phloxin-Saffron stain.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast, nanoparticles should not lead to formation of a rigid
      macroscopic barrier, and thanks to their size should not affect
      substantially the natural wound healing process. We therefore
      aimed for repair by nanobridging of full thickness cutaneous
      incisions and compared resulting healing with that of sutured
      incisions in Wistar rats. Because the healing depends of the
      thickness of the skin and of the local skin state of
      tension,1a,?13 we investigated the efficiency of nanobridging in
      two different sites: the thin abdominal skin and the thick dorsal
      skin and results were comparable.<br>
      <br>
      In Figure 1, a dorsal wound of 1.5 cm in length and 3 mm in depth
      was nanobridged by Stöber silica (SiO2NP and results compared to a
      standard suture by non-resorbable clinical thread (4/0, Ethicon)
      and commercial cyanoacrylate glue (Dermabond). Nanoparticle
      solutions were spread with a brush (n=6) or a micropipette (n=5)
      on one edge of the wound and two edges were brought together
      manually and pressed into contact (Supporting Information, Figure
      S1, Movie S1). By using a micropipette, we could vary the volume
      of nanoparticle solution spread (from 2 µL to 15 µL). Excess
      solution, which rose to the wound surface, was removed with a
      compress. The wound edges were maintained in contact manually for
      less than one minute after which time the wound has closed. For
      all of the animals, wounds did not reopen during the follow up.
      The macroscopic results evidenced no pathological inflammation or
      necrosis (Figure 1). Figure 2 shows results for deep dorsal wound
      closure achieved with metabolizable10 iron oxide nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      Skin wound closure with Fe2O3NP solution. After skin injury, 4 µL
      of Fe2O3NP solution was soaked onto one edge of the wound. A thin
      and aesthetic scar was observed. At day 7 post-injury, the
      histological sections stained with Hematoxylin-Phloxin-Saffron
      stain evidenced the site of the injury as a very thin line (blue
      arrows). Magnification (inset) of this area revealed a normal
      repair process and some particle aggregates along the wound
      closure.<br>
      <br>
      For all of the tested nanoparticles, scars were aesthetic (Figure
      1 and 2), a feature which bodes well for many areas of skin
      surgery. Furthermore, nanobridging allows easily repositioning and
      adjusting wound edges to obtain an optimal alignment.
      Repositioning is in principle possible for suturing, but it
      requires removal of suture by trained personnel and increases
      operation time, and adds to local trauma that delays healing.<br>
      <br>
      The presence of nanoparticles applied by brush or micropipette
      does not modify the first stages of healing process, namely
      vascular clot formation and inflammation that prevent bleeding and
      remove cells and dying tissue.14 As for sutures, the granulation
      tissue formed a new connective matrix serving as a migration
      structure for the cells (Figure 1). For Fe2O3 particles, <br>
      Hematoxylin-Phloxine-Saffron staining reveals the presence of
      small amount of aggregates (Figure 2). Controlling particle
      aggregation is important. Indeed, when powders of silica
      nanoparticle rather than solutions were spread, the particle
      agglomerates limit wound closure and healing (Supporting
      Information, Figure S2).<br>
      <br>
      Cauterization, sutures, or hemostatic sealants can treat surface
      lacerations of soft and wet tissues deeply penetrated by blood
      such as liver, spleen, or kidney.2,?11a–d,g However, use of these
      techniques for deep wounds closure is very challenging. A 1.5 cm
      long and 6 mm deep horizontal incision on a right hepatic rat lobe
      was performed with a scalpel. In control experiments, the
      mechanical pressure did not yield any permanent hemostasis in the
      absence of nanoparticle solution and lead to hemorrhage and death.
      To repair, SiO2 or Fe2O3 nanoparticle solutions were deposited to
      the bleeding injury area with a pipette. The two edges of the
      wound were brought manually together and kept in contact. After
      about 1 min hemostasis was complete, and the injury stayed closed
      (Supporting Information, Movie S2). The rats were monitored during
      the acute post-surgery, and no bleeding syndrome was detected
      (n=3). At day 3 post-surgery, stereo-macroscopic observation of
      the liver showed a thin scar tissue (Figure 3). Histological
      studies revealed the presence of thin granulation tissue between
      the two edges of the injury. Nanobridging not only assured
      hemostasis, biliostasis, and wound closure, but liver function was
      also not affected by the application of nanoparticle solutions.
      Alat and Asat enzymes were in normal range, respectively, 26 U?L-1
      and 81 U?L-1 before surgery and 24 U?L-1 and 74 U?L-1 3 days after
      repair by SiO2NP. The total bilirubin was in the normal range (1.4
      µmol?L-1 and 1.5 µmol?L-1, respectively, before and 3 days
      post-surgery).<br>
      <br>
      Liver injury repair with Ludox TM50 silica nanoparticles. A 6 mm
      deep horizontal incision was performed with a scalpel on a right
      hepatic rat lobe and nanoparticle solution was deposited to the
      bleeding injury with a pipette, then the edges of the wound were
      brought together. After about 1 min, hemostasis was complete.
      Three days post-injury, macroscopic examination of the liver
      surface showed a thin fibrotic line at the site of the injury
      (Inset, blue arrows). Histological cross-section of the wound
      (Hematoxylin-Phloxin-Saffron stain), showing the formation of
      tissue repair from the liver surface (blue arrow) and along the
      wound (white dotted line).<br>
      <br>
      For hemostasis after hepatectomy, we propose employing
      nanoparticles to firmly attach membranes onto bleeding liver
      section. To illustrate the potential of such an approach, we used
      a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) membrane with a surface coated with
      silica nanoparticles.15 PVA film was swollen in phosphate buffer
      saline solution. The coating was realized by spreading SiO2NP
      powder on a surface of the swollen film. The unattached silica
      particles were removed by gently shaking the film. A ventral
      midline laparotomy (5 cm) was performed on a Wistar rat. The right
      hepatic lobe was exposed and resection of 2/3 of the lobe was
      totally transversally cut and the coated membrane was lightly
      pressed for few seconds against the bleeding section (Figure 4).
      Hemostasis was immediately obtained. After 15 min of monitoring,
      the abdominal wall was closed with a Vicryl 4/0 and the rat was
      monitored during the acute post-surgery without any evidence of a
      bleeding syndrome. As shown in Figure 4, neither pathologic
      inflammation nor bleeding was observed at the site of injury three
      days after surgery. In control experiments, no hemostatic seal
      could be achieved with PVA membrane in the absence of SiO2
      coating.<br>
      <br>
      Hemostasis and medical device securing to tissues. Top: Hemostasis
      after liver resection. A) The right lobe of the rat liver was
      sectioned (A) and a wet-PVA membrane coated by SIO2NP
      nanoparticles was spread to cover the liver section (B). The
      bleeding stopped within 30 seconds. After 3 days, the liver was
      explanted and the membrane was still present (C). Bottom: Securing
      a construct to a beating heart. A solution of Ludox TM50 silica
      nanoparticles was applied with a brush onto the surface of a
      beating rat heart. A porous and biodegradable 3D-polysaccharide
      scaffold was then simply put onto the coated area and it firmly
      bonded to the beating heart surface (left; Supporting Information,
      Movie S3). The scaffold was still attached to the heart surface
      after 3 days.<br>
      <br>
      For a membrane fixed onto liver tissue to stop bleeding, organ
      motions are limited. In many clinical situations, it is important
      to secure membranes, medical devices, or tissue engineering
      constructs to organs that undergo important contractions, such as
      the beating heart.8a,?16 The application of adhesives is thus much
      more demanding and, when possible, suturing or cyanoacrylate glues
      are employed, despite their toxicity and the difficulty of
      applying in wet conditions. To check whether the adhesion brought
      by nanoparticles can withstand stringent in vivo conditions and
      prevent device slipping, we evaluated the ability of nanobridging
      to fix a scaffold onto the beating heart of rats. Rats were thus
      anesthesied and a tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation
      were performed. The thorax was opened, and a drop of the silica
      Ludox TM50 was spread on the surface of the heart with a brush. A
      3D-scaffold of 6 mm in diameter made of a porous polysaccharide
      biodegradable hydrogel optimized for cell therapy16 was brought
      into contact with the surface coated by nanoparticles and stayed
      firmly fixed resisting heart contractions and the wet environment
      (Figure 4; Supporting Information, Movie S3). After 3 days, the
      thorax was re-opened and the 3D-scaffold was still visible on the
      heart (Figure 4). Macroscopic evaluation did not show any sign of
      inflammation and as expected the degradation of the polysaccharide
      scaffold had begun.<br>
      <br>
      In summary, we have demonstrated that rapid and strong adhesion by
      aqueous solutions of nanoparticles can be advantageously used in
      very different clinical situations. For skin wounds, remarkably
      aesthetic healing was obtained and repair procedure does not
      require any specific preparation or training. Bleeding control and
      tissue repair by nanobridging shown herein in the case of liver
      could be used on spleen, kidney, heart, and lung surgeries. When
      tight sealing is needed, nanobridging could complement anastomosis
      and classical suturing procedures. The possibility of securing
      medical devices could open new applications in repair and
      regenerative medicine. From the standpoint of chemistry, the
      principle illustrated herein is not limited to silica and iron
      oxide nanoparticles, and they are many possible choices of sizes,
      forms, and surface chemistry. In particular, nanoparticles with
      intrinsic biological effects, such as silver nanoparticles for
      skin infection or drug delivery systems, could provide useful
      options. Translation to clinical practice will require careful
      safety and toxicity investigations. A better understanding of
      biological mechanisms of the adhesion by nanobridging will guide
      the design of future-generation tissue adhesives.<br>

      <br>
      An electromagnetic shielding apparatus for covering and protecting
      the head of a user from EMF radiation which may be worn by itself
      or discretely beneath other head gear. A head covering is
      fabricated from a conductive, non-magnetizable material such as
      copper, bronze, brass or the like which may be drawn and shaped
      into a web or mesh material. The resulting shield is lightweight,
      air permeable and supple enough to be worn beneath other head
      gear.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention relates to electromagnetic shielding for the head
      and particularly to a head shield which may be worn alone or in
      conjunction with other head gear. Specifically, the invention
      relates to a head shield fabricated from a light-weight metal mesh
      or web material having openings to permit air permeability.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Living tissues of plants and animals depend on electrochemical
      potentials for many of their normal functions. Charged species
      such as sodium, potassium and calcium ions are nearly omnipresent
      throughout mammalian bodies and participate in or facilitate
      numerous important chemical reactions. Disruption of or
      interference with these reactions may occur due to chemical
      imbalances caused by environmental factors including the presence
      of electromagnetic radiation (EMR) sources, such as power lines,
      electrical equipment and the like. Recently, EMR sources have been
      implicated in the development of brain tumors, cancer, headaches,
      malaise, short-term memory loss and childhood leukemia. Both
      static electric and magnetic fields (collectively, EMF) as well as
      radiofrequency (RF) radiation have been implicated in these
      conditions and diseases. Unfortunately, with modern society's
      increasing reliance on electrical devices such as refrigerators,
      alarm clocks, microwave ovens, cellular phones, computers and the
      like, exposure to EMFs has become more consistent and unavoidable.<br>
      <br>
      Notwithstanding efforts by numerous western nations and Japan to
      regulate exposure by their people to EMFs as well as regulatory
      efforts adopted by several states in the U.S., there is
      disagreement as to the significance of the role EMFs play in the
      development of disease, notably cancer, in humans. A peer-reviewed
      report appearing in the British journal The Lancet in December
      1999 concluded that there was no link between electromagnetic
      radiation and childhood cancer in clear conflict with a report by
      James Clark and David Derbyshire in the Jul. 16, 1998 edition of
      the Daily Mail that indicated studies conducted by British
      researches found the use of mobile phones could "disrupt parts of
      the brain in charge of memory and learning" and could "cause a
      rise in blood pressure and may harm pregnant women." What is not
      in dispute is that humans in developed nations are exposed to EMFs
      as part of the modern environment and that the range of effects
      due to such exposure is not fully understood. Arguably, reduction
      or elimination of such exposure in the absence of clear
      understanding is to be desired. To this end, several attempts have
      been made in the prior art to reduce exposure by humans to various
      radiation sources. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,570,476, issued
      Nov. 5, 1996 to B. B. Olive discloses a cap of metallized fabric
      to protect the wearer from an electromagnetic field. U.S. Pat. No.
      5,621,188, issued Apr. 15, 1997 to S. C. Lee et al. discloses an
      electromagnetic shielding medium which can be used on the head.
      The shielding medium can be composed of any highly conductive
      metal, such as copper, and is fabricated as a plurality of
      geometrically shaped objects (spheres) held in contact with each
      other in a generally hexagonal array. U.S. Pat. No. 5,038,047
      issued Aug. 6, 1991 to S. S. Still discloses a hood to protect the
      head from radiation exposure. U.S. Pat. No. 5,022,099, issued Jun.
      11, 1991 to C. A. Walton shows a solid helmet to protect the head
      from radiation.<br>
      <br>
      Despite the efforts of the prior art, each of these devices fails
      to provide EMF shielding which is not only effective at shielding
      the head but also which is lightweight, thus making economical use
      of material, simple to manufacture, air permeable and supple
      enough to be worn comfortably under other head gear such as caps,
      hats or scarves.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to an electromagnetic shielding
      apparatus 1 for the head. As shown in FIG. 1, the electromagnetic
      shielding apparatus may comprise a beanie configuration 3, 4
      including a basic head covering 2 which is fabricated from a web
      of coiled and interlocking metal wire 5. Because of its
      availability, cost and conductivity, copper wire is an ideal
      material, although any other highly conductive material, including
      for example, bronze or brass, also would be acceptable. A
      preferred material is copper wire having a guage size of about 1.0
      mm to about 1.0 cm. Importantly, the selected material should not
      be readily magnetizable in order to avoid inadvertent EMF exposure
      arising from the shield itself. The beanie configurations 3 and 4
      differ in size in order to accommodate different heads but may
      also differ in construction. For example, the small beanie 3 is
      made of a heavier gauge copper wire 5 than is the large beanie 4.
      Moreover, the spaces 6 between the interlocking coils 7 of the
      smaller beanie 3 are larger that the spaces 8 of the larger beanie
      4. Ideally, the pitch of the wire coils should be selected to
      produce spaces averaging from about 1.0 mm to about 20.0 mm
      across. Alternatively, the beanies may be fabricated from a metal
      mesh material. The resulting beanie allows for free air
      permeability therethrough and is supple enough to conform to the
      shape of a wearer's head. As configured, the beanie configurations
      3, 4 of the electromagnetic shielding apparatus of the instant
      invention may be worn by themselves or may be worn discretely
      beneath a yarmulke or similar head gear.<br>
      <br>
      A first alternative embodiment 10 is shown in FIG. 2. As with the
      preceding embodiment, the electromagnetic shielding apparatus is
      fabricated as a one-piece structure having a basic head-covering
      portion 11, a forehead-covering portion 12 and a bill portion 13.
      The electromagnetic shielding apparatus thus configured may be
      incorporated into a cap 15, such as a baseball cap. The shielding
      available to the wearer is extended to include not only the top of
      the head 16 but also the forehead 17, generally covering the
      entire brain. It is to be understood that although the
      electromagnetic shielding apparatus is shown in conjunction with a
      baseball cap, hats having different configurations such as fedoras
      or cowboy hats are contemplated to be within the scope of the
      present invention, the electromagnetic shielding apparatus
      requiring corresponding configurational changes to conform to
      differing hat types. Use of lightweight materials such as the
      interlocking coils or mesh used in the instant invention
      facilitates the ready modeling of these different configurations.<br>
      <br>
      A second alternative embodiment 20 shown in FIG. 3 comprises a
      one-piece structure including a basic head-covering portion 21 as
      well as a depending skirt portion 22 and may be worn to cover the
      entire face 23 and neck 24 of a user so that the entire head is
      protected from undesired EMF radiation.<br>
