      <b>officialdom &amp; tptb fears = danger for populace....<br>
        <br>
      </b>The Spanish Flu pandemic which began in 1918 was one of the
      most lethal, perhaps the most lethal disease scourge to hit
      humanity in 'modern' times. It infected 500 million people out of
      a world population of about 1.5 billion, or 1/one person out of
      every 3/three. The flu was both lethal, and maiming. Residual
      damage and retained viri from this influenza have been cited as
      significant factor in the rise of polio within northern hemisphere
      nations over the subsequent 2/two generations.<br>
      <br>
      While 1/one in 3/three were infected, and made ill, an estimated
      1/one in 10/ten of the general population perished from the
      disease. The fatality rate of the Spanish Flu, at the lower end of
      the range of estimates, was 20%, or somewhere over 100/one hundred
      million humans. To put that in perspective, the total kill level
      for World War 1 was 37/thirty-seven million, or about a third the
      level of the disease.<br>
      <br>
      The impact of the 1918 influenza global outbreak on humanities
      economic and social infrastructure was deep, and long lasting.
      Estimates were that the US economy did not recover to
      pre-influenza levels for 27/twenty seven years (not the stock
      markets but actual production/delivery of products as a metric).<br>
      <br>
      It is a certainty, a fact, that the 'Spanish' influenza outbreak
      in the USA in 1918 was brought to this country by its government,
      through its Army.<br>
      <br>
      Epidemiological data indicate that pandemic began in the US in
      March 1918, at a crowded army camp in Fort Riley, Kansas.
      Subsequently, the transport of hundreds of thousands of infected
      troops in close physical contact between camps caused influenza to
      spread quickly even before troops assembled in East Coast ports en
      route to France. The troops brought the influenza to the trenches
      of the opposing armies and to other parts of Europe and beyond.
      (source)<br>
      <br>
      Editorially, i should like to note that then, with the Spanish flu
      outbreak of 1918, as now, with Ebola, the USGov't is apparently
      doing all it can to spread the disease. Then, as now, SPECIALLY
      selected soldiers were sent to become 'infected carriers',
      although without their knowledge and consent.<br>
      <br>
      Here in woo-woo world, we expect these infected soldiers to be
      returned to various bases here in the USA to begin the spread of
      the next wave of the pandemic.<br>
      <br>
      We also need to note that our data shows a [killer flu] that
      sweeps the planet in 2014- 2016. This [killer flu] is strangely
      timed considering that the US Gov't has, in 2009, dug up bodies of
      people in Alaska (preserved by the cold) who died of the flu in
      1918/1919. Hmmm....now why would they be doing that? And then we
      start seeing a number of very interesting patents coming from CDC
      (among others, and now totally over 480) that relate to DNA from
      influenza being used to 'boost' other diseases. Hmmmm....<br>
      <br>
      Further, our predictive data shows (from the SpaceGoatFarts entity
      where we keep all the [unknown] and [officially denied] data
      elements) that the flu will be labeled as [dark star]. Initially i
      did not understand the reference, however new immediacy data of
      the last week has provided some details that point to [alaska] and
      its association with the 1918/1919 influenza. These details would
      seem to point to a variant of this influenza as being our [killer
      flu] of this upcoming 'season'. The [star] attribute set is
      pointing toward a [general (in US military)], and the [dark]
      attribute set refers to a number of aspects of this individual,
      but specifically being a [line officer] who [wears (the) dark
      star]. There are many more levels to the detail associations
      connecting [tptb] to this (to be) unfolding disease [flush] this
      coming [winter/northern hemisphere].<br>
      <br>
      Note from our data that the 2014-2016 [killer flu] will [pass in
      3/three waves], and that the [fever] used by the body to destroy
      the virus will last [3/three days], and that many of the [victims]
      will [perish of dehydration/exhaustion (of lungs)]. Further, there
      are other similar symptoms to the 1918 Spanish flu including
      [masses of fever blisters].<br>
      <br>
      Soooo....i can be wrong on these interpretations. Have been so in
      the past. Hope to be so now. Perhaps by foreknowledge and taking
      immune boosting steps, we can create conditions where i am wrong.
      If so, now is the time.<br>
      <br>
      A last note, the flu 'season' exists due to the drop in exposure
      to sunlight and thus the production of vitamin D in the skin. This
      happens every year as the northern hemisphere moves into late Fall
      and Winter. One effective way to prevent disease is to make sure
      you get enough vitamin D.<br>
      <br>
      Note: Colloidal Silver will NOT work against ebola or any other
      virus in the body. This is due to ebola virus, and all others NOT
      having any need for oxygen, and having a hard, protein shell.
      Collodial Silver MOA is to bind to oxgen receptors in all cells it
      encounters. As viri have no oxygen receptors, CS at any size is
      worthless as an anti-viral. CS ONLY works on bacteria. The
      continued meme of CS against Ebola in the alternative media is
      deliberate disinformation. Who wants you to believe in an
      ineffective ebola cure? Hmmm....<br>
      <br>
      Guys....Collodial Silver will ONLY kill virus inside a laboratory
      test. It will NOT do so in the blood. Bear in mind that silver is
      not allowed to be 'free floating' in your bloodstream. It is bound
      to cells all along the way through the gut and never makes it
      across the intestinal wall in any quantity.<br>
      <br>
      PLUS, the method of action of silver AT ANY SIZE? including 'nano'
      is to bind to oxygen receptors on the bacteria, and others on
      fungi. BUT a virus has NO such receptors, and silver is useless
      against it in the body.<br>
      <br>
      It will not hurt you, but to rely on it against a virus?.....risky
      behavior.<br>

      A new microscope sweeps lattices of light over samples to give
      scientists sneak peeks inside living cells without hurting them.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists have previously devised ways to glimpse the hidden
      machinery of cells, but spying the tiny nuts and bolts in action
      is tricky. Shining light on cells for too long can bleach their
      color and even kill them.<br>
      <br>
      So 2014 chemistry Nobel Prize-winner Eric Betzig of the Howard
      Hughes Medical Institute's Janelia Research Campus in Ashburn,
      Va., and colleagues tweaked a technique to see cells' innards (SN
      Online: 10/8/14). Instead of shooting a focused beam of light at a
      developing embryo or a virus infecting a cell, the scientists
      spread the beam out into a grid.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Breaking up the beam dials down the light's intensity and protects
      cells,the researchers report in the Oct. 24 Science. Using the
      scope, the scientists watched as a cancer cell navigated through a
      sticky thicket of protein and as an immune cell (shown in orange)
      stretched out and glommed on to another cell (blue-green).<br>

      In vivo imaging provides a window into the spatially complex,
      rapidly evolving physiology of the cell that structural imaging
      alone cannot. However, observing this physiology directly involves
      inevitable tradeoffs of spatial resolution, temporal resolution,
      and phototoxicity. This is especially true when imaging in three
      dimensions, which is essential to obtain a complete picture of
      many dynamic subcellular processes. Although traditional in vivo
      imaging tools, such as widefield and confocal microscopy, and
      newer ones, such as light-sheet microscopy, can image in three
      dimensions, they sacrifice substantial spatiotemporal resolution
      to do so and, even then, can often be used for only very limited
      durations before altering the physiological state of the specimen.<br>

      sheet (blue-green, center) excites fluorescence (orange) in
      successive planes as it sweeps through a specimen (gray) to
      generate a 3D image. The speed, noninvasiveness, and high spatial
      resolution of this approach make it a promising tool for in vivo
      3D imaging of fast dynamic processes in cells and embryos, as
      shown here in five surrounding examples. Lattice light-sheet
      microscopy. An ultrathin structured light sheet (blue-green,
      center) excites fluorescence (orange) in successive planes as it
      sweeps through a specimen (gray) to generate a 3D image. The
      speed, noninvasiveness, and high spatial resolution of this
      approach make it a promising tool for in vivo 3D imaging of fast
      dynamic processes in cells and embryos, as shown here in five
      surrounding examples.<br>
      <br>
      To address these limitations, we developed a new microscope using
      ultrathin light sheets derived from two-dimensional (2D) optical
      lattices. These are scanned plane-by-plane through the specimen to
      generate a 3D image. The thinness of the sheet leads to high axial
      resolution and negligible photobleaching and background outside of
      the focal plane, while its simultaneous illumination of the entire
      field of view permits imaging at hundreds of planes per second
      even at extremely low peak excitation intensities. By implementing
      either superresolution structured illumination or by dithering the
      lattice to create a uniform light sheet, we imaged cells and small
      embryos in three dimensions, often at subsecond intervals, for
      hundreds to thousands of time points at the diffraction limit and
      beyond.<br>
      <br>
      We demonstrated the technique on 20 different biological processes
      spanning four orders of magnitude in space and time, including the
      binding kinetics of single Sox2 transcription factor molecules, 3D
      superresolution photoactivated localization microscopy of nuclear
      lamins, dynamic organelle rearrangements and 3D tracking of
      microtubule plus ends during mitosis, neutrophil motility in a
      collagen mesh, and subcellular protein localization and dynamics
      during embryogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila
      melanogaster. Throughout, we established the performance
      advantages of lattice light-sheet microscopy compared with
      previous techniques and highlighted phenomena that, when seen at
      increased spatiotemporal detail, may hint at previously unknown
      biological mechanisms.<br>
      Conclusion<br>
      <br>
      Photobleaching and phototoxicity are typically reduced by one to
      two orders of magnitude relative to that seen with a 1D scanned
      Bessel beam or the point array scanned excitation of spinning disk
      confocal microscopy. This suggests that the instantaneous peak
      power delivered to the specimen may be an even more important
      metric of cell health than the total photon dose and should enable
      extended 3D observation of endogenous levels of even sparsely
      expressed proteins produced by genome editing. Improvements of
      similar magnitude in imaging speed and a twofold gain in axial
      resolution relative to confocal microscopy yield 4D spatiotemporal
      resolution high enough to follow fast, nanoscale dynamic processes
      that would otherwise be obscured by poor resolution along one or
      more axes of spacetime. Last, the negligible background makes
      lattice light-sheet microscopy a promising platform for the
      extension of all methods of superresolution to larger and more
      densely fluorescent specimens and enables the study of signaling,
      transport, and stochastic self-assembly in complex environments
      with single-molecule sensitivity.<br>

      surface (11A) side of the structure body (11), for example, is a
      region in which the pressure of the deuterium is high due to
      pressure or electrolysis and the like, and the other surface (11B)
      side, for example, is a region in which the pressure of the
      deuterium is low due to vacuum exhausting and the like, and
      thereby, a flow of deuterium in the structure body (11) is
      produced,and nuclide transmutation is carried out by a reaction
      between the deuterium and the material (14) that undergoes nuclide
      transmutation.<br>

      <b>Energy generat</b><b>ion apparatus and method<br>
        US 20110122984<br>
        ABSTRACT </b>-- A practical technique for inducing and
      controlling the fusion nuclei within a solid lattice. A reactor
      includes a loading source to provide the light nuclei which are to
      be fused, a lattice which can absorb the light nuclei, a source of
      phonon energy, and a control mechanism to start and stop
      stimulation of phonon energy and/or the loading of reactants. The
      lattice transmits phonon energy sufficient to affect
      electron-nucleus collapse. By controlling the stimulation of
      phonon energy and controlling the loading of light nuclei into the
      lattice, energy released by the fusion reactions is allowed to
      dissipate before it builds to the point that it causes destruction
      of the reaction lattice.<br>
      <b>Theory of Operation<br>
        The Source of the Observed Energy in So Called "Cold Fusion"<br>
      </b>Unlike the common assumptions involved in "Cold Fusion," it is
      believed that the energy released in these reactions is the result
      of neutron capture by hydrogen isotopes and the beta decay of 4H
      to 4He.<br>
      An additional alternative reaction path is a 2H undergoing an
      electron capture event and combining with a passing 2H to form
      4He.<br>
      <b>The Source of the Free Neutrons<br>
      </b>The neutrons participating in these reactions are the product
      of flavor change of protons that have been loaded into the core
      lattice (while the current implementation contemplates a
      crystalline core, other implementations may use ceramic cores or
      powder beds). The flavor change represents the transmutation of
      the proton into a neutron by a process similar to electron
      capture. Neutron generation requires a crystal lattice capable of
      generating phonons, capable of loading hydrogen ions, and which
      can supply valence or conduction band electrons, providing the
      ˜511 KeV electron mass. The required system is one that can
      achieve a total Hamiltonian energy of ˜782 KeV. This value
      represents the difference in mass between the proton-electron
      combination and the mass of the neutron. This combination leads to
      the transformation of a proton and electron into a neutron. This
      is an endothermic reaction that leads to an overall lower system
      energy level. The system is converting only enough energy (mass)
      to affect an electron capture, leaving the resulting neutron at an
      extremely low energy level. The resulting low energy neutron has a
      high cross section of reaction with respect to (1-3)H nuclei in
      the lattice. This neutron capture is similar to the process
      leading to a neutron star as discussed in [Baym1971], and applies
      to the H, D and T caught in the lattice and further enhanced by
      the quantum currents which allows the lower loading in this
      system.<br>
      It is believed that that energy is transferred to the protons
      through superposition of multiple phonon wave functions within the
      lattice of the core. This energy grows very rapidly as the
      non-bonded energy is extremely asymmetric. As mentioned in
      [NIH_Guide], "Repulsion is modeled by an equation that is designed
      to rapidly blow up at close distances (1/r12dependency)."
      Additional energy beyond the phonon energy is realized from atomic
      band state confinement of ions. When local loading of the lattice
      is high, hydrogen ions take up positions at the octahedral points
      of vacant S(n+1) electron orbitals between the PnS(n+1) orbital
      wave function energy levels in transition metals. This wave
      function energy level occupation provides confinement necessary
      for what is referred to as Quantum Compression, a property arising
      out of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.<br>

        Method for Producing Heavy Electrons<br>

        Nickel alloys for hydrogen storage and the generation of energy
        therefrom<br>
        US 20140126680<br>
        ABSTRACT -- </b>An apparatus for the generation of thermal
      energy comprises a reactor vessel containing a volume of
      pressurized hydrogen; a hydrogen-storing nickel alloy structure in
      the reactor vessel and configured to have an electric potential
      applied across it and to be heated to at least about 100 C; and a
      heat exchange conduit configured to carry a heat exchange medium
      past the nickel alloy structure so as to allow thermal energy
      generated in the nickel alloy structure to be transferred to the
      heat exchange medium. The hydrogen-storing nickel alloy structure
      comprises a nickel alloy skeletal catalyst mixed with an oxide.
      The applied electric potential, and the increase in the gas
      pressure and temperature of the hydrogen from the applied heat,
      create a reaction between hydrogen nuclei and nickel nuclei in the
      nickel alloy structure whereby thermal energy is generated by the
      emission of phonons from the nickel alloy structure.<br>

        Method of acceleration of nuclear transmutation of isotopes by
        carrying out exothermic reactions<br>
        US 20140192941<br>
        ABSTRACT</b> -- Methods for acceleration of nuclear
      transmutation of tritium and radioactive isotopes of metals, and
      decontamination of metals contaminated with radioactive isotopes
      by destroying radioactive isotopes to a required level of residual
      radioactive inventory in metals with simultaneous release of
      thermal energy via stimulating accelerated transmutation with the
      half-life parameters describing kinetics of radioactive isotope
      destruction much shorter than their generally accepted half-life.
      The stimulus is applied to radioactive metals by placing them into
      a chamber, exposing them to gaseous substances of the group of
      hydrogen, deuterium, tritium, or a mixture of these isotopes in a
      molecular hydrogen form for said gaseous substances to be absorbed
      by the metals, heating the metals to a temperature of at least
      200° C. and maintaining at the said temperature. Exothermic
      reactions of non-radioactive metals with deuterium, tritium, or a
      mixture of these isotopes in a molecular hydrogen form release a
      significant amount of energy.<br>
      Irrespectively of a mechanism of nuclear reactions involving
      tritium—radioactive decay and/or nuclear reactions with tritium
      participation—certain amount of energy is released in these
      experiments. Therefore, tritium in metals could be used as a
      source of energy production.<br>
      A search for economically viable alternative sources of energy
      production has been going on for the last several decades.
      Recently, an economically viable method of energy production based
      on exothermic reaction of nickel with hydrogen was proposed by A.
      Rossi (Italian patent No. 0001387256 issued on 6 Apr. 2011).
      According to the patent, a highly efficient exothermal reaction
      between nickel atoms and hydrogen atoms takes place in a tube,
      preferably, though not exclusively made of a metal, filled with a
      nickel powder and heated to a high temperature preferably, though
      not necessarily, of 150 to 500° C., by injecting hydrogen into the
      said metal tube with the said nickel powder being pressurized,
      preferably, though not necessarily, to a pressure of 2 to 20 bars.
      In the exothermal reaction described in the patent, the hydrogen
      nuclei are compressed around the metal atom nuclei (as the
      capability of nickel to absorb hydrogen is high), while the said
      high temperature generates inter-nuclear percussions which are
      made stronger by the catalytic action of other optional
      undisclosed elements, thereby triggering a capture of a proton by
      the nickel powder, with a consequent transformation of nickel to
      copper and a beta+ decay of the latter to a nickel nucleus having
      a mass larger by a unit than that of the original nickel.<br>
      The said patent did not specify an isotopic composition of nickel
      used for the experiments; therefore, for a purpose of estimating
      heat release in this reaction, we used an isotopic composition of
      nickel with an abundance of the stable isotopes existing on the
      Earth. Table 1 shows possible products of the nuclear reactions of
      nickel isotopes with hydrogen atoms. For the purpose of our
      estimates, cross sections for all isotopes are assumed to be
      identical. An energy released per each nuclear reaction of nickel
      isotopes is estimated based on Einstein's equation, ?E=?mc2. As
      can be seen from Table 1, each nickel isotope can theoretically
      react with hydrogen atom. Assuming that all nuclear reactions of
      each isotope of a nickel sample with hydrogen atoms are going on
      in parallel, energy released by g-atom of nickel (2.38E+24 MeV) is
      calculated based on stoichiometric concentrations of the nickel
      stable isotopes. Moreover, most of nickel stable isotopes will be
      mainly transformed to stable 29Cu63 isotope provided a sufficient
      amount of hydrogen atoms is available.<br>

        Resonant Vacuum Arc Discharge Apparatus for Nuclear Fusion<br>
        US 20120008728<br>
        ABSTRACT -- </b>The present invention relates to a resonant
      vacuum arc discharge apparatus for producing nuclear fusion. A
      resonant high-frequency high-voltage alternating current (AC)
      power supply is used to efficiently power a fusion tube normally
      containing deuterium, tritium and/or helium-3 vapor. Metals that
      can hold large amounts of hydrogen isotopes such as palladium and
      titanium can be used to increase the target density. The nuclear
      fusion device can be used for energy production, well logging,
      uranium mining, neutron activation analysis, isotope production or
      other applications that require a neutron source.<br>
      <br>
      The inventor previously received patents for a resonant power
      supply for producing vacuum arc discharges, U.S. Pat. No.
      6,630,799, and for a vacuum arc discharge apparatus for the
      efficient production of x-rays, U.S. Pat. No. 6,765,987. These
      devices used a high-voltage resonant circuit attached to the cold
      cathode electrodes of a partially evacuated tube in order to
      produce x-rays. The resonant AC circuit was significantly more
      efficient than a DC powered x-ray source of the same voltage and
      energy. The x-ray tube in its preferred embodiment used a noble
      gas such as xenon or argon at pressures in the low millitorr
      range.<br>

        Material surface treatment method using concurrent electrical
        and photonic stimulation<br>
        US 20130233718<br>
        ABSTRACT<br>
      </b>A material surface treatment protocol (e.g., FIG. 13) uses
      concurrent electronic and photonic stimulation to generate an
      exothermic reaction and coat the surface (e.g., FIGS. 8 and 9) of
      a material, such as palladium. This protocol is performed at or
      near the boiling point of water within a sealed vessel that
      prevents the escape of steam and that is lined with silica or a
      similar glass to increase the silica available to the reaction.
      The great majority of the applied energy is heat used to elevate
      the temperature to near the boiling point, while concurrent
      stimulations provide only about 100 mW of additional energy for
      the surface treatment.<br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
      </b>The protocol typically requires at least two hours of
      treatment before bursts of heat are observed. It is suspected that
      something must be happening to either the solution or to the
      electrodes in that period to facilitate the observed reaction.
      Lithium salts, such as lithium sulfate (Li2SO4), are used as an
      electrolyte in the solution. Since the reaction does not occur
      immediately, it is possible that the silica and the lithium in our
      protocol are bonding in some way before the bursts of heat are
      observed. In particular, the lithium may be combining with the
      silica compound in the solution over the time frame of the
      treatment protocol to form a lithium silicate, possibly Li2SiO3
      (lithium metasilicate). Alternatively, since silsesquioxanes were
      used in the anionic silica hydride in the solution for the
      experiments, perhaps the lithium is either bonding to resulting
      siliceous cage structures or entering the center of the silica
      cage when that compound is used as the source of the silica.<br>
      The energy density of the reaction shown in the data log is thus
      234 Joules/41.5×10-12 m3 or 5.64×103 MJ/L.<br>
      Making the worst-case assumption that the active region of the
      reaction has the 12.0 g/cm3 density of fully dense palladium, that
      converts to 470 MJ/kg.<br>
      That energy density is several times greater than molecular energy
      densities, thus providing further evidence that the reaction is
      not a molecular chemical reaction.<br>
      At the present state of the research in LENRs, it is not known
      whether the lithium silicate is a reactant, in which case it would
      be consumed in the reaction, or a catalyst, in which case it would
      not be consumed.<br>
      The nature and shape of the bursts of heat recorded in our data
      logs, together with the condition of the electrode surfaces seen
      from SEM analyses, indicate that the surface temperature of the
      electrodes may locally approach or even attain the 1555° C.
      melting point of palladium, such that the solution at the surface
      of that electrode can locally flash to steam. A continuous
      reaction requires the on-going replenishment of solution in the
      liquid phase, which naturally occurs in the test reaction reactor.
      An alternative protocol may be to provide fresh solution at that
      inlet of a nozzle where the steam is exhausted.<br>

      transportation for long operation range with zero emission using
      an onboard low energy nuclear reaction thermal generator. The
      present invention generally includes a thermal generator within a
      thermal enclosure case, an energy conversion system linked with
      the thermal generator, an energy storage system linked with the
      energy conversion system, a cooling system and a central control
      system. The thermal generator reacts nickel powder with hydrogen
      within a reactor chamber to produce heat. The heat is then
      transferred to the energy conversion system to be converted into
      electricity for storage in the energy storage system. The cooling
      system provides cooling for the various components of the present
      invention and the control system regulates its overall operation.

        Abstract</b> -- The device (100) has a piston (120) mounted and
      reciprocally moved in front and rearward directions in cylinders
      through operating gases that is stored in the cylinder. Pressure
      of the operating gases is temporally predetermined-changed using a
      temperature controller, and heating of the operating gases is
      performed by a reaction of a reaction metal with a reaction gas.
      The reaction metal and reaction gas are provided in a region
      closer to a closed front surface (114) of the cylinder, where the

      particular the possibility of heating of the working gas inside
      said at least one cylinder of the Stirling engine system by a
      reaction of a reactive metal and a reaction gas. This implies a
      compact design with a comparatively low weight. The crucial factor
      is the high energy gain, which is generated by means of the
      materials used in this invention. Because the heat-generating
      reaction proceeds without the consumption of oxygen and therefore
      can be installed in the interior of the cylinder, a fast-acting,
      direct heat without the interposition of another heat transfer
      medium is possible, as is the case in the conventional case by the
      material of the cylinder wall. In this way, the working gas can be
      brought to an average operating temperature more rapidly than in
      the prior art.<br>

          When we complain about the rain, other people will often say
          "Yeah, but it's good for the plants." Well, thanks to a
          microturbine-based system created by three students from the
          Technological University of Mexico, it's now also being used
          to generate electricity for use in low-income homes.<br>
          <br>
          In a nutshell, the Pluvia system – developed by Omar Enrique
          Leyva Coca, Romel Brown and Gustavo Rivero Velázquez – uses
          the stream of rainwater runoff from houses' rooftop rain
          gutters to spin a microturbine in a cylindrical housing.
          Electricity generated by that turbine is used to charge
          12-volt batteries, which can in turn be used to power LED
          lamps or other small household appliances.<br>
          <br>
          The generator measures about 2 inches wide by 10 inches high
          (51 x 254 mm), and receives the water through a half-inch (13
          mm) pipe. Once the water has flowed through the microturbine,
          it proceeds to pass through a charcoal filter and into a
          storage tank, leaving it "equal to or cleaner than the water
          in the network supply system of Mexico City," according to the
          students.<br>
          <br>
          The Pluvia system has already been tested in Mexico City's
          Iztapalapa community. The university now hopes to increase the
          power of the system, allowing it to generate a greater amount
          of electricity.<br>

          Almost FREE electricity with Boondee Electron generator<br>
          <br>
          Electron generator was invented by the inventor of Boondee
          Workshop<br>
          <br>
          It needs a little power --&nbsp; as little as 6 volts DC -- to
          start up the energy. Ater that the engine will generate
          electric power and not require 6 volt anymore. During the
          generating electricity the engine become hot -- about 120*C.
          -- so we are developing the next prototype to ventilate the
          heat. This 1st prototype can generate AC electricity 220 volt
          / 1000 watts. Have to stop the engine every 3 hours and wait
          about 5 minutes to restarting again.<br>
          <br>
          In July 16, 2011 I just built a new version of electron
          generator model FE-88. It use battery size AA x 8 pcs to warm
          up the system.<br>

          Further indications have come to light that Dean Warwick,
          alternative energy pioneer and intelligence insider did not
          die of natural causes.<br>
          <br>
          Dean Warwick collapsed and died whilst addressing a packed
          auditorium in Blackpool last weekend. Significantly however,
          he said he felt a “beam” or “burning” at the side of his head
          shortly before beginning his talk.<br>
          <br>
          According to those who last spoke to him before he began his
          talk, Dean said: “I think I’m going to be bumped off”.<br>
          <br>
          Originally from New Zealand but now resident in Scotland, Dean
          had promised to make some momentous announcements at the
          conference.<br>
          <br>
          In the weeks prior to speaking at Probe International’s
          conference, Dean had given Dave Starbuck a foretaste of what
          was coming in an interview.<br>
          <br>
          Among other things, Dean promised that he would name who was
          behind the murder of Bobby Kennedy.<br>
          <br>
          However, he said, that would only be the beginning. For he
          told Dave Starbuck that he would also name the “Anti-Christ”
          and blow the whistle on underground bases and missing
          children.<br>
          <br>
          In the taped interview with Dave Starbuck, he also revealed
          how and why seven survivors at Lockerbie were allowed to die
          from hypothermia. The reason, he said, was that the survivors
          knew that a terrorist bombing did not bring down Pam Am Flight
          103, which went down in 1988 killing 270 passengers and crew.<br>
          <br>
          They were allowed to die, said Dean, because they knew that a
          missile or beam weapon brought down the Jumbo jet and had they
          lived, would have been able to testify to this.<br>
          <br>
          Such knowledge however, made Dean Warwick a very dangerous man
          to those with things to hide. Which is why questions are being
          asked about his sudden demise.<br>
          <br>
          According to Dave Starbuck who was at the Probe International
          conference when he spoke, Dean was starting to hit his stride.
          He got to the point when he said he was about to reveal who
          was behind Bobby Kennedy’s murder, the name of the
          “Anti-Christ” and more besides.<br>
          <br>
          But before he did, Dean sat down as if composing his thoughts
          prior to speaking again.<br>
          <br>
          He never did though.<br>
          <br>
          Instead, he keeled over and fell from the stage and despite
          efforts to revive him, was pronounced dead shortly thereafter.<br>
          <br>
          Although a post mortem has yet to be conducted, the
          circumstances surrounding Dean’s death are highly suspicious.
          All the more so as those who witnessed the event and tried to
          telephone this website were unable to do so.<br>
          <br>
          Although we took no calls this weekend, our phone line was
          reportedly “permanently engaged”. Making it seem all the more
          likely that Dean was "taken out", possibly by a beam weapon,
          by a group with a vested interest in keeping the lid on what
          is really going on.<br>

          <b>Dean Warwick: Ampliflaire Efficient Wood-Burning Stove</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Dean Warwick’s patented Ampliflaire is a major break-through
          in heating technology and is theonly heat exchange process
          capable of raising combustion cycle efficiency within fuel
          burning systems.Other systems of heat exchange by their very
          nature must lower combustion cycle efficiency.Ampliflaire
          recovers the heat energy other systems lose. Wherever fuel is
          burned or heat energy iswasted, there is a unit to resolve the
          problem, and flue-pipe models, retro-fitted to conventional
          boilers,convert them into overall effective condensing systems
          with remarkable savings.Ampliflaire open fires release the
          electrical energy in plants, absorbed from the sun during
          thegrowing cycle. Grown fuels are the most efficient
          converters of solar energy, and the burning of grownfuels in
          this way is the safe way to make available energy from a
          nuclear reaction.As hydroxides (OH) of carbon (C), the
          potential energy in plants far outshines their current
          use.With the largest man-made forest in Europe, the United
          Kingdom Government already recognizes acommitment to grown
          fuel which can easily satisfy British needs. Examples are
          winter species grass for methane gas, bio-diesel, hydrogen
          from plants, liquids, and wood replenishing solids.Ampliflaire
          reduces heating bills by approximately 90%, reduces pollution,
          increases propertyvalue, removes household dust, eradicates
          condensation, and efficiently circulates refreshed air.The
          company’s brochure features numerous practical cases of
          individual or commercial clients whoare now enjoying the
          benefits of Ampliflaire. From small cottages to large hotels,
          from churches to business premises, the company has an
          efficient and effective system available. <br>

          .Dean Warwick keeled over dead October 7, 2006 in the middle
          of a Unidentified Flying Object(UFO) conference presentation
          in Blackpool, UK. Mr. Warwick was an alternative energy
          pioneer, former U.S. Government officer and intelligence
          insider who had promised to make some momentous announcements.
          The circumstances suggest a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
          ‘hit’ using an Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) weapon. These ELF
          weapons can be set on a ‘delta wave’ and are able to shut a
          person’s nervous system down.&nbsp; Much of this technology
          has been perfected on the 4th level of the CIA underground
          Dulce facility in the New Mexico desert. The fourth level of
          this underground base deals with technological aspects of
          human aura research, dream manipulation, hypnosis, telepathy
          and advanced mind control. The ELF weapons ‘suck’ the life out
          the victim’s body, and Warwick literally ’fell asleep’ on his
          feet<br>
          <br>
          The suspected assassin was followed out of the auditorium by a
          quick-thinking woman who then observed him laughing as he
          proudly reported his murderous deed on his cell phone.

          </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Heating apparatus for heating an environment comprises one or
          more heat exchange conduits (A, B, C, D, E, F, 6, 8) located
          in the flow path of primary heated fluid (F1-F2), and a device
          (4) for inducing a flow of air in each conduit, each conduit
          being adapted to carry air into, through and out of a heat
          flow path to the environment (2), the arrangement being such
          that, in use, air within the conduits progresses from a cooler
          to a hotter part of the heat flow path, and the conduits are
          spaced closer together toward the downstream direction of the
          flow path to improve the efficiency of heat exchange between
          the primary heated fluid and secondary air in the conduits.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          This invention relates to heating apparatus, particularly of
          the type which makes use of heat from existing heating or
          cooking apparatus.<br>
          <br>
          Open fires, closed fires, boilers, cookers (solid fuel, oil or
          gas), ceiling mounted radiant gas heaters and etc, loose
          valuable heat to the outside atmosphere without the benefit of
          all the heat generated having contributed to the inside
          atmosphere of the home or workplace.<br>
          <br>
          Heat is transmitted by three means; Radiation, Convection and
          Conduction. Most of the heat transmitted to the room from an
          open fire is by radiation. No convected heat emits from an
          open fire--it cannot. All the convected heat and most of the
          conducted heat--which conducted heat in turn transfers to
          convected heat in the main as air passing over the fire
          surrounds draws on that heat and takes it away up the flue--is
          lost up the flue and in turn to the outside atmosphere.<br>
          <br>
          All fires--unless supplied with air for combustion in a sealed
          ducted source from the exterior--actually lower room
          temperature for some time after starting up. An open fire on
          an exterior wall is at best 10% efficient, on an interior wall
          is at best 20% efficient. A free standing closed solid fuel
          fire is at best 30% efficient. Solid fuel, oil or gas cookers
          are at best 53% efficient. Ceiling mounted radiant gas heaters
          are at the 30% efficient, and wall mounted radiant/convector
          gas heaters are at best 50% efficient. Solid fuel, oil or gas
          boilers are in the 50%-60% efficiency range with the most
          efficient being a very low output gas boiler in the region of
          74% efficiency. These figures take into account all the heat
          generated which actually finds its way first to the interior
          including that which bleeds through the linings and structure
          of the flue to the interior. The remaining percentage is the
          heat energy which is lost to the outside atmosphere without
          benefit to the purpose for the heating system--this is the
          heat lost up the flue in the form of the convected heat
          generated in the system, and in turn a part of that convected
          heat which is converted to conducted heat and lost through the
          exterior lining and structure of the flue.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          An object of this invention is to provide heating apparatus
          which makes use of the otherwise wasted heat and returns it
          back to the interior of the area being heated.<br>
          <br>
          According to the present invention, there is provided heating
          apparatus for heating an environment, comprising a passage
          defining a flowpath for warm gas, the flowpath being adapted
          to pass warm gas past a plurality of heat exchange tubes
          generally transverse to the flowpath and spaced therealong,
          the tubes forming at least in part at least one heat exchange
          conduit adapted to carry air through the flowpath from a
          downstream to an upstream part thereof in indirect heat
          exchange, and air-flow inducing means for inducing a flow of
          air in the or each conduit and thence to the environment,
          characterized in that the spacing between adjacent tubes
          progressively decreases in the downstream direction of the
          flowpath thereby in use progressively improving the rate of
          heat exchange between the air and the warm gas.<br>
          <br>
          Preferably one or more heat exchange conduits comprises one or
          more first banks of parallel tubes extending into a heat flow
          path, the inlets of the tubes being operatively connected to
          air flow-inducing means, and one or more second banks of
          parallel tubes connected directly or indirectly to the outlets
          of the first tubes and extending out of the heat flow path.<br>
          <br>
          Preferably, the one or more heat exchange conduits comprises a
          plurality of parallel tube elements which provide a sinuous
          flow path for air.<br>
          <br>
          Preferably the or each heat exchange conduit is in the form of
          a continuous tube.<br>
          <br>
          Heating apparatus according to the present invention comprises
          a plurality of banks of tubes for parallel spaced location in
          the path of a flow of heat, each bank being in
          intercommunication with the or each end adjacent bank by
          passage means and so disposed that the bank nearest the heat
          source is upstream of the heat flow and the bank remote or
          remotest from the heat source is downstream of the or each
          other bank, and air flow-inducing means for inducing a flow of
          air into the bank or banks of tubes at the downstream end of
          the heat flow, to pass the air through successive banks,
          provided to the upstream bank or banks nearest the heat source
          from which the air exits into a room or other enclosed area,
          the air as it enters the downstream bank or banks of tubes
          being relatively cool and being gradually heated as it passes
          through successive banks of tubes to exit at the upstream bank
          or banks of tubes at a higher temperature.<br>
          <br>
          Preferably, where more than two banks of tubes are provided,
          the spacing between adjacent banks decreases towards the
          downstream bank.<br>
          <br>
          Preferably the banks of tubes are formed as a unit and are
          located in a containment member mounted, in the warm gas flow
          path.<br>
          <br>
          Preferably the air inlet or inlets to the or the most,
          downstream bank, or banks of tubes, is, or are, operatively
          connected to the air flow-inducing means, and the air outlet
          or outlets from the, or the most upstream, bank, or banks, of
          tubes communicate with a common room or other enclosed area
          whereby cool air is withdrawn therefrom into the banks of
          tubes and heated air is returned thereto.<br>
          <br>
          Preferably the tubes in the banks downstream of the two most
          upstream banks progressively reduce in wall thickness from two
          upstream banks.<br>

          </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
          </b><b><br>
          </b>Referring firstly to FIGS. 1 to 6, the room air flowing
          into the system to be heated is shown at 1 and the heated air
          returning is shown at 2. FIG. 1 is an open fire burning coal,
          wood, peat, gas (artificial logs or coal), and etc., with the
          unit of FIG. 3, fitted to the top of the open surround by a
          containment 19 and 20 shown in FIG. 2 as if a drawer in its
          slider to a cabinet.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 4 shows a unit 30 (in exploded view) fitted to the after
          flue pipe 31 of a closed fire 32.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 5 shows a unit 30a fitted to the after flue pipe 31a of a
          solid fuel, oil or gas fired cooker/boiler 32a.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 6 shows a unit 30b fitted to the flue pipe 31b in the
          chimney breast above an open fire.<br>
          <br>
          Other applications of the system are possible. A unit may be
          above a ceiling mounted radiant gas heater in a factory or
          warehouse. A unit may have the inlet 1 and the outlet 2 on the
          opposite sides of the wall to the heat source, e.g. as shown
          in FIG. 6, and the inlet 1 and the outlet 2 may be on opposite
          sides of the wall in each other, e.g. where emission is
          required in an adjoining room or hallway or into an adjacent
          cupboard for use as an airing cupboard. A unit may or may not
          have a supply of ducted fresh air from the exterior supplied
          to the inlet 1 and a unit may or may not have air from outlet
          2 ducted away to some distant use. All applications of the
          system are dependant on the requirements of the user.<br>
          <br>
          The working principles of the system are shown in FIG. 7 and
          FIG. 8 which show banks of tubes A, B, C, D, E, F, through
          which may be forced air from the room to be heated. The flow
          of the air through the unit is in the form of from the room 1
          through the upper banks of tubes 6 down through the
          communicating chamber or header 7 and back through the lower
          banks of tubes 8 and return to the room 2. 25 is a seperating
          membrane. Flue gases from the heat source (fire etc.) rise up
          through the array of tubes at F1 and exit at F2. As the flue
          gases travel through the banks of tubes they heat up these
          tubes which in turn pass their heat on to the air passing
          through the tubes as shown in, FIG. 9.<br>
          <br>
          The passage of air through the tubes is in overall effect in
          reverse order to that of the passage of the flue gases. Cool
          room air entering the system meets cooled flue gases leaving
          the system in the upper banks of tubes. This room air is
          gradually heated as it passes through the system, the reverse
          being the case for the flue gases, and meets the hotter flue
          gases entering the system in the lower banks of tubes as
          it--the room air--then leaves this harmonious system.<br>
          <br>
          FIGS. 10, 11, 12, and 13 depict a unit in schematic elevation,
          end view, partial cross section and plan view, which unit may
          be fitted to the upper part of the opening to an open fire (as
          depicted in FIGS. 1 and 3) with the containment unit depicted
          in FIGS. 14 and 15 (as depicted in FIG. 2). Air is shown
          entering from the room 1 through a probable filter 3 and into
          the unit through the fan or fans 4, along a communication duct
          5 and into the banks of tubes 6 (FIG. 12, only one tube shown
          for clarity) and into the communicating duct 7, or header, and
          down and back through the banks of tubes 8 (FIG. 12, only one
          tube shown for clarity) and exiting into the room 2.<br>
          <br>
          In the typical system with banks of tubes A, B, C, D, E, F,
          there may be a unit spacing horizontally between tubes of d
          for diameter, and a spacing between F and E which is less than
          the spacing between E and D which is less than the spacing
          between D and C which is less than the spacing between C and B
          which is less than the spacing between B and A. The net effect
          of this is that the spacing X between tubes from one bank to
          another and through which passes flue gases from F1 to F2, is
          gradually reduced as the flue gases approach the upper banks
          of tubes. The flue gases enter the system F1 and pass through
          the spacing X between banks B and A and heat is given up to
          the tubes contacted (FIG. 9). The flue gases--now reduced in
          temperature--travel on to spacing X between banks C and B
          which is smaller than that at B and A and which squeezes the
          flue gases and increases the flue gas pressure at this point,
          above that which it would have been had the flue gases met a
          spacing X between banks C and B the same as the spacing X
          between banks B and A. From gas law P.multidot.V/T is a
          constant and this increase in flue gas pressure has the effect
          of raising the flue gas temperature as it passes through
          spacing X, and by the raising of the flue gas temperature at
          that point effecting an increase in the heat exchange between
          the flue gases flowing round the tubes and the air flowing
          through the tubes. As the volume of flue gases remains a
          constant the flue velocity through spacing X is thereby
          increased. This process is repeated again and again through
          each spacing X at each juncture of banks of tubes until the
          flue gases leave the system F2 much reduced in temperature,
          and more so--reduced in temperature--than had the flue gases
          merely passed through a system with the spacings X a constant,
          and with this overall effective throat system having increased
          flue velocity to such an extent as to negate the possibility
          of back puff into the heat source.<br>
          <br>
          The gauge thickness of the tube wall (FIG. 9) 26, in the two
          lower banks A and B are of equal gauge and of such thickness
          as to minimize their destruction from heat contact. The system
          may be further enhanced by the tubes in the upper banks above
          A and B being constructed of a gauge wall thickness lighter
          than that of tubes A and B and reducing in gauge wall
          thickness to the lightest being in the uppermost bank. This
          would have the effect of maximizing the rate of transfer of
          heat to the room air passing through the tubes which room air
          is quenching the inner wall of the tube of the heat conducted
          through the tube wall thickness. The net effect of this being
          maximum heat gain in the room air and maximum heat loss in the
          flue gases, i.e. maximum efficiency in the system.<br>
          <br>
          A unit may comprise any number of tubes from two upwards
          depending on the system required for a particular application.<br>
          <br>
          FIGS. 16 and 17 are further embodiments of the previously
          stated system whereby flue gases enter at F1 and exit at F2
          through a greater number of tubes than depicted in FIG. 7,
          with room air entering at 1 and flowing through tubes 6 into
          and down communicating duct 7 and through tubes 8 and down
          communicating duct 9 and through tubes 10 and down
          communicating duct 11 and through tubes 12 and exiting into
          the room 2. FIG. 18 is a schematic elevation of FIGS. 16 and
          17 with flue gases entering F1 and exiting F2 with room air
          entering at 1 and exiting at 2, for a possible installation to
          a chimney breast as depicted in FIG. 6 with a plan view of the
          containment depicted in FIG. 20, as 19, having flange 20 for
          bolting the unit in a gas proof seal, with the unit taking
          heat from the gases in a standard wall flue 21. Further
          adaptations of this unit are as previously stated--into an
          airing cupboard and/or another room and etc.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 19 is a schematic cross section of a possible system to a
          boiler or cooker or free standing heater as depicted in FIGS.
          4 and 5 with further banks of tubes in addition to these
          previously stated,--through tubes 12--and down communicating
          duct 13 and through tubes 14 and down communicating duct 15
          and through tubes 16 and exiting into the room 2. The
          containment here is an open sided box 17 with flange 20 for a
          gas proof seal and flue connector 18 at either end of the box
          for connection to after flue pipe of the heat source.<br>
          <br>
          A further adaptation may be as in FIG. 1 where the fans
          housings 22 may be fitted at the bottoms of legs--as
          communicating ducts, vertically to and with duct 5,
          immediately in front of 23--and thereby allowing the open fire
          to be increased in size forward of its original surround 23
          and with a larger grate fitted forward of the original at 24.
          The unit is removable from its containment structure thereby
          providing accessibility for the cleaning of the flue and also
          the unit itself which may be immersed, e.g. in a bath of
          liquids capable of dissolving any solid matter adhering to the
          unit. The unit could be constructed of materials such as
          stainless steel for appearance and freedom of maintenance and,
          e.g. zinc galvanized or electroplated steel tubes etc, and
          which unit by its removability may be maintained by redipping
          etc, if required.<br>
          <br>
          Central heating is generally represented by radiators supplied
          with hot water from a boiler system through pipes, and over
          which radiators--should be referred to as convectors as
          radiation does not take place without a 200 deg C temperature
          difference between the radiator and the radiated--flows room
          air convecting away the heat to room furniture and etc, and
          generally raising room temperature.<br>
          <br>
          With the unit fitted to an ordinary open fire, central heating
          is achieved without the cost and space of an installation of
          boiler, pipes or radiators. Air flowing through the unit at
          temperatures well in excess of 100 degC from a fan rated at
          about 100 CFM (cubic feet per minute) will be taken through or
          under doors, through Building Regulation required room
          ventilators and/or by other means--depicted--to all parts of a
          standard sized home, and in a short space of time drastically
          improve the temperature of that home. ##EQU1##<br>
          <br>
          The cost of running a 100 CFM fan is 1 unit of electricity
          (6.38 pence) per 40 Hrs, with a life expectancy of the fan
          between 25,000-30,000 Hrs (1250 days) continuous running.<br>
          <br>
          The apparatus as hereinbefore described provides filtered
          particle free air and heated (depending on the fire built up)
          to temperatures well in excess of 100 deg C, which intensely
          heated air within the unit provides a bacterium and virus
          destruct--the vast majority of these being destroyed at 121
          deg C--environment, further benefiting the interior
          environment of the home or workplace in providing all around
          warmth from an open fire--whereas without the apparatus a
          person would be warm on the side facing the fire and on the
          other side, and in providing a de-humidified (condensation
          loss), and well ventilated atmosphere.<br>
          <br>
          Testing a unit of four banks of parallel spaced tubes in an
          open fire of dimensions 24 inches wide by 18 inches deep and
          using one fan of 100 CFM rating gave the following results in
          output:<br>

          The unit generally performed in the region of 80% efficiency,
          with the slight discrepancies in the test results being due to
          the fluctuation of flame strength resulting from the burning
          of wood only, for the results obtained in all tests.<br>
          <br>
          Further tests were performed for actual output readings, and
          with Test 6 of the unit fitted into the top of an open fire of
          average burn; actual output from the unit registered 538,000
          BTU.<br>
          <br>
          During testing it was recorded that temperature some 40 feet
          distance from the unit, and seperated from the open fire by
          partitions, reached 0.8 deg C. higher than at positions 4 feet
          either side of the unit. It was also recorded that during all
          tests the unit remained cool to the touch, with Test 4
          recording only 32 deg C. on top of the unit.<br>

          <div align="center"><b>Synthetic setae</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Synthetic setae emulate the setae found on the toes of a gecko
          and scientific research in this area is driven towards the
          development of dry adhesives. Geckos have no difficulty
          mastering vertical walls and are apparently capable of
          adhering themselves to just about any surface. The 5-toed feet
          of a gecko are covered with elastic hairs called setae and the
          end of these hairs are split into nanoscale structures called
          spatulae (because of their resemblance to actual spatulas).
          The sheer abundance and proximity to the surface of these
          spatulae make it sufficient for van der Waals forces alone to
          provide the required adhesive strength.[1] Following the
          discovery of the gecko’s adhesion mechanism in 2002, which is
          based on van der Waals forces, biomimetic adhesives have
          become the topic of a major research effort. These
          developments are poised to yield families of novel adhesive
          materials with superior properties which are likely to find
          uses in industries ranging from defence and nanotechnology to
          healthcare and sport.<br>
          <b><br>
            Basic principles</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Geckos are renowned for their exceptional ability to stick and
          run on any vertical and inverted surface (excluding
          Teflon[3]). However gecko toes are not sticky in the usual way
          like chemical adhesives. Instead, they can detach from the
          surface quickly and remain quite clean around everyday
          contaminants even without grooming.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Extraordinary adhesion</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          The two front feet of a tokay gecko can withstand 20.1 N of
          force parallel to the surface with 227 mm2 of pad area,[4] a
          force as much as 40 times the gecko's weight. Scientists have
          been investigating the secret of this extraordinary adhesion
          ever since the 19th century, and at least seven possible
          mechanisms for gecko adhesion have been discussed over the
          past 175 years. There have been hypotheses of glue, friction,
          suction, electrostatics, micro-interlocking and intermolecular
          forces. Sticky secretions were ruled out first early in the
          study of gecko adhesion since geckos lack glandular tissue on
          their toes. The friction hypothesis was also dismissed quickly
          because the friction force only acts in shear which cannot
          explain the adhesive capabilities of geckos on inverted
          surfaces. The hypothesis that the toe pads act as suction cups
          was dispelled in 1934 by experiments carried out in a vacuum
          in which the gecko's toes remained stuck. Similarly, the
          electrostatic hypothesis was refuted by an experiment showing
          that geckos could still adhere even when the build-up of
          electrostatic charge was impossible (such as on a metal
          surface in air ionized by a stream of x-rays). The mechanism
          of microinterlocking which suggested that the curved tips of
          setae could act as microscale hooks was also challenged by the
          fact that geckos generate large adhesive forces even on
          molecularly smooth surfaces.<br>
          <br>
          The possibilities finally narrowed down to intermolecular
          forces, and the development of electron microscopy in the
          1950s, which revealed the micro-structure of the setae on the
          gecko's foot, provided further proof to support this
          hypothesis. The problem was finally solved in 2000 by a
          research team led by biologists Kellar Autumn of Lewis &amp;
          Clark College in Portland, Oregon, and Robert Full at the
          University of California at Berkeley.[6] They showed that the
          underside of a gecko toe typically bears a series of ridges,
          which are covered with uniform ranks of setae, and each setae
          further divides into hundreds of split ends and flat tips
          called spatulas (see figure on the right). A single seta of
          the tokay gecko is roughly 110 micrometers long and 4.2
          micrometers wide. Each of a seta's branches ends in a thin,
          triangular spatula connected at its apex. The end is about 0.2
          micrometers long and 0.2 micrometers wide.[5] The adhesion
          between gecko's foot and the surfaces is exactly the result of
          the Van der Waals force between each seta and the surface
          molecules. A single seta can generate up to 200\muN of
          force[7] There are about 14,400 setae per square millimeter on
          the foot of a tokay gecko, which leads to a total number of
          about 3,268,800 setae on a tokay gecko's two front feet. From
          the equation for intermolecular potential:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \Phi (R,D)=-\frac{\rho_1\rho_2\pi^2\alpha
          R}{6 D}<br>
          <br>
          where \rho_1 and \rho_2 are the number of contacts of the two
          surfaces, R is the radius of each contact and D is the
          distance between the two surfaces.<br>
          <br>
          We find that the intermolecular force, or the van der Waals
          force in this case between two surfaces is greatly dominated
          by the number of contacts. This is exactly the reason why the
          gecko's feet can generate extraordinary adhesion force to
          different kinds of surfaces. The combined effect of millions
          of spatulae provides an adhesive force many times greater than
          the gecko needs to hang from a ceiling by one foot.<br>
          <br>
          The surprisingly large forces generated by the gecko's toes
          made us wonder how geckos manage to lift their feet so quickly
          – in just 15 milliseconds – with no measurable detachment
          forces. A few years ago, Kellar Autumn and his research group
          found out the 'Lift-off mechanism' of the gecko's feet. Their
          discovery revealed that gecko adhesive actually works in a
          'programmable' way that by increasing the angle between the
          setal shaft and the substrate to 30 degrees, no matter how big
          the perpendicular adhesive force is, geckos 'turn off' the
          stickiness since the increased stress at the trailing edge of
          the seta causes the bonds between seta and the substrate to
          break.The seta then returns to an unloaded default state. On
          the other hand, by applying preload and dragging along the
          surface, the geckos turn on the modulate stickiness. This
          'Lift-off' mechanism can be shown in the figure on the right.<br>
          <b><br>
            Self-cleaning ability</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Unlike conventional adhesives, gecko adhesive becomes cleaner
          with repeated use, and thus stays quite clean around everyday
          contaminants such as sand, dust, leaf litter and pollen. In
          addition, unlike some plants and insects that have the ability
          of self-cleaning by droplets, geckos are not known to groom
          their feet in order to retain their adhesive properties – all
          they need is only a few steps to recover their ability to
          cling to vertical surfaces.<br>
          <br>
          Kellar Autumn and his research group have conducted
          experiments to test and demonstrate this ability of the
          gecko.[8] They also use the contact mechanical model to
          suggest that self-cleaning occurs by an energetic
          disequilibrium between the adhesive forces attracting a dirt
          particle to the substrate and those attracting the same
          particle to one or more spatulae. In other words, the Van der
          Waals interaction energy for the particle-wall system requires
          a sufficiently great number of particle-spatula systems to
          counterbalance; however, relatively few spatulae can actually
          attach to a single particle, therefore the contaminant
          particles tend to attach to the substrate surface rather than
          the gecko's toe due to this disequilibrium. Figure on the
          right shows the model of interaction between N spatulas, a
          dirt particle and a planar wall.<br>
          <br>
          It's important to know that this property of self-cleaning
          appears intrinsic to the setal nano-structure and therefore
          should be replicable in synthetic adhesive materials. In fact,
          Kellar Autumn's group observed how self-cleaning still
          occurred in arrays of setae when isolated from the geckos
          used.<b>..</b><br>

          Spider-Man suit, scientists could use geckos - rather than
          arachnids - as their model<br>
          <br>
          Geckos are among the superheroes of the animal world.<br>
          <br>
          These colourful lizards can scamper rapidly up walls, scuttle
          along ceilings and even hang upside down on polished glass.<br>
          <br>
          Yet the secret of their amazing climbing ability remained a
          mystery until relatively recently.<br>
          <br>
          The underside of a gecko's foot looks like a tyre tread and is
          covered in millions of microscopic hairs. Each hair splits
          into hundreds of tips just 200 billionths of a metre wide.<br>
          <br>
          The secret of this lizard's adhesion turns out to be the
          relatively weak intermolecular forces that draw materials
          together any time they get close.<br>
          <br>
          These van der Waals forces nevertheless explain how a gecko
          can support its own body weight on just one finger, and a
          single gecko hair can lift the weight of an ant.<br>
          <br>
          To un-stick, the gecko pulls its foot away at a different
          angle.<br>
          <br>
          "What we're talking about is something that is about as sticky
          as sticky tape - it's not crazy glue," says Prof Kellar
          Autumn, who became intrigued by gecko adhesion after being
          funded to develop climbing robots by the US military.<br>
          <br>
          Prof Autumn, from Lewis &amp; Clark College in Oregon, added:
          "What is special about it is that it is controllable. And its
          controllability is based on geometry and physics, not
          chemistry."<br>
          <br>
          “The way gecko adhesives work is so bizarre... that I don't
          think we would have invented it”<br>
          <br>
          The effort to uncover the mechanisms behind gecko climbing has
          already yielded synthetic material that sticks in the same
          way.<br>
          <br>
          Stick, peel and re-stick a piece of existing adhesive tape
          several times and it quickly loses its clingy properties.<br>
          <br>
          Prof Autumn and Mark Cutkosky, from Stanford University,
          compared natural and polymer-based synthetic gecko hairs using
          a machine that simulated gecko climbing. This showed both
          versions could be re-used some 30,000 times without losing
          their stickiness.<br>
          <br>
          Synthetic adhesives could yield transformative applications in
          robotics, industry, medicine, sports and clothing.<br>
          <br>
          But one possible use always comes up in any popular
          discussion: could they allow humans to scale walls like
          Spider-Man?<br>
          <br>
          In 2007, physicist and engineer Nicola Pugno, from Turin
          Polytechnic in Italy, calculated that a person wearing gloves
          and boots made of carbon nanotubes and structured to mimic
          gecko feet could indeed cling safely to a wall or a ceiling.<br>
          <br>
          Challenges would include wear and tear and the propensity for
          dirt particles to collect and inhibit stickiness.<br>
          <br>
          The suit would have to work on every kind of surface and for
          long periods of time. But Prof Pugno says: "We are not very
          far, in my opinion, from a kind of Spider-Man suit."<br>
          <br>
          Prof Metin Sitti, from Carnegie Mellon University, says the
          idea is "not impossible". Selecting a lightweight person and
          applying the adhesive to many parts of the suit (not just the
          feet and hands) would improve the chances of success, he
          explains.<br>
          <br>
          But, he comments: "We get questions like: 'Can you carry a
          one-tonne weight'. And we say: 'Maybe, but that's not our
          biggest advantage'."<br>
          <br>

          </b><b>Gecko adhesion</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          A. The toes of geckos are covered in ridge-like lamellae,
          producing a tyre tread pattern<br>
          <br>
          B. Millions of microscopic hairs, or setae, cover each toe.
          These are only as long as two diameters of a human hair<br>
          <br>
          C. Each seta ends in up to 1000 even tinier tips, called
          spatulae<br>
          <br>
          D. The spatular tips are only 200 billionths of a metre wide
          -below the wavelength of visible light<br>
          <br>
          Several institutes have been developing robots that can climb
          walls - Stanford University's "Sticky-bot" can be seen in
          action here. Some scientists envisage "geckobots" being used
          to search for survivors in a burning building or disaster
          zone, to explore the rocky terrain of Mars, or even as toys.<br>
          <br>
          But many in the field are most excited by more routine
          applications.<br>
          <br>
          Medicine is one target area for these adhesives. They could
          spawn advanced bandages that can be removed easily after
          healing or gripping surfaces on instruments designed for
          delicate surgery. Since the mechanism works in the wet, it
          could be used to affix implants within the body.<br>
          <br>
          Stanislav Gorb, from the University of Kiel, studies
          biological adhesion; his work also looks at the way beetles
          stick to surfaces.<br>
          <br>
          He says gecko material has several advantages when compared
          with generic sticky tape. There is no "visco-elastic" adhesive
          to dry out, so it stays attached for longer and leaves no
          residue.<br>
          <br>
          But he says that with current production methods, they are
          unlikely to replace classical sticky tape.<br>
          <br>
          "Maybe in 5-10 years we will have a method that will make the
          tape very cheap - right now it isn't. Secondly, right now, the
          forces are in the range or even lower than traditional sticky
          tape."<br>
          <br>
          <b>Zip it up</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Metin Sitti thinks gecko material could provide alternatives
          to current "closure" technologies, such as hook and loop
          fastening, zips and sealing systems on food packaging.<br>
          <br>
          It is one area he is exploring through his company
          NanoGripTech, set up to commercialise his lab's gecko work.<br>
          Synthetic gecko hairs Synthetic gecko-inspired adhesives can
          be even stickier than the real thing<br>
          <br>
          Synthetic adhesives work best on glass; rough or uneven
          surfaces pose more of an obstacle. Getting high performance
          out of gecko material on a variety of surfaces and in
          different conditions represents the firm's first challenge.<br>
          <br>
          "We have been focusing on what happens when the surface gets
          wet, oily, dirty and what happens when temperatures change
          from very cold to very hot," says Prof Sitti.<br>
          <br>
          "The second challenge is how can you manufacture and sell this
          [material] at high volume and at low cost?"<br>
          <br>
          Prof Sitti is working on this problem and expects within a
          year to begin manufacturing at low volumes.<br>
          <br>
          A silicone-based bio-inspired adhesive made by German firm
          Binder has been on the market for some six months. Prof Gorb
          was involved with its development.<br>
          <br>
          The company has been exploring medical applications and the
          "pick and place" technology used in clean rooms to precisely
          position components on to circuit boards.<br>
          <br>
          "Clean rooms often work with suction systems. That generates
          dust and requires a lot of energy, which contributes to the
          cost," says Jan Tuma, managing director of Binder.<br>
          <br>
          "We are only sticky on really flat, shiny surfaces. It depends
          on the pins per sq cm and at the moment we have 29,000 pins
          per sq centimetre.<br>
          <br>
          "Geckos have more, but they have had millions of years to
          develop, and we have had only a few."<br>
          <br>
          Prof Autumn says: "We can look to Nature as a giant library of
          design principles. The way gecko adhesives work is so bizarre
          and so different from the way that adhesives have been
          engineered, that I don't think we would have invented it."<br>

              cement&nbsp; </b><br>

          <b> </b><b>Abstract </b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          The invention relates to a method for pouring a large dam by
          utilizing double-swelling cement. In a traditional method, the
          speed of pouring the large dam is very slow and the
          construction cost is very high by utilizing sectional and
          block pouring manners. According to the method for pouring the
          large dam by utilizing the double-swelling cement, disclosed
          by the invention, the SO3 content of the adopted cement is
          within 2.8-3.5%, the content of magnesium oxide in a clinker
          is within 4.0-6.0%, and hydration heat meets requirements of
          hot cement in GB200-2003. The method is characterized in that
          fly ash or grinded mineral slag is added when concrete is
          mixed, flake ice replaces mixing water for pre-cooling
          aggregate, an additive is simultaneously added, and a cooling
          water pipe is embedded in the poured concrete. During pouring,
          a distribution, high-lift and continuous pouring construction
          method replaces a traditional sectional, block and grouting
          construction method. The method for pouring the large dam by
          utilizing the double-swelling cement, disclosed by the
          invention, has the advantages of largely increasing
          construction speed, reducing construction cost and improving
          social benefits and economical benefits remarkably.<b><br>

                LET Vitamin C</b></big><br>
          </div>
          <b><br>
          </b>Cardiologist, Thomas Levy, MD JD, a frequent Vitamin C
          lecturer and the author of two books on the subject theorizes
          in his book, Curing the Incurable, that it is likely the human
          body was not intended to get all its ascorbate (Vitamin C)
          from dietary sources. He presents eight evidences for this
          theory:<br>
          <br>
          The need for ascorbate (Vitamin C) in the human body for basic
          maintenance of basic structure and function is essential and
          fluctuates greatly based on health status and environmental
          conditions.<br>
          <br>
          Even in IV doses exceeding 200 grams per day, no toxicity for
          ascorbate has ever been documented.<br>
          <br>
          Human livers have all the ingredients necessary to synthesize
          ascorbate except one — the enzyme L-Gulonolactone oxidase
          (GLO).<br>
          <br>
          Humans have the gene required to produce GLO but it is
          defective in the vast majority of the population.<br>
          <br>
          Some humans apparently synthesize ascorbate as not all
          individuals deprived of dietary ascorbate develop scurvy.<br>
          <br>
          Most mammals, reptiles, and amphibians do synthesize
          ascorbate. Some of the larger mammals produce upwards of 100
          grams daily.<br>
          <br>
          Intravenous doses of ascorbate have shown powerful
          antioxidant, anti-toxin and anti-pathogenic properties in
          humans. (Dr. Levy cites many cases of this including Fred
          Klenner’s use of ascorbate to cure 60 out of 60 cases of polio
          in the late 1940s.)<br>
          <br>
          The uptake of ascorbate by the intestines is very inefficient.
          <br>
          <br>
          Since Liposomal Encapsulation Technology can deliver virtually
          100% of a nutrient directly to the bloodstream, it promises to
          eliminate the huge loss of bioavailability when dose sizes of
          actively transported nutrients are increased. This
          bio-availability chart was developed from a study done by J.L.
          Groff, S.S. Gropper, and S.M. Hunt which<br>
          was published in the book Advanced Nutrition and Human
          Metabolism, West Publishing Co., 1995, pages 222-237.<br>
          <br>
          Concerning the inefficiency of the body’s uptake of Vitamin C,
          studies show that the body has an increasing resistance to
          traditional forms of oral Vitamin C — tablets, powders,
          capsules — as dose size increases.<br>
          <br>
          J.L. Groff (1995 - see chart at left) demonstrated that less
          than 2 grams of a 12 gram oral dose of Vitamin C actually gets
          to the bloodstream. Based on that study, 2 grams of liposomal
          encapsulated Vitamin C has the bio-availability equal to
          24-500 mg tablets of the nutrient.<br>

          </b><b>Conclusion</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Innovations, such as HAARP, makes one realize, very quickly,
          that mankind has been dragged into a psychopathic world of
          horrors created by the globalists for their perverted agenda.
          What is important to realize is that what is about to happen
          to the country, as a result of this artificially manipulated
          massive weather front and it is being done to us, this is not
          an act of nature.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          <b>Appendix</b><b><br>

          Bernard Eastman HAARP Patents (Partial)<br>
          <br>
          Bernard J. Eastlund’s U.S. Patent # 4,686,605, “Method and
          Apparatus for Altering a Region in the Earth’s Atmosphere,
          Ionosphere; and/or Magnetosphere”<br>
          <br>
          Eastlund authored patent US20070238252 ‘Cosmic particle
          ignition of artificially ionized plasma patterns in the
          atmosphere’ which was published a few months before his death.
          The conclusion section of the patent contains the following
          text:<br>
          <br>
          “This invention has a phenomenal variety of possible
          ramifications and potential future developments. As alluded to
          earlier, a variety of telecommunications systems for
          improvement of local cellular systems, short haul stand alone
          cellular systems, city wide cellular systems and long haul
          communications systems could result. Two new approaches to
          weather modification and control are suggested. The first is
          for manipulation of the steering winds that control the
          development of mesocyclones, or the modification of the
          directions of the jet streams that influence development of
          hurricanes. The second is a method for influencing the
          electrical charge distribution in weather patterns such as
          meso-cyclones. Possible defense applications include a method
          of accelerating electrons to MEV energies in conjunction with
          the HAARP antenna. Research applications include the creation
          of bright and controlled guide stars for astrophysical
          purposes. Thus it can be seen that the ramifications are
          numerous, far-reaching, and exceedingly varied in usefulness.”<br>

          has the advantage of being a destructive force that is not
          designed to kill people.<br>
          Advantages: Destructive to structures and warmaking potential,
          but does not directly threaten people.<br>
          Challenges: How to generate a strong enough acoustic field.<br>
          Countermeasures: Acoustic wave cancellation methods (generate
          a wave out of phase with the<br>
          weapon) standard earthquake protection methods, such as
          flexible structures, truss designs, reinforced<br>
          materials.<br>
          Possible Applications: Destruction of structures Attacking
          hardened, hidden structures. Airfield<br>
          interdiction (destroy runways) Civilian application:
          demolition.<br>

                      <b></b><br>
                      For many years, I have pursued a field of study
                      that is at best non-traditional. My discovery of a
                      global business cycle during the early 1970's was
                      by no means intentional. As a youth growing up in
                      the 1960's, the atmosphere was anything but
                      stable. I don’t really know if it was Hollywood
                      that captivated my interest in history with an
                      endless series of movies about Roman and Greek
                      history, but whatever it was that drove me, I can
                      only attest to what resulted.<br>
                      <br>
                      My father had always wanted to return to Europe
                      after serving under General Patton during the war.
                      My mother insisted that she would go only when he
                      could afford to take the whole family. That day
                      finally came and something inside me insisted upon
                      being able to earn my own spending money. I
                      applied for a job despite my age of only 14. It
                      wasn’t much, but on weekends I worked with a
                      coin/bullion dealer. In those days, gold was
                      illegal to buy or sell in bullion form so the
                      industry centered on gold coins issued by Mexico,
                      Hungary and Austria. I soon became familiar with
                      the financial markets as they were starting to
                      emerge. It was this experience that began to
                      conflict with the formal training of school.<br>
                      <br>
                      One day in a history class, the teacher brought in
                      an old black and white film entitled "Toast of the
                      Town." This film was about Jim Fisk and his
                      attempt to corner the gold market in 1869 that
                      created a major financial panic in which the term
                      "Black Friday" was first coined. In the film was a
                      very young support actor named Cary Grant who
                      stood by the ticker tape machine reading off the
                      latest gold prices. He read the tape and exclaimed
                      that gold had just reached $162 an ounce. I knew
                      from my job that gold was currently selling for
                      $35. At first I thought that the price quote of
                      $162 in the movie must be wrong. After all,
                      Hollywood wasn’t known for truthfulness.
                      Nonetheless, I was compelled to go to the library
                      to check the newspapers of 1869 for myself. This
                      first step in research left me stunned – the New
                      York Times verified $162 was correct.<br>
                      <br>
                      For the first time in my life, I was faced with a
                      paradox that seemed to conflict with traditional
                      concepts. How could gold be $162 in 1869 and yet
                      be worth only $35 in the 1960's? Surely, inflation
                      was supposed to be linear. If a dollar was a lot
                      of money in 1869, this meant that adjusted for
                      inflation gold must have been the equivalent of
                      several thousand dollars. If value was not linear,
                      then was anything linear?<br>
                      <br>
                      I began exploring the field of economics on my own
                      and reading the various debates over the existance
                      of a business cycle. Kondratieff was interesting
                      for his vision of great waves of economic
                      activity. Of course, others argued that such
                      oscillations were purely random. Over the years
                      that followed, this nagging question still
                      bothered me. I had poured my heart and soul into
                      history, quickly learning that all civilizations
                      rose and fell and there seemed to be no exception.<br>
                      <br>
                      I was still not yet convinced that a business
                      cycle was actually definable. Kondratieff’s work
                      was indeed interesting, but there was not enough
                      data to say that it was in fact correct. On the
                      other hand, it seemed that the random theory crowd
                      was somehow threatened by the notion that the
                      business cycle might be definable. After all, if
                      the business cycle could be defined, then perhaps
                      man’s intervention would not be successful.
                      Clearly, there was a large degree of self-interest
                      in discouraging any attempt to define the business
                      cycle. I knew from my study of history that a
                      non-professional German industrialist took Homer
                      and set out to disprove the academics who argued
                      that Homer was merely a story for children. In the
                      end, that untrained believer in Homer discovered
                      Troy and just about every other famous Greek city
                      that was not supposed to have existed beyond
                      fable.<br>
                      <br>
                      I didn’t know how to go about such a quest to find
                      if the business cycle was definable. Admittedly, I
                      began with the very basic naive approach of simply
                      adding up all the financial panics between 1683
                      and 1907 and dividing 224 years by the number of
                      panics being 26 yielding 8.6 years. Well, this
                      didn’t seem to be very valid at first, but it did
                      allow for a greater amount of data to be tested
                      compared to merely 3 waves described by
                      Kondratieff.<br>
                      <br>
                      The more I began to back test this 8.6-year
                      average, the more accurate it seemed to be. I
                      spent countless hours in libraries reading
                      contemporary accounts of events around these
                      dates. It soon became clear that there were issues
                      of intensity and shifts in public confidence.
                      During some periods, society seemed to distrust
                      government and after a good boom bust cycle,
                      sentiment shifted as people ran into the arms of
                      government for solutions. Politics seemed to ebb
                      and flow in harmony with the business cycle.
                      Destroy an economy and someone like Hitler can
                      rise to power very easily. If everyone is fat and
                      happy, they will elect to ignore drastic change
                      preferring not to rock the boat.<br>
                      <br>
                      The issue of intensity seemed to revolve around
                      periods of 51.6 years, which was in reality a
                      group of 6 individual business cycles of 8.6 years
                      in length. Back testing into ancient history
                      seemed to reveal that the business cycle concept
                      was alive and well during the Greek Empire as well
                      as Rome and all others that followed. It was a
                      natural step to see if one could project into the
                      future and determine if its validity would still
                      hold up. Using 1929.75 as a reference point, major
                      and minor turning points could then be projected
                      forward in time. For the most part, I merely
                      observed and kept to myself this strange way of
                      thinking. In 1976, one of these 8.6-year turning
                      points was quickly approaching (1977.05). For the
                      first time, I began to use this model expecting a
                      significant turn in the economy back toward
                      inflation. My friends thought I was mad. Everyone
                      was talking about how another Great Depression was
                      coming. The stock market had crashed by 50% and
                      OPEC seemed to be undermining everything. I rolled
                      the dice and stuck to it and to my amazement,
                      inflation exploded right on cue as gold rallied
                      from $103 to $875 by January 1980.<br>
                      <br>
                      As my confidence in this model increased, I began
                      to expand my research testing it against
                      everything I could find. It became clear, that
                      turning points were definable, but the wildcard
                      would always remain as a combination of volatility
                      and intensity. To solve that problem, much more
                      sophisticated modeling became necessary.<br>
                      <br>
                      As the 51.6-year turning point approached
                      (1981.35), there was no doubt in my mind that the
                      intensity would be monumental. Indeed, interest
                      rates went crazy with prime reaching 22% and the
                      discount rate being pushed up to 17%. The
                      government was attacking inflation so hard, they
                      moved into overkill causing a massive recession
                      into the next half-cycle date of 1985.65. It was
                      at this point in time that the Plaza Accord gave
                      birth of the G5. I tried to warn the US government
                      that manipulating the currency would set in motion
                      a progressive trend toward higher volatility
                      within the capital markets and the global business
                      cycle as a whole. They ignored me and claimed that
                      until someone else had such a model, they did not
                      believe that volatility would be a concern.<br>
                      <br>
                      The next quarter cycle turning point was arriving
                      1987.8 and the Crash of 1987 unfolded right on
                      cue. It was at this time that a truly amazing
                      development took place. The target date of 1987.8
                      was precisely October 19th, 1987 the day of the
                      low. While individual models specifically based
                      upon the stock market were successful in
                      pinpointing the high and low days, I did not think
                      for one moment that a business cycle that was
                      derived from an average could pinpoint a precise
                      day; it simply did not seem logical.<br>
                      <br>
                      After 1987, I began to explore the possibility
                      that coincidence should not be just assumed. I
                      began researching this model even more with the
                      possibility that precision, no matter how
                      illogical, might possibly exist. I began viewing
                      this business cycle not from a mere economic
                      perspective, but from physics and math. If this
                      business cycle were indeed real, then perhaps
                      other fields of science would hold a clue to this
                      mystery. Physics helped me understand the
                      mechanism that would drive the business cycle but
                      mathematics would perhaps answer the quantitative
                      mystery. I soon began to understand that the
                      circle is a perfect order. Clearly, major
                      historical events that took place in conjunction
                      with this model involved the forces of nature as
                      well. If this business cycle was significant,
                      surely it must encompass something more than the
                      mere economic footprints of mankind throughout the
                      ages.<br>

                      <b>The Mystery of 8.6</b><br>
                      <br>
                      At first, 8.6 seemed to be a rather odd number
                      that just didn’t fit mathematically. In trying to
                      test the validity of October 19th, 1987 being
                      precise or coincidence, I stumbled upon something
                      I never expected. This is the first time I will
                      reveal something that I discovered and kept secret
                      for the last 13 years. The total number of days
                      within an 8.6-year business cycle was 3141. In
                      reality, the 8.6-year cycle was equal to p (Pi) *
                      1000. Suddenly, there was clearly more at work
                      than mere coincidence. Through extending my
                      studies into physics, it became obvious that
                      randomness was not a possibility. The number of
                      variables involved in projecting the future course
                      of the business cycle was massive, but not
                      completely impossible given sufficient computer
                      power and a truly comprehensive database. The
                      relationship of 8.6 to p (Pi) confirmed that
                      indeed the business cycle was in fact a perfect
                      natural cyclical phenomenon that warranted further
                      investigation. Indeed, the precision to a day
                      appeared numerous times around the world in
                      different markets. Both the 1994.25 and the
                      1998.55 turning points also produced clear events
                      precisely to the day. The probability of
                      coincidence of so many targets being that precise
                      to the day was well into the billions. Indeed, the
                      relationship of p to the business cycle
                      demonstrated the existence of a perfect cycle that
                      returned to its point of origin where once again
                      it would start anew. The complexity that arose was
                      that while the cycle could be measured and
                      predicted, precisely which sector of the global
                      economy would become the focal point emerged as
                      the new research challenge.<br>
                      <br>
                      It was also clear that the driving forces behind
                      the business cycle had shifted and intensified due
                      to the introduction of the floating exchange rate
                      system back in 1971. My study into intensity and
                      volatility revealed that whenever the value of
                      money became uncertain, inflation would rise
                      dramatically as money ceased to be a store of
                      wealth. Numerous periods of debasements and
                      floating exchange rate systems had taken place
                      throughout recorded history. The data available
                      from Rome itself was a spectacular resource for
                      determining hard rules as to how capital responded
                      to standard economic events of debasement and
                      inflation. The concept of Adam Smith’s Invisible
                      Hand was valid, but even on a much grander scale
                      involving capital flow movement between competing
                      economies. The overall intensity of the cycle was
                      decisively enhanced creating greater waves as
                      measured by amplitude by the floating exchange
                      system. As currency values began to swing by 40%
                      in 4-year intervals, the cycle intensified even
                      further causing currency swings of 40% within
                      2-year intervals and finally down to a matter of
                      months following the July 20th, 1998 turning
                      point.<br>
                      <br>
                      <b>The Domino Effect</b><b><br>
                      </b><br>
                      The events that followed 1987 were all too easy to
                      foresee. The G5 talked the dollar down by 40%
                      between 1985 and 1987 essentially telling foreign
                      capital to get out. The Japanese obliged and their
                      own capital contraction led to the next bubble top
                      at the peak of the 8.6-year cycle that was now due
                      1989.95. As the Japanese took their money home for
                      investment, the value of their currency rose as
                      did their assets thereby attracting global
                      investment as well. Everyone was there in Tokyo in
                      late 1989. Just about every investment fund
                      manager globally was touting the virtues of Japan.
                      As the Japanese bubble peaked, capital had
                      acquired a taste for foreign investment. That now
                      savvy pool of international investment capital
                      turned with an eye towards South East Asia. Right
                      on cue, the capital shifted moving into South East
                      Asia for the duration of the next half-cycle of
                      4.3 years until it too reached its point of
                      maximum intensity going into 1994.25. At this
                      point, international capital began to shift again
                      turning back to the United States and Europe, thus
                      causing the beginning of a new bull market in a
                      similar manner to what had happened in Japan. In
                      fact, 1994.25 was once again the precise day of
                      the low on the S&amp;P 500 for that year. As
                      American and European investment returned home,
                      the steady outflow of capital from South East Asia
                      finally led to the Asian Crisis in 1997. In both
                      cases, Japan and South East Asia blamed outsiders
                      and sought to impose punitive measures to
                      artificially support their markets. In Japan,
                      these interventions have left the Postal Savings
                      Fund insolvent as public money was used to support
                      the JGB market. Financial institutions were
                      encouraged to hide their losses and even employees
                      from the Minister of Finance were installed in
                      some cases engaging in loss postponing
                      transactions of every kind. Major life companies
                      were told not to hedge their risks for fear that
                      this would make the markets decline even further.
                      Thus, the demise of Japan that would have been
                      complete by 1994 was extended by government
                      intervention that has most likely resulted in a
                      lengthening of the business cycle decline into
                      2002.85.<br>
                      <br>
                      The next peak on the 8.6-year business cycle came
                      in at 1998.55, which was precisely July 20th,
                      1998. While the intensity was defined rather well
                      by the model’s forecast of 6,000 on the Dow by the
                      quarter-cycle target of 1996.4 followed by 10,000
                      for 1998, the development of highly leveraged
                      hedge funds created a trap that was not fully
                      anticipated. It was clear that the European
                      markets had captured the greatest intensity
                      between 1996 and 1998 and that Russia too had
                      reached our target for maximum intensity. However,
                      the excessive leveraging of funds like Long-Term
                      Capital Management had significantly created the
                      peak in volume as well. Thus, the spread trades
                      were so excessive, that the collapse that was to
                      be expected, took on a virus type of affect. As
                      Russia moved into default, and LTCM moved into
                      default, the degree of leverage caused a cascade
                      of liquidation that was spread around the world.
                      Everything became affected causing the collapse in
                      liquidity and credit to further undermine the
                      global economy as a whole. Despite the new highs
                      in US indices into 1999, the broader market has
                      failed to keep pace and the peak in both liquidity
                      and volume remains clearly that of 1998.55.<br>

                      While this business cycle can be calculated on
                      quarter-cycle intervals of 2.15 years into the
                      final peak for this major wave formation of
                      December 24th, 2032. Though this is long beyond my
                      life expectancy, there is so much more behind the
                      true understanding of the driving forces within
                      the business cycle. I have learned that it is easy
                      to claim coincidence and ignore the telltale signs
                      of a hidden order. It is easy to argue that there
                      is no basis for such a model without ever making
                      an effort to test results. If everyone stopped
                      with such criticism, most of ancient Greece would
                      still be buried and Homer would still be
                      considered a book for children. Man would not fly
                      or travel to the moon. A cure for cancer would not
                      be sought and progress would simply not exist. But
                      furthering our understanding is part of humanity.
                      Like law, that when strictly enforced deprives
                      society of justice when circumstances are ignored,
                      it is also the sin of ignorance toward new
                      concepts that deprives mankind of progress and
                      ultimately our posterity.<br>

                      The future that lies ahead will increasingly move
                      ever greater toward intensity and volatility. Such
                      periods have always brought not merely great booms
                      and busts, but they too hold in the palm of their
                      hand the thunderbolt of war. The economic future
                      of Russia is one of such corruption and decay,
                      that it too will rise as the warlord who seeks to
                      regain what he has lost. China too will eventually
                      beat the drums of war as its economy worsens and
                      its leaders seek to hold the slippery reigns of
                      power. Such periods of economic strife will begin
                      to grow in intensity particularly following
                      2002.85 and moving into 2007.15. Only when
                      economic chaos reaches a sudden state of eruption
                      is it possible to see a successful revolution. The
                      government was not prepared in Indonesia. However,
                      unless a complete shock takes place in China and
                      Russia, it is far more likely that these two
                      nations will not fall to internal revolution but
                      will seek to turn the economic tides against their
                      neighbors. These are basic facts of history that
                      cannot be denied. War is directly linked to the
                      economic fate of mankind. Undermine the economy
                      and you will create the next Hitler.<br>
                      <br>
                      During the American Revolution, World War I and
                      World War II, the act of counterfeiting the
                      currency of your enemy was but one means of
                      warfare intent upon undermining their economy. The
                      dark side to investigating the business cycle is
                      clearly exposing the map through which an enemy
                      can exploit your economy at the precise moment of
                      maximum intensity thereby creating the greatest
                      amount of economic instability. I suppose it is
                      like splitting the atom. The power can be used to
                      light a city or harnessed to destroy it. We must
                      always face that plus and minus no matter what
                      field one seeks to explore.<br>
                      <br>
                      The financial markets will contract globally. The
                      untold hidden losses within the Japanese financial
                      system are slowly bubbling to the surface.
                      However, as new mark-to-market rules approach on
                      April 1st, 2001, the sins of the past will all be
                      forced into the open light of day and those who
                      have thought that economic recovery was underway
                      will be shocked by what they will still face.
                      While the US market may yet contract into 2000,
                      the flicker of hope for one more rally into
                      2002.85 exists as long as the rest of the world
                      remains so uncertain. But for the US market to
                      survive into 2002, it must also retest support
                      going into 2000. Without a pull back, the global
                      instability will create a dangerous economic
                      situation in the years ahead. It is clear that a
                      high in 2002/2003 for the US market may be
                      followed by a crash, but the shift in capital
                      investment will then move back toward the tangible
                      sectors that have been left behind.<br>
                      <br>
                      In the next issue of the WCMR, the details of this
                      business cycle will be expanded to provide a list
                      of turning points down to the 8.6-month interval.
                      There is a wealth of knowledge that lies ahead if
                      we are not afraid to explore. Regularity of the
                      business cycle does not mean that we lack free
                      will. For it has taken me 30 years of observation
                      to get this far. The peak for one nation may be
                      the low for another. For within the scheme of
                      global capital flows, not everyone can enjoy a
                      boom simultaneously. For every gain in trade,
                      there must be someone who loses. This is simply
                      the nature of the global economy. The greatest
                      booms unfold when capital concentrates in one
                      sector. When that capital shifts, you also find
                      the result of the greatest financial panics in
                      history. An individual will always possess the
                      free will to follow the crowd or strike out with
                      his own independence to buck the trend. There will
                      be those who believe in the business cycle and use
                      it to their advantage just as there will be those
                      who refuse to acknowledge its existence. As long
                      as not everyone believes, the cycle will exist
                      forever. The regularity of the business cycle is
                      not determined by man alone; for within its deep
                      calculations resides the very heart of nature
                      itself. Like the Biblical forecast of Joseph that
                      seven years of plenty will be followed by seven
                      years of famine, understanding the nature of the
                      business cycle can certainly enhance our ability
                      to better manage our affairs rather than
                      constantly add to the intensity of the cycle
                      through our own error of intervention. For now, it
                      is more likely that the politics will continue to
                      act in the opposite direction of the cycle adding
                      to its intensity and enhancing its volatility.
                      Perhaps I have been an evangelist seeking to point
                      out that the economy is like a rain forest –
                      destroy one species and it will ripple through the
                      entire system. The global economy to me is the
                      same delicate system that cannot be viewed in
                      isolation, but only through its collective
                      integration. The failed labor policies of Europe
                      have created perpetually high unemployment and the
                      worst record of economic growth for the past 30
                      years. Instead of objectively reviewing what has
                      happened, Europe seeks to federalize and
                      strengthen the very controls that already exist.
                      Communism and socialism are all political
                      byproducts of our failure to understand the
                      business cycle. Blaming the rich, your neighbor or
                      a particular race are all vain quests to explain
                      the cause of a cycle that has moved through the
                      boom bust phase. Who knows, perhaps it is possible
                      that if for one moment we truly understood the
                      business cycle and worked in harmony with it, the
                      possibility of reducing the amplitude just might
                      result in a more stable political-economy for all
                      mankind.<br>

                      "The first sign of this change in the Earth's core
                      would be the "breaking up of some conditions" in
                      the South Pacific and "sinking or rising" in the
                      Mediterranean or Etna area. Cayce forecast that,
                      by the end of the century, New York, Los Angeles
                      and San Francisco would be destroyed. He said that
                      "the greater portion of Japan must go into the
                      sea" at this time, and that northern Europe would
                      be "changed as in the twinkling of an eye." In
                      1941, Cayce predicted that lands would appear in
                      the Atlantic and the Pacific in the coming years,
                      and that "the coastline now of many a land will be
                      the bed of the ocean. Even many of the
                      battlefields of (1941) will be ocean, will be the
                      sea, the bays, the lands over which the new order
                      will carry on their trade as with one another."<br>
                      <br>
                      "Watch New York, Connecticut and the like. Many
                      portions of the east coast will be disturbed, as
                      well as many portions of the west coast, as well
                      as the central portion of the United States. Los
                      Angeles, San Francisco, most of all these will be
                      among those that will be destroyed before New
                      York, or New York City itself, will in the main
                      disappear. This will be another generation though,
                      here; while the southern portions of Carolina,
                      Georgia, these will disappear. This will be much
                      sooner. The waters of the Great Lakes will empty

                      can be followed. Special attention was given in
                      the readings that it would require "another
                      generation" and often foretold which event would
                      precede another one. It is clear that based on his
                      readings, the geography of the entire world will
                      change and it all begins with the polar shift.<br>
                      Two Signals of the Beginning<br>
                      <br>
                      The two signals Cayce researchers have attributed
                      to the beginning of the major Earth changes are
                      described in a Sept. 28, 1977 article titled,
                      Prophecy Holds Bright Future of Livingston written
                      by Owen Jones. This article appeared in the
                      Livingston Enterprise newspaper serving the
                      Livingston, Montana area and detailed that the
                      simultaneous eruption of two famous volcanoes
                      would herald the final shifting of the poles.<br>
                      <br>
                      Mt. Pelee: Located on the French Caribbean Island
                      of Martinique, Mt. Pelee last erupted in 1902.<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                      Mt. Etna: Located in NE Sicily, Italy, Mt. Etna is
                      an active volcano. It's the largest one currently
                      active in Europe.<br>
                      <br>
                      According to researchers of Cayce's readings, when
                      both volcanoes erupt together, there will be
                      approximately 90 days to evacuate the west coast
                      before the massive flood claims the coastline.<br>

                      <br>
                      WATERBURY, Conn. (WTNH)– Waterbury Police are
                      investigating after a woman had to confront a
                      naked man at gunpoint while he allegedly performed
                      sexual acts on her pit bull Tuesday morning. The
                      man is believed to be suffering from mental health
                      issues.<br>
                      <br>
                      “I thought my dog had killed somebody, because I
                      saw a man underneath her,” said Alice Woodruff. “I
                      started to scream. I had a citronella candle and I
                      threw it at him, screaming get off my dog, you
                      have to get out of here. He said no! Today is the
                      day we are going to spend the rest of our lives
                      together.”<br>
                      <br>
                      Alice Woodruff lives in Waterbury, she says on
                      Tuesday at 10 a.m. she found a man attacking her
                      dog Layla, who she describes as an aggressive
                      rescue pit bull who they keep on an 800-pound tow
                      chain in the back yard; however, Woodruff says
                      Layla was calm during the attack.<br>
                      <br>
                      “He pranced through the yard naked, yelling ‘this
                      is our day and you have to prosper in it,'” said
                      Woodruff. “‘ISIS sent me,’ and I was thinking ‘did
                      something like this just land in my back yard?’ I
                      ran in, got my gun out of the bedroom, and
                      realized as usual the ammunition is in my car
                      locked in my glove box. I showed him the clip went
                      in, but I always kept the gun at my side while I
                      was talking to him. He kept saying this is the
                      plan, that we were going to die today in a
                      massacre. He didn’t seem to care that I had the
                      gun, and I kept it down. Then I gave him a warning
                      and shot the gun to the right into the dirt.”<br>
                      <br>
                      “After you shoot the gun, did he take off?” we
                      asked.<br>
                      <br>
                      “No, he put his arms out and started walking
                      toward me, telling me to kill him, but to know
                      that as soon as I kill him that we were going to
                      die,” said Woodruff. “Honestly, the whole time I
                      thought there was a bomb or gun and he was going
                      to take it out and do a massacre.”<br>
                      <br>
                      Woodruff works in the mental field. She says
                      standing next to a pile of clothes, the naked man
                      in front of her, she felt the danger, but also
                      compassion.<br>
                      <br>
                      “I knew he needed help, and I knew there was
                      something going on,” said Woodruff. “I have been
                      in the field for so long there is no help for
                      these people.”<br>
                      <br>
                      “After all this you were still corn earned for his
                      safety?” we asked.<br>
                      <br>
                      “I don’t want him to harm anybody else,” said
                      Woodruff. “Somebody else might have killed him,
                      and he was only 22.”<br>
                      <br>
                      Woodruff says the man is a neighbor of hers but
                      they had never met. Tonight, he is in a hospital.
                      Police say they will arrest him immediately when
                      he is released from the hospital. They plan to
                      charge him with cruelty to an animal, sexual
                      assault, and breach of peace.<br>
