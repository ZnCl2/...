              being 'ordered by ALIEN </b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Raymundo Corona built the pyramid in Coahila near the
          Mexico-US border<br>
          <br>
          He told me to build the temple in the form of a pyramid said
          Raymundo Corona.<br>
          <br>
          Mr Corona, 33 when he claims the alien visited him in 1984,
          said: "He told me to build the temple in the form of a
          pyramid.<br>
          <br>
          "When I asked him why it had to be in the form of a pyramid,
          he said it was because it should be like my faith, something
          that winds and storms couldn't move and was always pointing
          upwards."<br>
          <br>
          Mr. Coriba saw the alien in his dreams before he visited in
          person, he built to pyramid to the aliens specifications.<br>
          <br>
          Recalling the moment he asked his mysterious visitor his name,
          Mr Corona told Mexican daily La Vanguardia that Herulayka had
          warned him: "Many people will laugh at you, defame you and say
          it was an act of insanity or something he did during a bender,
          it was an act of a madman or a drug addict.<br>
          <br>
          "He told me he came from the constellation of Orion, from a
          place called Nefilin which is a place 20 times larger than
          Earth where people are similar to human beings.<br>
          <br>
          "He was a tall man with honey-coloured eyes and white hair
          down to the ground. He was barefoot and wore a tunic tied with
          a rope."<br>
          <br>
          Mr Corona, whose wife was less than a day away from giving
          birth to his daughter at the time, says he had seen the alien
          in dreams before their meeting in person. He said the
          extraterrestrial had claimed humans were destroying their own
          planet and should wake up to the fact they must look after it
          like a child because it gave them what they needed for their
          own survival.<br>
          <br>
          Monclova is less than 600 miles from Roswell in New Mexico
          where a US Air Force surveillance balloon crashed in 1947,
          sparking rumors it was actually an alien spacecraft.<br>

          shown that the intensity of ultraviolet light that is made to
          pass through a graphene nano-ribbon is modulated with a
          terahertz frequency. So we are seeing the opening up of a new

          <br>
          In this study, first-principles time-dependent density
          functional theory calculations were used to demonstrate the
          possibility to modulate the amplitude of the optical electric
          field (E-field) near a semiconducting graphene nanoribbon. A
          significant enhancement of the optical E-field was observed
          3.34 Å above the graphene nanoribbon sheet, with an amplitude
          modulation of approximately 100 fs, which corresponds to a
          frequency of 10 THz. In general, a six-fold E-field
          enhancement could be obtained, which means that the power of
          the obtained THz is about 36 times that of incident UV light.
          We suggest the use of semiconducting graphene nanoribbons for
          converting visible and UV light into a THz signal.<br>

          <br>
          ..Researchers have designed a new device that can convert a DC
          electric field into a tunable source of terahertz radiation….<br>
          <br>
          This device exploits the instabilities in the oscillation of
          conducting electrons at the device's surface, a phenomenon
          known as surface plasmon resonance. To address the terahertz
          gap, the team created a hybrid semiconductor: a layer of thick
          conducting material paired with two thin, two-dimensional
          crystalline layers made from graphene, silicene (a
          graphene-like material made from silicon instead of carbon),
          or a two-dimensional electron gas. When a direct current is
          passed through the hybrid semiconductor, it creates a plasmon
          instability at a particular wavenumber. This instability
          induces the emission of terahertz radiation, which can be
          harnessed with the help of a surface grating that splits the
          radiation.<br>
          <br>
          By adjusting various parameters -- such as the density of
          conduction electrons in the material or the strength of the DC
          electric field -- it is possible to tune the cutoff wavenumber
          and, consequently, the frequency of the resulting terahertz
          radiation…<br>

          We propose a new approach for energy conversion from a dc
          electric field to tunable terahertz emission based on hybrid
          semiconductors by combining two-dimensional (2D) crystalline
          layers and a thick conducting material with possible
          applications for chemical analysis, security scanning, medical
          (single-molecule) imaging, and telecommunications. The hybrid
          nano-structure may consist of a single or pair of sheets of
          graphene, silicene, or a 2D electron gas. When an electric
          current is passed through a 2D layer, we discover that two
          low-energy plasmon branches exhibit a characteristic loop in
          their dispersion before they merge into an unstable region
          beyond a critical wave vector qc . This finite qc gives rise
          to a wavenumber cutoff in the emission dispersion of the
          surface plasmon induced instability and emission of radiation
          (spiler). However, there is no instability for a single driven
          layer far from the conductor, and the instability of an
          isolated pair of 2D layers occurs without a wavenumber cutoff.
          The wavenumber cutoff is found to depend on the conductor
          electron density, layer separation, distances of layers from
          the conductor surface, and the driving-current strength.<br>

          <div align="center"><b>How brain oscillations respond to
              teleportation</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Technology may not have caught up to the teleportation devices
          of science fiction, but now we have some idea of how the brain
          handles "beaming up" from one location to another, thanks to
          research by neuroscientists at the University of California,
          Davis, involving some specially wired volunteers.<br>
          <br>
          The work is published online Feb. 25, 2016 in the journal
          Neuron.<br>
          <br>
          Arne Ekstrom, associate professor at the UC Davis Center for
          Neuroscience, wants to know how we memorize places and routes,
          and learn to find our way around. It's long been known that as
          a rat navigates a maze, its brain gives off a rhythmic
          oscillation, Ekstrom said. This also happens when humans
          travel around a virtual landscape on a computer screen. Most
          models of brain function assume that the oscillations,
          emanating from the hippocampus deep inside the brain, are at
          least partly driven by external inputs.<br>
          <br>
          "There is this rhythmic firing in the brain during navigation
          and while remembering things, but we don't know if it is
          triggered by sensory input or by the learning process,"
          Ekstrom said.<br>
          <br>
          Ekstrom, postdoc Lindsay Vass and graduate student Milagros
          Copara were able to solve this problem by working with a group
          of patients being treated at UC Davis' Department of
          Neurological Surgery. These patients have a severe form of
          epilepsy, and surgeon and study coauthor Kia Shahlaie
          implanted electrodes on their brains, inside the skull, to
          find out where seizure activity begins and identify treatment
          options.<br>
          <br>
          In between seizures, the electrodes recorded normal brain
          activity, and three patients volunteered to take part in the
          experiment. They were asked to navigate through a streetscape
          on a computer screen. At some points, they entered a
          teleporter and jumped to a different, known location in the
          map. During teleportation, the screen went black for a random

          Teleportation did not interrupt the oscillations at all, but
          the rhythm did change with the distance travelled during
          teleportation, Ekstrom said.<br>
          <br>
          The results show that these oscillations are driven entirely
          by memory and learning processes in the brain, and do not
          depend on external senses. They also show that the oscillation
          carries information about speed and distance travelled, even
          when that travel is virtual teleportation. <br>

          <div align="center"><b>Historic event: One-year 1 megawatt
              E-Cat trial completed</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          On February 17, 2016, a 350-day commercial test of a one
          megawatt heat plant based on Andrea Rossi’s E-Cat was
          completed. The event must be considered historic since it’s
          the first time an industrially useful amount of energy is
          produced over such a long time from this kind of yet
          unexplained radiation-free nuclear reaction—LENR or Low Energy
          Nuclear Reactions.<br>
          <br>
          To be clear, the report from the one-year trial, which has
          been controlled by a major independent third party
          certification institute, will be released only in about a
          month, and until then no official information is provided on
          the test result. However, multiple sources have told me that
          the test has been successful.<br>
          <br>
          Earlier, some sources having visited the test plant told me
          that the COP, Coefficient of Performance, i.e. the ratio
          between output power and input power for control, was in the
          range 20—80, meaning that the heat plant was consuming 12—50
          kW while producing 1 MW—the average consumption of about 300
          Western households, including electricity, space heating,
          water heating and air conditioning.<br>
          <br>
          I have also been told that the total amount of fuel—mostly
          harmless elements such as lithium, hydrogen and nickel,
          according to Andrea Rossi’s granted patent on the
          technology—was in the range of tenths of grams. And supposedly
          the charge has never been changed during the year. On the
          other hand, after one year’s run, the reactors are now being
          recharged for further operation.<br>
          <br>
          All this might be confirmed by the third party institute, that
          has been controlling the heat plant 24/7 with video cameras.<br>
          <br>
          The test has been undertaken by Andrea Rossi and his US
          industrial partner Industrial Heat, and according to Rossi,
          commercialisation of similar industrial heat plants will be
          initiated as soon as possible, provided that the result is
          positive. Industrial Heat has acquired the right to produce
          and sell E-Cat based technology in, as far as I have been
          told, North, Central and South America, China, Russia, Saudi
          Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.<br>
          <br>
          Needless to say, the consequences of such an energy source for
          the world will be huge. And the consequences for industry,
          finance and society is also the focus of the New Energy World
          Symposium or NewS, which will be held in Stockholm, Sweden, on
          June 21, 2016, provided that the report from the test is
          clearly positive.<br>
          <br>
          So, now we all wait for the report. Personally, however, I
          will put the champagne on ice. Now.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Comments --</b><br>
          <br>
          First, Rossi never suggested that the radiation from the hot
          cat is anything other than heat — he specifically denied EM
          and gamma radiation. But if you’re concerned about the
          radiation spectrum of an LENR reaction (whatever the heck that
          is), simply measure it with appropriate spectroscopy.<br>
          <br>
          But my main point is that an estimate of the energy produced
          by use of a thermal camera is a ruse by Rossi to begin with
          and is intended only to complicate, obfuscate and mislead.
          First, if you want a proof of concept of Rossi’s “effect”,
          then the device tested by Levi and reported by Lewan in 2011
          is vastly better. At least 10 times as much power from about
          the same volume and a power out to power in ration also at
          least ten times better. Problem is, that measurement, just
          like ALL the measurements, publicly reported, in which
          Lewan/or and Levi were involved, lacked calibration and thus
          were worthless. In the case of the 2011 experiment, a simple
          (but deliberate by Rossi) misplacement of the output
          thermocouple, too close to the huge heater in the device,
          would be enough to get the results without any LENR.<br>
          <br>
          <a
href="http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/energi_miljo/energi/article3108242.ece"
            "><b>http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/energi_miljo/energi/article3108242.ece</b></a><br>
          <br>
          One of the strangest aspects of this whole story is the
          decreasing output per volume of the ecats with time, a
          hallmark of energy scams, and the failure to repeat what seems
          like immensely successful and potentially probative
          experiments like Levi’s fluid/mass flow calorimetry run. Most
          of you know my conclusion about why those things are the way
          they are, so I won’t bother to repeat it again.<br>
          <br>
          I can hardly wait for the big reveal– who the “independent”
          referee of Rossi’s will be this time, what the company is
          which allowed the test and was the “customer” and which agency
          has been trying without success to certify a domestic/home
          ecat for going on five years. And people think this is all
          real? And they really believe Rossi can spend 16 hours a day
          for a year inside the container with the machine and STILL not
          be able to say conclusively whether it works or not (F9 !!!!)
          Yah shoore.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          “The most egregious error is the emissivity one, where the
          total and normal emissivity values used are the same in the
          report, but have been shown to be quite different in several
          skeptical analyses. This is important in that the power
          calculated by the report authors is directly a result of the
          emissivity values used. The reported COP is therefore directly
          connected to this conflation of emissivity values.”<br>
          <br>
          Actually the most basic, fundamental and crucial error in
          every one of the tests, demos and experiments, reported
          publicly by and for Rossi has been the same identical and
          unforgivable mistake — failure to calibrate the output power
          measurement coupled with failure to insure the integrity of
          the input power source and measurement.<br>
          <br>
          Mats Lewan, the late Dr. Kullander and Dr. Essen were
          criticized for this failure in early 2011 (the wet steam/dry
          steam debacle) and again in later experiments (the
          thermocouple placement debacle) and had every opportunity to
          get it right in the hot cat experiments. But they failed
          dismally to do so. It is completely incomprehensible that a
          device which incorporates a *built in* large electrical heater
          was not calibrated over the full operating temperature range,
          using that heater.<br>
          <br>
          There are innumerable other inconsistencies, lies, deceptions
          and evasions in Rossi’s stories (he’s currently recycling the
          nonsense about having a huge (robotic?) factory ready to make
          millions of ecats). But the failure to hold Rossi’s feet to
          the performance of a proper calibration has happened every
          time and the only possible explanation is negligence and
          incompetence on the part of those assisting and participating
          in these tests.<br>
          <br>
          That someone should take a discovery purported to be a
          tabletop multi kilowatt reactor and not work with a large
          company (think GE, GM, Tesla or any large Chinese or European
          company) is incomprehensible since this ridiculous farce has
          now gone 5 years!<br>
          <br>
          The decrement in performance from a power output of 135kW peak
          and 20kW steady state reported in 2011 in Mats own magazine
          under *his authorship!* …<br>
          <br>
          ( <a
href="http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/energi_miljo/energi/article3108242.ece"
            "><b>http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/energi_miljo/energi/article3108242.ece</b></a>
          )<br>
          <br>
          … to the current arguable 3 kW of the hotcat is equally
          inexplicable. And the so-called COP went from better than 30
          to the current claim of 3! This performance loss with time,
          when improvement would be expected, is the hallmark of an
          energy scam.<br>
          <br>
          The lack of response of the Swedish scientists responsible for
          the Lugano report to responsible critiques by people like
          Thomas Clarke is also very telling.<br>
          <br>
          The topping on the cake is Rossi claim to certification based
          on a worthless self-reported safety document and Rossi’s joy
          over a patent which simply describes a heater configuration
          wherein the source of heat could be anything — for example,
          the electric heater the device prominently contains. These
          claims are reminiscent of the time Rossi purchased a PhD
          diploma from a now state-closed fake university (Kensington).
          He is now claiming it was honorary which is pure nonsense.
          Rossi just makes stuff up as he goes along and the believers
          all swallow it.<br>

          ...As reported in the Journal of Nutrition, aged garlic
          extract shows significant promise in its ability to reverse
          deadly buildup of plaque in arteries. The study was found to
          both reduce the amount of accumulated “soft plaque” in the
          arteries as well as prevent new plaque from forming.<br>
          <br>
          Reduction of plaque in arteries after a year of aged garlic
          extract<br>
          <br>
          The study, conducted at the independent biomedical research
          facility LA BioMed, Torrance, Calif., showed that adding the
          supplement aged garlic extract resulted in a reduction in the
          amount of soft plaque, also known as low-attenuation plaque,
          that had built up in the arteries of patients. Participants in
          the study were already known to be suffering from metabolic

          .This isn’t the first time aged garlic extract has been

          The supplement Aged Garlic Extract can reverse the buildup of
          deadly plaque in arteries and help prevent the progression of
          heart disease, according to a new study scheduled for
          publication in the Journal of Nutrition.<br>
          <br>
          The research, conducted at LA BioMed, found a reduction in the
          amount of low-attenuation plaque, or "soft plaque," in the
          arteries of patients with metabolic syndrome who took Aged
          Garlic Extract. Metabolic syndrome is characterized by
          obesity, hypertension and other cardiac risk factors.<br>
          <br>
          "This study is another demonstration of the benefits of this
          supplement in reducing the accumulation of soft plaque and
          preventing the formation of new plaque in the arteries, which
          can cause heart disease," said Matthew J. Budoff, MD, an LA
          BioMed lead researcher. "We have completed four randomized
          studies, and they have led us to conclude that Aged Garlic
          Extract can help slow the progression of atherosclerosis and
          reverse the early stages of heart disease."<br>
          <br>
          The study involved 55 patients, aged 40 to 75 years, who had
          been diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. All the participants
          underwent screening at the beginning of the study to measure
          the total coronary plaque volume as well as dense calcium,
          non-calcified plaque and low-attenuation plaque. The screening
          was conducted using Cardiac Computed Tomography Angiography
          (CCTA), a noninvasive imaging technology that accurately
          measures calcium deposits and plaque buildup in the arteries.<br>
          <br>
          Following evaluation, the participants were given either a
          placebo or a dose of 2,400 milligrams of Aged Garlic Extract
          every day. A follow-up screening conducted a year after the
          initial screening found those who had taken Aged Garlic
          Extract had slowed total plaque accumulation by 80%, reduced
          soft plaque and demonstrated regression (less plaque on
          follow-up) for low-attenuation plaque.<br>

          </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
          <br>
          Background: Thousands of studies have been published based on
          animal and human studies evaluating garlic's effects and
          safety.<br>
          <br>
          Objective: We reviewed the available literature investigating
          the effects of garlic supplements on hypertension,
          hypercholesterolemia, C-reactive protein (CRP), pulse wave
          velocity (PWV), and coronary artery calcium (CAC), as well as
          available data on side effects.<br>
          <br>
          Methods: We searched PubMed for all human studies using
          medical subject heading words through 30 May 2013 and assessed
          relevant review articles and original studies. Only
          double-blind, randomized, controlled trials and meta-analyses
          of double-blind, randomized, controlled trials were included.
          The review of articles and data extraction were performed by 2
          independent authors, with any disagreements resolved by
          consensus.<br>
          <br>
          Results: Garlic supplementation reduced blood pressure by 7–16
          mm Hg (systolic) and 5–9 mm Hg (diastolic) (4 meta-analyses
          and 2 original studies). It reduced total cholesterol by
          7.4–29.8 mg/dL (8 meta-analyses). The most consistent benefits
          were shown in studies that used aged garlic extract (AGE). A
          few small studies that used AGE also showed favorable effects
          on CAC, CRP, and PWV. Although garlic is generally safe, rare
          adverse reactions have been documented with limited causality
          established.<br>
          <br>
          Conclusion: We conclude that garlic supplementation has the
          potential for cardiovascular protection based on risk factor
          reduction (hypertension and total cholesterol) and surrogate
          markers (CRP, PWV, and CAC) of atherosclerosis. Larger studies
          are warranted to evaluate these effects further.<br>

          (* Google translation) Independent analyst Sergei Albertovich
          Sallj, doctor of physico-mathematical sciences, professor,
          secretary of the St. Peterburg part "of the Russian Physical
          Society," and assistant to the president of "the Russian
          Physical Society" shared unique information about the
          achievements of Soviet science and global monopoly over
          knowledge.<br>
          <br>
          Why was science in the USSR actively developing for only 15
          years? Why cold nuclear fusion, finding physicians Ivana
          Filimonenko, wasn't allowed for use by Korolev, Kurchatov and
          Gluškov? What's behind mysterious deaths of these great
          scientists? Why is the program of cold nuclear fusion in the
          Soviet Union declared pseudo-scientific? Why are being killed
          an associate scientist all over the world, including the
          United States? What happened to the chief designer of
          St.Peters-burg company that was involved in the manufacture
          engines based on cold nuclear fusion? Which actually deals
          with the "Commission combating pseudoscience"? Why the
          Japanese are not able to implement in their industry
          alternative technology? What is the truth discovered by the
          former Minister of Economy of Japan - Heizi Takenaka? What is
          behind the tragedy of Fukushima? Is there such a thing as a
          geo-physical weapon?<br>

          Traditional theory has it that eyeglass correction in middle
          age is necessitated by the decreasing flexibility of the lens
          in the eye requiring the assistance of a lens to acquire
          proper focus accomodation. Recent discoveries however cast
          some questions on this theory... particularly since it is the
          "resting curvature" of the lens, not the "accommodation
          curvature" of the lens which seems to be the most widespread
          problem.. and there is little reason to believe that the
          ambient "resting curvature" of the lens would be under any
          (aging) pressure to change.<br>
          <br>
          Rather, HAMMOND'S research seems to indicate that it is brain
          development (e.g. perceptual development) during one's
          lifetime toward "better true size perception" that simply
          requires an unobtainable change in ambient curvature... which
          produces "blurred vision" in older people and requires
          glasses.<br>
          <br>
          The PROBLEM with glasses is that they change the focus
          location of the image by MAGNIFYING the object.&nbsp; For
          instance My glasses (I am farsighted, hence positive lenses)
          cause a measurable 5%-Magnification of everything I am seeing,
          in order to move the focal plane to the retina (focus
          correction).<br>
          <br>
          My question is this.&nbsp; If we suppose, according to
          HAMMOND'S THEORY that this change in apparent size of the
          World with age is a "natural design of God"... isn't there an
          (optical) way that we could move the plane of focus so that we
          wouldn't have blurred vision, WITHOUT introducing any "changed
          magnification" into the system.<br>
          <br>
          This then, would produce "True Godsite" without blurring or
          manmade magnification... according to Hammond's new theory.<br>
          <br>
          Is it optically-possible to make a pair of glasses which will
          do this... or are we up against some kind of optical law which
          says it is impossible.<br>
          <br>
          If it IS POSSIBLE, then according to Hammond's discovery, the
          present design of glasses is actually quite psychologically
          harmful, sort of the optical equivalent of "bleeding someone
          with leeches" used to be in the olden days of
          medicine.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

          According to Kaczynski, we need to reject
          organization-dependent technologies that tie us into the
          technosphere, and cultivate organization-independent ones:<br>
          <br>
          Small-scale technology is technology that can be used by
          small-scale communities without outside assistance.
          Organization-dependent technology is technology that depends
          on large-scale social organization. We are aware of no
          significant cases of regression in small-scale technology. But
          organization-dependent technology does regress when the social
          organization on which it depends breaks down. <br>
          <br>
          Easier said than done! It implies eliminating just about
          everything that makes it possible for people to survive. It
          implies living without electricity—not even off-grid systems
          that use batteries, photovoltaic cells and small-scale wind
          generators. It means living without pumped water, because
          demand pumps, pipes and valves are all manufactured products.
          It means living without electronics of any kind, since the
          electronics industry is globally integrated. No internet; no
          vaccinations; no cosmetic dentistry; no eyeglasses; no
          antibiotics or painkillers... Nothing that's mass-produced...
          It means living off the land using crude tools you can fashion
          yourself in a primitive smithy using salvaged metal. Very few
          people would ever settle for that!<br>
          <br>
          Sorry, Ted, but we need a better metric on which to base our
          decisions than simply sorting technologies into
          organization-dependent and organization-independent, and
          depriving ourselves of all the organization-dependent ones. So
          how about we do this instead: define a reasonably complete
          list of positive and negative aspects of technology, and then
          select which technologies we do use in order to maximize the
          benefit while minimizing the harm?<br>
          Calculating the harm/benefit ratio<br>
          Unlike the primitivist, extremist approach outlined above,
          this is a perfectly copacetic, constructive initiative, but I
          believe that the end result will be exactly the same, although
          achieved more gradually. You see, the harm/benefit analysis
          maximizes technology's benefit to us while minimizing
          technology's harm to us—not the technosphere. And I would
          conjecture that, based on which aspects of technology we
          regard as positive or negative, we can structure the process
          so that whatever helps us also shrinks the technosphere, and
          vice versa.<br>
          <br>
          Here are 30 aspects of technology, in no particular order,
          which, for each technology, take a value somewhere between
          harmful and beneficial:<br>
          <br>

          4. limited useful life / unlimited useful life<br>
          <br>
          5. fosters dependence / fosters autonomy<br>
          <br>

          7. expensive /free<br>
          <br>
          8. obsolescent / perpetual<br>
          <br>
          9. single-purpose / multiple-purpose<br>

          11. artificial / natural<br>
          <br>
          12. synthetic / organic<br>
          <br>
          13. industrial / artisanal<br>
          <br>
          14. limits options / opens up possibilities<br>
          <br>
          15. transnational / local<br>
          <br>
          16. requires specialists / requires generalists<br>
          <br>
          17. classifiable / unclassifiable<br>
          <br>
          18. analytical / intuitive<br>
          <br>
          19. individual use / community use<br>
          <br>
          20. new / (re)used<br>
          <br>
          21. consumer grade / commercial grade<br>
          <br>
          22. rarely used / frequently used<br>
          <br>
          23. networked / standalone<br>
          <br>
          24. powered / unpowered<br>
          <br>
          25. automatic / manual<br>
          <br>
          26. branded / generic<br>
          <br>
          27. proprietary / open-source<br>
          <br>
          28. registered / anonymous<br>
          <br>
          29. requires access / requires skill<br>
          <br>
          30. individual effort / team effort<br>
          <br>
          To analyze a particular technology, add up its harm h and its
          benefit b. To determine its Harm/Benefit Ratio (HBR) divide
          one by the other:<br>
          <br>
          HBR = h / b<br>

          Note that there is nothing magical about the 30 aspects of
          technology listed above, and you can modify this list or come
          up with one entirely your own. It is just a way of evaluating
          the pros and cons of technology, but with a particular view in
          mind: what is considered beneficial is that which is
          beneficial to you, within your local environment, human or
          natural, which makes you autonomous, self-sufficient and free.
          And what is considered harmful is what disrupts the natural
          environment while depriving you of autonomy, self-sufficiency
          and freedom, forcing you to relinquish control to impersonal,
          remote, nonhuman entities.<br>
          <br>
          Technology is neither good nor bad, and it is essential for
          survival. Our job is to pick and choose carefully, to embrace
          technologies that liberate and empower us, and to look for
          ways to avoid or eliminate the ones that weaken us, make us
          dependent on outside interests and forces, and can even result
          in our extinction as a species along with all the rest (yes,
          there are a few such technologies).<br>
          <br>
          If we do this job well, then we will shrink the technosphere —
          the oppressive, totalitarian, malignant, global entity into
          which technology has been allowed to coalesce. The mechanism
          by which the technosphere will shrink is a simple one to
          describe but rather difficult to evaluate in a quantifiable
          fashion. But sometimes such quantifiable evaluation isn't
          necessary; all that's needed is the ability to predict with
          confidence that the required result will be obtained through
          some finite, physically possible amount of effort. For
          example, there is no need for precise mathematical models to
          estimate how many whacks with a stick it will take to break a
          piñata; it sufficient to know that some reasonable number of
          whacks is enough to get at the candy inside it. And so it is
          here: some amount of effort, of which we humans, being
          adaptable and resourceful, are most certainly capable,
          provided we are sufficiently incentivized and motivated, will
          produce the result we are looking for.<br>
          <br>
          The technosphere expands when it gains efficiency. The
          efficiency in question is not some relative measure of the
          amount of useful output for a certain amount of input. Rather,
          it is the systemic efficiency of the technosphere as a whole:
          does it, all other things being equal, gain a greater measure
          of control over us? If we select technologies that cause us to
          relinquish control to the technosphere, then we are doing its
          work for it, making it more efficient. Conversely, if we
          select technologies that specifically deprive the technosphere
          of control or make the exercise of control more expensive in
          terms of time, resources and energy, then we reduce its
          efficiency and its scope.<br>
          <br>
          And this will cause it to shrink. This effect is automatic.
          The technosphere's emergent intelligence is the intelligence
          of a machine. Its internal programming is such that it always
          acts rationally in its own internal self-interest. For the
          technosphere, the ends always justify the means, to the
          exclusion of every other consideration. These ends are:
          limitless growth and expansion; complete domination of the
          biosphere; and complete control over us humans. If we succeed
          in thwarting it to a point where increased effort leads to
          decreased results, then, being rational, it will have no
          choice but to decrease effort... and shrink. This process, if
          taken far enough, will reduce it to a set of mere
          instrumentalities, from which we can choose à la carte — no
          longer able to pursue its own agenda but pressed into service
          if needed and allowed to dwindle and disappear if not.<br>

              sore virus? Controversial theory fuels fears disease could
              be infectious </b><br>
            <b>&nbsp;</b><br>
            <b>by Fiona Macrae</b><br>

          <br>
          The cold sore virus and other common bugs are major causes of
          Alzheimer’s disease, it was claimed last night.<br>
          <br>
          The controversial theory will fuel fears that Alzheimer’s is
          infectious – and raise fresh concerns about whether it could
          be linked to blood transfusions.<br>
          <br>
          However, it also suggests that antibiotic and antiviral
          medicines already on pharmacy shelves could be used to treat
          the memory-robbing disease.<br>
          <br>
          An international team of researchers, including experts from
          Cambridge, Edinburgh and Manchester universities, said
          evidence that bugs are behind Alzheimer’s is
          ‘incontrovertible’ and can no longer be ignored.<br>
          <br>
          In a powerful editorial in the Journal of Alzheimer’s
          Research, the 31 doctors and scientists say the idea that
          microbes cause Alzheimer’s has been long neglected.<br>
          <br>
          Yet there are more than 100 studies linking the cold sore bug
          – herpes simplex virus 1, or HSV-1 – to it.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Other suspects include a bacterium that causes pneumonia. The
          researchers argue that after working their way into the brain
          the microbes lie dormant, only to be awakened by ageing or
          illness. <br>
          <br>
          They can then kill vital brain cells, triggering the symptoms
          of Alzheimer’s. The theory also states that beta-amyloid, the
          toxic protein often thought to be a cause of the disease, is
          actually made by the brain to fight off the bugs.<br>
          <br>
          Last autumn, UK research raised fears the disease could be
          spread through blood transfusions, operations and even dental
          work.<br>
          <br>
          Conventional wisdom states that Alzheimer’s is either caused
          by faulty genes or a combination of bad luck and ageing.<br>
          <br>
          Evidence for the latest theory includes Manchester University
          research on human brain cells, which found that infection with
          the cold sore virus caused a dramatic increase in levels of
          beta-amyloid.<br>
          <br>
          Other research shows that viruses and other bugs are present
          in the brains of most elderly people – and that the cold sore
          virus hides in regions key to memory and mood.<br>
          <br>
          Professor Douglas Kell, a Manchester University biologist and
          one of the report’s authors, said that dormant bacteria have
          been found in blood. And while he doesn’t want to cause alarm,
          it is possible they could be passed on through blood
          transfusions. The editorial concludes that with tests of
          hundreds of other drugs coming to nothing, the time is ripe to
          look at alternatives.<br>
          <br>
          It states: ‘Given the failure of 413 trials of other types of
          therapy carried out between 2002 and 2012, anti-viral or
          anti-microbial treatment could rectify the “no drug works”
          impasse.’<br>
          <br>
          Others cautioned that while more research is justified, there
          no firm evidence that the disease is contagious.<br>
          <br>
          Dr James Pickett, head of research at the Alzheimer’s Society,
          said: ‘A large number of different microbes including viruses,
          bacteria and fungi have been found in the brains of older
          people – but there do appear to be more of them in the brains
          of people who have died with Alzheimer’s disease.<br>
          <br>
          ‘While these observations are interesting and warrant further
          research, there is currently insufficient evidence to tell us
          that microbes are responsible for causing Alzheimer’s disease
          in the vast majority of cases. We would like to reassure
          people that there remains no convincing evidence that
          Alzheimer’s is contagious or can be passed from person to
          person like a virus.’<br>

              breast cancer in mice – breakthrough study</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Nanotechnology has helped scientists cure mice which have
          breast cancer in its terminal stage. The study could be a
          turning point in treating the disease with clinical trials on
          human patients expected to be conducted as early as next year.<br>
          <br>
          "I would never want to over-promise to the thousands of
          patients looking for a cure but the data is astounding," Mauro
          Ferrari, president of the Houston Methodist Research Institute
          in Texas and a co-senior author of the paper said in the press
          release published by the Houston Methodist leading medicine
          website. The study, conducted by a team of researchers from
          Houston Methodist Research Institute, was published in the
          journal Nature Biotechnology.<br>

          Eric Gaillard 'Mind-boggling' breast cancer therapy can make
          tumors ‘disappear’ in 11 days, doctors say<br>
          <br>
          The new treatment for breast cancer, which used the so-called
          “nanoparticle generator” proved to be effective in mice and,
          therefore, has colossal potential to be transformed in order
          to treat the disease in humans, scientists said. The generator
          successfully interferes with the tumor cell’s ability to
          develop drug resistance.<br>
          <br>
          “This may sound like science fiction, like we’ve penetrated
          and destroyed the Death Star, but what we discovered is
          transformational. We invented a method that actually makes the
          nanoparticles inside the cancer and releases the drug
          particles at the site of the cellular nucleus. With this
          injectable nanoparticle generator, we were able to do what
          standard chemotherapy drugs, vaccines, radiation, and other
          nanoparticles have all failed to do,” said Ferrari.<br>
          <br>
          During their research Ferrari and his colleagues used a
          chemotherapy drug called doxorubicin but hid it inside
          microscopic silicon discs. This way the cancer cells lost
          their ability to resist the treatment. When the disc was
          inside a tumor cell, it broke down and the anti-cancer
          doxorubicin was released.<br>
          <br>
          The study showed that half of the mice that had been injected
          with the new drug had no traces of cancer for eight months.
          This is tantamount to 24 years in humans, the scientists
          explained.<br>
          <br>
          "If this research bears out in humans and we see even a
          fraction of the survival time, we are still talking about
          dramatically extending life for many years.<br>
          <br>
          "That’s essentially a providing a cure in a patient population
          that is now being told there is none," Ferrari said.<br>
          <br>
          Although the new method was only tested for curing breast
          cancer, Ferrari expressed a strong hope that it could be also
          used in fighting other cancer types.<br>
          <br>
          According to the scientist, the discovery could completely
          turn the current cancer treatment head over hills.<br>
          <br>
          "We are talking about changing the landscape of metastatic
          disease, so it’s no longer a death sentence," he said.<br>
          <br>
          “Lung and liver metastases are the two main reasons why we
          lose cancer patients. The results we have proven with this
          paper is that we can provide a functional cure; we can
          essentially cure long-term, [giving] disease-free survival for
          about 50 per cent of the animals that we provided this therapy
          to."<br>

          Administration and begin clinical trials in humans in 2017.<br>

              in ‘random’ prime numbers</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          …Although whether a number is prime or not is pre-determined,
          mathematicians don’t have a way to predict which numbers are
          prime, and so tend to treat them as if they occur randomly.
          Now Kannan Soundararajan and Robert Lemke Oliver of Stanford
          University in California have discovered that isn’t quite
          right….<br>
          <br>
          The pair found that in the first hundred million primes, a
          prime ending in 1 is followed by another ending in 1 just 18.5
          per cent of the time. If the primes were distributed randomly,
          you’d expect to see two 1s next to each other 25 per cent of
          the time. Primes ending in 3 and 7 take up the slack, each
          following a 1 in 30 per cent of primes, while a 9 follows a 1
          in around 22 per cent of occurrences.<br>
          <br>
          Similar patterns showed up for the other combinations of
          endings, all deviating from the expected random values. The
          pair also found them in other bases, where numbers are counted
          in units other than 10s. That means the patterns aren’t a
          result of our base-10 numbering system, but something inherent
          to the primes themselves. The patterns become more in line
          with randomness as you count higher – the pair have checked up
          to a few trillion – but still persists...<br>

              bacteria using tiny gold disks and light</b><br>
            <i><br>
              Light-activated gold nanoparticles destroy potentially
              deadly bacterial cells in seconds</i><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Researchers have developed a new technique for killing
          bacteria in seconds using highly porous gold nanodisks and
          light, according to a study published today in Optical
          Materials Express, a journal published by The Optical Society.
          The method could one day help hospitals treat some common
          infections without using antibiotics, which could help reduce
          the risk of spreading antibiotics resistance.<br>
          <br>
          "We showed that all of the bacteria were killed pretty quickly
          . . . within 5 to 25 seconds. That's a very fast process,"
          said corresponding author Wei-Chuan Shih, a professor in the
          electrical and computer engineering department, University of
          Houston, Texas.<br>
          <br>
          Scientists create gold nanoparticles in the lab by dissolving
          gold, reducing the metal into smaller and smaller disconnected
          pieces until the size must be measured in nanometers. One
          nanometer equals a billionth of a meter. A human hair is
          between 50,000 to 100,000 nanometers in diameter. Once
          miniaturized, the particles can be crafted into various shapes
          including rods, triangles or disks.<br>
          <br>
          Previous research shows that gold nanoparticles absorb light
          strongly, converting the photons quickly into heat and
          reaching temperatures hot enough to destroy various types of
          nearby cells -- including cancer and bacterial cells.<br>
          <br>
          In 2013, Shih and his colleagues from the University of
          Houston created a new type of gold disk-like nanoparticle that
          measures to a few hundred nanometers in diameter. The disks
          are riddled with pores, lending the particles a sponge-like
          look that helps increase their heating efficiency while
          maintaining their stability, said Shih.<br>
          <br>
          In the new work, the researchers set out to test the
          antimicrobial properties of their new nanoparticles when
          activated by light. They grew bacteria in the lab including E.
          coli and two types of heat-resistant bacteria that thrive in
          even the most scorching environments such as the hot springs
          of Yellowstone National Park.<br>
          <br>
          Then, they placed the bacteria cells on surface of a
          single-layer coating of the tiny disks and shone near infrared
          light from a laser on them. Afterward, they used cell
          viability tests and SEM imaging to see what percentage of
          cells survived the procedure.<br>
          <br>
          Using a thermal imaging camera, the research team showed that
          the surface temperature of the particles reached temperatures
          up to 180 degrees Celsius nearly instantaneously, "delivering
          thermal shocks" into the surrounding array. As a result, all
          of the bacterial cells were killed within 25 seconds, the
          researchers report.<br>
          <br>
          E. coli proved most vulnerable to the treatment; all of its
          cells were dead after only five seconds of laser exposure. The
          other two types of bacteria required the full 25 seconds, but
          that's still much quicker than traditional sterilization
          methods such as boiling water or using dry-heat ovens, which
          can take minutes to an hour to work, said Shih. And it's
          "considerably shorter" than what other nanoparticle arrays
          have demonstrated in recent studies, the researchers write.
          The time needed to achieve similar levels of cell death in
          those studies ranges from 1 to 20 minutes.<br>
          <br>
          In control trials, the researchers found that neither the gold
          disks nor light from the laser alone killed nearly as many
          cells.<br>
          <br>
          The technique has important potential biomedical applications,
          said Shih. Currently, the researchers are investigating using
          the particles as a simple coating for catheters to help reduce
          the number of urinary tract infections in hospitals.<br>
          <br>
          "Any sort of light activated procedure would be much easier to
          implement at the bedside of a patient," instead of removing
          and potentially replacing the catheter every time it needs to
          be cleaned, he said.<br>
          <br>
          Another potential application they're exploring is integrating
          the nanoparticles with filter membranes in small water
          filters, he said, to help improve water quality.<br>

          </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
          <br>
          A rapid photothermal bacterial inactivation technique has been
          developed by irradiating near-infrared (NIR) light onto
          bacterial cells (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis,
          Exiguobacterium sp. AT1B) deposited on surfaces coated with a
          dense, random array of nanoporous gold disks (NPGDs). With the
          use of cell viability tests and SEM imaging results, the
          complete inactivation of the pathogenic and heat-resistant
          bacterial model strains is confirmed within ~25 s of
          irradiation of the NPGD substrate. In addition to irradiation
          control experiments to prove the efficacy of the bacterial
          inactivation, thermographic imaging showed an immediate
          averaged temperature rise above 200 °C within the irradiation
          spot of the NPGD substrate. The light-gated photothermal
          effects on the NPGD substrate offers potential applications
          for antimicrobial and nanotherapeutic devices due to strong
          light absorption in the tissue optical window, i.e., the NIR
          wavelengths, and robust morphological structure that can
          withstand high instantaneous thermal shocks.<br>

          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          The endless opportunities that technology offers come with an
          unexpected side effect: There never seem to be enough hours in
          the day to get things done and rest, too.<br>
          <br>
          And our bodies might be suffering for it.<br>
          <br>
          Whether it is because we're staying up late watching the
          latest show or lying awake in bed, unable to sleep, about 20%
          of Americans are sleep-deprived, experts estimate.<br>
          <br>
          Rather than suffer through the day feeling groggy, here are 12
          science-backed habits that can help you get a good night's
          sleep — tonight.<br>
          <br>
          <i>Avoid "social jet lag" by keeping consistent sleeping
            hours.</i><br>
          <br>
          As much fun as sleeping in on the weekends is, it's not doing
          your body any favors. You can blame something called "social
          jet lag."<br>
          <br>
          Unlike regular jet lag, this one only happens when our body
          clocks get thrown off by the gap between our weekend and
          weekday sleep schedules. You can avoid it by waking up at the
          same time each day.<br>
          <br>
          <i>Steer clear of computer/phone screens right before bed.</i><br>
          <br>
          Do not attempt.<br>
          <br>
          You might think that scrolling through your Instagram feed
          before bed might be a good way to wind down, but it's not
          helping you fall asleep.<br>
          <br>
          Studies suggest that the light from cellphones and other
          electronic devices may interfere with our brain's production
          of melatonin, the chemical that tells our bodies it's time to
          sleep.<br>
          <br>
          To combat this, researchers suggest powering down your devices
          an hour before heading to bed. Plus, you'll also have more
          time to read that book you keep neglecting.<br>
          <br>
          <i>Exercise regularly.</i><br>
          <br>
          The relationship between sleep and exercise is a little
          complicated. A small study of women with insomnia found a
          connection between better sleep and exercise. The better
          night's sleep you get, the more likely you'll work out.<br>
          <br>
          But it's a beneficial cycle. The study found that four months
          down the road of exercising consistently, the women were
          sleeping at least 45 minutes more a night.<br>
          <br>
          Sleep well. Work out well. Repeat.<br>
          <br>
          <i>Eat a diverse diet.</i><i><br>
          </i><br>
          In an analysis of the 2007-2008 National Health and Nutrition
          Examination Survey, researchers at the University of
          Pennsylvania found that the amount of time people slept was
          linked to the types of foods they ate.<br>
          <br>
          And "normal sleepers" — those who got seven to eight hours of
          shut-eye each night — tended to eat a more diverse diet.<br>
          <br>
          Obviously, the researchers can't say whether spicing up your
          plate will necessarily help you sleep, but it likely won't do
          any harm!<br>
          <br>
          S<i>tay away from caffeine starting six hours before bed.</i><br>
          <br>
          Caffeine is one of the best ways to get an energy boost in the
          morning, but if you consume it too close to bed, it could
          cause some sleep problems.<br>
          <br>
          A small study of 12 healthy normal sleepers who took caffeine
          pills zero, three, or six hours before bed found that the
          participants had the best night's sleep if they didn't have
          caffeine within at least six hours of sleeping. Big surprise.<br>
          <br>
          <i>Cuddle up in a bedroom that's cool.</i><br>
          <br>
          Bonus: Cooler temperatures make for better blanket forts.<br>
          <br>
          Studies suggest there's an optimal temperature for sleeping:
          Sixty to 66 degrees Fahrenheit if you're wearing pajamas and
          have a blanket, and 86 to 89 degrees if you prefer to sleep
          with a little less on. Scientists think that when our bodies
          cool down, it helps jump-start the sleep process.<br>
          <br>
          <i>Know how much sleep you need. It changes with age.</i><br>
          <br>
          Sleep training helped me sleep like a baby more of the time.<br>
          <br>
          As you grow, your body changes and so do your sleeping needs.
          Here's the recommended number of hours of sleep you need
          depending on your age group, according to the National Sleep
          Foundation:<br>
          <br>
          0 to 3 months: 14 to 17 hours<br>
          4 to 11 months: 12 to 15 hours<br>
          1 to 2 years: 11 to 14 hours<br>
          3 to 5 years: 10 to 13 hours<br>
          6 to 13 years: 9 to 11 hours<br>
          14 to 17 years: 8 to 10 hours<br>
          18 to 64 years: 7 to 9 hours<br>
          Over 65 years: 7 to 8 hours<br>
          <br>
          <i>Skip the snooze button. Your body will thank you.</i><i><br>
          </i><br>
          That glorious snooze button sure seems inviting in the
          morning, but it could be messing up your sleep cycle and
          making you feel more tired throughout the day. Here are two
          reasons you should skip the snooze.<br>
          <br>
          The quality of sleep you get after hitting snooze is less than
          if you just continued sleeping for those extra 10 minutes. And
          by falling back to sleep, you're setting yourself up for
          another sleep cycle that you have no chance of finishing,
          according to Robert S. Rosenberg, the medical director of the
          Sleep Disorders Center of Prescott Valley and Flagstaff,
          Arizona.<br>
          <br>
          <i>Avoid a nightcap.</i><br>
          <br>
          Anyone who's ever had one too many knows that alcohol
          sometimes seems to put you to sleep.<br>
          <br>
          But according to the National Institute of Health, alcohol
          toys with signals in your brain that affect your quality of
          sleep. More specifically, it robs you of the deeper,
          restorative stages of sleep, which is why you may feel tired
          and unrested the morning after.<br>
          <br>
          <i>Don't sleep like this.</i><br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          If you're having a hard time sleeping and wake up with aches
          and pains the next morning, you might want to reassess your
          sleeping position.<br>
          <br>
          A large telephone survey of Australian residents revealed that
          people who favored sleeping on their side were less likely to
          report aches and pains and sleepless nights compared to people
          who sleep in any other position.<br>

          <br>
          Mar 18th: VT lies are being reprinted everywhere even by
          bloggers that ought to know better<br>
          <br>
          Hope you can post updates..Did anybody cared to try to contact
          his father ?<br>
          <br>
          His website is here: http://www.itsabouttimebook.com and<br>

          http://www.allanstime.com<br>
          <br>
          I was under the impression that Utah state decided NOT to
          charge him in regards to his affair with a young teen (between
          16-18 yrs old I believe)<br>
          <br>
          Also apparently it was Keshe (a CIA tool-asset with a
          messianic complex) that made the grandiose charges vs Allan at
          the US consulate at the FBI desk (!).. some say that his angel
          investor (a rich ?! Indian guy) kept him out of jail and Allan
          agreed to work with the powers to be to eke out free energy
          tinkerers ?<br>
          <br>
          In any event I do smell a set up-before his arrest Sterling as
          per his website was supposed to fly to Russia and meet
          inventors of a working on free energy devices..<br>
          <br>
          Funny but the many websites of S. Allan are no longer being
          updated etc..becoming like zombie websites(live on forever)<br>
          And those in the free energy movement(I am just an
          enquirer,not an inventor etc) suddenly all have total amnesia
          ?<br>
          <br>
          The angel investor Allan was partnering with - I do suspect
          foul play here<br>
          <br>
          I do know that Geoffrey Smith of Energy labs
          http://www.energybat.com did not get a good impression when
          Allan and his angel investor visited him for over a
          week..Note-Allan sort of $$$ oriented-this is how he is
          perceived for better or worse by free energy tinkerers- many
          are paranoid beyond reason but unfortunately many for good
          reasons too<br>
          <br>
          Look what happened to the late Paul Pantone (died on Dec
          15)-was it foul play- well he shortly died after his 1st GEET
          book-his websites are now zombie websites..<br>
          <br>
          In any event the only one seeming to be doing okay is the
          infamous Eric P Dollard <br>

          sex trafficking.<br>

          He presented a wealth of solid evidence, videos, email, more,
          that a network existed that tied “new age” types to not only
          online recruiting but to NGO’s working in South and Central

          We found organizations that were running schools and
          orphanages, “Palestinian scholarships,” help for abused or
          displaced mothers, from Lebanon, to Morocco, to Mexico and
          Brazil, all involved in stealing children.<br>
          <br>
          These groups plant themselves near the camps in the Middle
          East, preying on the Palestinians or working with ISIS to
          traffick Syrian and Iraqi Christians and Shiites, with full
          support of Turkish organized crime and suspected complicity
          with their intelligence services and political leadership as
          well…<br>
          <br>
          In August 2015, we arranged for Keshe to meet with the FBI in
          Rome to hand over his evidence. As many know by now, the
          computers seized on January 15, 2016 by FBI agent Jeff Ross in
          Salt Lake City, Utah contained files that listed high level
          clients, details of their preferences and enough to secure the
          kind of protection we had been seeing in Lebanon, Syria,
          Nigeria, Morocco, Turkey, Belgium, Britain, Ireland and the
          United States.<br>
          <br>
          Our information that it was Justice Scalia of the US Supreme
          Court who was protecting, Sterling Allan, despite nearly 2
          years of him doing everything imaginable to be arrested, was
          confirmed.<br>
          <br>
          Our report on Scalia’s murder at the hands of a secret society
          tied to the Bohemian Grove “satanic cult” was also confirmed,
          as was our information that only after Scalia’s death could
          Sterling Allan be arrested.<br>
          <br>
          We also have seen the “spin” that has tried to move what is
          solid evidence into conspiracy theory through wild
          misrepresentations of the Scalia-Obama meeting, or even
          blaming Obama personally for a “pillow over the face”
          suffocation killing partial confirmation as well, particularly
          when we follow the sources of these fabrications into the
          midst of Washington’s pedophile sewer...<br>
          <br>
          Let’s take a look at Scalia and the St. Hubertus group, a
          subset we are all informed, of the “Bohemian Grove” secret
          society. We know those involved are selected, not just money
          and power but for their history of moral flexibility, love of
          power combined with mediocre intellect, physical cowardice and
          delusions of being “special.”..<br>

          A new method of preparing highly conductive ultra-thin indium

          A new design of microbial fuel cell uses urine and overcomes
          two limitations of standard microbial fuel cells: their cost
          and low power production. ( <br>
          <br>
          A new kind of fuel cell that can turn urine into electricity
          could revolutionize the way we produce bioenergy, particularly
          in developing countries. The research, published in
          Electrochimica Acta, describes a new design of microbial fuel
          cell that's smaller, cheaper and more powerful than
          traditional ones.<br>
          <br>
          The world's supply of fossil fuels is being depleted, and
          there is increasing pressure to develop new renewable sources
          of energy. Bioenergy is one such source, and microbial fuel
          cells can produce it.<br>
          <br>
          In their study, researchers from University of Bath, Queen
          Mary University of London and the Bristol Robotics Laboratory
          describe a new design of microbial fuel cell that overcomes
          two limitations of standard microbial fuel cells: their cost
          and low power production.<br>
          <br>
          "Microbial fuel cells have real potential to produce renewable
          bioenergy out of waste matter like urine," said Dr. Mirella Di
          Lorenzo, corresponding author of the study from the University
          of Bath. "The world produces huge volumes of urine and if we
          can harness the potential power of that waste using microbial
          fuel cells, we could revolutionize the way we make
          electricity."<br>
          <br>
          Microbial fuel cells are devices that use the natural
          processes of certain bacteria to turn organic matter into
          electricity. There are other ways of producing bioenergy,
          including anaerobic digestion, fermentation and gasification.
          But microbial fuel cells have the advantage of working at room
          temperature and pressure. They're efficient, relatively cheap
          to run and produce less waste than the other methods.<br>
          <br>
          There are, however, some limitations. Microbial fuel cells can
          be quite expensive to manufacture. The electrodes are usually
          made of cost-effective materials, but the cathode often
          contains platinum to speed up the reactions that create the
          electricity. Also, microbial fuel cells tend to produce less
          power than the other methods of bioenergy production.<br>
          <br>
          The new miniature microbial fuel cell uses no expensive
          materials for the cathode; instead it's made of carbon cloth
          and titanium wire. To speed up the reaction and create more
          power, it uses a catalyst that's made of glucose and
          ovalbumin, a protein found in egg white. These are typical
          constituents of food waste.<br>
          <br>
          "We aim to test and prove the use of carbon catalysts derived
          from various food wastes as a renewable and low-cost
          alternative to platinum at the cathode," said corresponding
          author Dr. Mirella Di Lorenzo from the University of Bath.<br>
          <br>
          They then tweaked the design to see what would produce more
          power. Doubling the length of the electrodes, from 4mm to 8mm,
          increased the power output tenfold. By stacking up three of
          the miniature microbial fuel cells, the researchers were able
          to increase the power tenfold compared to the output of
          individual cells.<br>
          <br>
          "Microbial fuel cells could be a great source of energy in
          developing countries, particularly in impoverished and rural
          areas," said Jon Chouler, lead author of the study from the
          University of Bath. "Our new design is cheaper and more
          powerful than traditional models. Devices like this that can
          produce electricity from urine could make a real difference by
          producing sustainable energy from waste."<br>
          <br>
          "We have shown that the cell design has an incidence on
          performance and we want to further investigate the relevance
          of electrode surface area to volume ratio on performance. Our
          aim is to be able to effectively miniaturize the MFC and
          scale-up power production by generating compact batteries of
          multiple miniature units," added Dr. Di Lorenzo.<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          To resolve an increasing global demand in energy, a source of
          sustainable and environmentally friendly energy is needed.
          Microbial fuel cells (MFC) hold great potential as a
          sustainable and green bioenergy conversion technology that
          uses waste as the feedstock. This work pursues the development
          of an effective small-scale MFC for energy generation from
          urine. An innovative air-cathode miniature MFC was developed,
          and the effect of electrode length was investigated. Two
          different biomass derived catalysts were also studied.
          Doubling the electrode length resulted in the power density
          increasing by one order of magnitude (from 0.053 to 0.580 W
          m−3). When three devices were electrically connected in
          parallel, the power output was over 10 times higher compared
          to individual units. The use of biomass-derived oxygen
          reduction reaction catalysts at the cathode increased the
          power density generated by the MFC up to 1.95 W m−3, thus
          demonstrating the value of sustainable catalysts for cathodic
          reactions in MFCs.<br>
          <br>
          <b>1. Introduction</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          In the face of the growing problem of fossil fuel depletion,
          there is global interest in developing sustainable and
          environmentally friendly forms of energy. One form of
          alternative energy that may be viable in addressing this
          problem is bioenergy [1] and [2]. In this context, Microbial
          fuel cells (MFC) hold great potential as green and
          carbon-neutral technology that directly converts biomass into
          electricity [3].<br>
          <br>
          MFCs are electrochemical devices that take advantage of the
          metabolic processes of microorganisms to directly convert
          organic matter into electricity with high efficiencies for
          long periods of time [4]. Compared to other bioenergy
          conversion processes (i.e. anaerobic digestion, gasification,
          fermentation), MFCs have the advantage of reduced amounts of
          sludge production [5], as well as cost-effective operation,
          since they operate under ambient environmental conditions
          (temperature, pressure) [6]. Moreover, MFCs require no energy
          input for aeration so long as the cathode is passively
          aerated, for example via the use of a single-chamber device
          [7]. Lastly, MFCs have the ability to generate energy remotely
          by using a range of feed stocks, and can thus be used in areas
          of poor energy infrastructure. Organic waste used as a feed
          stock in particular offers attractive prospects from its
          cost-effectiveness and abundance. Urine has been demonstrated
          to be an effective feed stock for MFC operation with the
          additional benefit of nitrogen, phosphate and potassium
          recovery from the fuel [8]. In particular, according to
          Ieropoulos et al [9]. urea is enzymatically hydrolysed to
          ammonia and carbon dioxide. Ammonia is then oxidised at the
          anode of the MFC to generate mainly nitrite and in smaller
          amounts nitrate [10].<br>
          <br>
          Despite the breadth of applications and the growing interest
          in MFC technology over the past two decades, commercialisation
          of MFCs for energy generation has not yet been realised.<br>
          <br>
          The major limiting factors that hinder the practical
          implementation of MFCs at large scale, are the cost of
          materials used and the difficulties in the scale-up process
          [11].<br>
          <br>
          Typically the electrodes are made from highly cost-effective
          materials such as carbon cloth, carbon paper, and graphite
          based rods, plates and granules. Recently, even some metals,
          such as copper and silver, have been shown to be effective
          anode materials [12]. However, expensive metals, such as
          platinum, are usually used at the cathode to enhance the
          oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) [13], [14] and [15]. Recently,
          the use of biomass-derived catalysts recovered from waste has
          been proposed as an effective alternative to expensive metal
          ORR catalysts. In particular, biomass-derived materials from
          wood [16], sewage sludge [17] and bananas [18] have been shown
          to function as ORR catalysts to boost MFC performance whilst
          reducing the device cost and its carbon footprint. Doping
          these materials with heteroatoms such as nitrogen and sulphur
          [19], also in combination with nanoparticles like iron [20],
          has been shown to enhance the catalytic activity towards the
          ORR even further.<br>
          <br>
          Another limitation towards practical implementations of MFCs,
          is their poor performance due to high internal resistances and
          ohmic losses experienced upon scale-up [21]. Consequently, the
          power performance of MFCs is low compared to other renewable
          energy technologies [8] and [22]. Considering the
          thermodynamic limit of an MFC (1.14 V open circuit), the most
          feasible approach to scale-up the power generated by this
          technology is to create a collection of multiple MFCs
          connected together as a stack. By miniaturising individual MFC
          units, stacks of large numbers of constituent MFCs could be
          developed, within a compact footprint. This approach has been
          referred as the ‘miniaturisation and multiplication’ strategy
          [9].<br>
          <br>
          MFC miniaturisation offers other advantages as well. The large
          surface area-to-volume ratio and short electrode distances -
          typical characteristics of miniature MFCs- provide a pathway
          to reducing ohmic losses, improving the mass transport
          processes between bulk liquid, biofilm and electrode and
          therefore enhancing power performance [23]. The consolidation
          of microfabrication techniques has led to the first prototypes
          of micro-sized MFCs, which have been discussed in a recent
          review [11]. Nonetheless, the process of miniaturisation of
          the MFC technology is still in its infancy. The two-chamber
          configuration is typically adopted for the miniature MFCs
          reported thus far, and, usually, a ferricyanide solution is
          used as the catholyte [24]. Given the greater operational
          simplicity and cost-effectiveness of oxygen diffusion systems,
          air-cathode MFC designs should be considered instead.
          Moreover, a more in-depth analysis on how to effectively
          miniaturise the system for better performance would be
          beneficial.<br>
          <br>
          With the aim of guiding the development of efficient
          small-scale MFCs, this study reports the development of an
          innovative air-cathode small-scale MFC and analyses the effect
          that the chamber length (and therefore the electrodes length)
          have on its performance either when operated as a single unit
          or when assembled in a stack. No expensive metals have been
          employed at the cathode, and the use of two types of
          innovative and highly sustainable biomass-derived ORR
          catalysts are compared with a catalyst-free device…<br>
          <br>
          <b>4. Conclusions</b><br>
          <br>
          Microbial fuel cells are an extremely attractive technology
          for the generation of clean electricity from a range of waste
          streams. The most viable route to boosting power density
          generated by MFCs is to develop small scale devices and
          arrange multiple units in stacks.<br>
          <br>
          In this context, our study aims to guide towards the
          development of effective miniature MFCs. For this purpose we
          have developed an innovative miniature MFC, which can easily
          be further miniaturised. We have used an air-cathode
          configuration since it has the advantage of greater
          operational simplicity and cost-effectiveness. While fixing
          the electrodes spacing to 4 mm, we have investigated the
          effect of the electrodes length, when the system was
          continuously fed with artificial urine at a fixed flow rate of
          0.36 mL min−1.<br>
          <br>
          The doubling of the electrode length of the miniature MFC, and
          so the hydraulic retention time as well, increased the power
          density more than tenfold due to enhanced mass transfer
          properties and substrate consumption at the electrode surface.<br>
          <br>
          By electrically stacking three individual units in parallel,
          the power output reached the peak value of 1.2 W m−3.
          Moreover, the use of two different types of biomass-derived
          ORR catalysts at the cathode increased the power density up to
          threefold. These renewable and cost-effective cathode
          catalysts are of particular interest for applications in
          remote or impoverished regions where MFCs could be used for
          remote and sustainable energy generation from waste…<br>

      functional theory calculations were used to demonstrate the

      field (E-field) near a semiconducting graphene nanoribbon. A
      significant enhancement of the optical E-field was observed 3.34 Å
      above the graphene nanoribbon sheet, with an amplitude modulation
      of approximately 100 fs, which corresponds to a frequency of 10
      THz. In general, a six-fold E-field enhancement could be obtained,
      which means that the power of the obtained THz is about 36 times
      that of incident UV light. We suggest the use of semiconducting
      graphene nanoribbons for converting visible and UV light into a
      THz signal.<b><br>

      <b><br>
      </b>..Researchers have designed a new device that can convert a DC
      electric field into a tunable source of terahertz radiation….<br>
      <br>
      This device exploits the instabilities in the oscillation of
      conducting electrons at the device's surface, a phenomenon known
      as surface plasmon resonance. To address the terahertz gap, the
      team created a hybrid semiconductor: a layer of thick conducting
      material paired with two thin, two-dimensional crystalline layers
      made from graphene, silicene (a graphene-like material made from
      silicon instead of carbon), or a two-dimensional electron gas.
      When a direct current is passed through the hybrid semiconductor,
      it creates a plasmon instability at a particular wavenumber. This
      instability induces the emission of terahertz radiation, which can
      be harnessed with the help of a surface grating that splits the
      radiation.<br>
      <br>
      By adjusting various parameters -- such as the density of
      conduction electrons in the material or the strength of the DC
      electric field -- it is possible to tune the cutoff wavenumber
      and, consequently, the frequency of the resulting terahertz
      radiation…<b><br>

      <b><br>
      </b>We propose a new approach for energy conversion from a dc
      electric field to tunable terahertz emission based on hybrid
      semiconductors by combining two-dimensional (2D) crystalline
      layers and a thick conducting material with possible applications
      for chemical analysis, security scanning, medical
      (single-molecule) imaging, and telecommunications. The hybrid
      nano-structure may consist of a single or pair of sheets of
      graphene, silicene, or a 2D electron gas. When an electric current
      is passed through a 2D layer, we discover that two low-energy
      plasmon branches exhibit a characteristic loop in their dispersion
      before they merge into an unstable region beyond a critical wave
      vector qc . This finite qc gives rise to a wavenumber cutoff in
      the emission dispersion of the surface plasmon induced instability
      and emission of radiation (spiler). However, there is no
      instability for a single driven layer far from the conductor, and
      the instability of an isolated pair of 2D layers occurs without a
      wavenumber cutoff. The wavenumber cutoff is found to depend on the
      conductor electron density, layer separation, distances of layers
      from the conductor surface, and the driving-current strength.<b><br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>How brain oscillations respond to
            teleportation</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Technology may not have caught up to the teleportation devices
      of science fiction, but now we have some idea of how the brain
      handles "beaming up" from one location to another, thanks to
      research by neuroscientists at the University of California,
      Davis, involving some specially wired volunteers.<br>
      <br>
      The work is published online Feb. 25, 2016 in the journal Neuron.<br>
      <br>
      Arne Ekstrom, associate professor at the UC Davis Center for
      Neuroscience, wants to know how we memorize places and routes, and
      learn to find our way around. It's long been known that as a rat
      navigates a maze, its brain gives off a rhythmic oscillation,
      Ekstrom said. This also happens when humans travel around a
      virtual landscape on a computer screen. Most models of brain
      function assume that the oscillations, emanating from the
      hippocampus deep inside the brain, are at least partly driven by
      external inputs.<br>
      <br>
      "There is this rhythmic firing in the brain during navigation and
      while remembering things, but we don't know if it is triggered by
      sensory input or by the learning process," Ekstrom said.<br>
      <br>
      Ekstrom, postdoc Lindsay Vass and graduate student Milagros Copara
      were able to solve this problem by working with a group of
      patients being treated at UC Davis' Department of Neurological
      Surgery. These patients have a severe form of epilepsy, and
      surgeon and study coauthor Kia Shahlaie implanted electrodes on
      their brains, inside the skull, to find out where seizure activity
      begins and identify treatment options.<br>
      <br>
      In between seizures, the electrodes recorded normal brain
      activity, and three patients volunteered to take part in the
      experiment. They were asked to navigate through a streetscape on a
      computer screen. At some points, they entered a teleporter and
      jumped to a different, known location in the map. During
      teleportation, the screen went black for a random period of time.<br>
      <br>
      Teleportation did not interrupt the oscillations at all, but the
      rhythm did change with the distance travelled during
      teleportation, Ekstrom said.<br>
      <br>
      The results show that these oscillations are driven entirely by
      memory and learning processes in the brain, and do not depend on
      external senses. They also show that the oscillation carries
      information about speed and distance travelled, even when that
      travel is virtual teleportation. <b><br>

            E-Cat trial completed</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      On February 17, 2016, a 350-day commercial test of a one megawatt
      heat plant based on Andrea Rossi’s E-Cat was completed. The event
      must be considered historic since it’s the first time an
      industrially useful amount of energy is produced over such a long
      time from this kind of yet unexplained radiation-free nuclear
      reaction—LENR or Low Energy Nuclear Reactions.<br>
      <br>
      To be clear, the report from the one-year trial, which has been
      controlled by a major independent third party certification
      institute, will be released only in about a month, and until then
      no official information is provided on the test result. However,
      multiple sources have told me that the test has been successful.<br>
      <br>
      Earlier, some sources having visited the test plant told me that
      the COP, Coefficient of Performance, i.e. the ratio between output
      power and input power for control, was in the range 20—80, meaning
      that the heat plant was consuming 12—50 kW while producing 1
      MW—the average consumption of about 300 Western households,
      including electricity, space heating, water heating and air
      conditioning.<br>
      <br>
      I have also been told that the total amount of fuel—mostly
      harmless elements such as lithium, hydrogen and nickel, according
      to Andrea Rossi’s granted patent on the technology—was in the
      range of tenths of grams. And supposedly the charge has never been
      changed during the year. On the other hand, after one year’s run,
      the reactors are now being recharged for further operation.<br>
      <br>
      All this might be confirmed by the third party institute, that has
      been controlling the heat plant 24/7 with video cameras.<br>
      <br>
      The test has been undertaken by Andrea Rossi and his US industrial
      partner Industrial Heat, and according to Rossi, commercialisation
      of similar industrial heat plants will be initiated as soon as
      possible, provided that the result is positive. Industrial Heat
      has acquired the right to produce and sell E-Cat based technology
      in, as far as I have been told, North, Central and South America,
      China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.<b><br>
        <br>
        New Energy World Symposium, News.<br>
        <br>
      </b>Needless to say, the consequences of such an energy source for
      the world will be huge. And the consequences for industry, finance
      and society is also the focus of the New Energy World Symposium or
      NewS, which will be held in Stockholm, Sweden, on June 21, 2016,
      provided that the report from the test is clearly positive.<br>
      <br>
      So, now we all wait for the report. Personally, however, I will
      put the champagne on ice. Now.<b><br>
        <br>
        Comments --<br>
        <br>
      </b>First, Rossi never suggested that the radiation from the hot
      cat is anything other than heat — he specifically denied EM and
      gamma radiation. But if you’re concerned about the radiation
      spectrum of an LENR reaction (whatever the heck that is), simply
      measure it with appropriate spectroscopy.<br>
      <br>
      But my main point is that an estimate of the energy produced by
      use of a thermal camera is a ruse by Rossi to begin with and is
      intended only to complicate, obfuscate and mislead. First, if you
      want a proof of concept of Rossi’s “effect”, then the device
      tested by Levi and reported by Lewan in 2011 is vastly better. At
      least 10 times as much power from about the same volume and a
      power out to power in ration also at least ten times better.
      Problem is, that measurement, just like ALL the measurements,
      publicly reported, in which Lewan/or and Levi were involved,
      lacked calibration and thus were worthless. In the case of the
      2011 experiment, a simple (but deliberate by Rossi) misplacement
      of the output thermocouple, too close to the huge heater in the
      device, would be enough to get the results without any LENR.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#000000"><a

          "><b>http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/energi_miljo/energi/article3108242.ece</b></a><br>
        <br>
        One of the strangest aspects of this whole story is the
        decreasing output per volume of the ecats with time, a hallmark
        of energy scams, and the failure to repeat what seems like
        immensely successful and potentially probative experiments like
        Levi’s fluid/mass flow calorimetry run. Most of you know my
        conclusion about why those things are the way they are, so I
        won’t bother to repeat it again.<br>
        <br>
        I can hardly wait for the big reveal– who the “independent”
        referee of Rossi’s will be this time, what the company is which
        allowed the test and was the “customer” and which agency has
        been trying without success to certify a domestic/home ecat for
        going on five years. And people think this is all real? And they
        really believe Rossi can spend 16 hours a day for a year inside
        the container with the machine and STILL not be able to say
        conclusively whether it works or not (F9 !!!!) Yah shoore.<br>
        <br>
        “The most egregious error is the emissivity one, where the total
        and normal emissivity values used are the same in the report,
        but have been shown to be quite different in several skeptical
        analyses. This is important in that the power calculated by the
        report authors is directly a result of the emissivity values
        used. The reported COP is therefore directly connected to this
        conflation of emissivity values.”<br>
        <br>
        Actually the most basic, fundamental and crucial error in every
        one of the tests, demos and experiments, reported publicly by
        and for Rossi has been the same identical and unforgivable
        mistake — failure to calibrate the output power measurement
        coupled with failure to insure the integrity of the input power
        source and measurement.<br>
        <br>
        Mats Lewan, the late Dr. Kullander and Dr. Essen were criticized
        for this failure in early 2011 (the wet steam/dry steam debacle)
        and again in later experiments (the thermocouple placement
        debacle) and had every opportunity to get it right in the hot
        cat experiments. But they failed dismally to do so. It is
        completely incomprehensible that a device which incorporates a
        *built in* large electrical heater was not calibrated over the
        full operating temperature range, using that heater.<br>
        <br>
        There are innumerable other inconsistencies, lies, deceptions
        and evasions in Rossi’s stories (he’s currently recycling the
        nonsense about having a huge (robotic?) factory ready to make
        millions of ecats). But the failure to hold Rossi’s feet to the
        performance of a proper calibration has happened every time and
        the only possible explanation is negligence and incompetence on
        the part of those assisting and participating in these tests.<br>
        <br>
        That someone should take a discovery purported to be a tabletop
        multi kilowatt reactor and not work with a large company (think
        GE, GM, Tesla or any large Chinese or European company) is
        incomprehensible since this ridiculous farce has now gone 5
        years!<br>
        <br>
        The decrement in performance from a power output of 135kW peak
        and 20kW steady state reported in 2011 in Mats own magazine
        under *his authorship!* …<br>
        <br>
        ( <a
href="http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/energi_miljo/energi/article3108242.ece"
          "><b>http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/energi_miljo/energi/article3108242.ece</b></a>
        )<br>
        <br>
        … to the current arguable 3 kW of the hotcat is equally
        inexplicable. And the so-called COP went from better than 30 to
        the current claim of 3! This performance loss with time, when
        improvement would be expected, is the hallmark of an energy
        scam.<br>
        <br>
        The lack of response of the Swedish scientists responsible for
        the Lugano report to responsible critiques by people like Thomas
        Clarke is also very telling.<br>
        <br>
        The topping on the cake is Rossi claim to certification based on
        a worthless self-reported safety document and Rossi’s joy over a
        patent which simply describes a heater configuration wherein the
        source of heat could be anything — for example, the electric
        heater the device prominently contains. These claims are
        reminiscent of the time Rossi purchased a PhD diploma from a now
        state-closed fake university (Kensington). He is now claiming it
        was honorary which is pure nonsense. Rossi just makes stuff up
        as he goes along and the believers all swallow it.<b><br>

      </b>...As reported in the Journal of Nutrition, aged garlic
      extract shows significant promise in its ability to reverse deadly
      buildup of plaque in arteries. The study was found to both reduce
      the amount of accumulated “soft plaque” in the arteries as well as
      prevent new plaque from forming.<br>
      <br>
      Reduction of plaque in arteries after a year of aged garlic
      extract<br>
      <br>
      The study, conducted at the independent biomedical research
      facility LA BioMed, Torrance, Calif., showed that adding the
      supplement aged garlic extract resulted in a reduction in the
      amount of soft plaque, also known as low-attenuation plaque, that
      had built up in the arteries of patients. Participants in the
      study were already known to be suffering from metabolic syndrome,
      which carries with it a number of cardiac disease risk factors,
      including hypertension and obesity.<br>
      <br>
      .This isn’t the first time aged garlic extract has been associated
      with a reduction in plaque build-up of coronary arteries or heart
      disease. A study published in the July 2012 issue of Journal of
      Cardiovascular Disease Research found that average coronary artery
      calcium progression was significantly less one year after the
      start of the study among subjects receiving a combination of
      coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and aged garlic extract...<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>The supplement Aged Garlic Extract can reverse the buildup of
      deadly plaque in arteries and help prevent the progression of
      heart disease, according to a new study scheduled for publication
      in the Journal of Nutrition.<br>
      <br>
      The research, conducted at LA BioMed, found a reduction in the
      amount of low-attenuation plaque, or "soft plaque," in the
      arteries of patients with metabolic syndrome who took Aged Garlic
      Extract. Metabolic syndrome is characterized by obesity,
      hypertension and other cardiac risk factors.<br>
      <br>
      "This study is another demonstration of the benefits of this
      supplement in reducing the accumulation of soft plaque and
      preventing the formation of new plaque in the arteries, which can
      cause heart disease," said Matthew J. Budoff, MD, an LA BioMed
      lead researcher. "We have completed four randomized studies, and
      they have led us to conclude that Aged Garlic Extract can help
      slow the progression of atherosclerosis and reverse the early
      stages of heart disease."<br>
      <br>
      The study involved 55 patients, aged 40 to 75 years, who had been
      diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. All the participants underwent
      screening at the beginning of the study to measure the total
      coronary plaque volume as well as dense calcium, non-calcified
      plaque and low-attenuation plaque. The screening was conducted
      using Cardiac Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA), a
      noninvasive imaging technology that accurately measures calcium
      deposits and plaque buildup in the arteries.<br>
      <br>
      Following evaluation, the participants were given either a placebo
      or a dose of 2,400 milligrams of Aged Garlic Extract every day. A
      follow-up screening conducted a year after the initial screening
      found those who had taken Aged Garlic Extract had slowed total
      plaque accumulation by 80%, reduced soft plaque and demonstrated
      regression (less plaque on follow-up) for low-attenuation plaque.<b><br>

      <b>Abstract<br>
        <br>
        Objective: </b>We reviewed the available literature
      investigating the effects of garlic supplements on hypertension,
      hypercholesterolemia, C-reactive protein (CRP), pulse wave
      velocity (PWV), and coronary artery calcium (CAC), as well as
      available data on side effects.<b><br>
        <br>
        Methods: </b>We searched PubMed for all human studies using
      medical subject heading words through 30 May 2013 and assessed
      relevant review articles and original studies. Only double-blind,
      randomized, controlled trials and meta-analyses of double-blind,
      randomized, controlled trials were included. The review of
      articles and data extraction were performed by 2 independent
      authors, with any disagreements resolved by consensus.<b><br>
        <br>
        Results: </b>Garlic supplementation reduced blood pressure by
      7–16 mm Hg (systolic) and 5–9 mm Hg (diastolic) (4 meta-analyses
      and 2 original studies). It reduced total cholesterol by 7.4–29.8
      mg/dL (8 meta-analyses). The most consistent benefits were shown
      in studies that used aged garlic extract (AGE). A few small
      studies that used AGE also showed favorable effects on CAC, CRP,
      and PWV. Although garlic is generally safe, rare adverse reactions
      have been documented with limited causality established.<br>
      <b><br>
        Conclusion: </b>We conclude that garlic supplementation has the
      potential for cardiovascular protection based on risk factor
      reduction (hypertension and total cholesterol) and surrogate
      markers (CRP, PWV, and CAC) of atherosclerosis. Larger studies are
      warranted to evaluate these effects further.<br>

      Traditional theory has it that eyeglass correction in middle age
      is necessitated by the decreasing flexibility of the lens in the
      eye requiring the assistance of a lens to acquire proper focus
      accomodation. Recent discoveries however cast some questions on
      this theory... particularly since it is the "resting curvature" of
      the lens, not the "accommodation curvature" of the lens which
      seems to be the most widespread problem.. and there is little
      reason to believe that the ambient "resting curvature" of the lens
      would be under any (aging) pressure to change.<br>
      <br>
      Rather, HAMMOND'S research seems to indicate that it is brain
      development (e.g. perceptual development) during one's lifetime
      toward "better true size perception" that simply requires an
      unobtainable change in ambient curvature... which produces
      "blurred vision" in older people and requires glasses.<br>
      <br>
      The PROBLEM with glasses is that they change the focus location of
      the image by MAGNIFYING the object.&nbsp; For instance My glasses
      (I am farsighted, hence positive lenses) cause a measurable
      5%-Magnification of everything I am seeing, in order to move the
      focal plane to the retina (focus correction).<br>
      <br>
      My question is this.&nbsp; If we suppose, according to HAMMOND'S
      THEORY that this change in apparent size of the World with age is
      a "natural design of God"... isn't there an (optical) way that we
      could move the plane of focus so that we wouldn't have blurred
      vision, WITHOUT introducing any "changed magnification" into the
      system.<br>
      <br>
      This then, would produce "True Godsite" without blurring or
      manmade magnification... according to Hammond's new theory.<br>
      <br>
      Is it optically-possible to make a pair of glasses which will do
      this... or are we up against some kind of optical law which says
      it is impossible.<br>
      <br>
      If it IS POSSIBLE, then according to Hammond's discovery, the
      present design of glasses is actually quite psychologically
      harmful, sort of the optical equivalent of "bleeding someone with
      leeches" used to be in the olden days of medicine. <b><font

        </b>Imagine a future in which our electrical gadgets are no
        longer limited by plugs and external power sources.<br>
        <br>
        This intriguing prospect is one of the reasons for the current
        interest in building the capacity to store electrical energy
        directly into a wide range of products, such as a laptop whose
        casing serves as its battery, or an electric car powered by
        energy stored in its chassis, or a home where the dry wall and
        siding store the electricity that runs the lights and
        appliances.<br>
        <br>
        It also makes the small, dull grey wafers that graduate student
        Andrew Westover and Assistant Professor of Mechanical
        Engineering Cary Pint have made in Vanderbilt’s Nanomaterials
        and Energy Devices Laboratory far more important than their
        nondescript appearance suggests.<br>
        <br>
        “These devices demonstrate – for the first time as far as we can
        tell – that it is possible to create materials that can store
        and discharge significant amounts of electricity while they are
        subject to realistic static loads and dynamic forces, such as
        vibrations or impacts,” said Pint. “Andrew has managed to make
        our dream of structural energy storage materials into a
        reality.”<br>
        <br>
        That is important because structural energy storage will change
        the way in which a wide variety of technologies are developed in
        the future. “When you can integrate energy into the components
        used to build systems, it opens the door to a whole new world of
        technological possibilities. All of a sudden, the ability to
        design technologies at the basis of health, entertainment,
        travel and social communication will not be limited by plugs and
        external power sources,” Pint said.<br>
        <br>
        The new device that Pint and Westover has developed is a
        supercapacitor that stores electricity by assembling
        electrically charged ions on the surface of a porous material,
        instead of storing it in chemical reactions the way batteries
        do. As a result, supercaps can charge and discharge in minutes,
        instead of hours, and operate for millions of cycles, instead of
        thousands of cycles like batteries.<br>
        <br>
        In a paper appearing online May 19 in the journal Nano Letters,
        Pint and Westover report that their new structural
        supercapacitor operates flawlessly in storing and releasing
        electrical charge while subject to stresses or pressures up to
        44 psi and vibrational accelerations over 80 g (significantly
        greater than those acting on turbine blades in a jet engine).<br>
        <br>
        Furthermore, the mechanical robustness of the device doesn’t
        compromise its energy storage capability. “In an unpackaged,
        structurally integrated state our supercapacitor can store more
        energy and operate at higher voltages than a packaged,
        off-the-shelf commercial supercapacitor, even under intense
        dynamic and static forces,” Pint said.<br>
        <br>
        One area where supercapacitors lag behind batteries is in
        electrical energy storage capability: Supercaps must be larger
        and heavier to store the same amount of energy as lithium-ion
        batteries. However, the difference is not as important when
        considering multifunctional energy storage systems.<br>
        <br>
        Supercapacitors store ten times less energy than current
        lithium-ion batteries, but they can last a thousand times
        longer.“Battery performance metrics change when you’re putting
        energy storage into heavy materials that are already needed for
        structural integrity,” said Pint. “Supercapacitors store ten
        times less energy than current lithium-ion batteries, but they
        can last a thousand times longer. That means they are better
        suited for structural applications. It doesn’t make sense to
        develop materials to build a home, car chassis, or aerospace
        vehicle if you have to replace them every few years because they
        go dead.”<br>
        <br>
        Westover’s wafers consist of electrodes made from silicon that
        have been chemically treated so they have nanoscale pores on
        their inner surfaces and then coated with a protective ultrathin
        graphene-like layer of carbon. Sandwiched between the two
        electrodes is a polymer film that acts as a reservoir of charged
        ions, similar to the role of the electrolyte paste in a battery.
        When the electrodes are pressed together, the polymer oozes into
        the tiny pores in much the same way that melted cheese soaks
        into the nooks and crannies of artisan bread in a panini. When
        the polymer cools and solidifies, it forms an extremely strong
        mechanical bond.<br>
        <br>
        “The biggest problem with designing load-bearing supercaps is
        preventing them from delaminating,” said Westover. “Combining
        nanoporous material with the polymer electrolyte bonds the
        layers together tighter than superglue.”<br>
        <br>
        The use of silicon in structural supercapacitors is best suited
        for consumer electronics and solar cells, but Pint and Westover
        are confident that the rules that govern the load-bearing
        character of their design will carry over to other materials,
        such as carbon nanotubes and lightweight porous metals like
        aluminum.<br>
        <br>
        The intensity of interest in “multifunctional” devices of this
        sort is reflected by the fact that the U.S. Department of
        Energy’s Advanced Research Project Agency for Energy is

        specifically on incorporating energy storage into structural

        <b>Abstract<br>
          <br>
        </b>A load-bearing, multifunctional material with the
        simultaneous capability to store energy and withstand static and
        dynamic mechanical stresses is demonstrated. This is produced
        using ion-conducting polymers infiltrated into nanoporous
        silicon that is etched directly into bulk conductive silicon.
        This device platform maintains energy densities near 10 W h/kg
        with Coulombic efficiency of 98% under exposure to over 300 kPa
        tensile stresses and 80 g vibratory accelerations, along with
        excellent performance in other shear, compression, and impact
        tests. This demonstrates performance feasibility as a
        structurally integrated energy storage material broadly
        applicable across renewable energy systems, transportation
        systems, and mobile electronics, among others.<b><br>

        Where the narrative of story meets the dialogue of change is the
        sweet spot where mythologies are born. Big changes in many areas
        of science and society point towards a gap waiting to be filled
        by new ways of thinking. For these new models to become the new
        ''norm' a whole new mythology must evolve. A mythology always
        needs a cosmology for its base. Electric Universe theory may
        provide the new cosmology which makes a new mythology possible
        at last. This video answers questions like what really is a
        mythology and how does it work and change? This could be the

      <div align="center"><big><b>Oxygen levels in womb affect aging in
            adulthood, study finds</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      Anti-aging products are a multi-billion dollar industry, but it
      seems there's only so much that creams and pills can do. A study
      found that much of our aging 'destiny' is set before birth, and is
      related to the amount of oxygen present in the womb.<br>
      <br>
      The study, led by a team of researchers from the University of
      Cambridge, centered around telomeres, otherwise known as the ends
      of chromosomes. In short, telomeres play a similar role to the
      plastic that binds the ends of shoelaces, preventing chromosomes
      from fraying. As humans get older, telomeres become shorter and
      shorter, meaning their length can be used as a proxy to measure
      aging.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers measured the length of telomeres in blood vessels
      of laboratory rats born from mothers who were not fed antioxidants
      during a normal or complicated pregnancy. In some of the rats,
      they simulated one of the most common complications in pregnancy -
      a reduction in the amount of oxygen a baby receives - by placing a
      group of pregnant rats in a room containing seven percent less
      oxygen than normal.<br>
      <br>
      They found that adult rats born from mothers who had less oxygen
      during pregnancy had shorter telomeres than rats from
      uncomplicated pregnancies, and experienced problems with the inner
      lining of their blood vessels. Both of these results signified
      those rats had aged more quickly and were predisposed to
      developing heart disease.<br>
      <br>
      However, when pregnant rats in that group were given antioxidant
      supplements, their offspring's risk of developing heart disease
      was lowered.<br>
      <br>
      "Antioxidants are known to reduce aging, but here, we show for the
      first time that giving them to pregnant mothers can slow down the
      aging clock of their offspring. This appears to be particularly
      important when there are complications with the pregnancy and the
      fetus is deprived of oxygen. Although this discovery was found
      using rats, it suggests a way that we may treat similar problems
      in humans," Dr. Beth Allison, first author of the study, said in a
      statement.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, offspring born from uncomplicated pregnancies - when
      the fetus received appropriate levels of oxygen - also benefited
      from antioxidants, and showed longer telomeres than those rats
      whose mothers did not receive such supplements during pregnancy.<br>
      <br>
      The study's lead author, Professor Dino Giussani from the
      Department of Physiology Development &amp; Neuroscience at the
      University of Cambridge, said the findings prove that the
      environment in the womb could be even more important than humans'
      post-natal environments.<br>
      <br>
      "Our study in rats suggests that the aging clock begins ticking
      even before we are born and enter this world, which may surprise
      many people," he said.<br>
      <br>
      "We already know that our genes interact with environmental risk
      factors, such as smoking, obesity and lack of exercise to increase
      our risk of heart disease, but here we've shown that the
      environment we're exposed to in the womb may be just as, if not
      more, important in programming a risk of adult-onset
      cardiovascular disease," Giussani added.<br>
      <br>
      The research, funded in the UK by the British Heart Foundation,
      was published in the journal FASEB on March 1. <br>

      <b>Abstract<br>
        <br>
      </b>Aging and developmental programming are both associated with
      oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, suggesting common
      mechanistic origins. However, their interrelationship has been
      little explored. In a rodent model of programmed cardiovascular
      dysfunction we determined endothelial function and vascular
      telomere length in young (4 mo) and aged (15 mo) adult offspring
      of normoxic or hypoxic pregnancy with or without maternal
      antioxidant treatment. We show loss of endothelial function
      [maximal arterial relaxation to acetylcholine (71 ± 3 vs. 55 ± 3%)
      and increased vascular short telomere abundance (4.2–1.3 kb) 43.0
      ± 1.5 vs. 55.1 ± 3.8%) in aged vs. young offspring of normoxic
      pregnancy (P &lt; 0.05). Hypoxic pregnancy in young offspring
      accelerated endothelial dysfunction (maximal arterial relaxation
      to acetylcholine: 42 ± 1%, P &lt; 0.05) but this was dissociated
      from increased vascular short telomere length abundance. Maternal
      allopurinol rescued maximal arterial relaxation to acetylcholine
      in aged offspring of normoxic or hypoxic pregnancy but not in
      young offspring of hypoxic pregnancy. Aged offspring of hypoxic
      allopurinol pregnancy compared with aged offspring of untreated
      hypoxic pregnancy had lower levels of short telomeres (vascular
      short telomere length abundance 35.1 ± 2.5 vs. 48.2 ± 2.6%) and of
      plasma proinflammatory chemokine (24.6 ± 2.8 vs. 36.8 ± 5.5 pg/ml,
      P &lt; 0.05). These data provide evidence for divergence of
      mechanistic pathways mediating cardiovascular aging and
      developmental programming of cardiovascular disease, and aging
      being decelerated by antioxidants even prior to birth.<b><br>

          </font></b><font color="#000000">Scientists have harnessed
          static electricity to control chemical reactions for the first
          time, in a breakthrough that could bring cleaner industry and
          cheaper nanotechnology.<br>
          <br>
          The team used an electric field as a catalyst for a common
          reaction, the Diels-Alder reaction, improving its reaction
          rate by a factor of five.<br>
          <br>
          Lead researcher Professor Michelle Coote from ANU Research
          School of Chemistry said the team had overturned conventional
          thinking with their new-found control of the common reaction,
          which is used to make a range of chemicals from self-healing
          materials to the drug cortisone.<br>
          <br>
          "It’s the most unexpected result possible," said Professor
          Coote, who is also a Chief Investigator with ARC Centre of
          Excellence for Electromaterials Science (ACES). "We now have a
          totally new way of thinking about chemistry.<br>
          <br>
          "The breakthrough could speed up manufacturing processes and
          allow unprecedented control of chemical reactions, for example
          in manufacturing flexible electronic components based on
          organic circuits," she said.<br>
          <br>
          An electric field catalyst is completely different to
          conventional catalysts, which are often based on expensive
          rare chemicals and can create unwanted by-products or
          contaminate the final products.<br>
          <br>
          As electric fields can be turned on and off very quickly from
          outside the test-tube, the new approach gives the researchers
          remote control over chemical processes.<br>
          <br>
          Professor Coote predicted that electric fields could strongly
          affect reaction rates, but it had never been observed before
          because standard chemical reactions are conducted with
          molecules oriented in random directions in a gas or liquid.<br>
          <br>
          The Centre of Excellence brought together a team, including
          researchers from&nbsp; Universitat de Barcelona in Spain and
          Dr Simone Ciampi from the University of Wollongong, that
          devised a way to test Professor Coote’s prediction, using the
          electric field generated by the tip of a scanning-tunneling
          electron microscope.<br>
          <br>
          The group oriented all the molecules in the same direction by
          attaching them to a surface and then used the probe of the
          electron microscope to test each molecule.<br>
          <br>
          By changing the strength and polarity of the electric field,
          the team were able to vary the rate of the Diels-Alder
          reaction, in which a conjugated diene and a substituted diene
          form a cyclohexene system, by a factor of five<br>
          <br>
          Professor Coote said the result will help research understand
          a lot of natural biochemical reactions.<br>
          <br>
          "Nature uses enzymes as the ultimate catalyst, which can vary
          reaction rates by 14 orders of magnitude," she said.<br>
          <br>
          "Enzymes work with carefully oriented charged functional
          groups, held in precise orientations, effectively generating
          an oriented electric field within the active site."<br>
          <br>
          Professor Coote started the project when ANU joined the
          University of Wollongong as an ACES partner and was introduced
          to colleagues at Universitat de Barcelona.<br>
          <br>
          ACES Director Professor Gordon Wallace said it is only a
          holistic approach to interdisciplinary research that can take
          ideas to industries in the shortest time possible.<br>
          <br>
          "The collegial environment and multidisciplinary approach
          within ACES meant that we could mobilise all the skills
          necessary-from molecular modelling to exquisite
          experiments-very quickly to enable this amazing discovery,"
          Professor Wallace said.<br>
          <br>
          The breakthrough has been published in the latest edition of
          Nature.</font><b><font color="#000000"><br>

              -- An electric field can trigger a Diels-Alder reaction</font></i><b><font

          In a discovery that might come as a shock—or, at the very
          least, an electric shock—chemists have found that a properly
          oriented external electric field can nudge two reagents to
          hook up with one another in a Diels-Alder reaction. The
          fundamental discovery expands chemists’ knowledge of how
          electricity can drive synthesis and catalysis (Nature 2016,
          DOI: 10.1038/nature16989).<br>
          <br>
          Chemists have long used electricity to trigger redox
          reactions. And theorists have suggested that electric fields
          could spur on non-redox transformations, but until now, no one
          had shown this was possible with a bimolecular system. “What
          is particularly striking is that we chose a really simple
          nonpolar carbon-carbon-bond-forming reaction—a Diels-Alder
          reaction—for which there are no formal zwitterionic
          intermediates involved,” says Michelle L. Coote, a professor
          at Australian National University who coauthored the study.
          “So we think these electric field effects could be very
          general.”<br>
          <br>
          Coote and her collaborators, University of Wollongong’s Simone
          Ciampi and University of Barcelona’s Nadim Darwish and Ismael
          Diez-Perez, were inspired by the work of Hebrew University of
          Jerusalem theorist Sason Shaik, who suggested that an oriented
          electric field might accelerate Diels-Alder reactions. To
          prove this experimentally, Coote and her colleagues tethered a
          dienophile to a gold surface and a diene to the tip of a
          scanning-tunneling microscope.<br>
          <br>
          They brought the molecules close to one another and applied an
          electric field. Upping the power of the electric field led to
          an increase in the reaction rate. What’s more, the field’s
          polarity mattered: The reaction rate only got a boost when the
          electric field favored electron flow from the dienophile to
          the diene.<br>
          <br>
          Shaik tells C&amp;EN he was delighted to see his theory, which
          had been described as “daydreaming,” proven experimentally.
          Although the current method can’t synthesize products on a
          practical scale, he thinks the discovery has the potential to
          change how chemists make molecules. “I definitely see a future
          where instead of mixing chemicals in a flask and heating, you
          will zap molecules with an electric field,” he says.</font><b><font

          </font></b><font color="#000000">It is often thought that the
          ability to control reaction rates with an applied electrical
          potential gradient is unique to redox systems. However, recent
          theoretical studies suggest that oriented electric fields
          could affect the outcomes of a range of chemical reactions,
          regardless of whether a redox system is involved1, 2, 3, 4.
          This possibility arises because many formally covalent species
          can be stabilized via minor charge-separated resonance
          contributors. When an applied electric field is aligned in
          such a way as to electrostatically stabilize one of these
          minor forms, the degree of resonance increases, resulting in
          the overall stabilization of the molecule or transition state.
          This means that it should be possible to manipulate the
          kinetics and thermodynamics of non-redox processes using an
          external electric field, as long as the orientation of the
          approaching reactants with respect to the field stimulus can
          be controlled. Here, we provide experimental evidence that the
          formation of carbon–carbon bonds is accelerated by an electric
          field. We have designed a surface model system to probe the
          Diels–Alder reaction, and coupled it with a scanning
          tunnelling microscopy break-junction approach5, 6, 7. This
          technique, performed at the single-molecule level, is
          perfectly suited to deliver an electric-field stimulus across
          approaching reactants. We find a fivefold increase in the
          frequency of formation of single-molecule junctions, resulting
          from the reaction that occurs when the electric field is
          present and aligned so as to favour electron flow from the
          dienophile to the diene. Our results are qualitatively
          consistent with those predicted by quantum-chemical
          calculations in a theoretical model of this system, and herald
          a new approach to chemical catalysis.</font><b><font

          </font></b><font color="#000000">END:CIV examines our
          culture's addiction to systematic violence and environmental
          exploitation, and probes the resulting epidemic of poisoned
          landscapes and shell-shocked nations. Based in part on
          Endgame, the best-selling book by Derrick Jensen, END:CIV
          asks: "If your homeland was invaded by aliens who cut down the
          forests, poisoned the water and air, and contaminated the food
          supply, would you resist?"<br>
          <br>
          The causes underlying the collapse of civilizations are
          usually traced to overuse of resources. As we write this, the
          world is reeling from economic chaos, peak oil, climate
          change, environmental degradation, and political turmoil.
          Every day, the headlines re-hash stories of scandal and
          betrayal of the public trust. We don't have to make outraged
          demands for the end of the current global system — it seems to
          be coming apart already.<br>
          <br>
          But acts of courage, compassion and altruism abound, even in
          the most damaged places. By documenting the resilience of the
          people hit hardest by war and repression, and the heroism of
          those coming forward to confront the crisis head-on, END:CIV
          illuminates a way out of this all-consuming madness and into a
          saner future.<br>
          <br>
          Backed by Jensen's narrative, the film calls on us to act as
          if we truly love this land. The film trips along at a brisk
          pace, using music, archival footage, motion graphics,
          animation, slapstick and satire to deconstruct the global
          economic system, even as it implodes around us. END:CIV
          illustrates first-person stories of sacrifice and heroism with
          intense, emotionally-charged images that match Jensen's poetic
          and intuitive approach. Scenes shot in the back country
          provide interludes of breathtaking natural beauty alongside
          clearcut evidence of horrific but commonplace destruction.<br>
          <br>
          END:CIV features interviews with Paul Watson, Waziyatawin,
          Gord Hill, Michael Becker, Peter Gelderloos, Lierre Keith,

          the direct conversion of flow into lift in an entirely closed
          system. The main possible applications are in aviation and
          space flight. This problem is solved by discovery of the
          physical fact that for each elementary part of a body
          possessing volume the gravitation acts on this elementary part
          absolutely perpendicular to the centre of the earth, but that
          as a result the gravitational forces acting on the totality of
          parts of a body do not run parallel, since they intersect at
          one and the same point M and thereby stand at a certain
          (effective) angle @ to one another (@ drawing). An extremely
          rapidly rotating ring or disc would attain weightlessness from
          a circumferential speed of 12.4 km/sec (considering the
          peripherally rotating effective mass). With further
          acceleration in excess of 12.4 km/sec calculable lift is
          possible solely due to rotating masses. <br>

            Commentary :<br>
            <br>
          </font></b><font color="#000000">There have been many
          questions about the countries forecast specially the one
          focusing on the United States of America (USA). They won't be
          answered one by one but below you can find some explanation,
          thoughts and reflections. We are going to keep this as short
          as possible.<br>
          <br>
          The majority of the economic and demographic data used in the
          making of the forecasts is widely available by institutions
          such as the CIA, IMF, UN, USG, etc. You can see the most
          relevant data at every single country's page. There is a tiny
          part of data coming from a variety of shadow sources such as
          Internet gurus, unsigned reports and others. But all these
          sources are from the internet and are of public domain for at
          least a minority. For example, several years ago Dagong, the
          Chinese ratings agency, published a report analyzing the
          physical economy of the States comparing it with those of
          China, Germany and Japan. The conclusion was that the US GDP
          was something between $5 to $10 trillion instead of $15
          trillion as officially reported by the USG. We assume that the
          official data, especially economic, released by governments is
          fake, cooked or distorted in some degree. Historically it is
          well known that the former Soviet Union was making up fake
          statistics years before its collapse. Western as well as other
          countries are making up their numbers today to conceal their
          real state of affairs. We are sure that many people out there
          can find government statistics in their own countries that by
          their own personal experience are hard to believe or are so
          optimistic that may belong to a different country.<br>
          <br>
          Despite the numeric data "quantity" there is a "quality" model
          which has not a direct translation into numeric data. The 2014
          strain of Ebola has a death rate of 50-60% but try to imagine
          what would happen if there is a pandemic of Ebola with
          hundreds of thousands or millions infected with the virus. So
          far the few cases of Ebola-infected people have "enjoyed"
          intensive healthcare with anti-viral and breathing assistance
          but above all with abundant human support by Physicians and
          nurses. In a pandemic scenario that kind of healthcare won't
          be available for the overwhelming number of infected leading
          to a dramatic increase of the death rate due to the lack of
          proper healthcare. The "quality" factor is that the death rate
          could increase to 80-90% in a pandemic scenario from the
          stated 50-60% rate. The figure itself is not important what is
          relevant is the fact that the scenario can evolve beyond the
          initial conditions from a 50% death toll to more than 90%. By
          the way, no pandemic or nuclear war is included in the
          forecast.<br>
          <br>
          The key element to understand the process that the USA will
          enter in the upcoming decade is migration. In the past,
          specially in the 20th century, the key factor that allowed the
          USA to rise to its colossus status was immigration with the
          benefits of a demographic expansion supporting the credit
          expansion and the brain drain from the rest of the world
          benefiting the States. The collapse of the Western financial
          system will wipe out the standard of living of its population
          while ending ponzi schemes such as the stock exchange and the
          pension funds. The population will be hit so badly by a full
          array of bubbles and ponzi schemes that the migration engine
          will start to work in reverse accelerating itself due to
          ripple effects thus leading to the demise of the States. This
          unseen situation for the States will develop itself in a
          cascade pattern with unprecedented and devastating effects for
          the economy. Jobs offshoring will surely end with many
          American Corporations relocating overseas thus becoming
          foreign Corporations!!!! We see a significant part of the
          American population migrating to Latin America and Asia while
          migration to Europe - suffering a similar illness - won't be
          relevant. Nevertheless the death toll will be horrible. Take
          into account that the Soviet Union's population was poorer
          than the Americans nowadays or even then. The ex-Soviets
          suffered during the following struggle in the 1990s with a
          significant death toll and the loss of national pride. Might
          we say "Twice the pride, double the fall"? Nope. The American
          standard of living is one of the highest, far more than double
          of the Soviets while having added a services economy that will
          be gone along with the financial system. When pensioners see
          their retirement disappear in front of their eyes and there
          are no servicing jobs you can imagine what is going to happen
          next. At least younger people can migrate. Never in human
          history were so many elders among the population. In past
          centuries people were lucky to get to their 30s or 40s. The
          American downfall is set to be far worse than the Soviet
          Union's one. A confluence of crisis with a devastating result.<br>
          <br>
          The Demographic crisis in the former Soviet Union countries
          has extended for over two decades, if we accept that it ended
          early in this decade (2010s). The demographic crisis will hit
          the World in the near future and is projected to last between
          three and eight decades more or less depending on
          technological breakthrough and environmental issues. The
          aftermath is more likely a frozen picture with the population
          numbers staying the same for a very, very long period of time.
          The countries forecast population numbers do reflect
          birth/deaths but also migratory movements. Many countries are
          going to increase their gross population due to immigration
          while their native population may shrink.<br>
          <br>
          Over the past two thousand years we have witnessed the Western
          civilization built around the Mediterranean Sea shifting to
          Northern Europe and then by the mid 20th century shifting to
          an Atlantic axis to finally get centered into the States in
          the past 30 years. The next move will see the civilization
          being centered in Asia with Russia and China on top.
          Historically a change in the economic paradigm has resulted in
          a death toll that is rarely highlighted by mainstream
          historians. When the transition from rural areas to large
          cities happened in Europe many people unable to accept the new
          paradigm killed themselves. They killed themselves by a
          psychological factor. This is not mainstream but it is true. A
          new crisis joins old, well known patterns with new ones.<br>
          <br>
          Sorry to disappoint many of you with our forecast. It is
          getting worse and worse every year since the beginning of the
          pre-crisis in 2007. It is already said that this website is
          non-profit, built on spare time and we provide our information
          and services AS IS without further explanations and/or

          dealers as some BS is floating around the internet on this
          topic. Take into account that the forecast is nothing more
          than a model whether flawed or correct. It is not God's word
          or a magic device that allows to foresee the future...<br>

          </font></b><font color="#000000">Hi Steve,<br>
          <br>
          Please put this in the “I need to get his off my chest”
          category. I know you know most (if not all) of this, but I
          believe, as a somewhat recently retired US Army General, I
          have an obligation to put this out there.<br>
          <br>
          We have all heard it said that generals are always fighting
          the last war. I did not find that true during my military
          career. In fact, I found the opposite. There were many
          exceptionally smart men and women who strained to look through
          fog, into the future, in anticipation of what would come next.
          The problem is, this is extremely difficult to do.<br>
          <br>
          Do you think post-World War II (and to some extent post-Korean
          War) planners could have envisioned the Viet Nam War?<br>
          <br>
          Do you think the post-Vietnam planners could have foreseen
          kicking in doors in Afghanistan and Iraq?<br>
          <br>
          What do you think post Afghanistan/Iraq planners are
          envisioning next?<br>
          <br>
          As you know, the Pentagon has war plans for multiple
          contingencies….along with concomitant branches and sequels.
          Some predict total war, but those plans rarely see the public
          eye. With today’s technologies and weaponry, it is too
          difficult to fathom that any nation would go down this path.
          Besides, anyone in a position of power, who publicly predicted
          such a war--- and urged immediate preparation-- would likely
          see his/her career end rather quickly.<br>
          <br>
          Yet sadly, history would indicate total war is the most likely
          next outcome.<br>
          <br>
          Those who fought the last total war, (World War II) have
          mostly passed. Those who remain have seen their voices grow
          dim. We are now in the fourth generation from World War II…and
          all current US generations have come to believe the following
          about war:<br>
          <br>
          Wars are protracted affairs that can last a decade or more.<br>
          Wars are low-level conflicts.<br>
          Wars do not affect the general populace of the US. (We bomb
          others, they don’t bomb us.)<br>
          Only a few are needed to prosecute a war. (Currently, less
          than one half of one percent of our population have served in
          the military.)<br>
          War is good for economy.<br>
          The status quo is maintained regardless of war’s outcome.<br>
          God is on our side.<br>
          <br>
          If history is any guide, all of the above beliefs will be
          shattered during the next war.<br>
          <br>
          Steve, there are historical “war cycles.” Not every war can be
          total (WW II), or a stand-off (Korea), or
          swiftly-victorious-but-without change (Desert Storm), or
          indecisive (Vietnam/Iraq/Afghanistan). There is a rhyme and
          rhythm to human conflict and we are on course for total war.
          Strauss and Howe to an excellent job of explaining such cycles
          in their 1997 classic book, The Fourth Turning.<br>
          <br>
          With that said, I believe the next war will:<br>
          <br>
          Last only 2-3 weeks.<br>
          Be a high-level conflict where more people will die than in
          all previous wars combined.<br>
          See the general US population targeted (and stunned) at the
          devastation.<br>
          Affect everyone—not just those in uniform.<br>
          Decimate the economy. Those not killed directly will struggle
          to survive post-hostilities.<br>
          Destroy the status quo and usher in a new order.<br>
          Make manifest that God is no longer on our side. We chose to
          abandon Him, so He honored our free will.<br>
          <br>
          The reality is, Americans have not fared well at the beginning
          of most wars. We get caught off-guard, stumble, and suffer
          casualties we should not suffer. Our strength is in our
          ability to recover and adapt. As a people---and as a
          military—we have proven ourselves able to adjust “on the fly”
          and overcome overwhelming odds.<br>
          <br>
          This trait is not lost on our enemies. Their solution? Win
          before we can adjust. Attack so hard and so fast, we cannot
          get up. The Japanese had this idea at Pearl Harbor, but did
          not have the means to execute the strategy. Today’s
          weapons/technology allow for such a strategy to be successful.<br>
          <br>
          The difficulty for most American leaders is that they have
          been brought up to believe there is a linear path to things
          such as civilization’s progress, economic growth, cultural
          achievement, technological advancement, military improvement,
          and so on. Yet, this has never been the case. Things cycle.
          The ancients knew this. Our founding fathers knew this.<br>
          <br>
          Linear thinking is a relatively new mindset…fueled and
          reinforced in large part by the industrial and technological
          revolutions. And, while the material achievements have been
          amazing, and seemingly straight up, the human condition has
          not changed. Like everything in nature, human behavior cycles.<br>
          <br>
          (As an aside, the Romans also believed technological advances
          were linear and destined to grow to the sky. Yet, after the
          Empire fell, Europe forgot how to make concrete for over 700
          years. When Rome fell, knowledge was lost in the areas of
          health care, architecture, hygiene, plumbing, engineering,
          etc. This knowledge was not recovered until centuries later.
          Thus, even technology cycles, if you look back far enough.)<br>
          <br>
          The point is, among other things, industrial and technological
          advances have reinforced a false belief-system that past is
          prologue….despite overwhelming historical evidence to the
          contrary. The result is, we are careening down a destructive
          path that many Americans can “feel”, but cannot articulate.<br>
          <br>
          This is not intended as fear mongering…there is plenty of
          non-substantiated nonsense out there. As hard as this is to
          write, however, there is substantial evidence to indicate
          total war is on the horizon. I believe future historians will
          look back and say, “How could they have not seen the path they
          were on?”<br>
          <br>
          Your website has offered many solutions re what people should
          do. Your recent prepper articles have been outstanding. Of
          course, the best way to live through total war is to not
          participate. Given this, what can the average American do?<br>
          <br>
          Leave the battlefield, which in total war, is the entire
          nation. Go south of the equator.<br>
          If you can’t leave the country, leave the urban areas.<br>
          <br>
          Prepare as best you can for the war and its aftermath.<br>
          <br>
          Get right with God.<br>
          <br>
          Be attuned to the promptings of the Holy Spirit. The early
          Christians were told via visions, dreams, &amp; prophets to
          flee before the Romans sacked the city in 70 AD.<br>
          <br>
          There is another issue. Your readers are going to have to make
          a judgment call as to whether the next war is a “God’s
          judgment war”. If you determine in the affirmative, then your
          bravery, good intentions, self-sacrifice, and noble deeds will
          be in vain. You will not be fighting a foreign foe. You will
          be fighting His will. You will lose. And please, do not fall
          into the trap that “at least we are better than the other
          guys”. The Egyptians, Assyrians, and Babylonians were not
          saints, yet God use them to judge ancient Israel and Judah.<br>
          <br>
          Thankfully Steve, you get it…and have gotten it for a long
          time. You are trying to save lives, both in the physical and
          the eternal. I am merely adding my voice to yours. I hope this
          small contribution will convince those who are on the fence to
          recognize the current situation and take appropriate action.<br>
          <br>
          Is there hope? Of course…but it would require repentance and
          revival on scale we have not seen for a long time in the US.
          Fast and pray.<br>
          <br>
          Your friend in Christ<br>

        <br>
        <b>K. S. Jayaraman</b><b> , Ramesh Singh.</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Earth emits a burst of carbon monoxide (CO) a few days before an
      earthquake, according to geophysicist Ramesh Singh. He and
      co-workers from France and the United States report that this gas
      could be used as one of the precursor signals for an earthquake
      early warning system.<br>
      <br>
      The scientists used data from an American satellite and analysed
      changes in carbon monoxide at different altitudes. "The carbon
      monoxide shows enhancement in concentration a few days prior to
      the earthquake," Singh said.<br>
      <br>
      Singh, who was formerly with the Indian Institute of Technology in
      Kanpur, is currently in the physics department of Chapman
      University in California, USA. The project was funded by the
      Indo-French Centre for the Promotion of Advanced Research in New
      Delhi.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers discovered the connection between CO emission and
      earthquake by analysing satellite remote sensing data collected
      around the time when a 7.6 magnitude earthquake shook Gujarat in
      western India nine years ago killing about 20,000 people and
      rendering thousands homeless.<br>
      <br>
      Singh said that CO levels were taken by an instrument onboard
      NASA's Terra satellite — launched in 2009 — circling the earth in
      a polar orbit at a height of 705 km. The instrument measures CO
      concentrations at different heights and also computes the total
      amount of the gas in a vertical column of air above the earth
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      Analysis of the satellite data showed a large peak in CO
      concentrations during January 19 and 20 — a week before the main
      earthquake event. On January 19, the total CO in the vertical
      column was also higher than usual. After the 26 January earthquake
      the concentration of the gas dropped.<br>
      <br>
      According to the scientists, CO gas is forced out of the earth due
      to the build up of stress prior to the earthquake "influencing the
      hydrological regime around the epicentre."<br>
      <br>
      Singh said an anomalous increase in land surface temperature a few
      days prior to Gujarat earthquake — as inferred from the data of
      NASA's other satellite MODIS — is also related to the CO emission.
      "The increase of column CO and concentrations of CO may have
      enhanced the land surface temperature," he said.<br>
      <br>
      "The anomalous changes in CO concentrations prior to the main
      earthquake event and enhancement of temperature of the earth
      surface observed from MODIS satellite data give an indication of
      coupling between land and atmosphere," the scientists report.
      Singh said observation by other researchers of a sudden increase
      in water vapour in the atmosphere and changes in the ionosphere a
      few days prior to the Gujarat earthquake all seem to be connected.<br>
      <br>
      According to the report, all these observations including the
      latest discovery of CO emission show the existence of a 'strong
      coupling' between land-atmosphere-ionosphere. "The integration of
      all these parameters in a seismically active region therefore
      looks a potential approach to understand earthquake processes and
      may provide reliable information about an impending earthquake,"
      the researchers conclude.<br>

      <br>
      NOAA AVHRR images have clearly shown anomalous changes in land
      surface temperature associated with earthquakes in the past two
      decades. Soon after the Gujarat earthquake of January 26, 2001, an
      anomalous increase in land surface temperature was inferred from
      MODIS satellite data a few days prior to the main earthquake
      event. The cause of such an anomalous change in surface
      temperature prior to the earthquake is attributed to many probable
      phenomena, but no definite cause has been identified. In the
      present study, changes of a complementary nature were found of
      land surface temperature associated with the emission of CO from
      the epicentral region. The observed changes on land and atmosphere
      associated with the Gujarat earthquake of 26 January, 2001, show
      the existence of strong coupling between land, atmosphere and
      ionosphere.<br>

      Technically the last earthquakes came two days after the 2-week
      trial period, however that timeline was meant for the window of
      making the forecasts. The Trial Period would not close until we
      tested the merit of the final prediction. Had it been made with 1
      minute to go and the earthquake struck 1 minute AFTER the trial
      ended, you would have an easy example of why the study must be
      done in this way.<br>

      “I don’t want to earn my living; I want to live.” ~ Oscar Wilde<br>
      <br>
      The species Homo sapiens — clearly our most-loved species, at the
      expense of nearly all others — has occupied Earth at a temperature
      somewhere between 2.2 and 3.2 C above baseline (i.e., relative to
      ~1750). We’ve also survived ice ages, which are characterized by a
      global-average temperature a few degrees below baseline.<br>
      <br>
      Our species has occupied this planet for about 200,000 years. Our
      human predecessors were here about 6 million years ago. As with
      every other species, ours requires habitat to persist. As is the
      case with non-human species, habitat for Homo sapiens has
      persisted at a global-average temperature within a narrow range,
      from about 12 C to about 17 C.<br>
      <br>
      The following calculations include only global dimming and the two
      self-reinforcing feedback loops for which estimates of heating are
      available. This analysis assumes moistening of the upper
      troposphere produces heating at a pace similar to methane. To my
      knowledge, no data, models, or forecasts are available to evaluate
      this assumption. As you’ll read, it’s a minor point.<br>
      <br>
      The remaining feedback loops remain a mystery in terms of their
      potential for warming the planet. But I can assure you we will
      continue to hear the phrase, “faster than expected.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Civilization pillow talk</b><br>
      <br>
      I’ll start with global dimming because industrial civilization
      cannot be maintained. Therefore, it will not be maintained. Even a
      child is able to understand this point … unless the child happens
      to exhibit behavior consistent with that of a privileged,
      Caucasian man living in the global north.<br>
      <br>
      Global dimming results from industrial activity, as indicated
      here. Earth will warm by 1 to 3 C degrees above today’s
      temperature within days or weeks after completion of the ongoing
      collapse of industrial civilization.<br>
      <br>
      Moistening of the upper troposphere adds 1 to 3 additional
      degrees. I describe this phenomenon as item 39 on this list.<br>
      <br>
      The monster, though, is atmospheric methane. A potent greenhouse
      gas, methane leaking emanating from the Arctic Ocean alone is
      likely to add between 5 and 11 degrees of warming within one or
      two decades. So said Paul Beckwith in November 2014 as he prepared
      to attend COP-20 in Lima, Peru. The paleo-climatic evidence
      supports this view. Please note that human extinction is likely to
      be triggered even if the exponential rise in atmospheric methane
      doesn’t matter, as explained here, but methane is a misbehaving
      bull in a fully stocked China shop.<br>
      <br>
      Currently, Earth is more than 1 C above its baseline temperature.
      The 1 C mark was the absolute upper Rubicon beyond which we could
      not cross, as pointed out by the United Nations Advisory Group on
      Greenhouse Gases in October 1990. According to David Spratt, 0.5 C
      was the significant threshold. Unfortunately, I doubt anybody
      suspected the rate of climate change was outstripping the adaptive
      response by 10,000 times back in October 1990, as we now know from
      research focused on vertebrates.<br>
      <br>
      Madly, as if poisoned by our own culture, we negotiate. The 1.5 C
      “target” produced by COP-21 in Paris was eclipsed a month after
      the ink dried on the vaunted agreement. Unlike us, nature does not
      negotiate. Rather, nature bats last.<br>
      <br>
      On, then, to the simple addition, rounding down in every case
      (i.e., taking a conservative approach):<br>
      <br>
      1. The most-rapid scenario starts with the current 1 C above
      baseline and adds about 3 C from loss of global dimming plus 1
      degree from moistening of the upper troposphere (to avoid counting
      the feedbacks twice), plus 11 C from Arctic methane, for a total
      of 16 C above the 1750 baseline by November 2024. That’ll be
      inconvenient, as it is much warmer than Earth’s global-average
      temperature at any time during at least the last 2 billion years
      (i.e., 2,000,000,000 years). The loss of global dimming is
      guaranteed by the temperature rise resulting from moistening of
      the upper troposphere or the rise in atmospheric methane.
      Civilization will not persist beyond 2 C above baseline, which
      translates to at least twice that temperature rise within the
      interior of large continents where grains are grown (thus
      sustaining civilization)<br>
      <br>
      2. At the slower end of the abrupt-climate-change spectrum is 1 C
      currently, plus 1 C from loss of global dimming, plus 1 degree
      from moistening of the upper troposphere, plus 5 C from Arctic
      methane, for a total of 8 C above the 1750 baseline by November
      2034. As above, the loss of global dimming is guaranteed by the
      temperature rise resulting from moistening of the upper
      troposphere or the rise in atmospheric methane.<br>
      <br>
      The latter scenario — the “slow” one — takes Earth to a planetary
      temperature well-suited for dinosaurs, were the transition to take
      hundreds of thousands of years. It is well beyond the temperature
      at which Earth has harbored anything resembling Homo sapiens, and
      it’s quite near the highest planetary temperature during the last
      2 billion years. The transition from here to 8 C above baseline
      will occur more rapidly than any previous known rise in
      global-average temperature.<br>
      <br>
      Even excluding a few dozen self-reinforcing feedback loops, is
      there any doubt either version of abrupt climate change will
      remove all habitat for our species in the very near future? If so,
      please share the attendant evidence.<br>
      <br>
      Oh, and I still don’t know your expiration date. Or mine. But I’m
      certain each of us will die, even those of us who are middle-aged,
      Caucasian men in the global north.<br>

      <big> </big><br>
      The Permian mass extinction of 250 million years ago wiped out 95%
      of life on land and sea and took 80,000 years from start to
      finish.<br>
      <br>
      The Dinosaur mass extinction of 60 million years ago took 33,000
      years to complete after the asteroid impact.<br>
      <br>
      Anthropogenic mass extinction will take up to 300 years, and is
      more likely go into runaway mode in a little over 30 years making
      it 100-1000 times faster than anything ever before.<br>
      The Runaway Mass Extinction Tipping Point Is Running Towards Us!<br>
      <br>
      Thousands of people die each year trying to get into Europe.<br>
      <br>
      When oil prices burp, stock markets shit themselves.<br>
      <br>
      66% of humans go without water each year.<br>
      <br>
      50% of our soil will be gone in 30 years.<br>
      <br>
      no soil + no water = no food.<br>
      <br>
      50% of species will go extinct in 40 years, maybe sooner.<br>
      <br>
      40% of earth’s green growth is eaten by humans and livestock.<br>
      <br>
      THE KICKER<br>
      <br>
      Runaway mass extinction cannot be stopped or reversed once
      started.<br>

            Renewable Energy</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><br>
      Many say we can have 100% renewable energy by 2050. This is
      factually incorrect.<br>
      <br>
      We can have 100% renewable electricity production by 2050.<br>
      <br>
      But electricity production is only 18% of total world energy
      demand.<br>
      <br>
      82% of total world energy demand is NOT electricity production.<br>
      <br>
      The other 82% of the world’s energy is used to extract minerals to
      make roads, cement, bricks, glass, steel and grow food so we can
      eat and sleep. Solar panels and wind turbines will not be making
      cement or steel anytime soon. Why? Do you really want to know?
      Here we go.<br>
      <br>
      TWED = Total World Energy Demand<br>
      18% of TWED is electrical grid generation.<br>
      82% of TWED is not electrical grid generation.<br>
      <br>
      In 20 years, solar &amp; wind energy is up from 1% to 3% of TWED.<br>
      <br>
      Solar &amp; wind power are projected to provide 6% of TWED by
      2030.<br>
      <br>
      When you hear stories about solar &amp; wind generating<br>
      50% of all humanity’s electrical power by 2050,<br>
      that’s really only 9% of TWED because<br>
      100% of electrical production is 18% of TWED.<br>
      <br>
      But, it takes 10X as much solar &amp; wind energy to close 1
      fossil fuel power plant simply because they don’t produce energy
      all the time.<br>
      <br>
      Reference Link: <b><br>
        <a
href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v2/n6/full/nclimate1451.html?WT.ec_id=NCLIMATE-201206">http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v2/n6/full/nclimate1451.html?WT.ec_id=NCLIMATE-201206</a></b><br>
      <br>
      That means it will take 10 X 18% of TWED to close all fossil power
      plants with intermittent power.<br>
      <br>
      Research says it will take 4 X 82% of TWED for a 100% renewable
      energy transition. But then again, whoever trusts research?<br>
      <br>
      10 X 18% + 4 X 82% = 100% Renewable TWED.<br>
      <br>
      CONCLUSION:<br>
      <br>
      We require 10X the fossil electrical grid energy we use now just
      to solve 18% of the emissions problem with solar &amp; wind power.
      This also means that even if we use 100% efficient Carbon Capture
      and Storage (CCS) for all the world’s electricity generation, we
      would still only prevent 18% of our emissions. 100% efficient CCS
      is very unlikely. Switching to electric vehicles would only double
      electrical demand while most of our roads are made out of
      distilled oil sludge.<br>
      <br>
      These figures do not include massive electrical storage and grid
      infrastructure solar &amp; wind require. Such infrastructure is
      hundreds of millions of tons of materials taking decades to
      construct, demanding even more energy and many trillions of
      dollars. With that kind of money in the offing, you can see why
      some wax over-enthused.<br>
      <br>
      Solar &amp; wind systems last 30 years meaning we will always have
      to replace them all over the world again 50% sooner than fossil
      power plants.<br>
      <br>
      Solar and wind power are an energy trap.<br>
      <br>
      It takes 1 ton of coal to make 6-12 solar panels.<br>
      Business As Usual = BAU<br>
      <br>
      In 15 years 40% of humanity will be short of water with BAU.<br>
      In 15 years 20% of humanity will be severely short of water.<br>
      <br>
      Right now, 1 billion people walk a mile every day for water.<br>
      <br>
      In 60 years humanity will not have enough soil to grow food says
      Scientific American. They call it, “The End of Human Agriculture.”
      Humanity’s soil is eroding and degrading away at 24 million acres
      per year.&nbsp; And, when they say 60 years they don’t mean
      everything is wonderful until the last day of the 59th year. We
      will feel the heat of those words in much less than 30 years. Soil
      loss rates will only increase with severe droughts, storms and
      low-land floods. Here’s what BAU really looks like.<br>
      <br>
      50% of humanity’s soil will be gone in 30 years.<br>
      <br>
      50% of humanity will lack water in 30 years.<br>
      <br>
      50% of humanity will go hungry in 30 years.<br>
      <br>
      A 100% TWED transition takes 50 years minimum. It is a vastly more
      difficult and complex goal than you are told.<br>

      We are losing earth’s soil and fresh water faster than we can
      effect 100% renewable TWED.<br>
      <br>
      In 25 years civilization will end says Lloyds of London and the
      British Foreign Office.<br>
      <br>
      In my opinion, in 30 years we won’t have enough fossil fuel for a
      100% renewable TWED transition.<br>
      <br>
      This is the most important fact I’ve learned:<br>
      <br>
      Renewable Energy is Unsustainable without massive energy demand
      destruction<br>
      <br>
      Humanity will destroy its soil and water faster than we can switch
      to renewable energy with BAU. We cannot sustain economic growth
      with renewable energy. Without massive political-economic change,
      civilization will collapse with 100% certainty. But, don’t worry,
      I like to fix things.<br>
      Animal Agriculture = AA<br>
      <br>
      Humans + Livestock = 97% of the weight of all land vertebrate
      biomass<br>
      Humans + Livestock = 80% of the cause of all land-air extinctions<br>
      Humans + Livestock = 50% of the use of all land surface area<br>
      Humans + Livestock = 40% consumption of all land plant growth *<br>
      * Net Primary Production.<br>
      <br>
      50% of the soy grown in South America is shipped over to China to
      feed their pigs. Rainforests and deep-rooted scrub are cleared to
      grow animals &amp; feed so that their required fresh water is in
      reality a sky river exported in boats to China and Europe leaving
      little moisture in the air to reach São Paulo. Since rainforest
      roots are so thick they don’t require very much, or even good,
      soil;&nbsp; this leaves rainforest soil so poor and thin that it
      degrades and erodes faster when exposed to the elements.<br>
      <br>
      The Himalayan mountains are heating 2X faster than the planet and
      many fear that China will run out of water in 15 years by 2030.<br>
      <br>
      50% of China’s rivers have vanished since 1980.<br>
      60% of China’s groundwater is too poisoned to touch.<br>
      50% of China’s cropland is too poisoned to safely grow food.<br>
      <br>
      Animal Agriculture will destroy our soil and water long before we
      can effect 100% intermittent TWED transition with BAU.<br>
      <br>
      BAU means 7 billion people will not stop eating meat and wasting
      food without major $$$ incentive. Meaning a steadily rising carbon
      tax on meat. Just saying that can get you killed in some places.<br>
      <br>
      Without using James Hansen’s 100% private tax dividends to carbon
      tax meat consumption out of the market earth will die. 100%
      private tax dividends means 100% for you, 0% for government.<br>
      <br>
      100% for you,<br>
      0% for gov.<br>
      <br>
      The funny thing is that meat and fire saved our ancestors from
      extinction and now meat and fire will cause mass extinction of all
      the life we love on earth. Survival is not an optional menu item
      as is eating meat. We have to act now, not 5 years from now, or
      forever be not remembered as the least greatest generation because
      there’ll be no one left to remember us.<br>
      <br>
      Michael Mann says we will lock-in a 2 degree temperature rise in 3
      years for 2036 with BAU. Ocean fish will be gone in less than 25
      years simply because of the BAU of meat consumption. The BAU of
      fishing kills everything in its path producing lots of waste kill.
      We are stealing all the Antarctic Ocean’s krill just to sell as a
      health supplement. You can learn a lot about fishing by watching
      “Cowspiracy” on Netflix.<br>
      <br>
      We cannot let governments get control of carbon markets like how
      Sanders, Klein and McKibben want government to get 40% of your
      carbon tax dividend money. Naomi Klein and Bill McKibben are
      funded by the Rockefellers. Klein’s latest video about herself was
      funded by the oil-invested Ford Foundation. This is 100% in direct
      opposition to James Hansen’s tax dividend plan and immoral. Hansen
      said that governments should get 0% of that money, not 40%.&nbsp;
      I strongly believe your carbon dividends should be in a new
      open-source world e-currency directly deposited to your phone to
      be phased in over 10 years. But, I’m kinda simple that way.<br>
      <br>
      Google: Rockefellers fund Bill McKibben. Believe me, the
      Rockefellers don’t fund 350.org out of the kindness of their
      hearts. To learn why they would do such a thing, you can watch the
      educational video at the bottom of this page.<br>

      James Hansen repeated at COP21 that his 100% private carbon tax
      dividends would unite Democrats and Republicans because government
      would be 100% excluded. Socialists like Sanders, Klein and
      McKibben want government to control 40% of that money. They are
      divisive and Republicans will never accept their revolutionary
      rhetoric. We don’t have time for this endless fighting. Forget the
      Socialist vs. Capitalist mentality. We barely even have time to
      unite, and nothing unites like money. Environmentalism in the 21st
      century is about a revolving door of money and power for elite
      socialists and capitalists. Let’s give everyone a chance to put
      some skin in the game.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Endgame -- 20 Premises</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <b>Premise One:</b> Civilization is not and can never be
      sustainable. This is especially true for industrial civilization.<br>
      <br>
      Premise Two: Traditional communities do not often voluntarily give
      up or sell the resources on which their communities are based
      until their communities have been destroyed. They also do not
      willingly allow their landbases to be damaged so that other
      resources—gold, oil, and so on—can be extracted. It follows that
      those who want the resources will do what they can to destroy
      traditional communities.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Premise Three:</b> Our way of living—industrial civilization—is
      based on, requires, and would collapse very quickly without
      persistent and widespread violence.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Premise Four: </b>Civilization is based on a clearly defined
      and widely accepted yet often unarticulated hierarchy. Violence
      done by those higher on the hierarchy to those lower is nearly
      always invisible, that is, unnoticed. When it is noticed, it is
      fully rationalized. Violence done by those lower on the hierarchy
      to those higher is unthinkable, and when it does occur is regarded
      with shock, horror, and the fetishization of the victims.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Premise Five:</b> The property of those higher on the hierarchy
      is more valuable than the lives of those below. It is acceptable
      for those above to increase the amount of property they control—in
      everyday language, to make money—by destroying or taking the lives
      of those below. This is called production. If those below damage
      the property of those above, those above may kill or otherwise
      destroy the lives of those below. This is called justice.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Premise Six:</b> Civilization is not redeemable. This culture
      will not undergo any sort of voluntary transformation to a sane
      and sustainable way of living. If we do not put a halt to it,
      civilization will continue to immiserate the vast majority of
      humans and to degrade the planet until it (civilization, and
      probably the planet) collapses. The effects of this degradation
      will continue to harm humans and nonhumans for a very long time.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Premise Seven:</b> The longer we wait for civilization to
      crash—or the longer we wait before we ourselves bring it down—the
      messier will be the crash, and the worse things will be for those
      humans and nonhumans who live during it, and for those who come
      after.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Premise Eight: </b>The needs of the natural world are more
      important than the needs of the economic system.<br>
      <br>
      Another way to put premise Eight: Any economic or social system
      that does not benefit the natural communities on which it is based
      is unsustainable, immoral, and stupid. Sustainability, morality,
      and intelligence (as well as justice) requires the dismantling of
      any such economic or social system, or at the very least
      disallowing it from damaging your landbase.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Premise Nine:</b> Although there will clearly some day be far
      fewer humans than there are at present, there are many ways this
      reduction in population could occur (or be achieved, depending on
      the passivity or activity with which we choose to approach this
      transformation). Some of these ways would be characterized by
      extreme violence and privation: nuclear armageddon, for example,
      would reduce both population and consumption, yet do so
      horrifically; the same would be true for a continuation of
      overshoot, followed by crash. Other ways could be characterized by
      less violence. Given the current levels of violence by this
      culture against both humans and the natural world, however, it’s
      not possible to speak of reductions in population and consumption
      that do not involve violence and privation, not because the
      reductions themselves would necessarily involve violence, but
      because violence and privation have become the default. Yet some
      ways of reducing population and consumption, while still violent,
      would consist of decreasing the current levels of violence
      required, and caused by, the (often forced) movement of resources
      from the poor to the rich, and would of course be marked by a
      reduction in current violence against the natural world.
      Personally and collectively we may be able to both reduce the
      amount and soften the character of violence that occurs during
      this ongoing and perhaps longterm shift. Or we may not. But this
      much is certain: if we do not approach it actively—if we do not
      talk about our predicament and what we are going to do about
      it—the violence will almost undoubtedly be far more severe, the
      privation more extreme.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Premise Ten:</b> The culture as a whole and most of its members
      are insane. The culture is driven by a death urge, an urge to
      destroy life.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Premise Eleven: </b>From the beginning, this
      culture—civilization—has been a culture of occupation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Premise Twelve: </b>There are no rich people in the world, and
      there are no poor people. There are just people. The rich may have
      lots of pieces of green paper that many pretend are worth
      something—or their presumed riches may be even more abstract:
      numbers on hard drives at banks—and the poor may not. These “rich”
      claim they own land, and the “poor” are often denied the right to
      make that same claim. A primary purpose of the police is to
      enforce the delusions of those with lots of pieces of green paper.
      Those without the green papers generally buy into these delusions
      almost as quickly and completely as those with. These delusions
      carry with them extreme consequences in the real world.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Premise Thirteen:</b> Those in power rule by force, and the
      sooner we break ourselves of llusions to the contrary, the sooner
      we can at least begin to make reasonable decisions about whether,
      when, and how we are going to resist.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Premise Fourteen:</b> From birth on—and probably from
      conception, but I’m not sure how I’d make the case—we are
      individually and collectively enculturated to hate life, hate the
      natural world, hate the wild, hate wild animals, hate women, hate
      children, hate our bodies, hate and fear our emotions, hate
      ourselves. If we did not hate the world, we could not allow it to
      be destroyed before our eyes. If we did not hate ourselves, we
      could not allow our homes—and our bodies—to be poisoned.<br>

      <b>Premise Sixteen:</b> The material world is primary. This does

      means also that real world actions have real world consequences.
      It means we cannot rely on Jesus, Santa Claus, the Great Mother,
      or even the Easter Bunny to get us out of this mess. It means this
      mess really is a mess, and not just the movement of God’s
      eyebrows. It means we have to face this mess ourselves. It means
      that for the time we are here on Earth—whether or not we end up
      somewhere else after we die, and whether we are condemned or
      privileged to live here—the Earth is the point. It is primary. It
      is our home. It is everything. It is silly to think or act or be

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Active oxygen species or free radicals are considered to cause
      extensive oxidative damage to biological macromolecules, which
      brings about a variety of diseases as well as aging. The ideal
      scavenger for active oxygen should be 'active hydrogen'. 'Active
      hydrogen' can be produced in reduced water near the cathode during
      electrolysis of water. Reduced water exhibits high pH, low
      dissolved oxygen (DO), extremely high dissolved molecular hydrogen
      (DH), and extremely negative redox potential (RP) values. Strongly
      electrolyzed-reduced water, as well as ascorbic acid, (+)-catechin
      and tannic acid, completely scavenged O.-2 produced by the
      hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase (HX-XOD) system in sodium phosphate
      buffer (pH 7.0). The superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity of
      reduced water is stable at 4 degrees C for over a month and was
      not lost even after neutralization, repeated freezing and melting,
      deflation with sonication, vigorous mixing, boiling, repeated
      filtration, or closed autoclaving, but was lost by opened
      autoclaving or by closed autoclaving in the presence of tungsten
      trioxide which efficiently adsorbs active atomic hydrogen. Water
      bubbled with hydrogen gas exhibited low DO, extremely high DH and
      extremely low RP values, as does reduced water, but it has no
      SOD-like activity. These results suggest that the SOD-like
      activity of reduced water is not due to the dissolved molecular
      hydrogen but due to the dissolved atomic hydrogen (active
      hydrogen). Although SOD accumulated H2O2 when added to the HX-XOD
      system, reduced water decreased the amount of H2O2 produced by
      XOD. Reduced water, as well as catalase and ascorbic acid, could
      directly scavenge H2O2. Reduce water suppresses single-strand
      breakage of DNA b active oxygen species produced by the
      Cu(II)-catalyzed oxidation of ascorbic acid in a dose-dependent
      manner, suggesting that reduced water can scavenge not only O2.-
      and H2O2, but also 1O2 and .OH.<br>

      Nagalase prevents vitamin D from being produced in the body.<br>
      <br>
      Not long ago, Neon Nettle reported on the epidemic of doctors
      being murdered, most of which were in Florida, U.S. The scientists
      all shared a common trait, they had all discovered that nagalase
      enzyme protein was being added to vaccines which were then
      administrated to humans.<br>
      <br>
      Nagalese is what prevents vitamin D from being produced in the
      body, which is the body’s main defence to naturally kill cancer
      cells.<br>
      <br>
      According to Thebigriddle.com: Nagalase is a protein that’s also
      created by all cancer cells. This protein is also found in very
      high concentrations in autistic children. And they’re PUTTING it
      in our vaccines!!<br>
      <br>
      This prevents the body from utilizing the Vitamin D necessary to
      fight cancer and prevent autism. Nagalese disables the immune
      system. It’s also known to cause Type 2 Diabetes. So
      basically…they weren’t killing these doctors because they had
      found the cure to cancer or were successfully treating
      autism…they’re killing them because these Dr’s had been
      researching and had the evidence that the vaccines they’re
      injecting our precious children with are CAUSING our current
      cancer and autism crisis!!<br>
      <br>
      And that it’s obviously being done knowingly and on purpose! The
      Dr’s they killed in FL had been collaborating and were getting
      ready to go public with the information…<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Eternal 5D data storage could record
            the history of humankind</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Scientists at the University of Southampton have made a major step
      forward in the development of digital data storage that is capable
      of surviving for billions of years.<br>
      <br>
      Using nanostructured glass, scientists from the University’s
      Optoelectronics Research Centre (ORC) have developed the recording
      and retrieval processes of five dimensional (5D) digital data by
      femtosecond laser writing.<br>
      <br>
      The storage allows unprecedented properties including 360 TB/disc
      data capacity, thermal stability up to 1,000°C and virtually
      unlimited lifetime at room temperature (13.8 billion years at
      190°C ) opening a new era of eternal data archiving. As a very
      stable and safe form of portable memory, the technology could be
      highly useful for organisations with big archives, such as
      national archives, museums and libraries, to preserve their
      information and records.<br>
      <br>
      The technology was first experimentally demonstrated in 2013 when
      a 300 kb digital copy of a text file was successfully recorded in
      5D.<br>
      <br>
      Now, major documents from human history such as Universal
      Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), Newton’s Opticks, Magna Carta
      and Kings James Bible, have been saved as digital copies that
      could survive the human race. A copy of the UDHR encoded to 5D
      data storage was recently presented to UNESCO by the ORC at the
      International Year of Light (IYL) closing ceremony in Mexico.<br>
      <br>
      The documents were recorded using ultrafast laser, producing
      extremely short and intense pulses of light. The file is written
      in three layers of nanostructured dots separated by five
      micrometres (one millionth of a metre).<br>
      <br>
      The self-assembled nanostructures change the way light travels
      through glass, modifying polarisation of light that can then be
      read by combination of optical microscope and a polariser, similar
      to that found in Polaroid sunglasses.<br>
      <br>
      Coined as the ‘Superman memory crystal’, as the glass memory has
      been compared to the “memory crystals” used in the Superman films,
      the data is recorded via self-assembled nanostructures created in
      fused quartz. The information encoding is realised in five
      dimensions: the size and orientation in addition to the three
      dimensional position of these nanostructures.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Peter Kazansky, from the ORC, says: “It is thrilling to
      think that we have created the technology to preserve documents
      and information and store it in space for future generations. This
      technology can secure the last evidence of our civilisation: all
      we’ve learnt will not be forgotten.”<br>

      "IX L ARCANE. Recharging nervous energy. A way used in ancient
      Egypt for strengthening of currents of energy within the body. It
      was shown in the figures, using the second Master Arcane exercise.
      Two rods clasped in the hands of standing figures, were the grips
      of tremendous power, akin to electricity (secondary electricity),
      which when the grips were held in the hand released this energy
      into the body, to be stored in unipolar ganglias, and spinal
      fluid, raising the potential of energy 100%, and lasting for a day
      and a night, 24 hours.<br>
      <br>
      "The rods were two in number and of different compositions. One
      generally to be used in the right, another in the left hand. One
      having the power of the Sun, another the power of the Moon.<br>
      <br>
      'The Sun rod of Power is composed of hard coal (carbon) specially
      hardened, in which the structure of the molecules is changed the
      way the molecules of iron are changed when converting iron into
      magness. (To convert iron into magness, the structure of iron
      moecules is changed by re-crystallization process, hardening, then
      it will retain the magnetism.) The process of hardening is heating
      to high temperature and then instantly cooling by submerging in
      water. (The rods of bard coal prepared for the electric arc lamps
      are excellent as Sun rods of Power.)<br>
      <br>
      The hardened rod of coal can be inserted in a copper tube, with
      both ends open or closed (Length of rod six inches, diameter one
      inch or according to the grip of the band.)<br>
      <br>
      "The Moon rod of Power is composed of hard lode stone, or pressed
      lode stone, (it may also be a rod of magnetized hard iron or steel
      magness. The Moon rod of Power can be inserted in a zinc or tin
      tube with both ends open or closed. (Length and diameter same as
      Sun rod.) The Moon grip or rod works as a kind of catalyst, to
      bring the Sun grip or rod into more powerful action.<br>
      <br>
      The rods of power were known even long long ago, and the secret of
      their making knew only a few initiated.<br>
      <br>
      The mysterious metal (bronze) auricalcum has tremendous power, and
      is composed of five metals, each having a definite color, white,
      black, red, blue and yellow. It is radioactive, and it hides the
      mystery of immaculate conception. Proportion of the metals is
      even. Then comes electron, composed of gold and silver, (40% and
      60% silver), then a combination of silver 75% and zinc 25%;
      combination of copper and zinc, and also copper and tin. (Many
      combinations of bronze you can make figuring out planets and their
      relations and properties. Sun, gold; Moon, silver; Saturn, lead;
      Jupiter, tin; Mars, iron; Venus, copper; Mercury, mercury. Also
      minerals, coal, lode-stone, beryl, amber, tourmaline, rock crystal
      , hematite, etc. (Here text contains drawing of two figures rods,
      one figure is standing with a rod in each hand, one is sitting in
      the Egyptian meditation position, on a chair, back erect, feet
      flat on floor, hands on knees, with rods on knees. MM) The
      Egyptian master system postures for recharging the nervous energy,
      one should be relaxed and following the direction of the Sun.
      Objects shaped in different symbolic forms are also used
      throughout the world, like Babylonian maies (iron with silver
      inlay, with horned human head and head of the bull). In Tibet is
      used dorgee, etc."<br>

      A mechanical device including two concentric space frame
      structures is used to enhance plant growth. Essentially identical
      in shape but with the inner space frame smaller than the outer by
      a 4:5 relationship the space frame structures independently rotate
      about a common axes line. Each space frame consists of a right
      square pyramid of rods with its apex pointing upward and a second
      similar pyramid directly below it by a distance approximately two
      and one half times the length of each rod comprising the pyramid.
      The second, lower pyramid however has its apex pointing downward
      and is turned 45-degrees about a line connecting the two apex
      points. Eight additional rods complete each space frame. They
      each, respectively connect a corner of the upper pyramid base to a
      corner of the lower pyramid base in a manner that is symmetric.<br>

      <b>FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] These teachings involve equipment and methods for
      horticultural and agricultural productivity enhancement.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] The field of cultivating plants has spurred technological
      advances from the plow, to artificial irrigation, to hybridization
      and now to advances in the application of DNA research. In the
      area of subtle influences that alter a plants environment, some
      have experimented with “talking to their plants” and playing
      Mozart for them. While neither of those techniques has found
      widespread use, there is a growing body of serious research
      regarding the effects of sound and vibrations on plant growth.
      Like all living organisms, plants have highly complex sensory
      networks for monitoring their surroundings, and are known to
      modify their growth and development to suit their environment. For
      example, plants exposed to a variety of mechanical perturbations,
      such as wind or touch, undergo physiological and developmental
      changes that enhance resistance to subsequent mechanical stress.
      Developmental changes in response to mechano-stimulation are
      collectively known as thigmomorphogenesis.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The short paper “Biochemical and physiological changes in
      plants as a result of different sonic exposures” by Yu-Chuan Qin,
      Won-Chu Lee, Young-Cheol Choi and Tae-Wan Kim that was published
      in Elsevier's Ultrasonics journal (41 (2003) 407-41) investigates
      the biochemical mechanisms that might be involved in some of these
      phenomena. Chinese cabbage and cucumbers at two growth stages were
      the researchers' subjects. For each plant type three groups were
      constituted. Besides a control group that was not subject to any
      artificial acoustic treatment, one group was exposed to steady
      ultrasonic (US) waves of 20 k Hz, while the other was exposed to
      so-called “green music” (GM) consisting of a combination of
      classical music and natural sounds including bird songs. Both O2
      intake and polyamines content were measured. In brief, they found
      Chinese cabbage reacting more positively to the GM and the
      cucumbers to the US. However, for each quantity measured, either
      one or the other or both of the sonically exposed plants had
      greater readings than those of the control plants. That paper's
      charts of the polyamines content measurements are reproduced as
      FIGS. 1A and 1B. The caption of the Chinese cabbage growth graph
      in that paper is:<br>
      <br>
      “Polyamine content (nmol/gFW) of Chinese cabbage seedlings: (A) 15
      d and (B) mature plant (70 d) as a result of different acoustic
      exposures. Error bars represent the standard deviations of the
      means of polyamine contents.” And the caption in that paper of the
      cucumber data is: “Polyamine content (nmol/gFW) of cucumber
      seedlings: (A) 15 d and (B) mature plant (70 d) as a result of
      different acoustic treatments. Error bars represent the standard
      deviations of the means of polyamine contents.”<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Studies have also focused on specific frequencies' effects,
      for example “Plant gene responses to frequency-specific sound
      signals”, Mi-Jeong Jeong, Chang-Ki Shim, Jin-Ohk Lee, Hawk-Bin
      Kwon, Yang-Han Kim, Seong-Kon Lee, Myeong-Ok Byun and Soo-Chul
      Park. (Mol Breeding (2008) 21:217-226) published Springer's
      Molecular Breeding journal. They demonstrated sound affecting
      plant growth through mRNA expression analyses.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Others have looked at the issue of the effect of vibration
      on plant growth. One relevant article is: “Growth Promotion by
      Vibration at 50 Hz in Rice and Cucumber Seedlings”, Hideyuki
      Takahashi, Hiroshi Suge and Tadashi Kato. (Plant CellPhysiol.
      32(5): 729-732 (1991)). They looked at the effect of 50 Hz
      vibration and mention that a motivation of their study was the
      issue that motors and other mechanical apparatus in a green house
      might produce sounds with unintended and unexpected effects on
      plants.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] FIG. 3 shows a reproduction of that paper's “FIG. 1.” Its
      caption is:<br>
      <br>
      “Germination of rice and cucumber seeds as affected by vibration
      at 50 Hz Data is shown as the percentage of germinated seeds in a
      time-course study. Top (A), rice seeds under submerged conditions;
      middle (B), rice seeds on filter paper; bottom C), cucumber seeds
      on filter paper. Open (O) and closed (�) circles indicate the
      control and the vibrated seeds, respectively. One hundred seeds
      were used for each treatment.”<br>
      <br>
      [0010] U.S. Pat. No. 7,600,343 dated Oct. 13, 2009 by Reiner
      Schultheiss, et al, discusses the effect of shock waves on plant
      growth.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] However, previous attempts to improve plant growth along
      the lines of the research above have not made it into routine,
      large-scale, commercial use. Systems and methods are needed which
      can improve plant growth in ways compatible with our current
      environmental imperatives that are also inexpensive to deploy and
      maintain. Preferably, solutions would avoid chemical fertilizers
      and chemical pesticides and be simple to deploy in both the
      developed world and the developing world.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      [0012] System and methods consistent with these teachings involve
      two counter-rotating geometric space frame structures that may be
      thought of as concentric. When energized and operated proximate to
      growing plants, the growth rate of those plants can be enhanced.
      Experimental results have shown its operation to be associated
      with effective increase in plant growth.<br>

      <br>
      Korean researchers claim to have discovered two sound-sensitive
      genes in rice plants.<br>
      <br>
      Mi-Jeong Jeong and colleagues from the National Institute of
      Agricultural Biotechnology in Suwon, South Korea, made the
      discovery by exposing plants to noise and studying how this
      affected gene activity. <br>
      <br>
      Initially they tried playing 14 samples of classical music to
      their rice, including Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, but saw no
      response. <br>
      <br>
      Next they tried playing sounds of specific frequencies and began
      to see a change.&nbsp; At 125 Hz and 250 Hz the activity of two
      genes, rbcS and Ald, went up. But when sounds at at 50 Hz were
      played, the gene activity went down. <br>
      <br>
      To find out whether other genes could be rendered sound-sensitive,
      the team linked the genetic elements that control the Ald gene to
      a 'reporter' gene inserted into the rice called GUS
      (beta-glucuronidase).&nbsp; They found that sounds could then also
      manipulate the levels of GUS.<br>
      <br>
      This suggests that it might be possible to use sound instead of
      chemicals to control different genetic processes in plants, such
      as switching on resistance genes to help them fight off pests or
      ripen more rapidly. <br>
      <br>
      Not all scientists are convinced though; some say that the new
      research, which is published in the journal Molecular Breeding,
      makes use of old techniques and lacks sufficient numbers to make
      the data credible. Sounds like sour grapes, although it does
      suggest that it's not just cereals like wheat and barley that have
      'ears'...<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We identified a set of sound-responsive genes in plants using a
      sound-treated subtractive library and demonstrated sound
      regulation through mRNA expression analyses. Under both light and
      dark conditions, sound up-regulated expression of rbcS and ald.
      These are also light-responsive genes and these results suggest
      that sound could represent an alternative to light as a gene
      regulator. Ald mRNA expression increased significantly with
      treatment at 125 and 250Hz, whereas levels decreased significantly
      with treatment at 50Hz, indicating a frequency-specific response.
      To investigate whether the ald promoter responds to sound, we
      generated transgenic rice plants harboring a chimeric gene
      comprising a fusion of the ald promoter and GUS reporter. In three
      independent transgenic lines treated with 50 or 250Hz for 4h, GUS
      mRNA expression was up-regulated at 250Hz, but down-regulated at
      50Hz. Thus, the sound-responsive mRNA expression pattern observed
      for the ald promoter correlated closely with that of ald,
      suggesting that the 1,506bp ald promoter is sound-responsive.
      Therefore, we propose that in transgenic plants, specific
      frequencies of sound treatment could be used to regulate the
      expression of any gene fused to the ald promoter.<br>

      </b><b>ABSTRACT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Regulation of tomato fruit ripening may help extend fruit shelf
      life and prevent losses due to spoilage. Here, tomato fruit were
      investigated whether sound treatment could delay their ripening.
      Harvested fruit were treated with low-frequency sound waves (1.
      kHz) for 6. h, and then monitored various characteristics of the
      fruit over 14-days at 23. ±. 1. °C. Seven days after the
      treatment, 85% of the treated fruit were green, versus fewer than
      50% of the non-treated fruit. Most of the tomato fruit had
      transitioned to the red ripening stage by 14 days after treatment.
      Ethylene production and respiration rate were lower in the
      sound-treated than non-treated tomatoes. Furthermore, changes in
      surface color and flesh firmness were delayed in the treated
      fruit. To investigate how sound wave treatment effects on fruit
      ripening, the expression of ethylene-related genes was analyzed by
      quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis. The expression level of
      several ethylene biosynthetic (ACS2, ACS4, ACO1, E4 and E8) and
      ripening-regulated (. RIN, TAGL1, HB-1, NOR, CNR) genes was
      influenced by sound wave treatment. These results indicated that
      sound wave treatment delays tomato fruit ripening by altering the
      expression of important genes in the ethylene biosynthesis and
      ethylene signaling pathways.<br>

      “Measuring Effects of Music, Noise, and Healing Energy Using a
      Seed Germination Bioassay. “ The objective of this 2004 study was
      to measure biologic effects of music, noise, and healing energy
      without human preferences or placebo effects using seed
      germination as an objective biomarker. A series of five
      experiments were performed utilizing okra and zucchini seeds
      germinated in acoustically shielded, thermally insulated, dark,
      humid growth chambers. Conditions compared were an untreated
      control, musical sound, pink noise, and healing energy. Healing
      energy was administered for 15-20 minutes every 12 hours with the
      intention that the treated seeds would germinate faster than the
      untreated seeds. The objective marker was the number of seeds
      sprouted out of groups of 25 seeds counted at 12-hour intervals
      over a 72-hour growing period. Temperature and relative humidity
      were monitored every 15 minutes inside the seed germination
      containers. A total of 14 trials were run testing a total of 4600
      seeds.<br>

      Results: Musical sound had a highly statistically significant
      effect on the number of seeds sprouted compared to the untreated
      control over all five experiments for the main condition and over
      time. This effect was independent of temperature, seed type,
      position in room, specific petri dish, and person doing the
      scoring. Musical sound had a significant effect compared to noise
      and an untreated control as a function of time while there was no
      significant difference between seeds exposed to noise and an
      untreated control. Healing energy also had a significant effect
      compared to an untreated control and over time with a magnitude of
      effect comparable to that of musical sound. Conclusion: This study
      suggests that sound vibrations (music and noise) as well as
      biofields (bioelectromagnetic and healing intention) both directly
      affect living biologic systems, and that a seed germination
      bioassay has the sensitivity to enable detection of effects caused
      by various applied energetic conditions.67<br>

      Inventor(s): SCHULTHEISS REINER, et al.<br>
      <br>
      The method of stimulating a plant substance is disclosed. The
      method has the steps of activating a pressure pulse or an acoustic
      shock wave generator or source to emit pressure pulse or acoustic
      shock waves; and subjecting the plant substance to the pressure
      pulse or acoustic shock waves stimulating said plant substance
      wherein the substance is positioned within a path of the emitted
      shock waves. In one embodiment the emitted pressure pulse or shock
      waves are divergent or near planar. In another embodiment the
      emitted shock waves are convergent having a geometric focal volume
      of point at a distance of at least X from the source, the method
      further comprising positioning the substance at a distance less
      than the distance X from the source. The substance is a plant
      tissue having cells. The tissue can be a seed, zygotic embryo or
      somatic embryogenic culture of somatic embryos of plants.; The
      plant may be a vegetable, tree, shrub or tuber. The tissue may be
      a part of the root system, a part of the stem system or a part of
      the leaf system. The method of stimulating includes activating the
      cells within the treated tissue thereby releasing growth factor
      proteins or other chemical compositions promoting growth and
      accelerating germination or plant growth.<br>

      The image above looks like concept art for a new dystopian sci-fi

      past human drones, tethered to machines and blinded to reality by
      blinking plastic masks. Golden light shines down on the man as he
      strides past his subjects, cast in gloom, toward a stage where he
      will accept their adulation. Later that night, he will pore across
      his vast network and read their praise, heaped upon him in

      <div align="center"><big><b>Proven one-step process to convert CO2
            and water directly into liquid hydrocarbon fuel</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A team of University of Texas at Arlington chemists and engineers
      have proven that concentrated light, heat and high pressures can
      drive the one-step conversion of carbon dioxide and water directly
      into useable liquid hydrocarbon fuels.<br>
      <br>
      This simple and inexpensive new sustainable fuels technology could
      potentially help limit global warming by removing carbon dioxide
      from the atmosphere to make fuel. The process also reverts oxygen
      back into the system as a byproduct of the reaction, with a clear
      positive environmental impact, researchers said.<br>
      <br>
      "Our process also has an important advantage over battery or
      gaseous-hydrogen powered vehicle technologies as many of the
      hydrocarbon products from our reaction are exactly what we use in
      cars, trucks and planes, so there would be no need to change the
      current fuel distribution system," said Frederick MacDonnell, UTA
      interim chair of chemistry and biochemistry and co-principal
      investigator of the project.<br>
      <br>
      In an article published today in the Proceedings of the National
      Academy of Sciences titled "Solar photothermochemical alkane
      reverse combustion," the researchers demonstrate that the one-step
      conversion of carbon dioxide and water into liquid hydrocarbons
      and oxygen can be achieved in a photothermochemical flow reactor
      operating at 180 to 200 C and pressures up to 6 atmospheres.<br>
      <br>
      "We are the first to use both light and heat to synthesize liquid
      hydrocarbons in a single stage reactor from carbon dioxide and
      water," said Brian Dennis, UTA professor of mechanical and
      aerospace engineering and co-principal investigator of the
      project.<br>
      <br>
      "Concentrated light drives the photochemical reaction, which
      generates high-energy intermediates and heat to drive
      thermochemical carbon-chain-forming reactions, thus producing
      hydrocarbons in a single-step process."<br>
      <br>
      Duane Dimos, UTA vice president for research commended the
      researchers on their success.<br>
      <br>
      "Discovering a one-step process to generate renewable hydrocarbon
      fuels from carbon dioxide and water is a huge achievement," Dimos
      said. "This work strengthens UTA's reputation as a leading
      research institution in the area of Global Environmental Impact,
      as laid out in our Strategic Plan 2020."<br>
      <br>
      The hybrid photochemical and thermochemical catalyst used for the
      experiment was based on titanium dioxide, a white powder that
      cannot absorb the entire visible light spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      "Our next step is to develop a photo-catalyst better matched to
      the solar spectrum," MacDonnell said. "Then we could more
      effectively use the entire spectrum of incident light to work
      towards the overall goal of a sustainable solar liquid fuel."<br>
      <br>
      The authors envision using parabolic mirrors to concentrate
      sunlight on the catalyst bed, providing both heat and
      photo-excitation for the reaction. Excess heat could even be used
      to drive related operations for a solar fuels facility, including
      product separations and water purification.<br>
      <br>
      The research was supported by grants from the National Science
      Foundation and the Robert A. Welch Foundation. Wilaiwan Chanmanee,
      postdoctoral research associate in mechanical and aerospace
      engineering, and Mohammad Fakrul Islam, graduate research
      assistant and Ph.D. candidate in the department of Chemistry and
      Biochemistry at UTA, also participated in the project.<br>
      <br>
      MacDonnell and Dennis have received more than $2.6 million in
      grants and corporate funding for sustainable energy projects over
      the last four years.<br>
      <br>
      MacDonnell and Dennis' investigations also are focused on
      converting natural gas for use as high-grade diesel and jet fuel.
      The researchers developed the gas-to-liquid technology in
      collaboration with an industrial partner in UTA's Center for
      Renewable Energy and Science Technology, or CREST, lab, and are
      now working to commercialize the process.<br>
      <br>
      MacDonnell also has worked on developing new photocatalysts for
      hydrogen generation, with the goal of creating an artificial
      photosynthetic system which uses solar energy to split water
      molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen could then be
      used as a clean fuel.<br>

      </b><b>Significance</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      An efficient solar process for the one-step conversion of CO2 and
      H2O to C5+ liquid hydrocarbons and O2 would revolutionize how
      solar fuel replacements for gasoline, jet, and diesel solar fuels
      could be produced and could lead to a carbon-neutral fuel cycle.
      We demonstrate that this reaction is possible in a single-step
      process by operating the photocatalytic reaction at elevated
      temperatures and pressures. The process uses cheap and
      earth-abundant catalytic materials, and the unusual operating
      conditions expand the range of materials that can be developed as
      photocatalysts. Whereas the efficiency of the current system is
      not commercially viable, it is far from optimized and it opens a
      promising new path by which such solar processes may be realized.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A one-step, gas-phase photothermocatalytic process for the
      synthesis of hydrocarbons, including liquid alkanes, aromatics,
      and oxygenates, with carbon numbers (Cn) up to C13, from CO2 and
      water is demonstrated in a flow photoreactor operating at elevated
      temperatures (180–200 °C) and pressures (1–6 bar) using a 5%
      cobalt on TiO2 catalyst and under UV irradiation. A parametric
      study of temperature, pressure, and partial pressure ratio
      revealed that temperatures in excess of 160 °C are needed to
      obtain the higher Cn products in quantity and that the product
      distribution shifts toward higher Cn products with increasing
      pressure. In the best run so far, over 13% by mass of the products
      were C5+ hydrocarbons and some of these, i.e., octane, are drop-in
      replacements for existing liquid hydrocarbons fuels. Dioxygen was
      detected in yields ranging between 64% and 150%. In principle,
      this tandem photochemical–thermochemical process, fitted with a
      photocatalyst better matched to the solar spectrum, could provide
      a cheap and direct method to produce liquid hydrocarbons from CO2
      and water via a solar process which uses concentrated sunlight for
      both photochemical excitation to generate high-energy
      intermediates and heat to drive important thermochemical
      carbon-chain-forming reactions.<br>

      <big> Dear Sir,</big><br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The wrong direction was given two centuries ago to the electrical
      current.<br>
      <br>
      A similar error occurred with the magnetic field of electrons
      presently postulated with a dipole topology within the standard
      model, although there is no experimental evidence.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The electron magnetic field has in fact the inverse topology: it
      has not a dipole structure but a rotational structure.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      As a consequence, the motion of electron can not be the cause of
      magnetic fields.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The experiment proposed to verify this alternative view of
      electron magnetic field topology is presented in a new video. The
      video may be seen from the producer home page:<br>

      <big> </big><br>
      ...This 'information-influencing' is part of so-called 'strategic
      communication.' Journalist Robert Parry wrote:<br>
      <br>
      "In this age of pervasive media, the primary method of social
      control is through the creation of narratives delivered to the
      public through newspapers, TV, radio, computers, cell phones and
      any other gadget that can convey information. This reality has
      given rise to an obsession among the power elite to control as
      much of this messaging as possible.<br>
      <br>
      So, regarding U.S. relations toward the world, we see the State
      Department, the White House, Pentagon, NATO and other agencies
      pushing various narratives to sell the American people and other
      populations on how they should view U.S. policies, rivals and
      allies. The current hot phrase for this practice is "strategic
      communications" or Stratcom, which blends psychological
      operations, propaganda and P.R. into one mind-bending smoothie.<br>
      <br>
      I have been following this process since the early 1980s when the
      Reagan administration sought to override "the Vietnam Syndrome," a
      public aversion to foreign military interventions that followed
      the Vietnam War. To get Americans to "kick" this syndrome,
      Reagan's team developed "themes" about overseas events that would
      push American "hot buttons."Tapping into the Central Intelligence
      Agency's experience in psy-ops targeted at foreign audiences,
      President Ronald Reagan and CIA Director William J. Casey
      assembled a skilled team inside the White House led by CIA
      propaganda specialist Walter Raymond Jr.<br>
      <br>
      From his new perch on the National Security Council staff, Raymond
      oversaw inter-agency task forces to sell interventionist policies
      in Central America and other trouble spots. The game, as Raymond
      explained it in numerous memos to his underlings, was to glue
      black hats on adversaries and white hats on allies, whatever the
      truth really was.<br>
      <br>
      ...The seeding of narratives is effected by intelligence services
      working in cooperation with journalists (among other methods). A
      former editor for an influential and internationally circulated
      German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ), Udo
      Ulkoffe, published a book in 2014 called 'Gekaufte Jornalisten'
      (Bought Journalists), in which he revealed the prescriptive role
      of secret services role towards the media. In an interview,
      Ulkoffe said:<br>
      <br>
      "It is not right what I have done in the past. To manipulate
      people, to make propaganda. And it is not right what my colleagues
      do and have done in the past because they are bribed to betray
      people not only in Germany, but all over Europe," he told RT. "I
      was a journalist for 25 years and I was educated to lie, to
      betray, and not to tell the truth to the public."<br>
      <br>
      "I was bribed by the Americans not to report exactly the truth...
      I was invited by the German Marshall Fund of the United States to
      travel to the US. They paid for all my expenses and put me in
      contact with Americans they'd like me to meet," he said. "I became
      an honorary citizen of the state of Oklahoma in the US just
      because I wrote pro-American. I was supported by the CIA. I have
      helped them in several situations and I feel ashamed for that
      too."<br>
      <br>
      Many other journalists are involved in the same practice, Ulfkotte
      added. "Most of the journalists you see in foreign countries, they
      claim to be journalists, and they might be. But many of them, like
      me in the past, are so-called 'non-official cover.' It means you
      work for an intelligence agency, you help them if they want you
      to. But they will never say they know you." The journalists
      selected for such jobs usually come from big media organizations.
      The relationship with the secret service starts as a friendship.
      "They work on your ego, make you feel like you're important. And
      one day one of them will ask you 'Will you do me this favor?'"
      Ulfkotte explained… <br>

      <b> </b><b><br>
      </b>The mitochondrial theory of aging remains one of the most
      widely accepted aging theories and implicates mitochondrial
      electron transport chain dysfunction with subsequent increasing
      free radical generation. Recently, complex II of the electron
      transport chain appears to be more important than previously
      thought in this process, suggested predominantly by nonhuman
      studies. We investigated the relationship between complex II and
      aging using human skin as a model tissue. The rate of complex II
      activity per unit of mitochondria was determined in fibroblasts
      and keratinocytes cultured from skin covering a wide age range.
      Complex II activity significantly decreased with age in
      fibroblasts (P = 0.015) but not in keratinocytes. This was
      associated with a significant decline in transcript expression (P
      = 0.008 and P = 0.001) and protein levels (P = 0.0006 and P =
      0.005) of the succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A and
      subunit B catalytic subunits of complex II, respectively. In
      addition, there was a significant decrease in complex II activity
      with age (P = 0.029) that was specific to senescent skin cells.
      There was no decrease in complex IV activity with increasing age,
      suggesting possible locality to complex II.<br>

      This has gone on way too long with powerful perpetrators having
      virtual immunity<br>
      <br>
      [ Editor’s Note:&nbsp; Investigations are now ongoing as to
      Allen’s professional and personal relationships as pedophiles
      often run in packs, especially those who are public figures, using
      the age old cover of hiding in plain site.<br>
      <br>
      What is most shocking below is that Stirling had made multiple
      child molestation admissions on the internet and not been turned
      in early, or by any of his “friends”. This may be because some, or
      maybe even many of this friends were of the same persuasion.<br>
      <br>
      The FBI has a history of breaking up pedophile rings and I would
      bet they are going to dig down to the bedrock on this one. We will
      be following this story very closely as we would not be surprised
      to see more arrests…<br>

      </b><b>White House confrontation over FBI file leads to Scalia
        killing</b><br>
      <br>
      [ Editorial note: Revelations on the Allan case, which led to
      Scalia now lead into the entire Koch network, including the
      Federalist Society, said to be operating not simply in law schools
      but America’s high schools as well, and into the Heritage
      Foundation. We don’t know when it began, maybe at the Presidio
      under Michael Aquino and the Temple of Set or before. We do know
      it has victimized thousands of children around the world, not only
      in America but channeling children through Belgium and the
      Netherlands into sexual slavery and death.<br>
      <br>
      What is it that makes the powerful desire what is so hurtful and
      obscene? When we ignored the Franklin Coverup, we opened ourselves
      to this. ]<br>
      <br>
      Justice Antonin Scalia was surprised when he was ordered to the
      White House. This was not a man you gave orders to, especially not
      President Obama. It was Justice Antonin Scalia who vacated the
      long sacrosanct immunity from civil lawsuits, opening the door for
      a weakened presidency.<br>
      <br>
      When Scalia left the White House after a meeting with the
      president just before flying to Texas, the manila envelope he was
      carrying had printouts from a computer seized by FBI Special Agent
      Jeff Ross of the Salt Lake City, Utah field office, or so
      informants tell us.<br>
      <br>
      lia left the White House carrying “slam dunk proof” that would
      lead to the arrest, conviction and, of course, impeachment of a
      seated Supreme Court Justice, files that contained names of
      victims and details on sex acts, preferred “types” along with
      dates and places. All of this was on the seized computer and these
      files went “up hill” from the FBI to the Department of Justice and
      directly over to the White House...<br>
      <br>
      The computer itself belonged to a Stirling David Allen, arrested
      and charged with child rape and sodomy by the FBI after an
      investigation that began with a meeting in Rome, Italy. The FBI
      had known about Allen for some time, had wanted to arrest him
      since 2014 but had been blocked, they just didn’t know why or who
      was behind it, not until Justice Scalia died. Within 9 days, Allen
      was jailed, and the evidence he held began to yield gold.<br>
      <br>
      Allen is being held on these charges with bail set at $250,000.<br>
      <br>
      We were shown an email from Allen where he tells of his January
      15, 2016 meeting with Agent Ross at which time his computers were
      seized by the FBI. What we are told was on Allen’s computer and
      what Allen told agents is astounding. Allen confessed, we are
      told, not only to his own sex crimes but to being recruited by a
      powerful international organization that provided him broad
      protection from prosecution.<br>

      New growth in the 'popping' of the 'stock market bubble' sets is
      increasing at a very rapid pace as the 'money velocity' and
      'credit creation' both 'crash' to 'never before seen levels' as
      the 'derivatives' system start 'coming apart' as the 'systemic
      movement (is) downward'. These sets have support that shows that
      the 'dealership (cars) lines (of credit)' are 'collapsing' to
      'levels never before seen'. These sets are showing that the 'rate
      of bankruptcies (within auto dealerships)' will 'increase' to
      nearly '99%' over these next 10/ten years.<br>

            “Pay for Success” Bonds for Pre-K Special Education</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Now, in case you missed the scam - and I rather doubt you did -
      here it is, one more time:<br>
      <br>
      What is “pay for success” and what are “social impact bonds?” As
      blogger Fred Klonsky explains:<br>
      <br>
      <a
href="https://preaprez.wordpress.com/2016/01/29/whats-that-smell-a-defense-of-pay-for-success-from-the-white-house/"
        "><b>https://preaprez.wordpress.com/2016/01/29/whats-that-smell-a-defense-of-pay-for-success-from-the-white-house/</b></a><br>
      <br>
      "...Pay for Success is a social impact bond (SIB) that pays Wall
      Street investors like Goldman Sachs a bounty for every child that
      does not receive special education support.<br>
      <br>
      "Pay for Success is nothing less than a push-out program that then
      pays the bond investor a bonus for every child that is pushed out
      of special ed services…"<br>
      <br>
      This left me breathless, and almost at a loss for words.<br>
      <br>
      That's right: you can now invest in educational deprivation for
      special needs students, and the more that get pushed out of the
      "system," the more "successful" it is, and the more money you
      make. This is not capitalism folks. This is not the manufacture of
      a product nor the production of a needed service. This is simply
      the monetization of inhumanity. It is ultimately, if one examines
      the premise carefully, the trafficing in humanity itself, and of a
      most barbarous kind. This is not the betterment of society.<br>
      <br>
      And just when I thought the finance-capital world could not
      possibly become more depraved or more corrupt. Don't get me wrong:
      I'm not, never have been, and never will be, sympathetic to any
      form of socialism. But finance capitalism has not served us any
      better, and I suspect there's little difference between the two.
      Paper profits are made, the richer get richer, and more empowered
      in their assault on any manifestion of humanity which they don't
      like...<br>
