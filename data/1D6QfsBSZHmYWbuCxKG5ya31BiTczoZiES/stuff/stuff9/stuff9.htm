      <b>METHOD FOR INCREASE OF EFFECTIVENESS OF FUEL UNITS ON
        HYDROCARBON FUEL AND DEVICE FOR ITS IMPLEMENTATION</b><br>
      Method for increase of power effectiveness of fuel units at
      hydrocarbon fuel is in simultaneous activation of components of
      reaction of burning before combustion. Activation undergo both
      components of reaction - gaseous fuel and air by means of
      affecting those with high-voltage pulsing irregular electric field
      with strength 20-25 kV and pulse frequency 100-120 Hz.<br>

      <b>Bio activation energy pad</b><br>
      PURPOSE: A bio activation energy pad is provided to reduce the
      generation of Carbon Monoxide, Hydrocarbon, and Nitrogen Oxide due
      to imperfect combustion as a burning rate increases. CONSTITUTION:
      A bio activation energy pad comprises a bent cover plate(1), an
      energy pad, a lower plate cover, a completely assembled energy
      pad, and welding spots. The H2O contained in the air flowing into
      an internal combustion engine is separated into hydrogen and
      oxygen. The energy source from normal fuel is combined with the
      energy source from the hydrogen and oxygen so that the power more
      than 35~40% of the general power obtained from the normal fuel is
      provided. The amount of carbon monoxide due to the imperfect
      combustion is reduced as the fuel efficiency of the internal
      combustion engine is improved.<br>

      PURPOSE:To reduce the exhaust gas and black smokes exhausted at
      combustion resulting from improvement of the combusting efficiency
      of an internal combustion engine which uses a liquefied
      hydrocarbonic fuel. CONSTITUTION:A liquefied hydrocarbonic fuel is
      put in fluidic contact with minerals including at least carbonic
      component, and thereby the hydrocarbonic fuel is irradiated with
      carbonic mineral electromagnetic waves within the wavelength
      region to generate reactions so that the molecular activation
      motion is induced. Thus the oxidation effect at combustion is
      promoted and the combusting efficiency is enhanced, and thereby
      the exhaust gas and black smokes are reduced.<br>

      <b>WATER FUEL</b><br>
      PURPOSE:To obtain a water fuel which does not generate CO, CO2,
      etc. and has excellent fuel efficiency, by dispersing activation
      energy comprising a liquid hydrocarbon which has been converted
      into a photoelectron emitting substance by allowing it to absorb
      electrons in a specified amount of water consisting of polar
      molecules. CONSTITUTION: A contact cell is produced from a bimetal
      formed by the surface contact of a noble metal with a base metal
      to generate an electrode wave, thus emitting electrons. A liquid
      hydrocarbon (e.g., kerosine or gasoline) is allowed to absorb the
      electrons to be converted into a photoelectron emitting substance
      for activation energy. This activation energy is dispersed with a
      dispersing agent in at least 20% water consisting of polar
      molecules to give an objective water fuel. With this water fuel,
      it is the hydrogen generated by the decomposition of water that
      burns; therefore, the combustion gas is clean and the amount of
      oxygen required for combustion is about 1/10 of that required with
      the conventional fuel.<br>

      <b>METHOD FOR INTENSIFICATION OF GASEOUS FUEL BURNING</b><br>
      Method for intensification of burning gaseous fuel relates to
      power engineering, transportation of natural gas, metallurgical
      industry, branches of industry with utilization of organic
      industrial and domestic wastes, and can be used in installations
      operating on hydrocarbon gaseous fuel. The method includes
      formation on electrodes of electric discharge that forms electric
      high-voltage field that affects process of burning. At that
      gaseous fuel of fuel-air mix in process of injection undergo
      effect of electric varying high-voltage field of silent discharge
      with following catalytic treatment. At that treatment of gaseous
      fuel or fuel-air mix takes place with previous adding
      oxygen-containing additives, this leads to increase of content of
      oxygen-containing radicals at burning. One uses as well silent
      discharge with variable power and voltage for generation of
      radicals of hydrocarbons formed under effect of electric
      high-voltage field is kept at value from 2 to 20 kV. Besides that
      for generation of radicals of hydrocarbons one uses gas discharge
      with increased frequency and variable power. As result decrease of
      energy of activation of endothermic process of decomposition of
      hydrocarbons of gaseous fuel is provided due to previous formation
      of hydrocarbon radicals, hydrogen atoms, oxygen-including
      radicals, ions and ion-radicals in flow of gaseous fuel just
      before stage of burning fuel-air mix and during pre-flame
      treatment of gaseous fuel-air mix to burning.<br>

      <br>
      Apparatus for magnetically conditioning incoming air and fuel to
      an internal combustion engine to improve engine operation. The air
      and fuel, including diesel fuel, are subject to the lines of force
      from opposite poles of permanent magnets mounted on the air and
      fuel inlet lines. In another embodiment, to reduce unwanted
      emissions, the exhaust leading to the catalytic converter and the
      catalytic converter are subject to the magnetic fields from
      opposite poles of permanent magnets. Another embodiments provides
      for the use of magnets in furnaces to improve the efficiency and
      reduce unwanted emissions is such devices.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to magnetic air/fuel conditioning
      systems and more particularly to the use of magnets in the fuel
      and air intake lines of an internal combustion engine for reducing
      emissions and improving efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      Currently regulated gas emissions from motor vehicles are unburned
      hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and oxides of nitrogen
      (NOx).<br>
      <br>
      Unburned HC and NOx react in the atmosphere to form photo-chemical
      smog. Smog is highly oxidizing in the environment and is the prime
      cause of eye and throat irritation, bad odor, plant damage, and
      decreased visibility. Oxides of nitrogen are also toxic. CO
      impairs blood capability to carry oxygen to the brain, resulting
      in slower reaction times and impaired judgement.<br>
      <br>
      An examination of the art reveals a number of magnetic devices
      which have been produced to enhance the operation of internal
      combustion engines by application of static magnets and
      electromagnetic principles.<br>
      <br>
      It is known that the use of permanent magnets on the fuel line of
      an automotive internal combustion engine for subjecting the fuel
      to a magnetic field will improve the performance of the engine and
      reduce unwanted emissions.<br>
      <br>
      It also has been shown that subjecting incoming oxygen containing
      gas to a a magnetic field will also increase combustion
      efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      A number of United States Patents show the use of magnets for
      improving the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels in engines.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 3,349,354 discloses the use of magnets to impose an
      electro magnetic field on flowing fuel. U.S. Pat. No. 3,830,621
      teaches the use of magnets to impose a north magnetic field on the
      flowing oxygen containing gas to reduce unwanted emissions.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,414,951 describes a system in which the fuel line
      is subject to a magnetic field with alternating poles. U.S. Pat.
      No. 4,461,262 discloses a fuel treating device in which both the
      incoming air and fuel are subject to longitudinal magnetic fields
      with alternating poles.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,568,901 shows the use of magnets on a hydrocarbon
      fuel carrying duct for ionizing particles of the fuel, applying
      the south poles of the magnets. U.S. Pat. No. 4,711,271 describes
      the use of magnets to subject oil to a magnetic field to reduce
      the buildup of undesirable materials along the inside wall of the
      pipe.<br>

      U.S. Pat. No. 4,755,288 discloses the use of magnets to subject

      No. 5,129,382 describes the use of magnets to impose a magnetic
      field on the fuel to an engine with both poles of the magnetic
      adjacent the fuel conduit.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,161,512 has a helical array of magnets surrounding
      a fuel carrying conduit to concentrate the magnetic field on the
      flowing fluid.<br>
      <br>
      None of the preceding patents teaches the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      In this invention, further improvements in fuel efficiency and
      emission quality are obtained by the application of magnetic
      fields to internal combustion engine systems to both the fuel and
      the air being delivered to the engine.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the principles of this invention, magnets of a
      specific design are arranged so that the flowing fuel is subject
      to the magnetic field adjacent one pole of a magnet while the
      incoming air is exposed to the magnetic field adjacent the
      opposite pole of a magnet.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment, one or more magnets are strapped to the
      fuel line as close as possible to the carburetor or fuel injectors
      with only one pole of the magnet or magnets adjacent to or in
      contact with the fuel line. One or more magnets are strapped to
      the air intake in such a way as to magnetically expose the oxygen
      to the magnetic field emanating from the pole opposite that of the
      pole used to expose the fuel.<br>
      <br>
      It is believed that the fuel and oxygen are oppositely polarized
      or ionized, with the result that the fuel and oxygen exhibit a
      stronger attraction to each other with the consequence that there
      is more efficient and complete bonding to each other during the
      combustion process.<br>

      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 1, there is illustrated an internal combustion
      engine 12 provided with an air inlet manifold 14, an air filter
      16, a carburetion or fuel injection device 18 hereinafter referred
      to as a carburetor, a fuel line 22 carrying a hydrocarbon liquid
      fuel to carburetor 18, and engine fuel-air mixture intake
      manifolds 24a and 24b. The products of combustion are discharged
      from engine 12 through an exhaust pipe 26.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the principles of this invention, magnetic
      fields are applied to the incoming air and the incoming fuel in
      the manner to be now described.<br>
      <br>
      Mounted on air manifold 14 is a permanent bar magnet 28 attached
      on one side of manifold 14 with a strap 32 of suitable material
      such as a fabric, aluminum, or plastic.<br>
      <br>
      Magnet 28 has the shape of a right angle parallelepiped with the
      opposite flat sides or faces containing the poles of the magnet.
      The face with the north pole is adjacent manifold 14 while the
      face with the south pole is on the side of magnet 28 opposite that
      of manifold 14 as indicated by the arrows. Hence, the entering air
      within manifold 14 is exposed to the magnetic lines of force
      radiating from the north pole of the magnet.<br>
      <br>
      Magnet 28 provides a magnetic field of at least approximately 500
      gauss, but preferably about 1500 or more gauss, to produce the
      effectiveness desired in this invention.<br>
      <br>
      In order to protect magnet 28 from the effects of heat generated
      by engine 12, it will be seen from FIG. 1a that magnet 28 is
      provided with insulation which would include a layer of aluminum
      28a to block radiant energy and a layer of thermal insulation 28b
      to prevent heating by conduction and radiation.<br>
      <br>
      Referring also to FIG. 2, a bar magnet 34 is mounted on fuel line
      22 leading into carburetor 18.<br>
      <br>
      Magnet 34 is a permanent bar magnet held in place by a strap 36 of
      suitable non-magnetic material. Magnet 34 is similar in
      construction, including the insulation, to that of magnet 28 being
      a right angle parallepiped with the face in contact with pipe 22
      being the south pole of the magnet as shown by the arrows.<br>
      <br>
      The width w of magnet 34 is not in excess of the diameter or cross
      section of pipe 22 for reasons which will now be described in
      connection with FIG. 3 which shows a similarly constructed magnet
      38 mounted on pipe 22. However, in FIG. 3, magnet 38 has a width
      which is greater than the diameter of pipe 22. It is known that in
      a magnet of this shape the magnetic fields adjacent the edges are
      more intense than the fields located adjacent intermediate areas
      of the faces. For example, in one magnet which was measured as to
      its magnetic field it was discovered that the maximum intensity of
      the fields adjacent the edges was 1100 gauss while at an
      intermediate location the field dropped off to 800 gauss. Hence,
      as is illustrated, a good portion of the magnetic field produced
      by the magnet goes to waste.<br>
      <br>
      It should also be noted that the exposure of the liquid
      hydrocarbon fuel flowing in line 22 to the magnetic field is more
      critical to the effectiveness of this invention because there is a
      smaller amount of liquid in terms of volume compared to the
      gaseous supply of oxygen in air. Also, the cross section of line
      22 carrying the liquid fuel is much smaller than the cross section
      of manifold 14 containing the air requiring a more intense
      application of the magnetic field. Because of the larger cross
      section of the air manifold, the air manifold would be provided
      with at least two magnets for each one on the fuel line.<br>
      <br>
      Magnet 34 should have an intensity of at least 500 gauss, but
      preferably at least 1100 gauss and above to work effectively in
      accordance with the principles of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      It is also critical that the air and fuel flows be subject to
      opposite polarities of the magnets, referred herein to as a
      bipolar arrangement or configuration, so that if the air is
      subject to the magnetic field adjacent the north pole of the
      magnet then the fuel must be subject to the magnetic field
      adjacent the south pole of the magnet, and vice versa.<br>
      <br>
      The resultant conditioned fuel/air mixture magnetized in opposite
      polarities burns more completely, producing higher engine output,
      better fuel economy, more power and most importantly reduces the
      amount of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen in
      the exhaust.<br>
      <br>
      Another benefit of this invention is that magnetically charged
      fuel and air molecules with opposite polarities dissolve carbon
      build-up in carburetor jets, fuel injectors, and combustion
      chambers help to clean up the engine and maintain the clean
      condition.<br>
      <br>
      The preferred embodiment described above is equally useful where
      the engine employs a carburetor or fuel injection, with the fuel
      magnet being mounted on the fuel line leading to the carburetor or
      injectors, including the use of diesel fuel.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE</b><br>
      <br>
      The above invention was tested on a 1988 Chrysler Le Baron with
      fuel injection. 1100 gauss magnets were mounted on the air and
      fuel inlet lines in a bipolar configuration. It was discovered
      that there was a substantial reduction in the hydrocarbons found
      in the exhaust and that there was also a noticeable improvement in
      engine performance, such as faster starting and greater
      acceleration, and miles per gallon.<br>
      <br>
      The principles of this invention are also applicable to improve
      the efficiency of the catalytic converter whose purpose is
      primarily to oxidize any remaining carbon monoxide to carbon
      dioxide.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 4, there is shown catalytic converter 42
      connected to receive the exhaust products from engine 12 through
      exhaust pipe 26 and discharge through pipe 46 to a muffler (not
      shown).<br>
      <br>
      Bar magnets 48 and 52 of design similar to those described
      earlier, including the insulation, are mounted on pipe 26 and
      converter 42, respectively, as illustrated, in a bipolar
      arrangement.<br>
      <br>
      In the illustrated arrangement, magnet 48 is mounted with the face
      containing the north pole in contact with exhaust pipe 26 whereas
      magnet 52 has its south pole facing catalytic converter 42. If
      desired, the magnets may be reversed as long as the bipolar
      arrangement is preserved.<br>
      <br>
      The arrangement of the magnets shown in FIG. 4 can be used alone
      or in combination with the fuel-air conditioning system
      illustrated in FIGS. 1-3.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 5, in another preferred embodiment, the
      principles of this invention are shown applied to a home or
      industrial heating system.<br>
      <br>
      Illustrated is a furnace 70 having an air inlet 72 connected to an
      air manifold 74 within furncace 70, a fuel inlet line 76 with a
      shut off valve 78, and an exhaust manifold 82 to carry away the
      products of combustion.<br>
      <br>
      As is understood in the art, furnace 70 may be employed to heat
      air or water (not shown) to be distributed for residential or
      industrial heating purposes. In addition, furnace 70 may burn any
      hydrocarbon fuel such as oil, gas, and propane.<br>
      <br>
      Mounted on air mainifold 74 are a plurality of bar magnets 84 of
      the type previously described. Mounted on fuel inlet line 76 are
      similar bar magnets 86. The magnets are mounted in a bipolar
      arrangement, for example, with magnets 84 having their north poles
      facing the incoming air and magnets 86 having their south poles
      facing the incoming fuel. If desired, the opposite arrangement of
      the poles may be employed provided the bipolar arrangement is
      maintained. The magnets would be at least 500 gauss and preferably
      about 1500 gauss.<br>
      <br>
      It is thus seen that there has been provided unique arrangements
      and method for improving the operation of internal combustion
      engines and furnaces, reducing unwanted emissions, and improving
      generally the efficiency of such systems.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Alzheimer’s Disease Has Been Reversed
            in Mice</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      Though all mice studies should be viewed with quelled excitement,
      a new Yale School of Medicine study shows that scientists were
      able to reverse Alzheimer’s disease with a single dose of a drug
      compound.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers gave mice with Alzheimer’s a compound called
      TC-2153, which prohibits a protein called STEP (Striatal-Enriched
      tyrosine Phosphatase) from interfering with the brains’ ability to
      learn and make memories. Synapses in the brain need to strengthen
      so that the brain can turn short-term memories into long-term
      memories, but STEP prevents synapses from doing so, and this can
      lead to neurological disorders including Alzheimer’s.<br>
      <br>
      The mice with memory loss who were given the compound were able to
      recover their cognitive function, and the researchers say they
      were indistinguishable from normal, control mice. The researchers,
      who published their recent work in the journal PLOS Biology, are
      now testing the compound’s ability in other animals.<br>
      <br>
      It will still be a long time before a compound like this is tested
      in humans, but the preliminary finding is encouraging since very
      few experiments have actually been able to reverse the disease,
      which currently affects about five million Americans and is
      expected to grow dramatically in coming years.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      STEP (STriatal-Enriched protein tyrosine Phosphatase) is a
      neuron-specific phosphatase that regulates N-methyl-D-aspartate
      receptor (NMDAR) and
      a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepr?opionicacid receptor
      (AMPAR) trafficking, as well as ERK1/2, p38, Fyn, and Pyk2
      activity. STEP is overactive in several neuropsychiatric and
      neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD).
      The increase in STEP activity likely disrupts synaptic function
      and contributes to the cognitive deficits in AD. AD mice lacking
      STEP have restored levels of glutamate receptors on synaptosomal
      membranes and improved cognitive function, results that suggest
      STEP as a novel therapeutic target for AD. Here we describe the
      first large-scale effort to identify and characterize
      small-molecule STEP inhibitors. We identified the
      benzopentathiepin
      8-(trifluoromethyl)-1,2,3,4,5-benzopenta?thiepin-6-aminehydrochloride
      (known as TC-2153) as an inhibitor of STEP with an IC50 of 24.6
      nM. TC-2153 represents a novel class of PTP inhibitors based upon
      a cyclic polysulfide pharmacophore that forms a reversible
      covalent bond with the catalytic cysteine in STEP. In cell-based
      secondary assays, TC-2153 increased tyrosine phosphorylation of
      STEP substrates ERK1/2, Pyk2, and GluN2B, and exhibited no
      toxicity in cortical cultures. Validation and specificity
      experiments performed in wild-type (WT) and STEP knockout (KO)
      cortical cells and in vivo in WT and STEP KO mice suggest
      specificity of inhibitors towards STEP compared to highly
      homologous tyrosine phosphatases. Furthermore, TC-2153 improved
      cognitive function in several cognitive tasks in 6- and 12-mo-old
      triple transgenic AD (3xTg-AD) mice, with no change in beta
      amyloid and phospho-tau levels.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Author Summary</b><br>
      <br>
      A series of recent studies have found that the levels of the
      enzyme striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) are
      raised in several different neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative
      disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, fragile X syndrome, and
      schizophrenia. STEP normally opposes the development of synaptic
      strengthening, and these abnormally high levels of active STEP
      disrupt synaptic function by removing phosphate groups from a
      number of proteins, including several glutamate receptors and
      kinases. Dephosphorylation results in internalization of the
      glutamate receptors and inactivation of the kinases—events that
      disrupt the consolidation of memories. Here we identify the
      benzopentathiepin
      8-(trifluoromethyl)-1,2,3,4,5-benzopenta?thiepin-6-aminehydrochloride
      (known as TC-2153) as a novel inhibitor of STEP. We show that the
      mechanism of action involves the formation of a reversible
      covalent bond between the inhibitor and the catalytic cysteine
      residue of STEP, and we demonstrate the activity of TC-2153 both
      in vitro and in vivo. TC-2153 shows specificity towards STEP
      compared to several other tyrosine phosphatases and shows no
      toxicity to cultured neurons. Importantly, the compound reversed
      cognitive deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease in a
      way that did not involve changes in the usual pathological signs
      (p-tau and beta-amyloid).<br>

      STriatal-Enriched protein tyrosine Phosphatase (STEP) (PTPN5) is a
      brain-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) targeted in part
      to postsynaptic terminals of excitatory glutamatergic synapses
      [1]–[4]. Recent studies indicate that STEP is overactive in
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), schizophrenia, and fragile X syndrome
      (FXS) [5]–[9]. The emergent model based on these findings suggests
      that the increase in STEP activity interferes with synaptic
      strengthening and contributes to the characteristic cognitive and
      behavioral deficits present in these disorders.<br>
      <br>
      Elevated levels of STEP activity disrupt synaptic function by
      dephosphorylation of STEP substrates [10]. These include
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members ERK1/2 and
      p38 [11],[12], the tyrosine kinases Fyn and Pyk2 [13],[14], the
      glutamate receptor GluN2B subunit of NMDARs (formerly termed NR2B)
      [6],[15],[16], and the GluA2 subunit of AMPAR (formerly termed
      GluR2) [16]–[18]. STEP dephosphorylates the kinases at regulatory
      tyrosine residues within their activation loop and thereby
      inactivates them. Dephosphorylation of GluN2B promotes
      internalization of GluN1/GluN2B receptors, whereas
      dephosphorylation of GluA2 promotes internalization of GluA1/GluA2
      receptors.<br>
      <br>
      To test the hypothesis that the observed overexpression of STEP
      disrupts synaptic strengthening in AD, we crossed STEP KO mice
      with the 3xTg-AD and Tg2576 AD mouse models. Six-month-old progeny
      null for STEP displayed significant decreases in biochemical and
      cognitive deficits, despite continued elevated levels of Aß
      [16],[19]. These data validated STEP as a target for drug
      discovery. Herein we describe the search for small-molecule STEP
      inhibitors. We performed a high throughput screen that culminated
      in the identification of the benzopentathiepin
      8-(trifluoromethyl)-1,2,3,4,5-benzopenta?thiepin-6-aminehydrochloride
      (known as TC-2153) as a novel STEP inhibitor. TC-2153 exhibited
      specificity for STEP in vitro, in cell-based assays, and in vivo,
      and also reversed cognitive deficits in 6- and 12-mo-old 3xTg-AD
      mice.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><br>
      <b>Initial High Throughput Screening for STEP Inhibitors</b><br>
      <br>
      We initially screened ~150,000 compounds from the Laboratory for
      Drug Discovery in Neurodegeneration library using para-nitrophenyl
      phosphate (pNPP) as the target substrate (see Text S1 for more
      information on assay development and secondary screens). Eight
      compounds were selected for further characterization based on
      chemical structure and IC50 values, which ranged between 1 µM and
      9.7 µM (Table S1), and studies of these molecules indicated potent
      inhibition of STEP activity in neuronal cultures and cortical
      tissue after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections in WT mice.
      However, following resynthesis of several of the lead compounds,
      we found that they all exhibited essentially no inhibitory
      activity towards STEP (Figure S1). We therefore tested the
      possibility that a “contaminant” in the commercial preparations of
      the lead compounds was inhibiting STEP activity. To address this
      issue, we performed preparative HPLC on Compound 3 and tested
      eluted fractions for activity against STEP in the pNPP assay
      (Figure 1A). Compound 3 appeared as a major peak (fraction 7) on
      the reverse-phase HPLC preparation and had no inhibitory activity
      against STEP compared to a second peak that appeared as a late
      minor peak (fraction 32) that was a potent inhibitor of STEP.
      Given the high apparent lipophilicity of the unknown, the supplied
      material was extracted with hexane and recrystallized from
      methanol. Small pale yellow needle-shaped crystals (0.5–1 cm in
      length) were obtained in approximately 1% yield. The isolated
      crystalline material displayed the same HPLC retention, UV
      absorbance, and STEP inhibitory properties as the initially
      collected late-eluting peak. The crystalline compound was
      characterized by X-ray crystallography and found to be sulfur (S8)
      (Figure 1B).<br>

      Abstract --- One hundred thousand years ago a Caveman observed
      that a thrown stone always fell to the ground, and postulated that
      the ground mysteriously attracted the stone. One hundred thousand
      years later, and 315 years after Sir Isaac Newton published his
      Gravitational Force Equation, most People and Physicists still
      believe in this myth. It is well known that charged capacitor
      plates exhibit significant "attractive" forces between the plates,
      this invention is just converting this available short linear
      motion to a continuous circular motion. The Energy for the
      resulting motion is derived completely from the Cosmic Flux Field;
      the Electrostatic charge of the Rotor/Stator is not depleted! The
      Ney-Brainard-Ney "Cosmic Flux Field Theory", and an Algorithm for
      calculating CF Turbine Rotor Torque is presented; they explain
      most of the mechanism of the "Invisible Forces at a Distance"
      (Gravitational, Electrostatic, and Magnetic). The Newton/Coulomb
      form of "Attraction" Force Equations are a great
      oversimplification of the Fundamental Physical Phenomena; it
      generally disregards the specific Attenuation/Impact Force of the
      Cosmic Flux traversing matter, which is the basis of all Cosmic
      Flux Forces! The N/C Equation "blows up" to infinity when
      Centroids overlap and "d&lt;2&gt;" in the denominator is zero. The
      Cosmic Flux Attenuation/Impact Forces of the Cosmic Flux paths
      traversing the Stators and Rotor must be Vectorially integrated,
      this will result in a net torque on the Rotor. In cases of
      relatively small Spherical mass diameters, at Astronomical
      distances apart, in Vacuum, of course Newton's approximation is
      quite accurate. The subject Cosmic Flux Electrostatic Turbine is
      rejected off hand by "conventional wisdom", because each element
      of the Stator is perfectly symmetrical to the Rotor axis "hence no
      net Force/Torque can exist on the Rotor". This conventional wisdom
      completely disregards the Fundamental Physical Phenomena.<br>

      <br>
      Today I got final confirmation that washes with my medical
      knowledge, here goes:<br>
      <br>
      The actual way ebola kills is by causing a severe cytokine release
      in blood vessel walls, which if already irritated by a viral
      assault, will rupture from the irritation caused by a strong
      cytokine release. With regard to ebola, the exact cytokine is
      called IL-6, which is inhibited by 41 percent with adequate
      vitamin C present. This means, that from this mode of action
      alone, vitamin C will reduce the impact of ebola by 41 percent. If
      you combine this with the fact that vitamin C will strengthen the
      blood vessel walls as well, the two ways vitamin C helps will work
      in combination to prevent death from ebola, especially if ebola,
      which removes all vitamin C weakens the blood vessel walls by
      removing vitamin C to begin with.<br>

      682% Mean increase in HGH levels<br>
      <br>
      <b>http://www.serovital.com/</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>So what exactly is HGH?</b><br>
      <br>
      HGH is a single chain peptide hormone that’s manufactured deep
      within the brain... in the pituitary gland. It’s released into the
      bloodstream and travels throughout the body. It passes into your
      fat cells and can actually cause them to shrink. It enters your
      muscle cells, stimulating lean muscle growth so you look more
      tight and toned, even if you haven’t been working out. When it
      reaches the skin it maintains healthy blood flow, ramps up
      collagen production and strengthens the underlying substructure of
      the skin’s critical architecture, keeping your skin firm, tight
      and smooth, which is why so many experts call HGH the “youth”
      hormone... and why some believe it’s the key to combatting aging.
      The problem is that while our bodies do manufacture HGH, our
      levels begin to decline rapidly as we age, and until recently the
      best way to increase our HGH levels was through expensive
      prescription injections (costs can run as high as $1500 per
      month). In addition to their high cost, these synthetic HGH
      injections are also extremely controversial, because some experts
      fear that introducing synthetic HGH into the body may upset the
      natural production of HGH.<br>
      <br>
      Is there a way to increase growth hormone levels by more than 600%
      naturally?<br>
      <br>
      Until recently, the answer to that question would have been a
      resounding “No.” However, in September of 2012, a group of some of
      the most highly respected scientists in the world presented their
      research findings at the prestigious Obesity Society’s 30th Annual
      Scientific Meeting. These research results made headlines, because
      they showed that for the first time, there was an oral compound
      capable of increasing mean, bioactive, serum (blood) growth
      hormone levels... by 682%.<br>
      <br>
      The formula that was the subject of these research findings is now
      being sold by SanMedica International™ under the trade name
      SeroVital. And despite its much-hyped research, SeroVital remained
      an “underground” sensation... until the famed Dr.?Oz discussed the
      product’s research on his show.<br>
      <br>
      He introduced the show segment by asking his audience, “How many
      of you want to start feeling 20 years younger right now?” and then
      discussed what he called “a new frontier:?stimulating your body’s
      production of growth hormones naturally with amino acids.” And
      when Dr. Oz disclosed that "a recent study [on SeroVital-hgh]
      showed patients given a special blend of amino acids saw their HGH
      levels spike more than 6 times..." and added, “I have been
      searching for this from the day we started the show. I’ve been
      looking for ways of increasing HGH naturally because I don’t like
      getting the injections,” you can imagine the frenzy he started.<br>
      <br>
      Before long, SanMedica was having trouble keeping SeroVital– with
      its highly specialized, patented amino acid formula – in stock. It
      went from underground sensation to full-blown phenomenon. Even the
      United States Patent Office has added to the SeroVital explosion
      by issuing U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,551,542, 8,715,752 and 8,722,114
      protecting the SeroVital formula from imitators.<br>
      <br>
      Now, after more than 30 years of time-consuming, detailed
      research, there’s finally an affordable oral formula that
      encourages the pituitary gland to increase growth hormone
      production naturally, with out dangerous drugs or synthetic
      hormone injections...<br>

      <b>Elevated Growth Hormone 120 Minutes Following a Single Low-Dose
        of Amino Acids in Healthy Subjects</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Background</b><br>
      <br>
      The use of amino acid supplements to provoke growth hormone (GH)
      secretion in athletes and entertainers now extends to the general
      public. Not only do they have a goal of building lean tissue and
      reducing fat, but also in improving skin quality and other
      rejuvenating qualities that they believe GH can provide. Despite
      increasing mainstream use, evidence for whether oral amino acids
      stimulate GH is not clear.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Methods:</b><br>
      <br>
      This was a cross-over, placebo-controlled randomized study. 16 (12
      males; 32±14 years; 26.4±5.0 kg/m2) healthy subjects had serum GH
      measured at baseline and 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after
      taking a single low dose proprietary amino acid supplement blend
      (SeroVital™) or placebo.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results:</b><br>
      <br>
      After 120 minutes, GH levels had increased 8-fold from baseline
      (0.17 to 1.33ng/ml) and were significantly higher than placebo
      (P=0.01). In addition, a significantly higher mean AUC was
      observed after taking the supplement [20.4 (95% CI:
      19.9-21.0ng/ml) vs. 19.7 (95% CI: 18.7-20.6ng/ml); P=0.04].<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusions:</b><br>
      <br>
      Our results show that a single oral dose of these amino acids can
      significantly increase GH Levels after 120 minutes in healthy men
      and women. Whether these GH changes persist over a longer duration
      or have other positive effects is being further examined.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Introduction</b><br>
      <br>
      GH-deficient adults have marked reductions in lean body mass, and
      within months of GH treatment, gains in lean body mass, skin
      thickness and muscle mass were observed.1-3 It is well-established
      that intravenous (IV) administration of some amino acids results
      in significant GH secretion4,5 presumably via inhibition of
      somatostatin (SS), Figure 1, (also known as Growth Hormone
      Inhibiting Hormone). Such studies prompted testing of oral amino
      acids supplements (mainly arginine, lysine and orthinine) to
      stimulate GH secretion,6-10 albeit with mixed results and
      limitations in the study’s designs. Our aim was to rigorously
      determine whether oral amino acids can stimulate GH secretion,
      since athletes, entertainers and even the general public commonly
      take these supplements and believe GH has rejuvenating properties.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Methods</b><br>
      <br>
      This cross-over, placebo controlled, double-blind study involved
      16 healthy subjects [12 males, 4 females; 9 Caucasian, 6 African
      American, 1 other; mean age= 32±14 years; body mass index=26.4 ±
      5.0 ranging from 19.1 to 36.8kg/m2] (IRB Number 10043). Each
      subject reported to the Inpatient Unit on two occasions one week
      apart. After an overnight fast, subjects had an IV line placed and
      baseline bloods samples were drawn at -30, -15, and 0 minutes.
      Subjects were then asked to swallow the capsules of supplement
      (SeroVital™) or an identical looking placebo. SeroVital™ is a
      novel 2.9g/dose blend of l-lysine HCl, l-arginine HCl,
      oxo-proline, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, l-glutamine, and schizonepeta
      (aerial parts) powder. Blood was drawn at 15, 30, 60and 90 and 120
      minutes for assay. Human GH was measured at each time point using
      the Siemens Immulite 2000 (intra-assay CV was 3.72%, inter-assay
      CV was 5.70%, and the detection limit for GH was 0.05ng/ml.<br>
      Results<br>
      <br>
      Mean growth hormone increased eight-fold over baseline (equivalent
      to 682%) after the supplement from 0.17 at baseline to 1.33ng/ml
      at 120 minutes compared to a mean decrease of 52% after placebo
      from 0.93 to 0.45ng/ml (Figure 2). The mean change in GH levels
      from baseline to 120 minutes (GH at 120 minutes minus GH at 0
      minutes), was 1.15 (95% CI: 0.17, 2.14) ng/ml after the supplement
      versus -0.48 (-1.47, 0.50) ng/ml after the placebo, demonstrating
      a statistically significant differential effect (P=0.01). After
      the supplement, the mean AUC for GH across 120 minutes was 20.43
      (95% CI: 19.90, 20.95) ng/ml/min which was significantly higher
      (P=0.04) than placebo at 19.67 (18.74, 20.59) ng/ml/min. Overall,
      120 minutes after taking the supplement, GH levelswere
      significantly higher in both absolute levels and by AUC.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Discussions and Conclusions</b><br>
      <br>
      The absolute magnitudes of these results are somewhat difficult to
      directly compare among past studies, as commercial GH assays use
      different antibodies to target specific GH epitopes resulting in
      differential sensitivities towards specific isoforms and fragments
      of the GH molecule. This results in variability of the normal
      range of the GH measurements in different assays. Indeed, the same
      GH sample measured using different assays can vary 2-3 fold.11,12
      Yet mean levels of GH reached after the subcutaneous injection of
      0.06 IU of HGH in the treatment of GH deficient subjects was
      0.4ng/ml, a value that was clearly in the range of values seen in
      our study with oral amino acids.<br>
      <br>
      13 Furthermore, our normalized percentage increase matches the
      magnitude increase of previous positive study results on GH
      secretion.6-10,13,14. Overall, we report an eight-fold increase,
      equivalent to 682%, in GH levels 120 minutes after a single oral
      supplement of SeroVital™.Our study had a broad range of ages and
      BMI’s and included both genders. An additional advantage of our
      study over previous GH evaluations is that it contained a placebo
      control group and was randomized and double-blinded. Future
      studies will examine whether regular increases in GH with oral
      amino acids increase strength and vitality. This indeed may be the
      case, since elderly subjects administered oral GH secretotgogues
      for 6 and 12 months have sustained increases in lean body mass and
      improved physical function.14.<br>

      <b>Abstract </b><br>
      <br>
      Embodiments of the invention generally relate to methods and
      supplements for improving the health of human beings.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</b><br>
      <br>
      The present disclosure generally relates to methods and
      supplements for improving health in a subject.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      The primary biological function of human growth hormone (hGH)
      includes stimulating growth, cell repair and regeneration. Once
      the primary growth period of adolescence concludes, the primary
      function of hGH in adulthood becomes that of cell regeneration and
      repair, helping regenerate skin, bones, heart, lungs, liver and
      kidneys to their optimal, youthful cell levels. As is the case
      with many of our other hormones or their pre-cursors, such as
      testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, DHEA and melatonin, hGH
      levels decline with age. Therapeutically, many of these hormones
      can be replaced to offset some of the effects of aging such as
      menopausal symptoms in women or erectile dysfunction in men.<br>
      <br>
      The human body, like every other living entity, works on daily, or
      circadian, as well as monthly and annual rhythms. Daily growth
      hormone secretion diminishes with age with roughly half the levels
      at age forty that we had when we were twenty, and about one-third
      of those youthful levels at age sixty. In some sixty-year olds,
      the levels are as low as 25% of the hGH levels in a twenty-year
      old. Symptoms of aging include loss of muscle, increase of fat,
      decreased physical mobility, decreased energy levels and as a
      result, diminished socialization, diminished healing ability and
      an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and decreased life
      expectancy. Low hGH levels are associated with the aging process
      and early onset of disease. For example, Rosen and Bengtsson noted
      an increased death rate from cardiovascular disease in hGH
      deficient patients. (Rosen, T., Bengtsson, B. A., Lancet 336
      (1990): 285-2880)<br>
      <br>
      Until recently, hGH was available only in expensive injectable
      forms, and benefits from the restoration of hGH levels available
      only to those with the ability to pay. Most recently substances
      that can trigger the release of human growth hormone from an
      individual's own anterior pituitary gland have become available.
      These are generically referred to as secretagogues. Secretagogues
      have the ability to restore hGH levels, potentially to the levels
      found in youth. See, e.g., "Grow Young With hGH" by Dr. Ronald
      Klatz, President of the American Academy of Anti-Aging, published
      in 1997 by Harper Collins.<br>
      <br>
      HGH-deficient adults have marked reductions in lean body mass, and
      within months of hGH treatment, gains in lean body mass, skin
      thickness and muscle mass are observed. (Cuneo R C et al. J Appl
      Physiol 1991; 70:695-700; Cuneo R C et al. J Appl Physiol 1991;
      70:688-694; Rudman D et al. N Engl J Med 1969; 280:1434-1438).<br>
      <br>
      It is well-established that intravenous (IV) administration of
      some amino acids results in significant hGH secretion. Intravenous
      infusion of 183 mg of arginine/kg body weight in females increased
      hGH levels &gt;20-fold and 30 g of arginine elevated serum hGH
      levels 8.6 fold in males (Merimee T J et al. N Engl J Med 1969;
      280:1434-1438; Alba-Roth J et al. J Clin Endocrinol Metab 1988;
      67:1186-1189). Other amino acids, such as methionine,
      phenylalanine, lysine, histidine, and ornithine have also led to
      marked increases in hGH (Alba-Roth, Muller, Schopohl, &amp; von
      Werder, 1988; Chromiak &amp; Antonio, 2002; Gouiinelen, M., M.
      Donnadieu, et al. (1972) Ann Endocrinol (Paris) 33(5): 526-528).<br>
      <br>
      Given the difficulties in IV administration of amino acids for
      widespread use, interest in elucidating the hGH response to oral
      amino acid supplements prompted testing of such supplements
      containing mainly arginine, lysine and ornithine at varying
      amounts. Yet the pronounced variability in results among these
      studies make clear the complexities involved in the design of an
      effective supplement for supporting hGH levels in the general
      public. (Suminski R R et al. Int J Sport Nutr 1997; 7:48-60;
      Lambert M I et al. Int J Sport Nutr 1993; 3:298-305; Corpas E et
      al. J Gerontol 1993; 48:M128-M133; Isidori A et al. Curr Med Res
      Opin 1981; 7:475-481; Fogelholm G M et al. Int J Sport Nutr 1993;

      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</b><br>
      <br>
      Described herein are nutritional supplements and methods for using
      the same. In embodiments, the nutritional supplement may be an
      amino acid secretagogue composition, which, when administered
      orally, stimulates the pituitary gland of a subject to release
      growth hormone (e.g., hGH).<br>
      <br>
      Some embodiments include an oral nutritional supplement that
      comprises, for example and without limitation: L-arginine
      hydrochloride, Oxo-proline, L-lysine hydrochloride, and cysteine.
      Particular examples include an oral nutritional supplement that
      consists essentially of L-arginine hydrochloride, Oxo-proline,
      L-lysine hydrochloride, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, L-glutamine, and
      schizonepeta powder.<br>
      <br>
      Certain embodiments herein include an oral nutritional supplement
      dosage form that consists of 0.86 mmol L-arginine; 1.32 mmol
      Oxo-proline; 2.05 mmol L-lysine; 1.53 [mu]mol N-acetyl L-cysteine;
      1.71 [mu]mol L-glutamine; and 125 [mu]g Schizonepta (aerial parts)
      powder. This oral nutritional supplement is referred to herein as
      "SeroVital(TM)." SeroVital(TM) may be orally administered in an
      amount of, for example, 2.9 grams (i.e., 4 unit dosage forms) to a
      human being, so as to stimulate the release of hGH in the human
      being. The nutritional supplement may be administered on a regular
      basis, such as a weekly or monthly intake at a dosage tailored to
      the subject's needs; i.e., the nutritional supplement may be
      administered regularly as multiples (1*, 2*, etc.) of the
      structural units (pills, tablets, capsules, etc.) in accordance
      with the needs of the subject.<br>
      <br>
      Some embodiments include a method for increasing growth hormone
      (e.g., hGH) in a subject (e.g., a human subject) that comprises
      orally administering a nutritional supplement to a subject to
      improve one or more objective health metrics, including for
      example and without limitation: increasing lean body mass;
      reducing obesity, adipose tissue mass, and anxiety; supporting
      weight loss; decreasing appetite and atrophic processes in
      skeletal muscle, liver, kidney, spleen, skin, and bone; and
      improving at least one of energy, endurance, sleep, metabolism,
      heart rate, blood pressure, cardiovascular health, sympathetic
      nervous activity, thyroid response, glucose utilization,
      mental/cognitive function, reaction time, bone density, hair
      health and appearance, nail health and appearance, skin health and
      appearance, and libido.<br>

      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>FIG. 1 includes a plot of growth hormone levels measured in
        subjects after administration of an exemplary supplement
        compared to a placebo;</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>FIG. 2 includes a scatter plot and linear regression analysis
        of the time to fall asleep in subjects with continued use of an
        exemplary supplement over time; and</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>FIG. 3 includes a scatter plot and linear regression analysis
        of the time awake during sleep over time in subjects with
        continued use of an exemplary supplement.</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The determination of an effective and safe oral functional blend
      that stimulates hGH secretion in the general population is
      important, since athletes, entertainers, and now the general
      public, seek effective hGH support supplements and understand hGH
      to have rejuvenating properties. Indeed, once partial to athletes
      and entertainers, the desire for effective supplements to provoke
      hGH increases now extends to the general public. Not only do they
      have a goal of building lean tissue and reducing fat, but also of
      improving skin quality and providing other rejuvenating qualities
      that hGH is understood to provide.<br>
      <br>
      However, the literature on oral amino acids for use in stimulating
      hGH does not contain clear evidence for an optimized oral amino
      acid-containing blend able to stimulate hGH in the general public,
      including both men and women of a wide age range.<br>
      <br>
      Embodiments herein provide a nutritional supplement for elevating
      growth hormone (e.g., hGH) release. Particular embodiments provide
      an amino acid-containing composition that is well tolerated, and
      may have the result of increasing or elevating hGH release in
      those individuals whose hGH release rates have slowed as a
      function of increasing age, or that have normal hGH levels but
      desire higher hGH levels. Although some existing nutritional
      supplements claim to impact the production of natural human growth
      hormone, there is a need for an improved nutritional supplement
      that efficiently enhances the production and effect of natural
      human growth hormone in the general population.<br>
      <br>
      Some embodiments herein provide a nutritional supplement for use
      by a human being. In particular embodiments, the nutritional
      supplement is an amino acid secretagogue composition, which, when
      administered orally, may stimulate the pituitary gland to produce
      hGH. Increased production of hGH may result in inhibition of
      insulin depression; inhibition of hyperglycaemia and increase in
      insulin effectiveness; enhancement of fat conversion; lowering of
      cholesterol; and/or normalization of lipid balance. In examples, a
      supplement herein may function as a dietary supplement by
      assisting the body's own ability to secrete hGH naturally in a
      manner which is safe and effective. Such a supplement may provide
      growth hormone therapy in a more affordable manner than existing
      compositions and methods, for example, injectable hGH
      compositions.<br>
      <br>
      Particular embodiments herein include an oral nutritional
      supplement that comprises L-lysine, L-arginine, oxo-proline, and
      one of cysteine and glutamine. In some examples, a supplement
      herein may comprise both cysteine and glutamine and/or
      schizonepeta powder. In particular examples, a functional dosage
      includes the L-arginine at a level between about 0.1-6 moles and
      the oxo-proline between about 0.1-8 moles, and/or the L-lysine in
      an amount between about 0.1-12 moles. In particular examples, the
      cysteine and/or glutamine may be contained at a level between
      about 0.001-6 moles.<br>
      <br>
      Cysteine may be present in a supplement according to particular
      embodiments as n-acetyl L-cysteine, and the glutamine may be
      L-glutamine. Amino acids in a nutritional supplement herein may be
      delivered as non-toxic salts thereof, effective complexes thereof,
      stable chelates thereof, active esters thereof, functional
      derivatives thereof, and mixtures thereof which are effective to
      increase hGH levels in a subject from the general population.<br>
      <br>
      Particular embodiments herein include an oral nutritional
      supplement that consists essentially of L-lysine (e.g., L-lysine
      HCl), L-arginine (e.g., L-arginine HCl), oxo-proline,
      N-acetyl-L-cysteine, L-glutamine, and schizonepeta (aerial parts)
      powder. In particular examples, a functional dosage includes
      L-arginine at a level between about 0.1-6 moles and oxo-proline
      between about 0.1-8 moles, and/or L-lysine in an amount between
      about 0.1-12 moles. n-acetyl L-cysteine and/or L-glutamine may be
      comprised in some exemplary supplements at a level between about
      0.001-6 moles. In particular examples, a functional dosage
      includes L-arginine at a level between about 2.5-4.5 moles and
      oxo-proline between about 4-6 moles, and/or L-lysine in an amount
      between about 7-9 moles. N-acetyl L-cysteine and/or L-glutamine
      may be comprised in some exemplary supplements at a level between
      about 0.001-0.5 moles.<br>
      <br>
      Certain embodiments herein include an oral nutritional supplement
      dosage form that consists of 0.86 mmol L-arginine; 1.32 mmol
      Oxo-proline; 2.05 mmol L-lysine; 1.53 mmol N-acetyl L-cysteine;
      1.71 [mu]mol L-glutamine; and 125 [mu]g Schizonepta (aerial parts)
      powder (SeroVital(TM)). Thus, an oral nutritional supplement
      dosage form may consist of 181.38 mg L-arginine HCl; 170.93 mg
      L-pyroglutamic acid; 374.83 mg L-lysine HCl; 0.25 mg N-acetyl
      L-cysteine USP; 0.25 mg L-glutamine; and 0.125 mg Schizonepta
      (aerial parts) powder, for example, in a capsule. In some
      examples, the oral nutritional supplement may be administered to a
      human being by orally administering 4 such dosage fauns (i.e.,
      725.50 mg L-arginine HCl; 683.70 mg L-pyroglutamic acid; 1499.30
      mg L-lysine HCl; 1.00 mg N-acetyl L-cysteine USP; 1.00 mg
      L-glutamine; and 0.50 mg Schizonepta (aerial parts) powder).<br>
      <br>
      Some embodiments herein provide a method for increasing human
      growth hormone in humans that comprises orally administering a
      nutritional supplement for elevating growth hormone release to a
      healthy human being. As used herein, a "healthy human being"
      refers to a human being having any age-related decline in hGH,
      excluding any physiological deficiency that is not age-related.
      Particular embodiments include oral administration of a
      nutritional supplement for elevating growth hormone release to a
      human that is at least 30 years old.<br>
      <br>
      A nutritional supplement for elevating growth hormone release may
      be orally administered to a human being to improve health,
      including by: increasing lean body mass; reducing obesity, adipose
      tissue mass, and anxiety; supporting weight loss; decreasing
      appetite and atrophic processes in skeletal muscle, liver, kidney,
      spleen, skin, and bone; and improving energy, endurance, sleep,
      metabolism, heart rate, blood pressure, cardiovascular health,
      sympathetic nervous activity, thyroid response, glucose
      utilization, mental/cognitive function, reaction time, bone
      density, hair health and appearance, nail health and appearance,
      skin health and appearance, and libido.<br>
      <br>
      In certain examples, oral administration of a nutritional
      supplement for elevating growth hormone release may improve hair
      and/or nail thickness, length, and/or growth. Oral administration
      of a nutritional supplement for elevating growth hormone release
      may improve wound healing, provide anti-aging skin properties,
      reduce wrinkles, dark spots, discolorations, dullness, sagging,
      laxity, and thinning, and may further improve texture, luminosity,
      "lift," tone, radiance, smoothness, uniformity, and youthful look
      of skin.<br>
      <br>
      A nutritional supplement for elevating growth hormone release may
      also be used in combination with testosterone or
      testosterone-boosting supplements to enhance the effect of the
      nutritional supplements disclosed herein.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the "consist essentially of" and "consisting
      essentially of" language herein, a nutritional supplement for
      elevating growth hormone release in some embodiments is
      essentially limited to the aforementioned ingredients, and does
      not include any additional active ingredients intended to add
      nutritional content (e.g., vitamins, minerals, etc.), but may
      include additional ingredients not intended to add nutritional
      content, for example, ingredients intended to fulfill a
      non-nutritional purpose (e.g., coloring, fillers, flavoring, an
      ingredient for maintaining the structural form, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      Each ingredient of a nutritional supplement for elevating growth
      hormone release may be prepared in accordance with any method
      known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Alternatively, each
      ingredient may be obtained in a fully-prepared from a commercially
      available source.<br>
      <br>
      A nutritional supplement for elevating growth hormone release may
      be in any suitable oral administration form, including but not
      limited to: a chewable form, a liquid form, a spray form, a
      capsule form, a suppository form, dissolvable wafer, and a powder
      form. In some embodiments, a dosage form of the nutritional
      supplement may be present in an amount of about 2.9 grams.<br>
      <br>
      Irrespective of the structural form of the nutritional supplement
      for elevating growth hormone release, the ingredients of the
      nutritional supplement may be distributed homogeneously or
      non-homogeneously within the nutritional supplement.<br>
      <br>
      A nutritional supplement for elevating growth hormone release may
      be ingested on a regular basis, such as a daily or weekly intake
      at a dosage tailored to an individual's needs; i.e., the
      nutritional supplement is to be taken regularly as multiples (1*,
      2*, etc.) of the dosage form (e.g., pills, tablets, capsules,
      etc.) in accordance with the needs of the individual. For example,
      a senior citizen leading a sedentary life is likely to need higher
      daily doses than does a young person engaged in regular strenuous
      exercise (e.g., a weight lifter). Alternatively, the nutritional
      supplement for elevating growth hormone release may be ingested on
      an as-needed basis at a dosage tailored to the individual's needs.
      Medical or nutritional counseling may be beneficial for arriving
      at a desirable or optimal dosage tailored to the individual's
      needs. The nutritional supplement may be administered, for
      example, from one to three times daily, or, by way of further
      example, the supplement may be administered every other day, or
      once a week. In particular embodiments, the nutritional supplement
      may be administered on an empty stomach.<br>
      <br>
      In embodiments, a nutritional supplement for elevating growth
      hormone release comprises a particular combination of types of
      amino acids, mass ranges, and specific formulations that have been
      selected to be synergistically-balanced and of adequate quantity
      to achieve a desired physiological effect; i.e., growth hormone
      release. Improper combinations of the same amino acids may be
      ineffective. The component amino acids may be synergistic in the
      sense that several of them, when combined together,
      synergistically stimulate the release of human growth hormone. The
      combination of amino acids in particular embodiments was also
      chosen to reduce or inhibit chemical combination or reaction
      between the amino acids.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLES</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Effect of an Oral Nutritional Supplement Single Dose on hGH
        Levels</b><br>
      <br>
      The short-term effects of a single oral nutritional supplement on
      hGH levels 2 hours post ingestion was studied 16 healthy subjects
      [12 males, 4 females; 9 Caucasian, 6 African American, 1 other;
      mean age=32+-14 years; body mass index=26.4+-5.0 ranging from 19.1
      to 36.8 kg/m&lt;2&gt;]. Each subject reported to the Inpatient
      Unit on two occasions one week apart. After an overnight fast,
      subjects had an IV line placed and baseline bloods samples were
      drawn at -30, -15, and 0 minutes.<br>
      Subjects were then asked to swallow the capsules of supplement
      (SeroVital(TM)) or an identical looking placebo. SeroVital(TM) is
      a 2.9 g/dose blend of L-lysine HCl, L-arginine HCL, oxo-proline,
      N-acetyl-L-cysteine, L-glutamine, and schizonepeta (aerial parts)
      powder. Blood was drawn at 15, 30, 60 and 90 and 120 minutes for
      assay. Human GH was measured at each time point using the Siemens
      Immulite(TM) 2000 (intra-assay CV was 3.72%, inter-assay CV was
      5.70%, and the detection limit for GH was 0.05 ng/mL. The -15 and
      120 minute time points were additionally assayed for
      triiodothyronine (T3) as informative for mechanistic
      investigations.<br>
      <br>
      The mean growth hormone increased 682% after the supplement from
      0.17 at baseline to 1.33 ng/mL at 120 minutes, compared to a mean
      decrease of 52% after the placebo from 0.93 to 0.45 ng/mL. FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      The mean change in GH levels from baseline to 120 minutes (GH at
      120 minutes minus GH at 0 minutes), was 1.15 (95% CI: 0.17, 2.14)
      ng/mL after the supplement, versus -0.48 (-1.47, 0.50) ng/mL after
      the placebo, demonstrating a statistically-significant
      differential effect (P=0.01). After the supplement, the mean AUC
      for GH across 120 minutes was 20.43 (95% CI: 19.90, 20.95)
      ng/mL/min which was significantly higher (P=0.04) than placebo at
      19.67 (18.74, 20.59) ng/mL/min. Overall, 120 minutes after taking
      the supplement, GH levels were significantly higher in absolute
      levels or by AUC.<br>
      <br>
      As daily circadian levels of T3 naturally decrease during the
      morning hours, at which the current trial was scheduled, it was
      not surprising that placebo levels between the -15 and 120 minute
      time points decreased by -6.10 ng/dL (106 to 100 ng/dL, P=0.01).
      In contrast, the SeroVital(TM) group exhibited a deceased
      reduction in T3 by nearly one-half over the same time course, -3.3
      ng/dL (101-97.3 ng/dL, NS), which was not a significant reduction
      compared to baseline, as was the reduction in the placebo group.
      These results affirm that somatostatin inhibition plays a
      mechanistic role in the ability of SeroVital(TM) to induce
      significant increases in serum GH levels in human subjects.<br>
      <br>
      At 120 minutes, GH concentrations were 2-fold higher in women
      (2.3+-1.1 ng/mL, n=4) than in men (1.0+-0.4 ng/mL, n=12, although
      the study was not adequately powered for these comparisons.
      Nevertheless, these findings support an enhanced effect of the
      SeroVital(TM) supplement in women.<br>
      <br>
      An eight-fold increase was observed, equivalent to 682%, in GH
      levels 120 minutes after a single oral supplement of
      SeroVital(TM). The study had a broad range of ages and BMI's and
      included both genders. An additional advantage of the present
      study over previous GH evaluations is that it contained a placebo
      control group and was randomized and double-blinded.<br>
      <br>
      These findings demonstrate that a specialized low-dose amino acid
      supplement can significantly increase short-term GH levels. Future
      studies will examine whether such increases in GH with oral amino
      acid supplementation increase fat-free mass and strength. This
      indeed may be the case, since elderly subjects administered oral
      GH secretagogues for 6 and 12 months have sustained increases in
      lean body mass and improved physical function.<br>
      <br>
      The absolute magnitudes of these results are somewhat difficult to
      directly correlate among past studies, as commercial GH assays use
      different antibodies to target specific GH epitopes. Therefore,
      different antibodies and assays are less likely to recognize some
      specific isoforms and fragments of the GH molecule. This results
      in variability of the normal range of the GH measurements in
      different assays. Indeed, the same GH sample measured using
      different assays can vary 2-3 fold, limiting the ability to
      compare actual GH levels across studies. Nevertheless, the mean
      levels of GH reached after the subcutaneous injection of 0.06 IU
      of HGH in the treatment of GH deficient subjects was 0.4 ng/mL, a
      value that was clearly in the range of values seen in our study
      with oral amino acids.<br>
      <br>
      Findings obtained from a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled
      study strengthen the evidence that oral administration of amino
      acids, when compounded properly, can increase GH serum levels,
      wherein SeroVital(TM) administration showed an 8-fold increase,
      equivalent to a 682% increase in GH levels, 120 minutes after a
      single oral dose. In addition, we elucidate some mechanistic
      details for these significant GH increases as through somatostatin
      inhibition, supported by our results on the 120 minute results on
      T3 levels in the same subjects.<br>

      <b>Example 2</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Effect of an Oral Nutritional Supplement on Endurance and Fat
        Metabolism</b><br>
      <br>
      To test the effect of the nutritional supplement on endurance and
      fat metabolism, a double-blind clinical study was conducted
      involving 12 healthy subjects [7 males, 5 females; mean age=31+-6
      years; body mass index=25.7+-3.8 ranging from 20.3 to 32.2
      kg/m&lt;2&gt;]. Each subject reported to the Fitness Testing
      Facility (PEAK, University of Utah College of Health) after an
      overnight fast. Upon arrival, each subjects underwent standard
      measurements of weight, height, body fat percent (Bod Pod), and
      resting metabolic rate (RMR, indirect calorimerty). Daily calorie
      expenditure was estimated based on the additive evaluations of
      measured RMR, estimated Lifestyle and Activity (defined as the
      number of calories burned performing daily activities including
      working, playing eating, etc), and estimated Exercise (defined as
      an estimate of the number of calories burned during exercise based
      on daily activity level). Following the baseline measurements,
      subjects then consumed a standard breakfast (Egg McMuffin, 300
      Calories; 12 g fat; 29 g carbohydrates; 18 g protein). Subjects
      rested for a further 45 minutes to reach a post-absorptive state,
      then underwent a Maximal Aerobic Fitness Test of graded exercise,
      completed on a treadmill. Subjects' oxygen uptake was measured
      using a metabolic cart, and VO2max was quantified.<br>
      Subjects were then provided a two week supply of a novel
      supplement SeroVital(TM) (2.9 g/dose blend of L-lysine HCl,
      L-arginine HCl, oxo-proline, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, L-glutamine, and
      schizonepeta (aerial parts) powder). The novel SeroVital(TM)
      increases serum human growth hormone hGH levels by 8 times
      (equivalent to 682%) 120 minutes after a single dose in healthy
      male and female volunteers. In this study, subjects were
      instructed to consume one dose of the supplement on an empty
      stomach, two hours after dinner prior to bedtime, every night for
      the two-week study duration.<br>
      <br>
      Following the final dose, each subject returned to the PEAK
      Fitness Testing Facility, University of Utah College of Health
      after an overnight fast (without having consumed their last dose
      of the supplement since the previous night). Upon arrival, each
      subjects underwent the identical test protocols as the baseline
      test day. The data from the two measurement days were then
      analyzed. Consistent with the hypothesis that the supplement would
      increase improve endurance parameters with its ability to increase
      in hGH levels, the decision was made to reject the null only if
      the data supported the one directional alternative consistent with
      a favorable response to the supplement. Statistical significance
      was assumed for P&lt;=0.05.<br>
      <br>
      Mean VO2max increased by 6% from 44.9+-8.1 at baseline to
      47.7+-9.2 mL/kg/min (3.69+-0.96 to 3.91+-1.02 L/min),
      demonstrating a statistically significant differential effect
      compared to baseline (P=0.02). After the period of supplementation
      with SeroVital(TM), the mean RMR increased by 2.7% from 1687+-330
      to 1733+-288 kcal/day with a statistical trend towards
      significance compared to baseline (P=0.165). Estimated daily
      calorie expenditure also increased by 2.7% from 1687+-330 to
      1733+-288 kcal/day with the trend towards significance (P=0.166).<br>
      <br>
      After two weeks of supplementation with the supplement
      SeroVital(TM), (taken on an empty stomach, two hours after dinner
      prior to bedtime, every night), both RMR and estimated daily
      calorie expenditure tended to increase, evidencing the potential
      of the supplement to impart long-term fat burning effects.
      Additionally, endurance as measured by VO2max in the
      post-absorptive state significantly improved with a measured 6%
      increase. Overall, the SeroVital(TM) supplement was shown to
      increase parameters of endurance, energy, and vitality.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Effect of an Oral Nutritional Supplement on Sleep Improvement</b><br>
      <br>
      To test the ability of the nutritional supplement to improve
      sleep, a double-blind clinical study was conducted involving 15
      healthy subjects [10 males, 5 females; mean age=33+-7 years]. Each
      subject completed a baseline Epworth Sleepiness Scale self-report
      questionnaire and a standardized assay of usual sleep habits. All
      subjects were deemed to have average sleep parameters within a
      normal range.<br>
      <br>
      The subjects were then provided a three week supply of a novel
      supplement SeroVital(TM) (2.9 g/dose blend of L-lysine HCl,
      L-arginine HCl, oxo-proline, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, L-glutamine, and
      schizonepeta (aerial parts) powder). The novel SeroVital(TM) blend
      increases serum human growth hormone hGH levels by 8 times
      (equivalent to 682%) 120 minutes after a single dose in healthy
      male and female volunteers.<br>
      <br>
      We investigated sleep patterns with continued use of the
      supplement when taken on an empty stomach, two hours after dinner
      prior to bedtime, every night for three weeks. On each trial day,
      subjects reported 1) time went to bed; 2) time of final wakening;
      3) estimated time to fall asleep; 4) time of awakening during
      sleep/length of time awake. Data was compiled by day for estimated
      time to fall asleep and length of time awake during sleep in order
      to assess sleep efficiency. Daily values for each measure were
      plotted as an average (+-S.D.) among the subjects over the time
      course of the study, and a linear regression was tabulated to
      assess overall trends over time. All available data was included
      in the analysis.<br>
      <br>
      Linear regression analysis showed that both estimated time to fall
      asleep (FIG. 2) and time awake during sleep (FIG. 3) tended to
      decrease over time with continued use of the supplement over the
      time course of the study. The time to fall asleep decreased with
      an average slope of -0.24 min/day, and the time awake during sleep
      decreased by an average slope of -0.26 min/day. Overall, these
      results so a trend towards greater sleep efficiency by
      measurements of both time to fall asleep and time awake during
      sleep, both with a quantified average decrease of about 0.25
      min/day over three weeks with regular nighttime use of the novel
      SeroVital(TM) supplement (when taken as directed, on an empty
      stomach, two hours after dinner prior to bedtime).<br>

      <b>COMPOSITIONS FOR INCREASING HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE LEVELS&nbsp; </b><br>
      <b>US8715752</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Abstract </b><br>
      <br>
      Embodiments of the invention generally relate to supplements for
      increasing human growth hormone (hGH) levels in healthy human
      beings.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] Embodiments of the invention generally relate to
      supplements for increasing human growth hormone (hGH) levels in
      healthy human beings.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The primary biological function of hGH includes stimulating
      growth, cell repair and regeneration. Once the primary growth
      period of adolescence concludes, the primary function of hGH in
      adulthood becomes that of cell regeneration and repair, helping
      regenerate skin, bones, heart, lungs, liver and kidneys to their
      optimal, youthful cell levels. As is the case with many of our
      other hormones or their pre-cursors, such as testosterone,
      oestrogen, progesterone, DHEA and melatonin, hGH levels decline
      with age. Therapeutically, many of these hormones can be replaced
      to offset some of the effects of aging such as menopausal symptoms
      in women or erectile dysfunction in men. The human body, like

      as monthly and annual rhythms Daily growth hormone secretion
      diminishes with age with roughly half the levels at age forty that
      we had when we were twenty, and about one-third of those youthful
      levels at age sixty. In some sixty-year olds, the levels are as
      low as 25% of the hGH levels in a twenty-year old. Symptoms of
      aging include loss of muscle, increase of fat, decreased physical
      mobility, decreased energy levels and as a result, diminished
      socialization, diminished healing ability and an increased risk of
      cardiovascular disease and decreased life expectancy. Low hGH
      levels are associated with the aging process and early onset of

      Endocrinol Metab 1988;67:1186-1189). Other amino acids, such as
      methionine, phenylalanine, lysine, histidine, and ornithine have
      also led to marked increases in hGH (Alba-Roth, Muller, Schopohl,
      &amp; von Werder, 1988; Chromiak &amp; Antonio, 2002; Gourmelen,

      <br>
      [0008] Indeed, once partial to athletes and entertainers, the
      desire for effective supplements to provoke growth hormone (hGH)
      increases now extends to the general public. Not only do they have
      a goal of building lean tissue and reducing fat, but also in
      improving skin quality and other rejuvenating qualities that hGH
      is understood to provide. Despite proceeding literature on oral
      amino acids for use in stimulating hGH, evidence for an optimized
      oral amino acid-containing blend able to stimulate hGH in the
      general public including both men and women of a wide age range is
      not clear.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] It would be desirable to provide a nutritional supplement
      for elevating hGH release, in particular an amino acid-containing
      composition that is well tolerated having the result of increasing
      or elevating hGH release in those individuals whose hGH release
      rates have slowed as a function of increasing age or that have
      normal hGH levels but desire higher hGH levels. Although some
      existing nutritional supplements claim to impact the production of
      natural human growth hormone, there is a need for an improved
      nutritional supplement that efficiently enhances the production
      and effect of natural human growth hormone in the general
      population.<br>

      <br>
      [0011] A particular embodiment of the present disclosure relates
      to an oral nutritional supplement that includes the amino acids
      1-lysine, 1-arginine, oxo-proline, and one of either cysteine or
      glutamine. The amino acids may be delivered as non-toxic salts

      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0014] The present invention relates to a nutritional supplement
      for use by a human being. The nutritional supplement is an amino
      acid-containing secretagogue composition, which, taken orally,
      stimulates the pituitary gland to increase serum levels of hGH.
      Increased levels of hGH may result in inhibition of insulin
      depression, inhibition of hyperglycaemia and increase in insulin
      effectiveness, enhancement of fat conversion, lowering of
      cholesterol, and normalization of lipid balance. The supplement of
      the present invention works as a dietary supplement by assisting
      the body's own ability to secrete hGH naturally in a manner that
      is safe and effective, as well as being affordable.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] A particular embodiment of the present disclosure relates
      to an oral nutritional supplement that includes 1-lysine,
      1-arginine, oxo-proline, and one of either cysteine or glutamine.
      The supplement may additionally include both cysteine and
      glutamine and/or schizonepeta powder. In particular embodiments, a
      functional dosage includes the 1-arginine at a level between 0.1-6
      mmol and the oxo-proline between 0.1-8 mmol, and/or the 1-lysine
      in an amount between 0.1-12 mmol. The cysteine and/or glutamine
      may be contained at a level between 0.001-6 mmol. In another
      particular embodiment, a functional dosage includes the 1-arginine
      HCl at a level between 2.5-4.5 mmol and the oxo-proline between
      4-6 mmol, and/or the 1-lysine HCl in an amount between 7-9 mmol
      The cysteine and/or glutamine may be contained at a level between
      0.001-0.5 mmol. The cysteine can be n-acetyl L-cysteine and the
      glutamine may be 1-glutamine. The amino acids may be delivered as
      non-toxic salts thereof, effective complexes thereof, stable
      chelates thereof, active esters thereof, functional derivatives
      thereof, and mixtures thereof which are effective, to increase hGH
      levels in the general population. The nutritional supplement may
      be present in an amount of 2.9 grams. The nutritional supplement
      may be in any acceptable and known oral formulation, such as
      powder, tablet, capsule, liquid, or wafer form.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Another particular embodiment relates to an oral
      nutritional supplement that consists essentially of 1-lysine HCl,
      1-arginine HCl, oxo-proline, N-acetyl-1-cysteine, 1-glutamine, and
      schizonepeta (aerial parts) powder. In particular embodiments, a
      functional dosage includes the 1-arginine HCl at a level between
      0.1-6 mmol and the oxo-proline between 0.1-8 mmol, and/or the
      1-lysine HCl in an amount between 0.1-12 mmol. The n-acetyl
      L-cysteine and/or 1-glutamine may be contained at a level between
      0.001-6 mmol. In another particular embodiment, a functional
      dosage includes the 1-arginine HCl at a level between 2.5-4.5 mmol
      and the oxo-proline between 4-6 mmol, and/or the 1-lysine HCl in
      an amount between 7-9 mmol. The n-acetyl L-cysteine and/or
      1-glutamine may be contained at a level between 0.001-0.5 mmol.
      The nutritional supplement may be in any acceptable and known oral
      formulation, such as powder, tablet, capsule, liquid, or wafer
      form.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Other embodiments are drawn to methods of increasing human
      growth hormone in humans that include orally administering the
      disclosed nutritional supplement to a healthy human being. As used
      herein, "healthy human being" means a human being without any
      physiological deficiency in hGH independent of age. Particular
      embodiments of the invention relate to oral administration of the
      disclosed nutritional supplement to a human that is at least 30
      years old. The nutritional supplement may be administered from one
      to three times daily or, alternatively, may be administered every
      other day, or may be administered once a week. In particular
      embodiments, the nutritional supplement may be administered on an
      empty stomach.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] In accordance with the "consist essentially of" and
      "consisting essentially of" language, the nutritional supplement
      of the third embodiments is essentially limited to the
      aforementioned ingredients and does not include any additional
      active ingredients intended to add nutritional content (e.g.,
      vitamins, minerals, etc.), but may include additional ingredients
      not intended to add nutritional content such as ingredients
      intended to fulfill a non-nutritional purpose (e.g., coloring,
      fillers, flavoring, an ingredient for maintaining the structural
      form, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Each ingredient of the nutritional supplement of the
      present invention may be prepared in accordance with any method
      known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Alternatively, each
      ingredient may be obtained in a fully prepared from a commercially
      available source.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The nutritional supplement of the present invention may be
      in any suitable oral administration form, including but not
      limited to: a chewable form, a liquid form, a spray form, a
      capsule form, a suppository form, dissolvable wafer, and a powder
      form.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Irrespective of the structural form of the nutritional
      supplement, the ingredients of the nutritional supplement may be
      distributed homogeneously or non-homogeneously within the
      nutritional supplement.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The nutritional supplement of the present invention may be
      ingested on a regular basis, such as a daily or weekly intake at a
      dosage tailored to an individual's needs; i.e., the nutritional
      supplement is to be taken regularly as multiples (1*, 2*, etc.) of
      the structural units (pills, tablets, capsules, liquid dose, etc.)
      in accordance with the needs of the individual. For example, a
      senior citizen leading a sedentary life may need higher daily
      doses than does a young person engaged in regular strenuous
      exercise (e.g., a weight lifter). Alternatively, the nutritional
      supplement of the present invention may be ingested on an
      as-needed basis at a dosage tailored to the individual's needs.
      Medical or nutritional counseling may be beneficial for arriving
      at a desirable or optimal dosage tailored to the individual's
      needs.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The combination of types of amino acids, mass ranges, and
      specific formulations have been selected to be synergistically
      balanced and of adequate quantity to achieve the desired
      physiological effect, namely, growth hormone release. Improper
      combinations of the amino acids may be ineffective. The component
      amino acids are synergistic in the sense that several of them when
      combined together, synergistically stimulate the release of human
      growth hormone. The combination was also chosen to reduce or
      inhibit chemical combination or reaction between the amino acids.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><br>
      <br>
      [0024] A cross-over, placebo controlled, double-blind study
      involved 16 healthy subjects [12 males, 4 females; 9 Caucasian, 6
      African American, 1 other; mean age=32+-14 years; body mass
      index=26.4+-5.0 ranging from 19.1 to 36.8 kg/m &lt;2&gt;]. Each
      subject reported to the Inpatient Unit on two occasions one week
      apart. After an overnight fast, subjects had an IV line placed and
      baseline bloods samples were drawn at -30, -15, and 0 minutes.
      Subjects were then asked to swallow the capsules of the test
      supplement or an identical looking placebo.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The administered supplement is a novel 2.9g/dose blend of
      1-lysine HCl, 1-arginine HCl, oxo-proline, N-acetyl-1-cysteine,
      1-glutamine, and schizonepeta (aerial parts) powder.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Blood was drawn at 15, 30, 60 and 90 and 120 minutes for
      assay. Human GH was measured at each time point using the Siemens
      Immulite 2000 (intra-assay CV was 3.72%, inter-assay CV was 5.70%,
      and the detection limit for GH was 0.05 ng/ml.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Mean growth hormone increased eight-fold over baseline
      (equivalent to 682%) after the supplement from 0.17 at baseline to
      1.33 ng/ml at 120 minutes compared to a mean decrease of 52% after
      placebo from 0.93 to 0.45 ng/ml ( FIG. 1). The mean change in GH
      levels from baseline to 120 minutes (GH at 120 minutes minus GH at
      0 minutes), was 1.15 (95% CI: 0.17, 2.14) ng/ml after the
      supplement versus -0.48 (-1.47, 0.50) ng/ml after the placebo,
      demonstrating a statistically significant differential effect
      (P=0.01). After the supplement, the mean AUC for GH across 120
      minutes was 20.43 (95% CI: 19.90, 20.95) ng/ml/min which was
      significantly higher (P=0.04) than placebo at 19.67 (18.74, 20.59)
      ng/ml/min. Overall, 120 minutes after taking the supplement, GH
      levels were significantly higher in both absolute levels and by
      AUC.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Mean levels of GH reached after the subcutaneous injection
      of 0.06 IU of HGH in the treatment of GH deficient subjects was
      0.4 ng/ml, a value that was clearly in the range of values seen in
      our study with oral amino acids (Janssen Y J et al. Br J Clin
      Pharmacol 1999;47:273-278).<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The present study involved a broad range of ages and BMI's
      and included both genders. An additional advantage of this study
      of the amino-acid containing blend over previous hGH evaluations
      is that it contained a placebo control group and was randomized
      and double-blinded.<br>

        LEVELS</b><br>
      <br>
      Embodiments of the invention generally relate to methods and
      supplements for increasing human growth hormone (hGH) levels in
      healthy human beings.<br>

      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] Embodiments of the invention generally relate to
      supplements and methods for increasing human growth hormone (hGH)
      levels in healthy human beings.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The primary biological function of hGH includes stimulating
      growth, cell repair and regeneration. Once the primary growth
      period of adolescence concludes, the primary function of hGH in
      adulthood becomes that of cell regeneration and repair, helping
      regenerate skin, bones, heart, lungs, liver and kidneys to their
      optimal, youthful cell levels. As is the case with many of our
      other hormones or their pre-cursors, such as testosterone,
      oestrogen, progesterone, DHEA and melatonin, hGH levels decline
      with age. Therapeutically, many of these hormones can be replaced
      to offset some of the effects of aging such as menopausal symptoms
      in women or erectile dysfunction in men. The human body, like
      every other living entity, works on daily, or circadian, as well
      as monthly and annual rhythms. Daily growth hormone secretion
      diminishes with age with roughly half the levels at age forty that
      we had when we were twenty, and about one-third of those youthful
      levels at age sixty. In some sixty-year olds, the levels are as
      low as 25% of the hGH levels in a twenty-year old. Symptoms of
      aging include loss of muscle, increase of fat, decreased physical
      mobility, decreased energy levels and as a result, diminished
      socialization, diminished healing ability and an increased risk of
      cardiovascular disease and decreased life expectancy. Low hGH
      levels are associated with the aging process and early onset of
      disease. For example, Rosen and Bengtsson noted an increased death
      rate from cardiovascular disease in hGH deficient patients (Rosen,
      T., Bengtsson, B. A., Lancet 336 (1990): 285-2880).<br>

      [0009] It would be desirable to provide a nutritional supplement
      for elevating hGH release, in particular an amino acid-containing
      composition that is well tolerated having the result of increasing
      or elevating hGH release in those individuals whose hGH release
      rates have slowed as a function of increasing age or that have
      normal hGH levels but desire higher hGH levels. Although some
      existing nutritional supplements claim to impact the production of
      natural human growth hormone, there is a need for an improved
      nutritional supplement that efficiently enhances the production
      and effect of natural human growth hormone in the general
      population.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0010] The present invention is a nutritional supplement and
      method of using the same. It is a novel amino acid-containing
      secretagogue composition, which, taken orally, stimulates the
      pituitary gland to increase serum levels of hGH.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] A particular embodiment of the present disclosure relates
      to an oral nutritional supplement that includes the amino acids
      1-lysine, 1-arginine, oxo-proline, and one of either cysteine or
      glutamine. The amino acids may be delivered as non-toxic salts
      thereof, effective complexes thereof, stable chelates thereof,

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0015] The present invention relates to a nutritional supplement
      for use by a human being. The present invention is drawn to a
      nutritional supplement and method of using the same. The
      nutritional supplement is an amino acid-containing secretagogue
      composition, which, taken orally, stimulates the pituitary gland
      to increase serum levels of hGH. Increased levels of hGH may
      result in inhibition of insulin depression, inhibition of
      hyperglycaemia and increase in insulin effectiveness, enhancement
      of fat conversion, lowering of cholesterol, and normalization of
      lipid balance. The supplement of the present invention works as a
      dietary supplement by assisting the body's own ability to secrete
      hGH naturally in a manner that is safe and effective, as well as
      being affordable.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] A particular embodiment of the present disclosure relates
      to an oral nutritional supplement that includes 1-lysine,
      1-arginine, oxo-proline, and one of either cysteine or glutamine.
      The supplement may additionally include both cysteine and
      glutamine and/or schizonepeta powder. In particular embodiments, a
      functional dosage includes the 1-arginine at a level between 0.1-6
      mmol and the oxo-proline between 0.1-8 mmol, and/or the 1-lysine
      in an amount between 0.1-12 mmol. The cysteine and/or glutamine
      may be contained at a level between 0.001-6 mmol. The cysteine can
      be n-acetyl L-cysteine and the glutamine may be 1-glutamine. The
      amino acids may be delivered as non-toxic salts thereof, effective
      complexes thereof, stable chelates thereof, active esters thereof,
      functional derivatives thereof, and mixtures thereof which are
      effective to increase hGH levels in the general population. The
      nutritional supplement may be present in an amount of 2.9 grams.
      The nutritional supplement may be in any acceptable and known oral
      formulation, such as powder, tablet, capsule, liquid, or wafer
      form.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Another particular embodiment relates to an oral
      nutritional supplement that consists essentially of 1-lysine HCl,
      1-arginine HCl, oxo-proline, N-acetyl-1-cysteine, 1-glutamine, and
      schizonepeta (aerial parts) powder. In particular embodiments, a
      functional dosage includes the 1-arginine HCl at a level between
      0.1-6 mmol and the oxo-proline between 0.1-8 mmol, and/or the
      1-lysine HCl in an amount between 0.1-12 mmol. The n-acetyl
      L-cysteine and/or 1-glutamine may be contained at a level between
      0.001-6 mmol. In another particular embodiment, a functional
      dosage includes the 1-arginine HCl at a level between 2.5-4.5 mmol
      and the oxo-proline between 4-6 mmol, and/or the 1-lysine HCl in
      an amount between 7-9 mmol. The n-acetyl L-cysteine and/or
      1-glutamine may be contained at a level between 0.001-0.5 mmol.
      The nutritional supplement may be in any acceptable and known oral
      formulation, such as powder, tablet, capsule, liquid, or wafer
      form.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Other embodiments are drawn to methods of increasing human
      growth hormone in humans that include orally administering the
      disclosed nutritional supplement to a healthy human being. As used
      herein, "healthy human being" means a human being without any
      physiological deficiency in hGH independent of age. Particular
      embodiments of the invention relate to oral administration of the
      disclosed nutritional supplement to a human that is at least 30
      years old. The nutritional supplement may be administered from one
      to three times daily or, alternatively, may be administered every
      other day, or may be administered once a week. In particular
      embodiments, the nutritional supplement may be administered on an
      empty stomach.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] In accordance with the "consist essentially of" and
      "consisting essentially Of" language, the nutritional supplement
      of the third embodiments is essentially limited to the
      aforementioned ingredients and does not include any additional
      active ingredients intended to add nutritional content (e.g.,
      vitamins, minerals, etc.), but may include additional ingredients
      not intended to add nutritional content such as ingredients
      intended to fulfill a non-nutritional purpose (e.g., coloring,
      fillers, flavoring, an ingredient for maintaining the structural
      form, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Each ingredient of the nutritional supplement of the
      present invention may be prepared in accordance with any method
      known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Alternatively, each
      ingredient may be obtained in a fully prepared from a commercially
      available source.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The nutritional supplement of the present invention may be
      in any suitable oral administration form, including but not
      limited to: a chewable form, a liquid form, a spray form, a
      capsule form, a suppository form, dissolvable wafer, and a powder
      form.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Irrespective of the structural form of the nutritional
      supplement, the ingredients of the nutritional supplement may be
      distributed homogeneously or non-homogeneously within the
      nutritional supplement.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The nutritional supplement of the present invention may be
      ingested on a regular basis, such as a daily or weekly intake at a
      dosage tailored to an individual's needs; i.e., the nutritional
      supplement is to be taken regularly as multiples (2*, 2*, etc.) of
      the structural units (pills, tablets, capsules, liquid dose, etc.)
      in accordance with the needs of the individual. For example, a
      senior citizen leading a sedentary life may need higher daily
      doses than does a young person engaged in regular strenuous
      exercise (e.g., a weight lifter). Alternatively, the nutritional
      supplement of the present invention may be ingested on an
      as-needed basis at a dosage tailored to the individual's needs.
      Medical or nutritional counseling may be beneficial for arriving
      at a desirable or optimal dosage tailored to the individual's
      needs.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The combination of types of amino acids, mass ranges, and
      specific formulations have been selected to be synergistically
      balanced and of adequate quantity to achieve the desired
      physiological effect, namely, growth hormone release. Improper
      combinations of the amino acids may be ineffective. The component
      amino acids are synergistic in the sense that several of them when
      combined together, synergistically stimulate the release of human
      growth hormone. The combination was also chosen to reduce or
      inhibit chemical combination or reaction between the amino acids.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><br>
      <br>
      [0025] A cross-over, placebo controlled, double-blind study
      involved 16 healthy subjects [12 males, 4 females; 9 Caucasian, 6
      African American, 1 other; mean age=32+-14 years; body mass
      index=26.4+-5.0 ranging from 19.1 to 36.8 kg/m &lt;2&gt;]. Each
      subject reported to the Inpatient Unit on two occasions one week
      apart. After an overnight fast, subjects had an IV line placed and
      baseline bloods samples were drawn at -30, -15, and 0 minutes.
      Subjects were then asked to swallow the capsules of the test
      supplement or an identical looking placebo.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The administered supplement is a novel 2.9 g/dose blend of
      1-lysine HCl, 1-arginine HCl, oxo-proline, N-acetyl-1-cysteine,
      1-glutamine, and schizonepeta (aerial parts) powder.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Blood was drawn at 15, 30, 60 and 90 and 120 minutes for
      assay. Human GH was measured at each time point using the Siemens
      Immulite 2000 (intra-assay CV was 3.72%, inter-assay CV was 5.70%,
      and the detection limit for GH was 0.05 ng/ml.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Mean growth hormone increased eight-fold over baseline
      (equivalent to 682%) after the supplement from 0.17 at baseline to
      1.33 ng/ml at 120 minutes compared to a mean decrease of 52% after
      placebo from 0.93 to 0.45 ng/ml ( FIG. 1). The mean change in GH
      levels from baseline to 120 minutes (GH at 120 minutes minus GH at
      0 minutes), was 1.15 (95% CI: 0.17, 2.14) ng/ml after the
      supplement versus -0.48 (-1.47, 0.50) ng/ml after the placebo,
      demonstrating a statistically significant differential effect
      (P=0.01). After the supplement, the mean AUC for GH across 120
      minutes was 20.43 (95% CI: 19.90, 20.95) ng/ml/min which was
      significantly higher (P=0.04) than placebo at 19.67 (18.74, 20.59)
      ng/ml/min. Overall, 120 minutes after taking the supplement, GH
      levels were significantly higher in both absolute levels and by
      AUC.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Mean levels of GH reached after the subcutaneous injection
      of 0.06 IU of HGH in the treatment of GH deficient subjects was
      0.4 ng/ml, a value that was clearly in the range of values seen in
      our study with oral amino acids (Janssen Y J et al. Br J Clin
      Pharmacol 1999;47:273-278).<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The present study is distinct in that it had a broad range
      of ages and BMF s and included both genders. An additional
      advantage of this study of the novel amino-acid containing blend
      over previous hGH evaluations is that it contained a placebo
      control group and was randomized and double-blinded.<br>

      <b>My Experience with Serovital-hgh</b><br>
      <b>by James White</b><br>
      <br>
      I remember hearing about Sylvester Stallone's use of human growth
      hormone (HGH), and realized how dang good he still looks at nearly
      70 years old. Although I've been reluctant to go the HGH route, I
      recently heard of a product that supposedly helps your body boost
      hgh, called Serovital-hgh. Here are my thoughts and experiences
      with the product.<br>
      <br>
      So I decided to plunk down a C-Note for a month supply. I went
      through a local Sephora located inside a JC Penney here in
      Southern Nevada.<br>
      <br>
      I wasn’t even sure at first what it was – a pill, a cream,
      something else? (It’s a pill) I can see a fancy cream making me
      look decades younger, but a pill?<br>
      <br>
      Anyway, I tried Serovital-hgh for a month, following the
      instructions exactly as stated – taking it in the morning two
      hours before eating breakfast.<br>
      <br>
      After a month… well, I can’t say I noticed much. Actually I
      noticed nothing at all. No side effects, and no benefits.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Better at Night?</b><br>
      <br>
      A gym rat friend of mine said that it would probably work better
      taking it at night rather than in the morning, even though
      Serovital’s website says you can take it either time. I wonder if
      this is why it works for some people and not others?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Competition</b><br>
      <br>
      I should point out that Serovital isn’t the only game in town when
      it comes to HGH boosters. Take a look at Fountain of Youth HGH
      Complete, which contains many of the ingredients of Serovital –
      and actually quite a few more. Its cost? $40.<br>
      <br>
      It’s hard not to browse the web without eventually seeing an ad
      for Serovital-hgh. Well, maybe that’s just me, because I Google a
      lot of anti-aging stuff, and I know Google delivers ads based on
      search history. OK, so it’s hard for ME not to browse the internet
      without seeing ads for Serovital.<br>
      <br>
      <b>What is Serovital-hgh?</b><br>
      <br>
      The website claims to be a blend of amino acids which raises
      growth hormone in the body. It is not human growth hormone.<br>
      <br>
      <b>How much does Serovital-hgh Cost?</b><br>
      <br>
      It ain’t cheap at about $100 for a month supply. Buy it somewhere
      local, such as Ulta. At least that way you can save yourself the
      $7 shipping they want to charge, plus the week or so it will take
      to arrive.<br>
      <br>
      Another reason I suggest picking it up at Ulta is because the
      official website (serovital.com) wants to automatically bill you
      every month to keep replenishing your supply.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Catch</b><br>
      <br>
      The website admits there are three “catches” to using the product:<br>
      <br>
      You have to use it alongside a sensible diet and exercise regimen.
      That probably excludes half of the potential customers right
      there.<br>
      It has to be taken on an empty stomach. Easy enough.<br>
      It’s cheaper than HGH injections, but will still cost about $100 a
      month. Youthful vigor is apparently only for the rich.<br>
      <br>
      One more “catch” they don’t really advertise is that you have to
      use it for about 2 months to even begin to notice any results.<br>

      <b>SeroVital HGH Review</b><br>
      <br>
      By: vagueswoosh<br>
      February 13, 2013<br>
      <br>
      A lot of people fantasize about life when they were 10 years
      younger.<br>
      <br>
      And while you can’t go back in time, Sierra Research Labs, like so
      many other supplement companies, says you can get your body back
      by increasing HGH levels, specifically they want you to believe
      you can do it with SeroVital HGH.<br>
      <br>
      SeroVital HGH is an HGH releaser, which means it uses natural
      ingredients like other HGH supplements to increase human growth
      hormone levels.<br>
      <br>
      Today, there are clear indications increasing HGH can provide
      numerous benefits including:<br>
      <br>
      • Reduced body fat<br>
      • Increased lean muscle mass<br>
      • Strengthened bones<br>
      • Improved energy levels<br>
      • Diminished wrinkles<br>
      • Heightened sex drive<br>
      • Improved mood<br>
      <br>
      SeroVital HGH advertising echoes these benefits, which you would
      expect. However, it’s down to the SeroVital HGH formula to
      actually increase HGH enough to deliver them. After taking some
      time to look at some studies on SeroVital’s formula, I was curious
      if SeroVital HGH was strong enough to get the job done, so I
      looked into the product further.<br>
      <br>
      <b>What’s in SeroVital HGH?</b><br>
      <br>
      Since everything hinges on the SeroVital HGH formula, let’s start
      there.<br>
      <br>
      Sierra Research Lab doesn’t tell us anything about their formula
      on their website. To discover that information, I had to look
      elsewhere. Luckily, SeroVital HGH retails on Ulta.com as well.
      According to Ulta, SeroVital HGH contains:<br>
      <br>
      L-Lysine – L-lysine is the first in a long line of amino acids in
      SeroVital. Lysine produces hormones that trigger greater HGH
      release from the pituitary gland. Because lysine isn’t
      naturally-produced, you’ll need adequate levels from your diet.
      With the extra lysine in SeroVital, your HGH production should
      increase.<br>
      <br>
      L-Arginine – Arginine is an amino acid that increases HGH levels
      as well as widens blood vessels to facilitate HGH circulation. It
      works especially well when combined with lysine. In a 1997 study,
      subjects who took arginine and lysine say significant increases in
      HGH circulation [1].<br>
      <br>
      Oxo-Proline – Also known as pyroglutamic acid, oxo-proline is an
      amino acid with antioxidant properties. It’s also used to
      moisturize skin. This provides some anti-aging benefits, but does
      nothing to directly increase growth hormone levels.<br>
      <br>
      N-Acetyl L-Cysteine (NAC) – NAC is a modified cysteine molecule.
      Like oxo-proline, it has a high antioxidant count. These
      antioxidants boost the immune system and improve health, but do
      nothing to raise HGH levels. However, when NAC is metabolized, it
      produces glutathione. Glutathione in turn increases DHEA and IGF-1
      levels, which promote greater HGH release [2].<br>
      <br>
      L-Glutamine – L-glutamine is the last amino acid in SeroVital and
      among the most powerful. Glutamine raises circulating HGH levels
      within 90 minutes of ingestion, according to one study [3]. It
      also prevents muscle breakdown, maintaining good body composition.<br>
      <br>
      Schizonepta Powder – Rounding out the formula is the herbal
      extract schizonepta. Schizonepta treats inflammation, but no
      evidence suggests it promotes greater HGH release.<br>
      <br>
      The amino acids in SeroVital are good ones, but they’re also
      commonplace. You can get these from your diet if you take care.
      Furthermore, there’s no ingredient information to judge whether
      the formula includes recommended quantities for each amino acid.<br>
      <br>
      Sierra Research claims this formula is backed by a clinical study,
      but the study is not peer-reviewed or printed in a scientific
      journal.<br>
      <br>
      If I had to guess, I’d say SeroVital is no more effective than
      your average HGH releaser.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Can SeroVital Cause Side Effects?</b><br>
      <br>
      Another concern many people have with HGH formulas is side effect
      risk. While all ingredients in SeroVital are natural and
      non-stimulating, excessive amino acid intake can cause a few
      problems. Specifically, arginine and glutamine can cause:<br>
      <br>
      • Bloating<br>
      • Water retention<br>
      • Nausea<br>
      • Abdominal pain<br>
      • Diarrhea<br>
      <br>
      Of course, without information on ingredient quantity, I can’t be
      sure if these side effects will be severe or if they will be
      present at all. Just be aware that they’re a possibility.<br>
      <br>
      <b>How Much Does SeroVital Cost?</b><br>
      <br>
      If SeroVital sounds like something you want to try, you can find
      it at SeroVital.com for $99.99 or at Ulta.com for $89.99. It’s
      also available from other retailers like Lucky Vitamin, but all
      prices stay within this range.<br>
      <br>
      Although this is significantly cheaper than growth hormone
      injections, this price still stings. You’ll likely need more than
      a 1-month supply to see the full benefits, which means you’ll be
      shelling out $100 every month for an indeterminate period of time.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Is There a SeroVital Guarantee?</b><br>
      <br>
      Sometimes a money-back guarantee reassures customers and makes the
      price tag more palatable. While SeroVital HGH advertises a “100%
      money-back guarantee,” there is no additional information on the
      website or elsewhere online.<br>
      <br>
      If you’re unsatisfied with SeroVital HGH, you may need to contact
      the company at 1-800-435-1409 and request more information about
      the refund. Most refunds cover only the first 30 to 90 days of
      purchase, so don’t put it off.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Is SeroVital Worth a Try?</b><br>
      <br>
      SeroVital HGH has gotten a lot of press, but I’m not sure it
      deserves it. With a sketchy backing trial and guarantee, an
      expensive price, and commonplace ingredients, I don’t see anything
      spectacular about this product. I’d recommend looking elsewhere
      before trying SeroVital.<br>

          <b>Alexander Solzhenitsyn</b></big><br>
      </div>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Solzhenitsyn penned this essay in 1974 and it circulated among
      Moscow's intellectuals at the time. It is dated Feb. 12, the same
      day that secret police broke into his apartment and arrested him.
      The next day he was exiled to West Germany. The essay is a call to
      moral courage and serves as light to all who value truth.<br>
      <br>
      At one time we dared not even to whisper. Now we write and read
      samizdat, and sometimes when we gather in the smoking room at the
      Science Institute we complain frankly to one another: What kind of
      tricks are they playing on us, and where are they dragging us?
      Gratuitous boasting of cosmic achievements while there is poverty
      and destruction at home. Propping up remote, uncivilized regimes.
      Fanning up civil war. And we recklessly fostered Mao Tse-tung at
      our expense—and it will be we who are sent to war against him, and
      will have to go. Is there any way out? And they put on trial
      anybody they want and they put sane people in asylums—always they,
      and we are powerless.<br>
      <br>
      Things have almost reached rock bottom. A universal spiritual
      death has already touched us all, and physical death will soon
      flare up and consume us both and our children—but as before we
      still smile in a cowardly way and mumble without tounges tied. But
      what can we do to stop it? We haven't the strength?<br>
      <br>
      We have been so hopelessly dehumanized that for today's modest
      ration of food we are willing to abandon all our principles, our
      souls, and all the efforts of our predecessors and all
      opportunities for our descendants—but just don't disturb our
      fragile existence. We lack staunchness, pride and enthusiasm. We
      don't even fear universal nuclear death, and we don't fear a third
      world war. We have already taken refuge in the crevices. We just
      fear acts of civil courage.<br>
      <br>
      We fear only to lag behind the herd and to take a step alone-and
      suddenly find ourselves without white bread, without heating gas
      and without a Moscow registration.<br>
      <br>
      We have been indoctrinated in political courses, and in just the
      same way was fostered the idea to live comfortably, and all will
      be well for the rest of our lives. You can't escape your
      environment and social conditions. Everyday life defines
      consciousness. What does it have to do with us? We can't do
      anything about it?<br>
      <br>
      But we can—everything. But we lie to ourselves for assurance. And
      it is not they who are to blame for everything—we ourselves, only
      we. One can object: But actually toy can think anything you like.
      Gags have been stuffed into our mouths. Nobody wants to listen to
      us and nobody asks us. How can we force them to listen? It is
      impossible to change their minds.<br>
      <br>
      It would be natural to vote them out of office—but there are not
      elections in our country. In the West people know about strikes
      and protest demonstrations—but we are too oppressed, and it is a
      horrible prospect for us: How can one suddenly renounce a job and
      take to the streets? Yet the other fatal paths probed during the
      past century by our bitter Russian history are, nevertheless, not
      for us, and truly we don't need them.<br>
      <br>
      Now that the axes have done their work, when everything which was
      sown has sprouted anew, we can see that the young and presumptuous
      people who thought they would make out country just and happy
      through terror, bloody rebellion and civil war were themselves
      misled. No thanks, fathers of education! Now we know that infamous
      methods breed infamous results. Let our hands be clean!<br>
      <br>
      The circle—is it closed? And is there really no way out? And is
      there only one thing left for us to do, to wait without taking
      action? Maybe something will happen by itself? It will never
      happen as long as we daily acknowledge, extol, and strengthen—and
      do not sever ourselves from the most perceptible of its aspects:
      Lies.<br>
      <br>
      When violence intrudes into peaceful life, its face glows with
      self-confidence, as if it were carrying a banner and shouting: “I
      am violence. Run away, make way for me—I will crush you.” But
      violence quickly grows old. And it has lost confidence in itself,
      and in order to maintain a respectable face it summons falsehood
      as its ally—since violence lays its ponderous paw not every day
      and not on every shoulder. It demands from us only obedience to
      lies and daily participation in lies—all loyalty lies in that.<br>
      <br>
      And the simplest and most accessible key to our self-neglected
      liberation lies right here: Personal non-participation in lies.
      Though lies conceal everything, though lies embrace everything,
      but not with any help from me.<br>
      <br>
      This opens a breach in the imaginary encirclement caused by our
      inaction. It is the easiest thing to do for us, but the most
      devastating for the lies. Because when people renounce lies it
      simply cuts short their existence. Like an infection, they can
      exist only in a living organism.<br>
      <br>
      We do not exhort ourselves. We have not sufficiently matured to
      march into the squares and shout the truth our loud or to express
      aloud what we think. It's not necessary.<br>
      <br>
      It's dangerous. But let us refuse to say that which we do not
      think.<br>
      <br>
      This is our path, the easiest and most accessible one, which takes
      into account out inherent cowardice, already well rooted. And it
      is much easier—it's dangerous even to say this—than the sort of
      civil disobedience which Gandhi advocated.<br>
      <br>
      Our path is to talk away fro the gangrenous boundary. If we did
      not paste together the dead bones and scales of ideology, if we
      did not sew together the rotting rags, we would be astonished how
      quickly the lies would be rendered helpless and subside.<br>
      <br>
      That which should be naked would then really appear naked before
      the whole world.<br>
      <br>
      So in our timidity, let each of us make a choice: Whether
      consciously, to remain a servant of falsehood—of course, it is not
      out of inclination, but to feed one's family, that one raises his
      children in the spirit of lies—or to shrug off the lies and become
      an honest man worthy of respect both by one's children and
      contemporaries.<br>
      <br>
      And from that day onward he:<br>
      <br>
      Will not henceforth write, sign, or print in any way a single
      phrase which in his opinion distorts the truth.<br>
      <br>
      Will utter such a phrase neither in private conversation not in
      the presence of many people, neither on his own behalf not at the
      prompting of someone else, either in the role of agitator,
      teacher, educator, not in a theatrical role.<br>
      <br>
      Will not depict, foster or broadcast a single idea which he can
      only see is false or a distortion of the truth whether it be in
      painting, sculpture, photography, technical science, or music.<br>
      <br>
      Will not cite out of context, either orally or written, a single
      quotation so as to please someone, to feather his own nest, to
      achieve success in his work, if he does not share completely the
      idea which is quoted, or if it does not accurately reflect the
      matter at issue.<br>
      <br>
      Will not allow himself to be compelled to attend demonstrations or
      meetings if they are contrary to his desire or will, will neither
      take into hand not raise into the air a poster or slogan which he
      does not completely accept.<br>
      <br>
      Will not raise his hand to vote for a proposal with which he does
      not sincerely sympathize, will vote neither openly nor secretly
      for a person whom he considers unworthy or of doubtful abilities.<br>
      <br>
      Will not allow himself to be dragged to a meeting where there can
      be expected a forced or distorted discussion of a question. Will
      immediately talk out of a meeting, session, lecture, performance
      or film showing if he hears a speaker tell lies, or purvey
      ideological nonsense or shameless propaganda.<br>
      <br>
      Will not subscribe to or buy a newspaper or magazine in which
      information is distorted and primary facts are concealed. Of
      course we have not listed all of the possible and necessary
      deviations from falsehood. But a person who purifies himself will
      easily distinguish other instances with his purified outlook.<br>
      <br>
      No, it will not be the same for everybody at first. Some, at
      first, will lose their jobs. For young people who want to live
      with truth, this will, in the beginning, complicate their young
      lives very much, because the required recitations are stuffed with
      lies, and it is necessary to make a choice.<br>
      <br>
      But there are no loopholes for anybody who wants to be honest. On
      any given day any one of us will be confronted with at least one
      of the above-mentioned choices even in the most secure of the
      technical sciences. Either truth or falsehood: Toward spiritual
      independence or toward spiritual servitude.<br>
      <br>
      And he who is not sufficiently courageous even to defend his
      soul—don't let him be proud of his “progressive” views, don't let
      him boast that he is an academician or a people's artist, a
      merited figure, or a general—let him say to himself: I am in the
      herd, and a coward. It's all the same to me as long as I'm fed and
      warm.<br>
      <br>
      Even this path, which is the most modest of all paths of
      resistance, will not be easy for us. But it is much easier than
      self-immolation or a hunger strike: The flames will not envelope
      your body, your eyeballs, will not burst from the heat, and brown
      bread and clean water will always be available to your family.<br>
      <br>
      A great people of Europe, the Czechoslovaks, whom we betrayed and
      deceived: Haven't they shown us how a vulnerable breast can stand
      up even against tanks if there is a worthy heart within it?<br>
      <br>
      You say it will not be easy? But it will be easiest of all
      possible resources. It will not be an easy choice for a body, but
      it is the only one for a soul. Not, it is not an easy path. But
      there are already people, even dozens of them, who over the years
      have maintained all these points and live by the truth.<br>
      <br>
      So you will not be the first to take this path, but will join
      those who have already taken it. This path will be easier and
      shorter for all of us if we take it by mutual efforts and in close
      rank. If there are thousands of us, they will not be able to do
      anything with us. If there are tens of thousands of us, then we
      would not even recognize our country.<br>
      <br>
      If we are too frightened, then we should stop complaining that
      someone is suffocating us. We ourselves are doing it. Let us then
      bow down even more, let us wail, and out brothers the biologists
      will help to bring nearer the day when they are able to read our
      thoughts are worthless and hopeless.<br>
      <br>
      And if we get cold feet, even taking this step, then we are
      worthless and hopeless, and the scorn of Pushkin should be
      directed to us:<br>
      <br>
      Why should cattle have the gifts of freedom?<br>
      <br>
      Their heritage from generation to generation is the belled yoke
      and the lash.<br>

      </b>Recent findings link fronto-temporal gamma
      electroencephalographic (EEG) activity to conscious awareness in
      dreams, but a causal relationship has not yet been established. We
      found that current stimulation in the lower gamma band during REM
      sleep influences ongoing brain activity and induces
      self-reflective awareness in dreams. Other stimulation frequencies
      were not effective, suggesting that higher order consciousness is
      indeed related to synchronous oscillations around 25 and 40 Hz.<br>

                splitter that runs on an ordinary AAA battery</b></big><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          In 2015, American consumers will finally be able to purchase
          fuel cell cars from Toyota and other manufacturers. Although
          touted as zero-emissions vehicles, most of the cars will run
          on hydrogen made from natural gas, a fossil fuel that
          contributes to global warming.<br>
          <br>
          Now scientists at Stanford University have developed a
          low-cost, emissions-free device that uses an ordinary AAA
          battery to produce hydrogen by water electrolysis. The battery
          sends an electric current through two electrodes that split
          liquid water into hydrogen and oxygen gas. Unlike other water
          splitters that use precious-metal catalysts, the electrodes in
          the Stanford device are made of inexpensive and abundant
          nickel and iron.<br>
          <br>
          "Using nickel and iron, which are cheap materials, we were
          able to make the electrocatalysts active enough to split water
          at room temperature with a single 1.5-volt battery," said
          Hongjie Dai, a professor of chemistry at Stanford. "This is
          the first time anyone has used non-precious metal catalysts to
          split water at a voltage that low. It's quite remarkable,
          because normally you need expensive metals, like platinum or
          iridium, to achieve that voltage."<br>
          <br>
          In addition to producing hydrogen, the novel water splitter
          could be used to make chlorine gas and sodium hydroxide,
          another important industrial chemical, according to Dai. He
          and his colleagues describe the new device in a study
          published in the Aug. 22 issue of the journal Nature
          Communications.<br>
          <br>
          <b>The promise of hydrogen</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Automakers have long considered the hydrogen fuel cell a
          promising alternative to the gasoline engine. Fuel cell
          technology is essentially water splitting in reverse. A fuel
          cell combines stored hydrogen gas with oxygen from the air to
          produce electricity, which powers the car. The only byproduct
          is water – unlike gasoline combustion, which emits carbon
          dioxide, a greenhouse gas.<br>
          <br>
          Earlier this year, Hyundai began leasing fuel cell vehicles in
          Southern California. Toyota and Honda will begin selling fuel
          cell cars in 2015. Most of these vehicles will run on fuel
          manufactured at large industrial plants that produce hydrogen
          by combining very hot steam and natural gas, an
          energy-intensive process that releases carbon dioxide as a
          byproduct.<br>

          Splitting water to make hydrogen requires no fossil fuels and
          emits no greenhouse gases. But scientists have yet to develop
          an affordable, active water splitter with catalysts capable of
          working at industrial scales.<br>
          <br>
          "It's been a constant pursuit for decades to make low-cost
          electrocatalysts with high activity and long durability," Dai
          said. "When we found out that a nickel-based catalyst is as
          effective as platinum, it came as a complete surprise."<br>
          <br>
          <b>Saving energy and money</b><br>
          <br>
          The discovery was made by Stanford graduate student Ming Gong,
          co-lead author of the study. "Ming discovered a
          nickel-metal/nickel-oxide structure that turns out to be more
          active than pure nickel metal or pure nickel oxide alone," Dai
          said. "This novel structure favors hydrogen electrocatalysis,
          but we still don't fully understand the science behind it."<br>
          <br>
          The nickel/nickel-oxide catalyst significantly lowers the
          voltage required to split water, which could eventually save
          hydrogen producers billions of dollars in electricity costs,
          according to Gong. His next goal is to improve the durability
          of the device.<br>
          <br>
          "The electrodes are fairly stable, but they do slowly decay
          over time," he said. "The current device would probably run
          for days, but weeks or months would be preferable. That goal
          is achievable based on my most recent results."<br>
          <br>
          The researchers also plan to develop a water splitter than
          runs on electricity produced by solar energy.<br>
          <br>
          "Hydrogen is an ideal fuel for powering vehicles, buildings
          and storing renewable energy on the grid," said Dai. "We're
          very glad that we were able to make a catalyst that's very
          active and low cost. This shows that through nanoscale
          engineering of materials we can really make a difference in
          how we make fuels and consume energy."<br>

          Alopecia can lead to patchy or complete hair-loss People saw
          their hair fully restored after just five months of treatment<br>
          <br>
          Scientists have completely reversed hair loss in three people
          by giving them a drug normally used to treat bone marrow
          disorders.<br>
          <br>
          The patients had alopecia areata - a condition that can cause
          severe, patchy baldness that is difficult to treat.<br>
          <br>
          But after five months of taking the medication ruxolitinib,
          all three saw total hair re-growth.<br>
          <br>
          The findings from Columbia University Medical Center are
          published in the journal Nature Medicine.<br>
          <br>
          'Devastating disease'<br>
          <br>
          Alopecia areata affects around two in every 1,000 people in
          the UK and is thought to be caused by the immune system
          attacking hair follicles.<br>
          <br>
          The US scientists had previously identified a set of immune
          cells involved in the destruction of hair and conducted a
          number of successful trials in mice.<br>
          <br>
          They then gave three patients with moderate to severe alopecia
          areata a twice daily dose of ruxolitinib.<br>
          <br>
          This medication is already approved for use in bone marrow
          conditions in the United States and European Union.<br>
          <br>
          All three patients had lost at least a third of their hair but
          saw dramatic hair growth within five months of therapy.<br>
          <br>
          Lead researcher Dr Raphael Clynes said: "We've only begun
          testing the drug in patients, but if the drug continues to be
          successful and safe, it will have a dramatic positive impact
          on the lives of people with the disease."<br>
          <br>
          Prof David Bickers, a dermatologist at Columbia University who
          has treated many patients with the disease, said: "There are
          few tools in the arsenal for the treatment of alopecia areata
          that have any demonstrated efficacy.<br>
          <br>
          "This is a major step forward in improving the standard of
          care for patients suffering from this devastating disease."<br>
          <br>
          Researchers say more work is now needed to see if the drug can
          be offered more widely.<br>
          <br>
          Alopecia areata can occur at any age but is most often seen in
          teenagers and young adults.<br>
          <br>
          It is not related to the more common male-pattern hair loss
          that is thought to be driven by hormones.<br>
          <br>
          Scientists say as the mechanisms behind this condition are
          different, the therapy is less likely to prove effective for
          this more common problem.<br>

          Ruxolitinib (INC424, INCB18424, trade names Jakafi and Jakavi,
          by Incyte Pharmaceuticals and Novartis) is a drug for the
          treatment of intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis, a type
          of bone marrow cancer.[2][3] It is also being investigated for
          the treatment of other types of cancer (such as lymphomas and
          pancreatic cancer),[4] for polycythemia vera,[4] for plaque
          psoriasis, and for alopecia areata [5].<br>
          <br>
          The phase III Controlled Myelofibrosis Study with Oral JAK
          Inhibitor-I (COMFORT-I) and COMFORT-II trials showed
          significant benefits by reducing spleen size, relieving
          debilitating symptoms, and improving overall
          survival.[6][7][8][9]<br>
          <br>
          <b>Mechanism of action</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Ruxolitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor with selectivity for
          subtypes JAK1 and JAK2 of this enzyme.[10][11] Ruxolitinib
          inhibits dysregulated JAK signaling associated with
          myelofibrosis. JAK1 and JAK2 recruit signal transducers and
          activators of transcription (STATs) to cytokine receptors
          leading to modulation of gene expression.<br>
          Side effects<br>
          <br>
          Immunologic side effects have included herpes zoster
          (shingles) (1.9%) and case reports of opportunistic
          infections.[12] Metabolic side effects have included weight
          gain (7.1%). Laboratory abnormalities have included alanine
          transaminase (ALT) abnormalities (25.2%), aspartate
          transaminase (AST) abnormalities (17.4%), and elevated
          cholesterol levels (16.8%).[citation needed]<br>
          <br>
          <b>Legal status</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          In November 2011, ruxolitinib was approved by the U.S. Food
          and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of
          intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis based on results of
          the COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II Trials.[13]<br>
          <br>
          <b>Economics</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Some analysts believe this to be a potential blockbuster
          drug.[4] As of the end of March 2012, and according to an
          Incyte spokesman, approximately 1000 physicians had prescribed
          the drug in the United States, out of a total 6500
          hematologists and oncologists nationwide.[4]<br>

          An arthritis drug has been used to cure a man who was almost
          completely bald from alopecia universalis.<br>
          <br>
          Tofacitinib citrate was used to treat the 25-year-old who had
          lost most of his hair after getting alopecia – a disease there
          is currently no long-term treatment or cure for.<br>
          <br>
          The man had not grown hair for seven years. However, after
          being treated with the arthritis drug for just three months,
          he had regrown a head of hair, eyebrows, eyelashes, some
          facial hair and armpit hair.<br>
          <br>
          Alopecia universalis occurs in approximately one in every
          200,000 people. It is thought to be an auto immune disorder
          and can affect anyone at any age.<br>
          <br>
          Senior author of the study Brett A King, a dermatologist from
          Yale University School of Medicine, said: "The results are
          exactly what we hoped for. This is a huge step forward in the
          treatment of patients with this condition.<br>
          <br>
          "While it's one case, we anticipated the successful treatment
          of this man based on our current understanding of the disease
          and the drug. We believe the same results will be duplicated
          in other patients, and we plan to try."<br>
          <br>
          As well as alopecia, the man was also diagnosed with plaque
          psoriasis, a condition that meant he had red scaly areas of
          skin.<br>
          alopecia<br>
          The patient's head a) before treatmen with tofacitinib, b) two
          months into treatment, c) five months into treatment, and d)
          eight months into treatment.Yale University<br>
          <br>
          Researchers decided to try treating him with tofacitinib – an
          FDA approved drug for rheumatoid arthritis – as it had been
          successful used to treat psoriasis on humans in the past. It
          had also reversed alopecia areata, a less extreme form of the
          disease, in mice.<br>
          <br>
          King thought the drug might address both diseases
          simultaneously. After two months of being treated with
          tofacitinib, the man's psoriasis had started to improve and he
          had started to grow hair. After three months, he had grown a
          full head of hair.<br>
          <br>
          Study co-author Brittany G Craiglow said: "By eight months
          there was full regrowth of hair. The patient has reported
          feeling no side effects, and we've seen no lab test
          abnormalities, either."<br>
          <br>
          Published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology, the
          authors say this is the first reported case of a successful
          targeted treatment of alopecia universalis.<br>
          <br>
          "There are no good options for long-term treatment of alopecia
          universalis," King said. "The best available science suggested
          this might work, and it has."<br>
          <br>
          The drug treats alopecia by turning off the immune system's
          attack on hair follicles. The researchers have now submitted a
          proposal for a clinical trial of a cream form of tofacitinib
          for treatment of alopecia.<br>

          <br>
          Water shortages continue to make the news across the world,
          and governments seem to be offering very few if any solutions.
          Recently, I covered a novel low-cost, simple device called
          Warka Water that aims to extract water from the air and offer
          regions with little to no infrastructure the possibility of
          water self-sufficiency.<br>
          <br>
          However, in addition to shortages, pollution is another grave
          problem; even if some areas technically have water it is often
          unfit to drink.<br>
          <br>
          A sophomore in the Department of Civil, Structural and
          Environmental Engineering at the University of Buffalo,
          Deshawn Henry, believes he has found a solution.<br>
          <br>
          Henry has created essentially a six-foot tall magnifying glass
          that he has termed a "water lens."<br>
          <br>
          It is another low-cost solution that can reach areas that have
          little in the way of conventional infrastructure, offering a
          speedy way to self-sufficiency and decreased deaths from
          unsafe water.<br>
          <br>
          Since the frame for the lens can be constructed from commonly
          found materials — wood, plastic sheeting and water — the lens
          can be built for almost no cost, offering an inexpensive
          method to treat water. <br>
          <br>
          The device may not look like much, but it can heat a liter of
          water to between 130 and 150 degrees Fahrenheit in a little
          more than an hour, destroying 99.9 percent of bacteria and
          pathogens. <br>
          <br>
          “The water lens could have a huge impact in developing
          countries,” says Henry ... “Millions of people die every year
          from diseases and pathogens found in unclean water, and they
          can’t help it because that’s all they have. Either they drink
          it or they die.”<br>
          <br>
          Henry's device is still in the testing phase, but shows
          promise. The University of Buffalo relates the details that
          still need to be worked out in order to provide the most
          efficient, practical system that could be used on widespread
          basis by families.<br>
          <br>
          The lens consists of a plastic sheet covered with water
          supported by a wooden frame. The frame holds a small container
          of water below the lens in line with a focal point created
          from a concentrated ray of sunlight. Barring the weather, once
          assembled, the lens functions freely. Due to the sun’s
          movement throughout the day, Henry needs to repeatedly shift
          the container to match the focal point. <br>
          <br>
          Henry’s research tested how altering the thickness of the
          plastic sheet and the volume of water over the sheet affected
          the efficiency of the lens. The device was tested with plastic
          sheets that were 0.7, 1 and 2 millimeters thick, and water
          volumes of four, six and eight liters. <br>
          <br>
          The study found that adding more water to the lens improved
          efficiency, as larger areas of water transmitted more energy
          from sunlight. However, thicker plastic sheets consumed more
          energy from light, lowering the lens’ efficiency. <br>
          <br>
          A plastic sheet that was too thin or excessive amounts of
          water could break the lens. Henry concluded that the
          0.7-millimeter sheet could efficiently heat the container
          while supporting eight liters of water, but any more and the
          sheet could potentially break. <br>
          <br>
          With 1.1 billion people lacking access to clean drinking
          water, Henry’s work could make a difference in the world, says
          Jensen, who frequently mentors undergraduate students during
          summer research programs. <br>
          <br>
          “I have seen how intense research activities can inspire UB
          students and educate the next generation of innovators,” says
          Jensen. “Deshawn’s work would allow a family in sunny regions
          to treat drinking water without having to expend energy or
          rely on imported technologies.” <br>
          <br>
          Building a larger water lens that remains efficient is the
          next step in Henry’s research. A family of five would need a
          lens at least three times the size of the device he
          constructed, which was designed to heat one liter of water at
          a time, says Henry.<br>
          <br>
          As fresh water continues to dwindle with recent studies
          showing that global crisis levels will be reached by 2040 and
          corporate water predators seek to hoard this "blue gold,"
          Deshawn Henry's invention could be a welcome practical
          solution to maintaining water sovereignty.<br>

          “The water lens could have a huge impact in developing
          countries.”<br>
          <br>
          Water may appear to be an abundant resource, but in some parts
          of the world clean water is hard to come by.<br>
          <br>
          That could change through the work of Deshawn Henry, a
          sophomore civil engineering major, who researched how to
          improve a 6-foot-tall, self-sustaining magnifying glass.<br>
          <br>
          Properly termed a water lens, the device uses another abundant
          resource — sunlight — to heat and disinfect polluted water.
          Since the frame for the lens can be constructed from commonly
          found materials — wood, plastic sheeting and water — the lens
          can be built for almost no cost, offering an inexpensive

          “The water lens could have a huge impact in developing

          Jensen, professor in the Department of Civil, Structural and

          “Millions of people die every year from diseases and pathogens

          <br>
          Henry studied under Jensen through the UB Louis Stokes
          Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program, which
          connects underrepresented students with research opportunities
          in STEM fields. LSAMP is one of many programs in the Office of
          Undergraduate Education focused on increasing
          experiential-learning opportunities for students.<br>
