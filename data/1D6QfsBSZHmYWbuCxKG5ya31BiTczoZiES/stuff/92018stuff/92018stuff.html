              plant in his capacity as a safety professional, Fritch
              observed first hand a near catastrophe. On 3 August 2018,
              a 100-ton canister filled with highly radioactive nuclear
              waste was being “downloaded” into a temporary transport
              carrier to be moved a few hundred yards from inside the
              plant to a storage silo buried near the world-famous San
              Onofre beach. As the thin-walled canister was being
              lowered into the transport cask, it snagged on a guide
              ledge four feet from the top. Crane operators were unaware
              that the canister had stopped descending and the rigging
              went completely slack, leaving the full weight of the
              heavy canister perched on that ledge by about a
              quarter-inch.<br>
              <br>
              Had the ledge not held for the hour or more it took
              workers to realize and address the error, the thin-walled
              canister of highly toxic nuclear waste would have fallen
              18 feet to the ground below.<br>

              </font></b><font color="#000000">Defects in 3D printed
              parts can cause all sorts of problems, but they’re often
              so small that they can’t be easily detected, if at all.
              Vanderbilt University researchers are the latest to tackle
              the issue of detecting defects in 3D printed objects, and
              have come up with a new way to make those defects visible
              – using gold. The team embedded gold nanoparticles inside
              3D printing material; once an object is 3D printed, the
              gold nanoparticles show up as a <b>deep maroon color</b>,
              highlighting any defects.<br>

                Abstract<br>
              </font></b><font color="#000000">Vaccines are being under
              investigation for the possible side effects they can
              cause. In order to supply new information, an
              electron-microscopy investigation method was applied to
              the study of vaccines, aimed at verifying the presence of
              solid contaminants by means of an Environmental Scanning
              Electron Microscope equipped with an X-ray microprobe. The
              results of this new investigation show the presence of
              micro- and nanosized particulate matter composed of
              inorganic elements in vaccines’ samples which is not
              declared among the components and whose unduly presence
              is, for the time being, inexplicable. A considerable part
              of those particulate contaminants have already been
              verified in other matrices and reported in literature as
              non biodegradable and non biocompatible. The evidence
              collected is suggestive of some hypotheses correlated to
              diseases that are mentioned and briefly discussed...<br>
            </font><b><font color="#000000"><br>
                Conclusion<br>
              </font></b><font color="#000000">The analyses carried out
              show that in all samples checked vaccines contain non
              biocompatible and bio-persistent foreign bodies which are
              not declared by the Producers, against which the body
              reacts in any case. This new investigation represents a
              new quality control that can be adopted to assess the
              safety of a vaccine. Our hypothesis is that this
              contamination is unintentional, since it is probably due
              to polluted components or procedures of industrial
              processes (e.g. filtrations) used to produce vaccines, not
              investigated and not detected by the Producers. If our
              hypothesis is actually the case, a close inspection of the
              working places and the full knowledge of the whole
              procedure of vaccine preparation would probably allow to
              eliminate the problem.<br>
              <br>
              A further purification of the vaccines could improve their
              quality and could probably decrease the number and
              seriousness of the adverse incidental effects.</font></font><font

              with a new revelation by the most credible insider source
              to date. Recently, I was contacted by Dr. Paul Batcho.
              Batcho is a former DARPA senior scientist who worked at
              Los Alamos and held a top secret security clearance. In
              short, Batcho asserts that clandestine forces are
              purposely engaging in “acts of terrorism” against the
              general public through emission of dangerous frequencies
              from cell phone and microwave towers in the St.
              Petersburg/Orlando/ Tampa, Florida area...<br>
              <br>
              Paul Batcho &gt; April 8, 2016<br>
              A?TTN: Telecommunication threat security office, Homeland
              Security<br>
              <br>
              I would like to bring to your attention an ongoing threat
              with regards to harmful communications transmitting from
              the cellular towers in central Florida, and Tampa St
              Petersburg. It is not clear to me whether it is due to the
              USCENTCOM in Tampa or it is targeting US civilians.<br>
              <br>
              I am a former scientist from Los Alamos National Lab in NM
              where I held a Q-Clearance for the DOE (top-secret DoD)
              for several years. I have also worked on DARPA research
              projects. I have a Ph.D. from Princeton and now live in St
              Petersburg and work… (Personal information deleted)…<br>
              <br>
              I seem to have stumbled across an advanced technology that
              I would classify as synthetic telepathy. It clearly uses
              the cellular towers to transmit illegal signals. It sounds
              unbelievable but it is actual technology being used on
              civilians of the US.<br>
              <br>
              My basic research does indicate that such technology can
              exist and dates back to the V2K (P300) mind wave
              technology of the 1970s. This does appear to be a much
              more advanced version that allows open communication of
              human mind to mind bridges...<br>
              <br>
              I am a Ph.D. from Princeton University and a former
              scientist from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New
              Mexico where I worked within nuclear weapon research
              teams. I held a Q clearance (top secret equivalent of
              DoD).&nbsp; I have also worked on DARPA research projects
              as a senior scientist.<br>
              <br>
              There is a technology&nbsp; transmitting RF signals and
              communications at the human brain resonant frequency
              bands, and it is targeting individuals and groups.<br>
              <br>
              These transmissions will cause harmful health affects in
              the form of enhanced microwave radiation illness. It is
              imperative that these frequency bands be measured and
              verified by an official source. These frequency bands do
              not exist naturally, and there is a technology targeting
              individuals.<br>
              <br>
              Cellular transmission’s broadcast at 853 MHz, human brain
              resonance is centered around 450Mhz,&nbsp; and Ham radio
              operators are not allowed to broadcast at the 400Mhz to
              700Mhz band. I would suggest a filtering at the 400Mhz to
              700Mhz band on all microwave and cellular transmissions,
              digital filters should suffice in the near term. Civilians
              are being harmed by the deliberate transmissions of an
              established technology.<br>
              <br>
              The verified measurement and existence of these RF band
              transmissions constitutes a terrorist act. Please advise
              the appropriate security office on Homeland security. This
              is a serious matter that needs immediate attention
              and&nbsp; it must be addressed. Please feel free to
              contact me.<br>
              I would be happy the discuss it.Thank youPaul F.&nbsp;
              Batcho, Ph.D...<br>

              1Please be advised:&nbsp; threat in the St
              Petersburg/Tampa/Orlando Area<br>
              This is&nbsp; follow-up to my previous emails on the
              illegal transmissions of signals from cellular and
              microwave transmission towers<br>
              The technology being used is clearly based on the methods
              outlined in the following patents based on microwave
              transmission directed at human brain frequencies.<br>
              The active technology has been in use for approximately 3
              1/2 years, roughly corresponding to the expiry of the 1992
              and 1994 patents funded by DARPA, US Patent # 5,123,844.
              June 23rd, 1992 US Patent # 5,289,438. February 22nd, 199
              <br>
              These systems stimulate the brain with RF frequencies and
              wave forms.This is not CDMA 450MHz:450MHz-470MHz
              transmissions.<br>
              There is unlawful use of the various lethal aspects of the
              technology.&nbsp; The technology is active and civilians
              are being targeted with harmful health effects. Please
              investigate the transmission of the various frequency
              signals in the 450 MHz range. The band from 437MHz to
              478Mhz with peaks at roughly 6 MHz intervals appear to
              have sizable spectral energy components...</font><b><font

              a synthetic small protein that wraps around a metal core
              composed of iron and sulfur. This protein can be
              repeatedly charged and discharged, allowing it to shuttle
              electrons within a cell. Such peptides may have existed at
              the dawn of life, moving electrons in early metabolic
              cycles.<br>
              <br>
              How did life arise on Earth? Rutgers researchers have
              found among the first and perhaps only hard evidence that
              simple protein catalysts -- essential for cells, the
              building blocks of life, to function -- may have existed
              when life began.<br>
              <br>
              Their study of a primordial peptide, or short protein, is
              published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.<br>
              <br>
              In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the chemist Günter
              Wächtershäuser postulated that life began on iron- and
              sulfur-containing rocks in the ocean. Wächtershäuser and
              others predicted that short peptides would have bound
              metals and served as catalysts of life-producing
              chemistry, according to study co-author Vikas Nanda, an
              associate professor at Rutgers' Robert Wood Johnson
              Medical School.<br>
              <br>
              Human DNA consists of genes that code for proteins that
              are a few hundred to a few thousand amino acids long.
              These complex proteins -- needed to make all living-things
              function properly -- are the result of billions of years
              of evolution. When life began, proteins were likely much
              simpler, perhaps just 10 to 20 amino acids long. With
              computer modeling, Rutgers scientists have been exploring
              what early peptides may have looked like and their
              possible chemical functions, according to Nanda.<br>
              <br>
              The scientists used computers to model a short, 12-amino
              acid protein and tested it in the laboratory. This peptide
              has several impressive and important features. It contains
              only two types of amino acids (rather than the estimated
              20 amino acids that synthesize millions of different
              proteins needed for specific body functions), it is very
              short and it could have emerged spontaneously on the early
              Earth in the right conditions. The metal cluster at the
              core of this peptide resembles the structure and chemistry
              of iron-sulfur minerals that were abundant in early Earth
              oceans. The peptide can also charge and discharge
              electrons repeatedly without falling apart, according to
              Nanda, a resident faculty member at the Center for
              Advanced Technology and Medicine.<br>
              <br>
              "Modern proteins called ferredoxins do this, shuttling
              electrons around the cell to promote metabolism," said
              senior author Professor Paul G. Falkowski, who leads
              Rutgers' Environmental Biophysics and Molecular Ecology
              Laboratory. "A primordial peptide like the one we studied
              may have served a similar function in the origins of
              life."<br>
              <br>
              Falkowski is the principal investigator for a NASA-funded
              ENIGMA project led by Rutgers scientists that aims to
              understand how protein catalysts evolved at the start of
              life. Nanda leads one team that will characterize the full
              potential of the primordial peptide and continue to
              develop other molecules that may have played key roles in
              the origins of life.<br>
              <br>
              With computers, Rutgers scientists have smashed and
              dissected nearly 10,000 proteins and pinpointed four
              "Legos of life" -- core chemical structures that can be
              stacked to form the innumerable proteins inside all
              organisms. The small primordial peptide may be a precursor
              to the longer Legos of life, and scientists can now run
              experiments on how such peptides may have functioned in
              early-life chemistry.<br>

              in the feeling of fear and in processing the relevance of
              emotions, when participants looked at the photograph of
              the unfair player. These two areas correlated with
              feelings of anger: the higher the level of anger reported
              by the participant, the stronger their activity.<br>

              William &amp; Mary and University of Michigan researchers
              transforms our understanding of one of the most important
              laws of modern physics. The discovery, published in the
              journal Nature, has broad implications for science,
              impacting everything from nanotechnology to our
              understanding of the solar system. <br>
              <br>
              “This changes everything, even our ideas about planetary
              formation,” said Mumtaz Qazilbash, associate professor of
              physics at William &amp; Mary and co-author on the paper.
              “The full extent of what this means is an important
              question and, frankly, one I will be continuing to think
              about.” <br>
              <br>
              Qazilbash and two W&amp;M graduate students, Zhen Xing and
              Patrick McArdle, partnered with a team of engineers from
              the University of Michigan to test whether Planck’s
              radiation law, a foundational scientific principle
              grounded in quantum mechanics, applies at the smallest
              length scales.<br>
              <br>
              The other co-authors on the Nature paper include Dakotah
              Thompson, Linxiao Zhu, Rohith Mittapally, Seid Sadat,
              Pramod Reddy and Edgar Meyhofer. Qazilbash’s research was
              funded by the National Science Foundation. <br>
              <br>
              Through a series of experiments, the team was able to show
              Planck’s law does not apply for objects smaller than a
              certain length scale — and the result is 100 times higher
              than what the law would predict. Qazilbash said the real
              challenge was not only proving the discrepancy, but also
              explaining it.<br>
              <br>
              “That’s the thing with physics,” Qazilbash said. “It’s
              important to experimentally measure something, but also
              important to actually understand what is going on.”<br>
              <br>
              Planck’s radiation law is a pillar of modern physics and
              one of the most important results in quantum mechanics.
              Formulated in 1900 by German physicist Max Planck, the law
              is a mathematical equation that explains the relationship
              between the temperature of an object and the energy
              emitted from that object in the form of electromagnetic
              radiation.<br>
              <br>
              At the turn of the 20th century, physicists began to
              understand that, at the atomic level, everything in the
              universe behaves as both a particle and a wave. They came
              to this conclusion by studying light and sub-atomic
              particles. Light is simultaneously a stream of particles
              called photons and a wave of fluctuating electric and
              magnetic fields. The waves of light (of which visible
              light is only a small part of the spectrum) were called
              electromagnetic radiation, a largely invisible interaction
              between all objects in the universe. <br>
              <br>
              “The full spectra of these wavelengths from hot objects
              were measured well before Max Planck came along, but
              nobody understood what was going on,” Qazilbash said. “The
              theories at that time could not explain it.”<br>
              <br>
              Planck theorized an answer that would become the bedrock
              of quantum physics.<br>
              <br>
              “Planck came up with quantization,” Qazilbash said. “His
              theory was that light is not just simply an
              electromagnetic wave, but that it is a quantized
              electromagnetic wave. It’s emitted and absorbed in
              discrete quanta called photons. That’s how he was able to
              explain this phenomena.”<br>
              <br>
              Moreover, Planck based his theory on the hypothesis that a
              photon’s energy depends on its frequency, meaning the
              energy of electromagnetic waves is also quantized. He
              articulated the relationship between energy and frequency
              in his radiation law. Until recently, the law was assumed
              to apply to all objects in the universe.<br>
              <br>
              Then in 2009, physicists attempted to apply the law to two
              objects that were so close there was less than a
              wavelength of radiation between them. The scientists found
              that the law did not hold up when the objects were in what
              is termed the “near field.” Qazilbash and his research
              team decided to test the law in the far field — farther
              apart than a wavelength of radiation — with objects that
              were smaller than a wavelength in thickness.<br>
              <br>
              “What our work shows is that if the objects are very
              small, there is a violation of the law,” Qazilbash said.
              “This has never been experimentally shown before.”<br>
              <br>
              Such an experiment required collaboration between
              disciplines, Qazilbash explained. The William &amp; Mary
              physics team partnered with the engineering department at
              University of Michigan for this project. The wavelengths
              of infrared light that are relevant for testing the law
              were only about 10 microns (about a fifth of the average
              cross-section of a human hair), so the engineers had to
              create an object even smaller. They eventually developed a
              membrane of silicon nitride only a few hundred nanometers
              (or less than half a micron) thick. <br>
              <br>
              To see if the law applied, the researchers placed two
              identical membranes at a relatively large distance apart.
              Next, they heated one of the membranes and measured the
              heat increase in the second. If Planck’s law holds true,
              then the heat increase in the second membrane should have
              been in accord with Planck’s prediction. What the
              researchers found instead was a 100-fold difference in
              radiative heat transfer than what Planck’s law would have
              predicted.<br>
              <br>
              “Planck’s radiation law says if you apply the ideas that
              he formulated to two objects, then you should get a
              defined rate of energy transfer between the two,”
              Qazilbash said. “Well, what we have observed
              experimentally is that rate is actually 100 times higher
              than Planck’s law predicts if the objects are very, very
              small.”<br>
              <br>
              The reason for such a huge disparity has to do with the
              nature of waves, Qazilbash explained.<br>
              <br>
              “Think of a guitar string,” he said. “It has some
              fundamental resonances. The frets are at a particular
              length to align with the best harmonics. If you pluck it
              in those places, it’s going to resonate at certain
              wavelengths more efficiently. It’s the same thing here
              with light. If the material and geometry of an object are
              such that electromagnetic waves can couple more
              effectively to it, then it will emit and absorb radiation
              more effectively.”<br>
              <br>
              The implications for discovering a 100-fold discrepancy in
              Planck’s radiation law are broad and touch nearly all
              aspects of modern physics, Qazilbash said. In the digital
              age, hardware developers are looking for ways to design
              smaller and faster technology. This discovery has the
              potential to change the future of nanotechnology. <br>
              <br>
              “Now we know that nanoscale objects can emit and absorb
              radiation much more effectively than we ever thought was
              possible,” Qazilbash said.<br>
              <br>
              Qazilbash added that it’s not only a revelation for
              small-scale objects and nanotechnology. The discovery also
              relates to climate science, planetary atmospheres,
              astrophysics and the makeup of solar systems. <br>
              <br>
              “This discovery touches so many fields,” Qazilbash said.
              “Wherever you have radiation playing an important role in
              physics and science, that’s where this discovery is
              important.”</font><b><font color="#000000"><br>

              Scientists have developed a way to transform sunlight into
              fuel that could lead to an 'unlimited source of renewable
              energy'.<br>
              <br>
              Researchers from the University of Cambridge have reached
              this 'milestone' by splitting water into hydrogen and
              oxygen.<br>
              <br>
              They did this through using a technique called
              semi-artificial photosynthesis that is based on the same
              process plants use to convert sunlight into energy.<br>
              <br>
              Hydrogen, which is produced when the water is split, could
              potentially be a green and unlimited source of renewable
              energy.<br>
              <br>
              Researchers did this by reactivating hydrogenase, an
              enzyme present in algae, that can reduce protons into
              hydrogen.<br>
              <br>
              Researchers converted sunlight to water into hydrogen and
              oxygen using a mixture of photosynthesis and manmade
              technologies (pictured)<br>
              <br>
              Oxygen is produced as a by-product of photosynthesis when
              the water absorbed by plants is 'split'.<br>
              <br>
              It is one of the most important reactions on the planet
              because it is the source of nearly all of the world's
              oxygen.<br>
              <br>
              Researchers used natural sunlight to convert water into
              hydrogen and oxygen using a mixture of biological
              components and manmade technologies. <br>
              <br>
              Academics at the Reisner Laboratory in Cambridge's
              Department of Chemistry developed the new technique of
              solar-driven water-splitting.<br>

              Dr Erwin Reisner, Head of the Reisner Laboratory, a Fellow
              of St John's College, University of Cambridge, and one of
              the paper's authors, described the research as a

              thaliana seeds were exposed to left and right torsion
              field for 30, 60 and 90 minutes. The field was generated
              using the Comfort-7, a device that besides axial and
              radial components of axion field has also an azimuth
              component. After exposure the seeds were evaluated for
              energy and capacity of germination. Comparing the results
              obtained for seeds exposed to left and right torsion field
              and unexposed seeds, the influence of torsion fields
              improved the energy of germination by an overall
              difference of 36.6% and 39.33%. For the seeds exposed to
              left torsion field, the higher the time of exposure, the
              greater results were obtained; the energy of germination
              increased by 14% at 60 minutes and 28.33% for 90 minutes

              The present invention relates to the field of chemistry
              and can be used for the production of chemical elements:
              metals, non-metals, their alloys, heavy water and hydrogen
              from natural minerals (ores), ash, slag, dust and other
              wastes, including metal...<br>
              <br>
              The generation of high-temperature plasma in the flow of
              water with and without additives (below the initial
              substance) is accomplished by a pulsed electric discharge
              in the narrowing of the working cavity in the zone of
              maximum intensity of the magnetic field induced and
              self-amplifying as a result of self-amplification of the
              electric current between the electrodes of the claimed
              device.<br>
              <br>
              This combination of actions for obtaining high-temperature
              plasma and obtaining new elements from the initial
              substance does not occur and does not occur in any of the
              known methods and devices for obtaining new elements by
              the transformation of the atomic-molecular structure of
              the starting materials.<br>
              <br>
              The process of stabilizing the existence of the
              high-temperature plasma generated by the claimed method in
              the inventive device is performed by the constant presence
              of an additional electric current in the working cavity in
              the flow of the high-temperature plasma formed, which is
              not used in any of the known methods and devices for
              obtaining new elements from the starting material.<br>
              <br>
              The additional current is directed from one extended
              section of the high-temperature plasma flow through the
              constriction to the other, which is also new both in
              plasma technology and in the methods for obtaining new
              elements from any starting material.<br>
              <br>
              The claimed device makes it possible to carry out phase
              transformations of the initial substance (water and the
              additives contained in it) of the fifth and sixth kind,
              i.e. according to the well-known figurative expression of
              Acad. VO Ginzburg (see his book. About physics and

              electrons from all the atoms of the initial substance and,
              thereby, to create conditions for the partial self-decay
              of the nuclei and the creation of new elements from the
              nuclei formed, and without disturbing the paired
              proton-neutron bonds and, therefore, without the formation

              ...A method for obtaining stable isotopes due to the
              nuclear synthesis of elements in microbiological cultures
              is known, including the preparation of a nutrient medium
              for the growth of microbiological cultures deficient in
              the isotope obtained as a result of transmutation and
              containing the initial isotopic components necessary for
              transmutation; cultivation in a nutrient medium of
              microbiological cultures that require these isotopes for
              their growth; isolation from the culture medium of the
              grown culture and isolation of stable isotopes [2] In the
              known method, the procedure for growing microbiological
              cultures of Aspergillus niger IFO 4066, Penicillium
              chrysogenum IFO 4689; Phizopus nigricans IFO 5781; Mucor
              rouxii IFO 0369; Saccharomuces cerevisiae IFO 0308;
              Torulopsis utilis IFO 0396; Saccharomyces ellipideus IFO
              0213; Hansenula anomala IFO 0118 in nutrient media, which
              are an aqueous solution of a number of chemical compounds
              and deficient in one of the components necessary for the
              growth of cultures (potassium, magnesium, iron, calcium)
              and, for control, in their standard media.<br>
              <br>
              In experiments on the implementation of the method, it was
              shown that when these crops were grown in media that were
              deficient in the corresponding element (there were no
              specific elements in these media at all), these elements
              were present in the culture obtained, which can be due
              only to their synthesis during nuclear transmutation from
              other elements present and isotopes. For example,
              magnesium was formed according to the reaction scheme Na23
              + p1 → Mg24 The drawback of the known method consists in
              the low probability of the necessary nuclear transmutation
              reaction due to unoptimized temperature conditions and the
              ionic-molecular composition of the nutrient medium, which
              is manifested in a small number of atoms or ions.<br>
              <br>
              The experience of conducting research on low-temperature
              nuclear fusion shows that such reactions are successful
              only with a special selection of the properties of the
              medium and temperature. In addition, the number of
              possible types of stable isotopes produced in the known
              method and corresponding to one of the main elements of
              which the microbial culture to be grown is insufficient.
              There are many types of isotopes, the preparation of which
              is of great interest, but which are not constituent parts
              of microbiological cultures.<br>
              <br>
              The aim of the invention is to increase the rate of
              production of stable isotopes and increase the number of
              types of stable isotopes obtained.<br>
              <br>
              This is achieved by the fact that in the known method of
              obtaining stable isotopes due to nuclear transmutation of
              the type of low-temperature nuclear synthesis of elements
              in microbiological cultures, including the preparation of
              a nutrient medium for growth of microbiological cultures
              deficient in the isotope obtained as a result of
              transmutation and containing the initial isotope
              components necessary for transmutation ; cultivation in a
              nutrient medium of microbiological cultures that require
              these isotopes for their growth and development; isolation
              from the nutrient medium of the grown culture and
              isolation of stable isotopes on the nutrient medium are
              influenced by factors that increase in it the
              concentration of free atoms or hydrogen ions due to the
              destruction of interatomic bonds.<br>
              <br>
              In addition, the culture medium can be formed on the basis
              of heavy water D2O.<br>
              <br>
              In addition, the nutrient medium contains the initial
              isotope components necessary for transmutation, for which
              the result of the synthesis reaction are unstable isotopes
              for the nutrient medium, which are necessary for the
              growth and formation of microbiological cultures and are
              maternal with respect to the final daughter stable
              isotopes.<br>
              <br>
              As a factor destroying the interatomic bonds, additive
              solution LiOH or LiOD, as well as ionizing radiation, is
              used in the nutrient medium....</font><b><font

          [0003] This invention relates generally to electrical

          <b>[0004] 2. Background </b><br>
          <br>
          [0005] The Searl Effect provides a way for extracting clean
          and sustainable electrical energy. The Searl Effect Generator
          provides three uniquely magnetized fixed stator rings having
          patterns setup to generate continual motion of similarly
          magnetized cylindrical rollers. The rollers have both freedom
          of spin and rotation around the stator which generates both
          mechanical and electrical power. <br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <br>
          [0006] The present invention relates to electron spin and the
          field of spintronics and provides for a spintronic generator.
          The present invention utilizes the application of large
          magnetic fields pulsed to micro sized magnetic fields to take
          advantage of magnetic tunnel junctions (hereinafter “MTJ”).
          Additional motive power is attained from Multiple Exciton
          Generation (hereinafter “MEG”), whereby a single absorbed
          photon of appropriately high energy can produce more than one
          electron-hole pair per absorbed photon. <br>
          <br>
          [0007] The present invention provides electrical power with
          the motive force of natural electron spin. The utilization of
          natural electron spin can be enhanced with carefully matched
          materials, weights, and magnetic waveforms which provide
          precise pulsed frequencies in resonance with the materials.
          This resonance of the magnetic pulses coordinates the newly
          defined spintronics, MTJ, and MEG to provide clean abundant
          power. A utilization of the Zero Point Energy results in a
          local environment temperature drop which can be one of the
          sources of motive force. The harvesting of electricity can be
          via standard induction pick up coils controlled by direct
          current motor controllers using an LRC tank circuit... <br>

          Research to calculate amount of ‘space grease’ in the Milky
          Way found enough for 40 trillion trillion trillion packs of
          butter<br>
          by Hannah Devlin Science correspondent <br>
          <br>
          The study provides the most precise estimate yet of the amount
          of ‘space grease’ in the Milky Way. <br>
          <br>
          It looks cold, dark and empty, but astronomers have revealed
          that interstellar space is permeated with a fine mist of
          grease-like molecules.<br>
          <br>
          The study provides the most precise estimate yet of the amount
          of “space grease” in the Milky Way, by recreating the
          carbon-based compounds in the laboratory. The
          Australian-Turkish team discovered more than expected: 10
          billion trillion trillion tonnes of gloop, or enough for 40
          trillion trillion trillion packs of butter.<br>
          <br>
          Prof Tim Schmidt, a chemist at the University of New South
          Wales, Sydney and co-author of the study, said that the
          windscreen of a future spaceship travelling through
          interstellar space might be expected to get a sticky coating.<br>
          <br>
          “Amongst other stuff it’ll run into is interstellar dust,
          which is partly grease, partly soot and partly silicates like
          sand,” he said, adding that the grease is swept away within
          our own solar system by the solar wind...<br>

              Detection</b><br>
            <b>by Robert Shrewsbury</b><br>
            <b>May 26th 2018 </b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Here is a small sample of gold bearing ore in the mono-atomic
          state. It is usually associated with calcium-alkali element
          deposits and often has gold, silver and platinum group metals
          in it, in the mono-atomic state. A standard fire assay will
          only vaporize the precious metals and send them up-out the
          chimney. It takes a special treatments to bring mono-atomic
          metals down to visible/usable solid metal dense state and I
          have done this repeatedly in the&nbsp; past as part of my
          learning and discovery.<br>
          <br>
          These mono-atomic metals have a very high-energy-spin and when
          stimulated send out very strong signals and I have also done a
          lot of tests with this.&nbsp; Look at the white (Google Earth
          Image) outcropping with the cedar trees, this is a sample of
          this type of un-recognized precious metals bearing ore. <br>
          <br>
          Now then when electronically/frequency stimulating precious
          metals for detection, these mono-atomic particles send out
          such strong signals that it also overwhelms and cloaks a real
          target that prospectors and treasure hunters alike get fooled
          a bunch and dig a lot of empty holes around the countryside.
          This adds another addition to "ghost reads". This is another
          leg of my research! Also Red-Spruce, Aspen, Eucalyptus, Cedar,
          Mulberry trees and a few other have a lot of mono-atomic
          precious metals in them and that is another signal problem in
          the detection field.<br>
          <br>
          In the world of unusual health this (calcium/alkali) element
          is related to what if also called "ORMUS" and people make it
          by dissolving precious metals and taking them to the
          mono-atomic state and then ingesting them. Gold ORMUS will
          make the brain work better as will Iridium/platinum and
          Platinum -proper will cure alcoholism very-well if made
          properly.<br>
          <br>
          A few years back I participated in some tests with this ORMUS
          material taken from Aspen trees (with Lamar Porter of Grand
          Junction Colorado) this we put in an alkali battery in his
          Ford Pickup and it increased the gas mileage from 14 to 24/25
          miles to the gallon although we had to change the engine
          timing a bit for it to run well, because this high energy
          addition changed the timing in the engine and we had to
          compensate.&nbsp; <br>

          For anyone who has ever been a reader, there’s much to
          sympathize with in Maryanne Wolf’s Reader, Come Home. The UCLA
          neuroscientist, a great lover of literature, tries to read
          Hermann Hesse’s Glass Bead Game, an old favorite, only to
          realize that she finds him boring and too complex. She wonders
          why he ever won a Nobel. And Wolf, who previously wrote Proust
          and the Squid: The Story and Science of the Reading Brain, is
          horrified that this is what has happened to her ability to
          concentrate.<br>
          <br>
          Reader, Come Home is about, as its subtitle states, “the
          reading brain in a digital world.” The Verge spoke to Wolf
          about how technology is changing the brain, what we lose when
          we lose deep attention, and what to do about it.<b>..<br>

          <b> </b><b>Abstract<br>
          </b>Telomeres ordinarily shrink by 1% annually, from birth to
          death. The telomeres of people with unhealthy habits have much
          faster shrinkage, while those of people with the best habits
          and genes shrink at a slower rate, thus enabling such people
          to live to approximately 100 years. Ultimately, telomere
          health is a major determinant of health and longevity.
          Rejuvenation or regrowth of telomeres is, therefore, a major
          key to longevity and health.<br>
          <br>
          In a pilot study, telomeres in 6 individuals, 3 men and 3
          women from 50 to 74 years of age, were measured initially in
          lymphocytes and neutrophils. Each participant then spent 30
          minutes at least 5 days each week sitting or lying in an
          electromagnetic field of 54 to 78 GHz, 50 to 75 decibels, or 1
          billionth of a watt per centimeter square.<br>
          <br>
          These same frequencies are reported to be present in ambient
          sunlight at an intensity of ten-billionths of a watt per
          centimeter square. Human DNA has been reported by Ukrainian
          physicists as resonating at 54 to 78 GHz.<br>
          <br>
          After 3 months of this electromagnetically generated solar
          homeopathic approach, average telomere length had increased
          1%. After 10 months of use of the device, average telomere
          length had increased 2.9%. Theoretically this "reverses" 2.9
          years of telomere aging.<br>
          <br>
          Using this approach, a 75 year old would theoretically reverse
          telomere aging by 50 years within a 14 year period. Obviously,
          many other parameters of health need to be evaluated as we
          continue these studies long term.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Telomere Rejuventation</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          In 1925 a Russian engineer, Georges Lakhovsky, published his
          classic book, The Creation of Health, in French. It was
          translated into English in 1935 and is still in print. He
          stated that human DNA has a resonant frequency of 50+
          gigahertz (GHz – billions of cycles per second).<br>
          <br>
          In the early 1980s, Ukrainian physicists determined that this
          frequency was 54-78 GHz and further reported that a majority
          of illnesses were "cured" by applying these frequencies to
          acupuncture points. Lakhovsky further reported "curing" many
          illnesses, including cancer, by applying a Tesla coil to two
          copper coils placed three feet apart with patients sitting in
          the center of these coils with the head near the center of the
          field induced by the Tesla coil. Tesla coils emit a random
          range of frequencies from 1 Hz up to at least 100 GHz.<br>
          <br>
          In 1994, under an IRB protocol, 75 patients were treated with
          a modification of the Lakhovsky apparatus.1 Twenty-five
          patients each had rheumatoid arthritis, depression or chronic
          back pain. They sat for 60 minutes daily, 5 days a week for 2
          weeks, in a 24 inch square cubicle, 48 inches high, with
          copper plates on the walls and a copper tubing pyramid over
          the base so that the copper pyramid and the copper base were
          physically connected. A Tesla coil was connected to the copper
          tubing and activated during the treatment. At the end of 2
          weeks, 70% of the patients with depression or rheumatoid
          arthritis were markedly improved but only half of the back
          patients improved (Fig. 1).<br>
          <br>
          Shortly after that, a portable transcutaneous electrical nerve
          stimulator (TENS) was developed. This device included output
          of 54-78 GHz at 50-75 decibels of energy, the same intensity
          used in the Ukraine. Five specific acupuncture circuits were
          activated with this GigaTENS device and specifically raised
          the DHEA, neurotensin, aldosterone or calcitonin, while the
          5th one lowered free radicals significantly. All of these
          studies, except for aldosterone, have been published.2,3,4 The
          circuit that raises DHEA was subsequently proven to treat
          successfully 70 to 80% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis,
          migraine, diabetic neuropathy, or depression. Stimulation at
          these frequencies also increases calcitonin and lowers free
          radicals.<br>
          <br>
          Despite the neurochemical and potential clinical benefits,
          most individuals offered the opportunity to use these circuits
          would not spend the 30 minutes daily required for such
          treatment. Since the Ukrainians had stated that these Giga
          frequencies are absorbed through the skin, specifically
          through acupuncture points, it appeared that the only
          reasonable way to immerse the body in these fields, without
          great effort on the part of the individual, was to provide the
          field while participants were lying down. Eventually this led
          to the creation of a 2-inch thick polyfoam mat in the center
          of which is a copper screen with crushed sapphire crystal
          placed over it. Copper wire from the center of that mat leads
          to the Tesla coil. When the Tesla coil is activated, a field
          of 54-78 GHz 2 feet high and around the mat is produced. Six
          individuals volunteered to participate in the study. Blood was
          drawn initially for analysis of telomere length of
          granulocytes and lymphocytes.<br>
          <br>
          Three and one half months later, telomere length was measured
          again and in 4 of the 6 subjects, telomere length had
          increased by approximately 1%. At the end of 10 months, blood
          was again drawn and telomere length had increased an average
          of 2.9%. Telomeres ordinarily shrink 1% every year from birth
          forward.<br>
          <br>
          Telomeres are responsible not only for the length of life but
          also the integrity of DNA and thus ultimately for health
          itself. Individuals using this approach can place the 2-inch
          mat on top of their mattress, plug it into a timer that can go
          off in 30 to 60 minutes while they are sleeping and obtain the
          benefit of "lying in a field effect of human DNA." Continuing
          studies will be done. All telomere blood tests were done at a
          reference lab, Repeat Diagnostics.<br>

          hollow inside each ankle; Conception vessel I-the hollow in
          center of perineum, or CV 2-at the top of the genitals, center
          of pubic bone; CV 6, Bladder 22-for adrenals; CV 6 is about
          1-1/2 cm below the umbilicus; B22 is 2 cm lateral to spinous
          process of 2nd lumbar vertebra; CV 18-1-112 cm below sternal
          notch ; Master of Heart 6-the sympathetic control points, 2 cm
          above wrist, on anterior forearm in center; Large Intestine
          I8-Window of the Sky, located 1 cm below the tip of the
          mastoids in the center between the sternocleidomastoid and the
          trapezius muscles Governing Vessel20-at the center top of the
          head above top of ears. (Interestingly, this is the center of
          the crown chakra).<br>
          <br>
          <b>TREATMENT</b><b><br>
          </b>Using a GigaTENS unit we applied 52-78 Ghz at one
          billionth of a watt/cm2 for 3 mins. to each point on the Ring
          of Fire, daily for 12 weeks. This was initially carried out on
          6 healthy, asymptomatic adult men... Results are seen in Table
          II. Note that in each individual DHEA increased 50 to 600/0,
          moving these individuals towards the mean and more optimal
          values.<br>
          <br>
          <b>DISCUSSION</b><b><br>
          </b>We have many hundreds of measurements of DHEA in patients
          with a variety of illnesses as well as in a number of healthy
          adults who live a usual American life of modern stress. In
          some individuals we have repeated measurements over months of
          time. Although there are slight variations (10 to 15%) with
          time of day and seasons, these are never of the 50% range.
          This information is to be reported in other papers
          specifically related to DHEA. Theoretically, if DHEA levels
          are maintained at 550 ng/dl up in women and 750 ng/dl up in
          men, they remain healthy throughout a long life. No other
          chemical appears to be so closely related to overall health
          and no other is so clearly a reflection of adrenal reserves.<br>
          The concept of the Ring of Fire is not present in acupuncture
          cosmology. There we do find the Tchong Mo circuit which
          involves kidneys and gonads, adrenals or thyroid connected to
          Master of the Heart. Activation of gonad Tchong Mo has been
          reported to control PMS in women and to restore fertility in 2
          out of 3 infertile men.9 One might activate only the adrenal
          Tchong Mo (SP4, K3, B22, MH6) to see whether this would
          restore the energetic/biochemical integrity of the adrenal
          gland or DHEA. There are other theoretical ways of restoring
          DHEA homeostasis. These include exposure to natural sunlight,
          natural progesterone, major stress reduction, meditative
          visualization, and active physical exercise.<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
          We suggest that DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) is the major
          marker for adrenal reserves, which are depleted by constant
          adaptation to increasing environmental stress. We further
          theorize that a central electromagnetic circuit, the Ring of
          Fire, maintains homeostasis of the adrenal system. And we
          propose that stimulation of the Ring of Fire at 52 to 78
          billion cycles per second (Ghz) at one billionth of a watt per
          cm2 can restore DHEA levels in depleted individuals. Initial
          results in 6 otherwise healthy individuals support this
          theory, with increases of 50 to 600/0 in 0 HEA after
          relatively brief periods of stimulation. Other possible ways
          of restoring DHEA are mentioned. If DHEA can be maintained or
          restored to optimal levels (at or above the mean), we suggest,
          based on a variety of evidence, that health and longevity will
          also be optimized.<br>

          An isotropic fluid composed of nanosized motors organizes into
          an autonomous machine that pumps fluid through long channels.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          Transport of fluid through a pipe is essential for the
          operation of macroscale machines and microfluidic devices.
          Conventional fluids only flow in response to external
          pressure. We demonstrate that an active isotropic fluid,
          composed of microtubules and molecular motors, autonomously
          flows through meter-long three-dimensional channels. We
          establish control over the magnitude, velocity profile, and
          direction of the self-organized flows and correlate these to
          the structure of the extensile microtubule bundles. The
          inherently three-dimensional transition from bulk-turbulent to
          confined-coherent flows occurs concomitantly with a transition
          in the bundle orientational order near the surface and is
          controlled by a scale-invariant criterion related to the
          channel profile. The nonequilibrium transition of confined
          isotropic active fluids can be used to engineer self-organized
          soft machines.<br>

          The Fukushima disaster was the most significant nuclear
          incident since the April 26, 1986 Chernobyl disaster and the
          second disaster to be given the Level 7 event classification
          of the International Nuclear Event Scale. The disaster was
          initiated primarily by the tsunami following the Tohoku
          earthquake on 11 March 2011. Immediately after the earthquake,
          the active reactors automatically shut down their sustained
          fission reactions. However, the tsunami disabled the emergency
          generators that would have provided power to control and
          operate the pumps necessary to cool the reactors. The
          insufficient cooling led to three nuclear meltdowns,
          hydrogen-air explosions, and the release of radioactive
          material. But the danger didn't end there...<br>

          <b>Summary</b><br>
          <b> </b>Stem-cell-based therapies can potentially reverse
          organ dysfunction and diseases, but the removal of impaired
          tissue and activation of a program leading to organ
          regeneration pose major challenges. In mice, a 4-day fasting
          mimicking diet (FMD) induces a stepwise expression of Sox17
          and Pdx-1, followed by Ngn3-driven generation of
          insulin-producing ß cells, resembling that observed during
          pancreatic development. FMD cycles restore insulin secretion
          and glucose homeostasis in both type 2 and type 1 diabetes
          mouse models. In human type 1 diabetes pancreatic islets,
          fasting conditions reduce PKA and mTOR activity and induce
          Sox2 and Ngn3 expression and insulin production. The effects
          of the FMD are reversed by IGF-1 treatment and recapitulated
          by PKA and mTOR inhibition. These results indicate that a FMD
          promotes the reprogramming of pancreatic cells to restore
          insulin generation in islets from T1D patients and reverse
          both T1D and T2D phenotypes in mouse models.<br>

        <div align="center"><b>THE SELF-RECHARGING BATTERY SUPPLY OF
            CARLOS F. BENITEZ BY PETER LINDEMANN</b><br>
        </div>
        <div align="left"><br>
          John Bedini has shown a "three-battery" circuit on his website
          for over 20 years, which works by the potential difference
          between the positives of three batteries in a specific
          arrangement. It shows that potential difference is what
          matters and not necessarily polarity. Ed Gray had a motor that
          ran on a process called "Splitting the Positive" and this is
          directly related to the three-battery system in principle. The
          well-known "Tesla Switch", which came from Ronald Brandt has
          nothing to do with Tesla, but is related to what Peter is
          presenting on and it operates a load between two negatives. I
          presented on a cold electricity circuit a couple years ago and
          it also operates a load between two negatives. These are all
          overunity circuits, which have one thing in common, they all
          appear to have their roots in one man's work and that is the
          Self-Recharging Battery Supply of Carlos F. Benitez.<br>
          <br>
          Peter demonstrated a large SG, which kept itself charged up a
          couple years ago - that was the "Beyond SG" presentation. Last
          year, RS Stafford repeated this demonstrated with a "poor
          man's" method that only required breakers from the hardware
          store. It also kept itself charged up and demonstrated more
          work than the net loss from the batteries. These are all
          related to the Benitez system.<br>
          <br>
          Conversations and replication attempts of Benitez's system
          have been going on for quite some time but only a few have
          made it work such as a few members in Energetic Forum.<br>
          <br>
          Peter Lindemann demonstrated a system at the 2018 ESTC that
          ran on one battery bank, while charging another and it ran a
          motor/generator. The batteries charged up more than they
          discharged and that was with low quality garden start
          batteries, which is the worst case scenario. That shows that
          this system will shine with real deep cycle batteries that are
          larger and have very low impedance. Low impedance batteries
          are the key and this has been proven by John Bedini and Peter
          Lindemann over many years.<br>
          <br>
          What you are about to see is the SIMPLEST, CHEAPEST and LOWEST
          TECH method to replicate the Carlos F. Benitez system that has
          ever been disclosed. After this, it will be hard for anyone to
          have an excuse to not have a self-charging system. This
          presentation shows the circuit, diagrams, patents and it
          includes a PDF companion guide to support your efforts. You're
          free to search Carlos F. Benitez and try to figure it out
          yourself, but unless you can decipher his language of what
          means what, then you will not get very far. Hence, the fact
          that besides Peter, only two others that we know of have
          achieved overunity with this concept - and that is over quite
          a few years.<br>
          <br>
          Peter's presentation is about 45 minutes and is the only time
          Benitez's system has been disclosed in this manner for what it
          is - an intro to the history, the operating theory, some
          revelations that Peter had that made it make sense and Peter's
          very specific schematics on how to build the system. Our hope
          is that replicating this exact method will take off and will
          become even more popular than the Bedini SG. This is SCALABLE,
          which means you can build this as big as you want!<br>

            cancer</b><br>
        </div>
        <div align="left"> &nbsp;<br>
          Garlic may be used to treat brain cancers, The Times reported
          on September 1 2007. The newspaper reported that scientists
          had found that certain organic compounds in garlic kill
          tumours. The type of tumour in question, glioblastoma, tends
          to kill people soon after they are diagnosed.<br>
          <br>
          The article continues that it will be several years until this
          finding can be used for the treatment of cancer. In the
          meantime, the researchers recommend making the most of
          garlic’s “potential cancer-preventing powers”, by peeling it
          and leaving for 15 minutes before cooking to release the
          enzyme that contains the “anti-cancer” compounds.<br>
          <br>
          This study is based on research looking at the effects of
          garlic compounds on brain cancer cells grown in the
          laboratory. The Times story correctly includes some note of
          caution about the fact that therapies based on these findings
          are a long way off. The study did not assess whether eating
          garlic could prevent cancer, or the effects of garlic
          compounds in people with tumours; it only looked at brain
          tumour cells grown in the laboratory.<br>
          <br>
          This study cannot tell us what benefits we might gain from
          eating garlic, and we certainly should not change our
          consumption of garlic based on this study.<br>
          <br>
          Where did the story come from?<br>
          <br>
          Dr Arabinda Das, and colleagues from the Medical University of
          South Carolina carried out this research. The study was funded
          in part by the National Cancer Institute and the National
          Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The study was
          published in the peer-reviewed medical journal: Cancer.<br>
          <br>
          What kind of scientific study was this?<br>
          <br>
          This was a laboratory study assessing the effects of garlic
          compounds on brain tumour cells.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers grew human glioblastoma (a type of brain
          tumour) cells in the laboratory. They then treated some of
          these cells with increasing concentrations of three compounds
          found in garlic. Other cells which were not treated with these
          compounds were used as controls. They then looked at whether
          the treated and control cells survived. They also looked at
          what changes were happening in the cells that might explain
          how and why they lived or died.<br>
          <br>
          What were the results of the study?<br>
          <br>
          The researchers found that all three compounds caused more
          glioblastoma cells to die (by a method known as apoptosis)
          than was observed in the untreated control cells. The higher
          the concentration of the compound used, the more cells died.<br>
          <br>
          The researchers then reported their results and went into
          in-depth analysis about the biochemical changes occurring in
          these cells.<br>
          <br>
          What interpretations did the researchers draw from these
          results?<br>
          <br>
          The researchers concluded that garlic compounds cause human
          glioblastoma cells to die by apoptosis. They also drew
          conclusions about what biochemical changes might play a role
          in this cell death.<br>
          <br>
          What does the NHS Knowledge Service make of this study?<br>
          <br>
          This was a laboratory study, and no conclusions about the
          effects of garlic on human health can be drawn from it.<br>
          <br>
          This study did not look at the effects of eating garlic in
          people who have glioblastoma; it also did not look at whether
          eating garlic prevents people developing cancer. In addition,
          this study did not look at the effects of these garlic
          compounds on healthy human cells; therefore it is possible
          that these compounds also kill healthy cells.<br>
          <br>
          Based on this studies findings, we shouldn’t believe that
          eating garlic will prevent or cure cancer.<br>
          Sir Muir Gray adds…<br>
          <br>
          Many powerful drugs have been developed from plants and it is
          to be hoped that many more will be discovered. Plants or plant
          extracts can now be more easily tested in laboratory studies
          with those that show promise being developed for human trials.
          For this reason, it is important that we try to prevent the
          loss of any more plant, or animal, species. It is also
          important to be realistic about the number of plants to be
          tested and the low probability that a promising lab result
          will become a successful human treatment...<br>

              Garlic-Derived Chemical, Z-ajoene, as a Glioblastoma
              Multiforme Cancer Stem Cell-Specific Targeting Agent</b><br>
            <b> </b><b>Yuchae Jung, et al.</b><br>

          <b> </b><br>
          <b> </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
          <b> </b>Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most
          common brain malignancies and has a very poor prognosis.
          Recent evidence suggests that the presence of cancer stem
          cells (CSC) in GBM and the rare CSC subpopulation that is
          resistant to chemotherapy may be responsible for the treatment
          failure and unfavorable prognosis of GBM. A garlic-derived
          compound, Z-ajoene, has shown a range of biological
          activities, including anti-proliferative effects on several
          cancers. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that
          Z-ajoene specifically inhibits the growth of the GBM CSC
          population. CSC sphere-forming inhibition was achieved at a
          concentration that did not exhibit a cytotoxic effect in
          regular cell culture conditions. The specificity of this
          inhibitory effect on the CSC population was confirmed by
          detecting CSC cell surface marker CD133 expression and
          biochemical marker ALDH activity. In addition, stem
          cell-related mRNA profiling and real-time PCR revealed the
          differential expression of CSC-specific genes, including
          Notch, Wnt, and Hedgehog, upon treatment with Z-ajoene. A
          proteomic approach, i.e., reverse-phase protein array (RPPA)
          and Western blot analysis, showed decreased SMAD4, p-AKT,
          14.3.3 and FOXO3A expression. The protein interaction map
          (http://string-db.org/) of the identified molecules suggested
          that the AKT, ERK/p38 and TGFß signaling pathways are key
          mediators of Z–ajoene’s action, which affects the
          transcriptional network that includes FOXO3A. These biological
          and bioinformatic analyses collectively demonstrate that
          Z-ajoene is a potential candidate for the treatment of GBM by
          specifically targeting GBM CSCs. We also show how this
          systemic approach strengthens the identification of new
          therapeutic agents that target CSCs.<br>

          Ocean temperatures continue to rise, and scientists are
          extremely alarmed as a mass die-off of sea creatures appears
          to be imminent.&nbsp; This week, environmental experts were
          stunned when ocean water off of the San Diego coast hit an
          all-time record high of 81.3 degrees Fahrenheit.&nbsp; Daily
          measurements began all the way back in 1916, and since that
          time a higher ocean temperature has never been recorded off of
          the California coast.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this is not an
          isolated incident.&nbsp; Studies have shown that ocean
          temperatures have been rising rapidly all over the planet, and
          this has already had a devastating impact on many
          ecosystems.&nbsp; The oceans are the foundation of the food
          chain, and if sea life starts dying off on a massive scale it
          could mean unprecedented famine all over the planet...<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two buoys off the coast of San Diego last
          week recorded what researchers believe could be the highest
          temperature ever measured in California waters.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sea-surface temperature of 81.3 degrees
          was logged Thursday by both the Torrey Pines buoy (7.3 miles
          offshore) and the neighboring Scripps Nearshore buoy (.7 miles
          from the coast). The buoys are two of 25 managed by Scripps
          Institution of Oceanography in California...<br>

        <div align="center"><b>Glioblastoma Brain Tumors And Aspartame</b><br>
          <b>By Dr. Betty Martini, D.Hum</b><br>
        </div>
        <div align="left"><br>
          Several have asked me if John McCain used aspartame since it
          is well known it breaks down to diketopiperazine, a brain
          tumor agent that caused brain tumors in original
          studies.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can find no reference.&nbsp; The
          problem is aspartame is in so many drugs and&nbsp; many
          products unlabeled.&nbsp; The FDA actually allowed aspartame
          in 17 dairy products without labeling.&nbsp; When you pour
          half and half in your coffee do you know if it has aspartame
          in it?&nbsp; Dr. Ralph Walton who has done studies on
          aspartame told me aspartame is in all gums.<br>
          <br>
          Senator Ted Kennedy died 9 years ago on the same day as John
          McCain, August 25th,.&nbsp;&nbsp; He knew about
          aspartame.&nbsp; He was reported to have chewed gum but there
          was no reference to him knowingly using aspartame
          otherwise.&nbsp;&nbsp; From "Aspartame: History of A Killer -
          The Whole Story:&nbsp; https://rense.com/general50/ killer.htm
          ,&nbsp; by Dr. Arthur Evangelista who formerly worked for FDA
          are these statements:<br>
          <br>
          Senator Edward Kennedy at the April 8, 1976 hearings before
          the Senate Subcommittee on Labor and Public Welfare stated
          (Se. Ted Kennedy 1976):<br>
          <br>
          "The extensive nature of the almost unbelievable range of
          abuses discovered by the FDA on several major Searle products
          is profoundly disturbing."<br>
          <br>
          "In all of the studies at Searle which have been examined by
          the FDA in its investigation, the scope of the material being
          considered included seven years of observation, from 1968 to
          date, in 57 studies involving more than 5,700 animals with
          over 228 million observations and calculations."<br>
          However, their deliberate misconduct and "lies" (as put by FDA
          Investigator, Dr. Adrian Gross) invalidated their experiments
          for the following reasons:<br>
          <br>
          * Many of the problems with the studies included horrendous
          experimental designs, questions regarding dosage given, loss
          of animal tissue and data, etc., etc., which invalidates
          entire experiments and causes what they claim to be 4 million
          observations and calculations per study (average) to become
          irrelevant.<br>
          <br>
          * Only the key aspartame studies were looked at. It is almost
          a certainty that the non-key aspartame studies were equally
          flawed. Therefore, this would invalidate the "hundreds of
          millions" of observations and calculations made during these
          studies.<br>
          <br>
          * The difference between a study showing no statistical
          difference and a significant statistical difference is often
          only a few observations or calculations. Therefore, had the
          myriad of other serious experimental errors not occurred (as
          detailed above), the observation and calculation mistakes in
          each experiment investigated would, by themselves, invalidate
          most of the key studies.<br>
          <br>
          * It is highly unlikely that the FDA Investigative teams found
          all of the problems with G.D. Searle's studies. G.D. Searle
          seemed so intent on covering up their misconduct, that it is
          quite likely that they were able to hide many of the problems
          from the FDA."<br>
          <br>
          Also, Former VP, Joe Biden's son, Beau Biden also died of a
          brain tumor, and again we don't know his diet. <br>
          <br>
          Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive malignant primary
          brain tumor. With an incidence rate of 3.19 per 100,000
          persons in the United States and a median age of 64
          years.&nbsp; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ books/NBK470003/
          While this report says glioblastomas are uncommon in children,
          St. Jude's Hospital is full of babies and children with brain
          tumors born from mother's who used aspartame during
          pregnancy.&nbsp; Having worked with the CDC on some research
          on leukemia many years ago I was told only about 10% of
          anything is reported.<br>
          <br>
          Aspartame has been proven to cause blood cancers
          including&nbsp; leukemia by the Ramazzini Studies in Italy by
          Dr. Morando Soffritti as well as a Harvard study.&nbsp; In
          original studies by G. D. Searle on aspartame they were caught
          excising brain tumors from the rats and adding them back to
          the study.&nbsp; When some died they were resurrecting them
          back on paper.&nbsp; It was one of the reasons the FDA tried
          to have G. D. Searle indicted for fraud.&nbsp; You can hear
          about it in the movie, "Sweet Misery: A Poisoned World"&nbsp;
          https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=ZI7_8FDzuJE<br>
          <br>
          I have always wondered if politicians are provided Diet
          Coke.&nbsp; When Dr. Ken Stoller and I testified before the
          Senate in New Mexico trying to have aspartame banned we were
          shocked with so many of the Senators sipping Diet Coke .&nbsp;
          In fact, Dr. Stoller said, "With so many of you sipping Diet
          Coke I wonder if we are going to get anywhere. However, please
          have mercy on the children."&nbsp; They didn't. <br>
          <br>
          Even in children's medication the FDA allows aspartame with
          full knowledge that the teratology studies on aspartame they
          sealed from the public showed for starters spina bifida,
          neural tube defects and cleft palate.&nbsp; At the request
          of&nbsp; FDA Jerome Bressler author&nbsp; of the famous
          Bressler Report, I finally was able to find the information
          and add it back to his review. http://www.mpwhi.com/complete_
          bressler_report.pdf&nbsp;&nbsp; From "While Science Sleeps: A
          Sweetener Kills" by Dr. Woodrow Monte is his chapter on
          aspartame and autism: https://rense.com/general96/
          asparautism.html&nbsp;&nbsp; MIT says by 2025, one out of two
          babies born will be autistic.&nbsp; As Jerome Bressler told
          me, "It's indefensible that the FDA sealed the studies from
          the public and allowed this&nbsp; poison to be sold without a
          pregnancy warning.&nbsp; I've had to live with this for
          years." <br>
          <br>
          In searching for the diet of these well known consumers I came
          across an excellent article on what causes these brain tumors
          and am pasting it in as a warning to those using
          aspartame.&nbsp; It is titled -" The 3 Things Senator John
          McCain (and Anyone Else ) Diagnosed with Brain Tumors Needs to
          Know"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7/25/2017<br>
          <br>
          https://korenwellness.com/ blog/the-3-things-senator-
          john-mccain-and-anyone-else- diagnosed-with -<br>
          <br>
          This is a life saving report to prevent death from brain
          tumors.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe some of the public can give us more
          information on the diet of these famous people. Let it be a
          warning for others.&nbsp; They are adding aspartame to so many
          of the generic drugs (and brand name) that a lot of people
          have no idea they are using it.&nbsp; It was even given to me
          and I stopped breathing three times.&nbsp; Remember that&nbsp;
          aspartame violently interacts with pain medication.&nbsp; This
          may be the reason so many are dying of opioids.&nbsp; If they
          are also using aspartame they may not wake up. <br>
          <br>
          Here is the Hospital Form with the chapter on aspartame and
          drug interaction from the medical text, "Aspartame Disease: An
          Ignored Epidemic" by H. J. Roberts, M.D.,&nbsp; to prevent the
          hospital from giving this chemical poison to you.&nbsp;
          http://www.mpwhi.com/ aspartame_hospital_form.htm Also, here
          is the chapter on cancer and brain tumors.&nbsp;
          http://www.mpwhi.com/tumors_ and_cancer.pdf&nbsp;&nbsp; It was
          written in 2001 and, of course, there have now been more
          independent scientific peer reviewed studies on aspartame's
          link to cancer including the Ramazzini and Harvard's
          studies.&nbsp; FDA scientist Dr. Adrian Gross told the Senate
          on 8/1/85 aspartame was on the market illegally because it
          violated the Delaney Amendment causing without a shadow of a
          doubt brain tumors and brain cancer.&nbsp; He said, therefore,
          the FDA should not have been able to set an allowable daily
          intake.&nbsp; His famous last words were "And if the FDA
          violates its own laws who is left to protect the public?"<br>

          <br>
          The invention discloses a bean sprout production method based
          on an audio-frequency control technology...<br>
          <br>
          <b>Summary of the Invention</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          The purpose of the present invention is to overcome the
          deficiencies of the prior art and provide a method for
          producing bean sprouts based on audio frequency regulation
          technology.<br>
          <br>
          The method for producing bean sprouts based on the audio
          frequency modulation technology is: 5 growth stages of bean
          sprouts with foaming species, small buds, two buds, middle
          buds and long vegetables;<br>
          <br>
          In the foaming stage, the water is changed every 3 hours or
          so, and the water temperature is Controlled at 23 ~ 24 °C,
          while applying the frequency of 3000 ~ 3500hz, the volume of
          the sound waves in the 80 ~ 100db continuous stimulation, the
          stimulation time is 9 ~ 12 hours; <br>
          <br>
          In the small bud stage, once every 2 hours watering, water
          temperature Control at 27 ~ 28 °C, while applying the
          frequency of 1500 ~ 2000hz, the sound volume of 80 ~ 100db of
          the sound waves for continuous stimulation, stimulation time
          of 21 to 24 hours; <br>
          <br>
          In the second bud stage, once every 2 hours watering, water
          temperature Control at 27 ~ 28 °C, while applying the
          frequency of 1500 ~ 2000hz, the volume of 80db-100db sound
          waves for continuous stimulation, stimulation time of 9 to 12
          hours; <br>
          <br>
          In bud stage, every 2 hours watering once, water temperature
          Control at 29 ~ 30 °C, while applying the frequency of 2000 ~
          2500hz, the volume of sound waves of 80 ~ 100db for continuous
          stimulation, stimulation time is 21 to 24 hours; <br>
          <br>
          In the long vegetable stage, watering once every 2 hours,
          water temperature Control at 30 to 31 °C, simultaneous
          application Frequency of 2000 ~ 2500hz, the volume of 80 ~
          100db continuous acoustic stimulus, the time is 9 to 12 hours.<br>
          <br>
          The bean sprouts are mung bean sprouts, bean sprouts, black
          bean sprouts or peanut bean sprouts.<br>
          <br>
          Example 1 ... the production of bean sprouts based on the
          present invention can be found to increase by more than 10%.<br>
          <br>
          Example 2 ... the yield of the bean sprouts produced based on
          the present invention can be found to increase by more than
          18%.<br>
          <br>
          Example 3 ... the production of bean sprouts based on the
          present invention increased by more than 15%.<br>
